have more than any other countrypossibly more than all the rest of the universe together every county has a little library of its ownguides to its towns churches abbeys castles rivers mountains finally to the county as a whole they are of all prices and all sizes from the diminutive papercovered booklet worth a penny to the stout clothbound octavo volume which costs eight or ten or twelve shillings or to the gigantic folio county history the huge repository from which the guidebook maker gets his materials for these great works are also guidebooks containing everything we want to learn only made on so huge a scale as to be suited to the coat pockets of brobdingnagians rather than of little ordinary men the wonder of it all comes in when we find that these books however old and comparatively worthless they may be are practically never wholly out of date when a new work is brought out dozens appear annually and say five thousand copies sold it does not throw as many or indeed any copies of the old book out of circulation it supersedes nothing if any man can indulge in the luxury of a new uptodate guide to any place and gets rid of his old one a rare thing to do this will be snapped up by poorer men who will treasure it and hand it down or on to others editions of 18605040 and older are still prized not merely as keepsakes but for study or reference any one can prove this by going the round of a dozen secondhand booksellers in his own district in london there will be tons of literary rubbish and good stuff old and new but few guidebooksin some cases not one if you ask your man at a venture for say a guide to hampshire he will most probably tell you that he has not one in stock then in his anxiety to do business he will perhaps fish out a guide to derbyshire dated 1854a shabby old bookand offer it for four or five shillings the price of a crabbe in eight volumes or of gibbons decline and fall in six volumes bound in calf talk to this man and to the other eleven and they will tell you that there is always a sale for guidebooksthat the supply does not keep pace with the demand it may be taken as a fact that most of the books of this kind published during the last halfcenturymany millions of copies in the aggregateare still in existence and are valued possessions  there is nothing to quarrel with in all this as a people we run about a great deal and having curious minds we naturally wish to know all there is to be known or all that is interesting to know about the places we visit then again our time as a rule being limited we want the whole matterhistory antiquities places of interest in the neighbourhood etc in a nutshell the brief book serves its purpose well enough but it is not thrown away like the newspaper and the magazines however cheap and badly got up it may be it is taken home to serve another purpose to be a help to memory and nobody can have it until its owner removes himself but not his possessions from this planet or until the broker seizes his belongings and guidebooks together with other books are disposed of in packages by the auctioneer  in all this we see that guidebooks are very important to us and that there is little or no fault to be found with them since even the worst give some guidance and enable us in after times mentally to revisit distant places it may then be said that there are really no bad guidebooks and that those that are good in the highest sense are beyond praise a reverential sentiment which is almost religious in character connects itself in our minds with the very name of murray it is however possible to make an injudicious use of these books and by so doing to miss the fine point of many a pleasure the very fact that these books are guides to us and invaluable and that we readily acquire the habit of taking them about with us and consulting them at frequent intervals comes between us and that rarest and most exquisite enjoyment to be experienced amidst novel scenes he that visits a place new to him for some special object rightly informs himself of all that the book can tell him the knowledge may be useful pleasure is with him a secondary object but if pleasure be the main object it will only be experienced in the highest degree by him who goes without book and discovers what old fuller called the observables for himself there will be no mental pictures previously formed consequently what is found will not disappoint when the mind has been permitted to dwell beforehand on any scene then however beautiful or grand it may be the element of surprise is wanting and admiration is weak the delight has been discounted  my own plan which may be recommended only to those who go out for pleasurewho value happiness above useless otherwise useful knowledge and the pictures that live and glow in memory above albums and collections of photographsis not to look at a guidebook until the place it treats of has been explored and left behind  the practical person to whom this may come as a new idea and who wishes not to waste any time in experiments would doubtless like to hear how the plan works he will say that he certainly wants all the happiness to be got out of his rambles but it is clear that without the book in his pocket he would miss many interesting things would the greater degree of pleasure experienced in the others be a sufficient compensation i should say that he would gain more than he would lose that vivid interest and pleasure in a few things is preferable to that fainter more diffused feeling experienced in the other case again we have to take into account the value to us of the mental pictures gathered in our wanderings for we know that only when a scene is viewed emotionally when it produces in us a shock of pleasure does it become a permanent possession of the mind in other words it registers an image which when called up before the inner eye is capable of reproducing a measure of the original delight  in recalling those scenes which have given me the greatest happiness the images of which are most vivid and lasting i find that most of them are of scenes or objects which were discovered as it were by chance which i had not heard of or else had heard of and forgotten or which i had not expected to see they came as a surprise and in the following instance one may see that it makes a vast difference whether we do or do not experience such a sensation  in the course of a ramble on foot in a remote district i came to a small ancient town set in a cuplike depression amidst high woodgrown hills the woods were of oak in spring foliage and against that vivid green i saw the manygabled tiled roofs and tall chimneys of the old timbered houses glowing red and warm brown in the brilliant sunshinea scene of rare beauty and yet it produced no shock of pleasure never in fact had i looked on a lovely scene for the first time so unemotionally it seemed to be no new scene but an old familiar one and that it had certain degrading associations which took away all delight  the reason of this was that a great railway company had long been booming this romantic spot and large photographs plain and coloured of the town and its quaint buildings had for years been staring at me in every station and every railway carriage which i had entered on that line photography degrades most things especially openair things and in this case not only had its poor presentments made the scene too familiar but something of the degradation in the advertising pictures seemed to attach itself to the very scene yet even here after some pleasureless days spent in vain endeavours to shake off these vulgar associations i was to experience one of the sweetest surprises and delights of my life  the church of this villagelike town is one of its chief attractions it is a very old and stately building and its perpendicular tower nearly a hundred feet high is one of the noblest in england it has a magnificent peal of bells and on a sunday afternoon they were ringing filling and flooding that hollow in the hills seeming to make the houses and trees and the very earth to tremble with the glorious storm of sound walking past the church i followed the streamlet that runs through the town and out by a cleft between the hills to a narrow marshy valley on the other side of which are precipitous hills clothed from base to summit in oak woods as i walked through the cleft the musical roar of the bells followed and was like a mighty current flowing through and over me but as i came out the sound from behind ceased suddenly and was now in front coming back from the hills before me a sound but not the samenot a mere echo and yet an echo it was the most wonderful i had ever heard for now that great tempest of musical noise composed of a multitude of clanging notes with long vibrations overlapping and mingling and clashing together seemed at the same time one and manythat tempest from the tower which had mysteriously ceased to be audible came back in strokes or notes distinct and separate and multiplied many times the sound the echo was distributed over the whole face of the steep hill before me and was changed in character and it was as if every one of those thousands of oak trees had a peal of bells in it and that they were raining that farup bright spiritual tree music down into the valley below as i stood listening it seemed to me that i had never heard anything so beautiful nor had any mannot the monk of eynsham in that vision when he heard the easter bells on the holy saturday evening and described the sound as a ringing of a marvellous sweetness as if all the bells in the world or whatsoever is of sounding had been rung together at once  here then i had found and had become the possessor of something priceless since in that moment of surprise and delight the mysterious beautiful sound with the whole scene had registered an impression which would outlast all others received at that place where i had viewed all things with but languid interest had it not come as a complete surprise the emotion experienced and the resultant mental image would not have been so vivid as it is i can mentally stand in that valley when i will seeing that greenwooded hill in front of me and listen to that unearthly music  naturally after quitting the spot i looked at the first opportunity into a guidebook of the district only to find that it contained not one word about those wonderful illusive sounds the bookmakers had not done their work well since it is a pleasure after having discovered something delightful for ourselves to know how others have been affected by it and how they describe it  of many other incidents of the kind i will in this chapter relate one more which has a historical or legendary interest i was staying with the companion of my walks at a village in southern england in a district new to us we arrived on a saturday and next morning after breakfast went out for a long walk turning into the first path across the fields on leaving the village we came eventually to an oak wood which was like an open forest very wild and solitary in half an hours walk among the old oaks and underwood we saw no sign of human occupancy and heard nothing but the woodland birds we heard and then saw the cuckoo for the first time that season though it was but april the fourth but the cuckoo was early that spring and had been heard by some from the middle of march at length about halfpast ten oclock we caught sight of a number of people walking in a kind of straggling procession by a path which crossed ours at right angles headed by a stout old man in a black smock frock and brown leggings who carried a big book in one hand one of the processionists we spoke to told us they came from a hamlet a mile away on the borders of the wood and were on their way to church we elected to follow them thinking that the church was at some neighbouring village to our surprise we found it was in the wood with no other building in sighta small ancientlooking church built on a raised mound surrounded by a wide shallow grassgrown trench on the border of a marshy stream the people went in and took their seats while we remained standing just by the door then the priest came from the vestry and seizing the rope vigorously pulled at it for five minutes after which he showed us where to sit and the service began it was very pleasant there with the door open to the sunlit forest and the little green churchyard without with a willow wren the first i had heard singing his delicate little strain at intervals  the service over we rambled an hour longer in the wood then returned to our village which had a church of its own and our landlady hearing where we had been told us the story or tradition of the little church in the wood its origin goes very far back to early norman times when all the land in this part was owned by one of williams followers on whom it had been bestowed he built himself a house or castle on the edge of the forest where he lived with his wife and two little daughters who were his chief delight it happened that one day when he was absent the two little girls with their female attendant went into the wood in search of flowers and that meeting a wild boar they turned and fled screaming for help the savage beast pursued and quickly overtaking them attacked the hindermost the youngest of the two little girls anal killed her the others escaping in the meantime on the following day the father returned and was mad with grief and rage on hearing of the tragedy and in his madness resolved to go alone on foot to the forest and search for the beast and taste no food or drink until he had slain it accordingly to the forest he went and roamed through it by day and night and towards the end of the following day he actually found and roused the dreadful animal and although weakened by his long fast and fatigue his fury gave him force to fight and conquer it or else the powers above came to his aid for when he stood spear in hand to wait the charge of the furious beast he vowed that if he overcame it on that spot he would build a chapel where god would be worshipped for ever and there it was raised and has stood to this day its doors open every sunday to worshippers with but one break some time in the sixteenth century to the third year of elizabeth since when there has been no suspension of the weekly service  that the tradition is not true no one can say we know that the memory of an action or tragedy of a character to stir the feelings and impress the imagination may live unrecorded in any locality for long centuries and more we know or suppose from at least one quite familiar instance from flintshire that a tradition may even take us back to prehistoric times and find corroboration in our own day  but of this story what corroboration is there and what do the books say i have consulted the county history and no mention is made of such a tradition and can only assume that the author had never heard itthat he had not the curious aubrey mind he only says that it is a very early churchhow early he does not knowand adds that it was built for the convenience of the inhabitants of the place an odd statement seeing that the place has every appearance of having always been what it is a forest and that the inhabitants thereof are weasels foxes jays and suchlike and doubtless in former days included wolves boars roedeer and stags beings which as walt whitman truly remarks do not worry themselves about their souls  with this question however we need not concern ourselves to me after stumbling by chance on the little church in that solitary woodland place the story of its origin was accepted as true no doubt it had come down unaltered from generation to generation through all those centuries and it moved my pity yet was a delight to hear as great perhaps as it had been to listen to the beautiful chimes many times multiplied from the wooded hill and if i have a purpose in this book which is without a purpose a message to deliver and a lesson to teach it is only thisthe charm of the unknown and the infinitely greater pleasure in discovering the interesting things for ourselves than in informing ourselves of them by reading it is like the difference in flavour in wild fruits and all wild meats found and gathered by our own hands in wild places and that of the same prepared and put on the table for us the evervarying aspects of nature of earth and sea and cloud are a perpetual joy to the artist who waits and watches for their appearance who knows that sun and atmosphere have for him revelations without end they come and go and mock his best efforts he knows that his striving is in vainthat his weak hands and earthy pigments cannot reproduce these effects or express his feelingthat as leighton said every picture is a subject thrown away but he has his joy none the less it is in the pursuit and in the dream of capturing something illusive mysterious and inexpressibly beautiful     chapter two on going back   in looking over the preceding chapter it occurred to me that i had omitted something or rather that it would have been well to drop a word of warning to those who have the desire to revisit a place where they have experienced a delightful surprise alas they cannot have that sensation a second time and on this account alone the mental image must always be better than its reality let the imagethe first sharp impressioncontent us many a beautiful picture is spoilt by the artist who cannot be satisfied that he has made the best of his subject and retouching his canvas to bring out some subtle charm which made the work a success loses it altogether so in going back the result of the inevitable disillusionment is that the early mental picture loses something of its original freshness the very fact that the delightful place or scene was discovered by us made it the shining place it is in memory and again the charm we found in it may have been in a measure due to the mood we were in or to the peculiar aspect in which it came before us at the first due to the season to atmospheric and sunlight effects to some human interest or to a conjunction of several favourable circumstances we know we can never see it again in that aspect and with that precise feeling  on this account i am shy of revisiting the places where i have experienced the keenest delight for example i have no desire to revisit that small ancient town among the hills described in the last chapter to go on a sunday evening through that narrow gorge filled with the musical roar of the church bells to leave that great sound behind and stand again listening to the marvellous echo from the wooded hill on the other side of the valley nor would i care to go again in search of that small ancient lost church in the forest it would not be early april with the clear sunbeams shining through the old leafless oaks on the floor of fallen yellow leaves with the cuckoo fluting before his time nor would that straggling procession of villagers appear headed by an old man in a smock frock with a big book in his hand nor would i hear for the first time the strange history of the church which so enchanted me  i will here give an account of yet another of the many wellremembered delightful spots which i would not revisit nor even look upon again if i could avoid doing so by going several miles out of my way  it was green open country in the west of englandvery far west although on the east side of the tamarin a beautiful spot remote from railroads and large towns and the road by which i was travelling on this occasion on a bicycle ran or serpentined along the foot of a range of low round hills on my right hand while on my left i had a green valley with other low round green hills beyond it the valley had a marshy stream with sedgy margins and occasional clumps of alder and willow trees it was the end of a hot midsummer day the sun went down a vast globe of crimson fire in a crystal clear sky and as i was going east i was obliged to dismount and stand still to watch its setting when the great red disc had gone down behind the green world i resumed my way but went slowly then slower still the better to enjoy the delicious coolness which came from the moist valley and the beauty of the evening in that solitary place which i had never looked on before nor was there any need to hurry i had but three or four miles to go to the small old town where i intended passing the night by and by the winding road led me down close to the stream at a point where it broadened to a large still pool this was the ford and on the other side was a small rustic village consisting of a church two or three farmhouses with their barns and outbuildings and a few ancientlooking stone cottages with thatched roofs but the church was the main thing it was a noble building with a very fine tower and from its size and beauty i concluded that it was an ancient church dating back to the time when there was a passion in the west country and in many parts of england of building these great fanes even in the remotest and most thinly populated parishes in this i was mistaken through having seen it at a distance from the other side of the ford after the sun had set  never i thought had i seen a lovelier village with its old picturesque cottages shaded by ancient oaks and elms and the great church with its stately tower looking dark against the luminous western sky dismounting again i stood for some time admiring the scene wishing that i could make that village my home for the rest of my life conscious at the same time that is was the mood the season the magical hour which made it seem so enchanting presently a young man the first human figure that presented itself to my sight appeared mounted on a big carthorse and leading a second horse by a halter and rode down into the pool to bathe the animals legs and give them a drink he was a sturdylooking young fellow with a sunbrowned face in earthcoloured working clothes with a small cap stuck on the back of his round curly head he probably imagined himself not a badlooking young man for while his horses were drinking he laid over on the broad bare backs and bending down studied his own reflection in the bright water then an old woman came out of a cottage close by and began talking to him in her west country dialect in a thin highpitched cracked voice their talking was the only sound in the village so silent was it that all the rest of its inhabitants might have been in bed and fast asleep then the conversation ended the young man rode out with a great splashing and the old woman turned into her cottage again and i was left in solitude  still i lingered i could not go just yet the chances were that i should never again see that sweet village in that beautiful aspect at the twilight hour  for now it came into my mind that i could not very well settle there for the rest of my life i could not in fact tie myself to any place without sacrificing certain other advantages i possessed and the main thing was that by taking root i should deprive myself of the chance of looking on still other beautiful scenes and experiencing other sweet surprises i was wishing that i had come a little earlier on the scene to have had time to borrow the key of the church and get a sight of the interior when all at once i heard a shrill voice and a boy appeared running across the wide green space of the churchyard a second boy followed then another then still others and i saw that they were going into the church by the side door they were choirboys going to practice the church was open then and late as it was i could have half an hour inside before it was dark the stream was spanned by an old stone bridge above the ford and going over it i at once made my way to the great building but even before entering it i discovered that it possessed an organ of extraordinary power and that someone was performing on it with a vengeance inside the noise was tremendousa bigger noise from an organ it seemed to me than i had ever heard before even at the albert hall and the crystal palace but even more astonishing than the uproar was the sight that met my eyes the boys nine or ten sturdy little rustics with round sunburnt west country faces were playing the roughest game ever witnessed in a church some were engaged in a sort of flying fight madly pursuing one another up and down the aisles and over the pews and whenever one overtook another he would seize hold of him and they would struggle together until one was thrown and received a vigorous pommelling those who were not fighting were dancing to the music it was great fun to them and they were shouting and laughing their loudest only not a sound of it all could be heard on account of the thunderous roar of the organ which filled and seemed to make the whole building tremble the boys took no notice of me and seeing that there was a singularly fine west window i went to it and stood there some time with my back to the game which was going on at the other end of the building admiring the beautiful colours and trying to make out the subjects depicted in the centre part lit by the afterglow in the sky to a wonderful brilliance was the figure of a saint a lovely young woman in a blue robe with an abundance of loose goldenred hair and an aureole about her head her pale face wore a sweet and placid expression and her eyes of a pure forgetmenot blue were looking straight into mine as i stood there the music or noise ceased and a very profound silence followednot a giggle not a whisper from the outrageous young barbarians and not a sound of the organist or of anyone speaking to them presently i became conscious of some person standing almost but not quite abreast of me and turning sharply i found a clergyman at my side he was the vicar the person who had been letting himself go on the organ a slight man with a handsome pale ascetic face cleanshaven very darkeyed looking more like an italian monk or priest than an english clergyman but although rigidly ecclesiastic in his appearance and dress there was something curiously engaging in him along with a subtle look which it was not easy to fathom there was a light in his dark eyes which reminded me of a flame seen through a smoked glass or a thin black veil and a slight restless movement about the corners of his mouth as if a smile was just on the point of breaking out but it never quite came he kept his gravity even when he said things which would have gone very well with a smile  i see he spoke and his penetrating musical voice had too like his eyes and mouth an expression of mystery in it that you are admiring our beautiful west window especially the figure in the centre it is quite neweverything is new herethe church itself was only built a few years ago this window is its chief glory it was done by a good artisthe has done some of the most admired windows of recent years and the centre figure is supposed to be a portrait of our generous patroness at all events she sat for it to him you have probably heard of lady y  what i exclaimed lady y that funny old woman  nomiddleaged he corrected a little frigidly and perhaps a little mockingly at the same time  very well middleaged if you like i dont know her personally one hears about her but i did not know she had a place in these parts  she owns most of this parish and has done so much for us that we can very well look leniently on a little weaknessher wish that the future inhabitants of the place shall not remember her as a middleaged woman not remarkable for good looksfunny as you just now said  he was wonderfully candid i thought but what extraordinary benefits had she bestowed on them i asked to enable them to regard or to say that this picture of a very beautiful young female was her likeness  why he said the church would not have been built but for her we were astonished at the sum she offered to contribute towards the work and at once set about pulling the small old church down so as to rebuild on the exact site  do you know i returned i cant help saying something you will not like to hear it is a very fine church no doubt but it always angers me to hear of a case like this where some ancient church is pulled down and a grand new one raised in its place to the honour and glory of some rich parvenu with or without a brand new title  you are not hurting me in the least he replied with that change which came from time to time in his eyes as if the flame behind the screen had suddenly grown brighter i agree with every word you say the meanest church in the land should be cherished as long as it will hold together but unfortunately ours had to come down it was very old and decayed past mending the floor was six feet below the level of the surrounding ground and frightfully damp it had been examined over and over again by experts during the past forty or fifty years and from the first they pronounced it a hopeless case so that it was never restored the interior right down to the time of demolition was like that of most country churches of a century ago with the old black wormeaten pews in which the worshippers shut themselves up as if in their own houses or castles on account of the damp we were haunted by toads you smile sir but it was no smiling matter for me during my first year as vicar when i discovered that it was the custom here to keep pet toads in the church it sounds strange and funny no doubt but it is a fact that all the best people in the parish had one of these creatures and it was customary for the ladies to bring it a weekly supply of provisionsbits of meat hardboiled eggs chopped up and earthworms and whatever else they fancied it would likein their reticules the toads i suppose knew when it was sundaytheir feeding day at all events they would crawl out of their holes in the floor under the pews to receive their rationsand caresses the toads got on my nerves with rather unpleasant consequences i preached in a way which my listeners did not appreciate or properly understand particularly when i took for my subject our duty towards the lower animals including reptiles  batrachians i interposed echoing as well as i could the tone in which he had rebuked me before  very well batrachiansi am not a naturalist but the impression created on their minds appeared to be that i was rather an odd person in the pulpit when the time came to pull the old church down the toadkeepers were bidden to remove their pets which they did with considerable reluctance what became of them i do not knowi never inquired i used to have a careful inspection made of the floor to make sure that these creatures were not put back in the new building and i am happy to think it is not suited to their habits the floors are very well cemented and are dry and clean  having finished his story he invited me to go to the parsonage and get some refreshment i daresay you are thirsty he said  but it was getting late it was almost dark in the church by now although the figure of the goldenhaired saint still glowed in the window and gazed at us out of her blue eyes i must not waste more of your time i added there are your boys still patiently waiting to begin their practicesuch nice quiet fellows  yes they are he returned a little bitterly a sudden accent of weariness in his voice and no trace now of what i had seen in his countenance a little while agothe light that shone and brightened behind the dark eye and the little play about the corners of the mouth as of dimpling motions on the surface of a pool  and in that new guise or disguise i left him the austere priest with nothing to suggest the whimsical or grotesque in his cold ascetic face recrossing the bridge i stood a little time and looked once more at the noble church tower standing dark against the clear ambercoloured sky and said to myself why this is one of the oddest incidents of my life not that i have seen or heard anything very wonderfuljust a small rustic village one of a thousand in the land a big new church in which some person was playing rather madly on the organ a set of unruly choirboys a handsome stainedglass west window and finally a nice little chat with the vicar it was not in these things it was a sense of something strange in the mind of something in some way unlike all other places and people and experiences the sensation was like that of the reader who becomes absorbed in henry newbolts romance of the old country who identifies himself with the hero and unconsciously or without quite knowing how slips back out of this modern world into that of half a thousand years ago it is the same familiar green land in which he finds himselfthe same old country and the same sort of people with feelings and habits of life and thought unchangeable as the colour of grass and flowers the songs of birds and the smell of the earth yet with a difference i recognized it chiefly in the parish priest i had been conversing with for one thing his mediaeval mind evidently did not regard a sense of humour and of the grotesque as out of place in or on a sacred building if it had been lighter i should have looked at the roof for an effigy of a semihuman toadlike creature smiling down mockingly at the worshippers as they came and went  on departing it struck me that it would assuredly be a mistake to return to this village and look at it again by the common lights of day no it was better to keep the impressions i had gathered unspoilt even to believe if i could that no such place existed but that it had existed exactly as i had found it even to the unruly choirboys the asceticlooking priest with a strange light in his eyes and the worshippers who kept pet toads in the church they were not precisely like people of the twentieth century as for the eccentric middleaged or elderly person whose portrait adorned the west window she was not the lady i knew something about but another older lady y who flourished some six or seven centuries ago     chapter three walking and cycling   we know that there cannot be progression without retrogression or gain with no corresponding loss and often on my wheel when flying along the roads at a reckless rate of very nearly nine miles an hour i have regretted that time of limitations galling to me then when i was compelled to go on foot i am a walker still but with other means of getting about i do not feel so native to the earth as formerly that is a loss yet a poorer walker it would have been hard to find and on even my most prolonged wanderings the end of each day usually brought extreme fatigue this too although my only companion was slowslower than the poor proverbial snail or tortoiseand i would leave her half a mile or so behind to force my way through unkept hedges climb hills and explore woods and thickets to converse with every bird and shy little beast and scaly creature i could discover but mark what follows in the late afternoon i would be back in the road or footpath satisfied to go slow then slower still untilthe snail in woman shape would be obliged to slacken her pace to keep me company and even to stand still at intervals to give me needful rest  but there were compensations and one perhaps the best of all was that this method of seeing the country made us more intimate with the people we met and stayed with they were mostly poor people cottagers in small remote villages and we too were poor often footsore in need of their ministrations and nearer to them on that account than if we had travelled in a more comfortable way i can recall a hundred little adventures we met with during those wanderings when we walked day after day without map or guidebook as our custom was not knowing where the evening would find us but always confident that the people to whom it would fall in the end to shelter us would prove interesting to know and would show us a kindness that money could not pay for of these hundred little incidents let me relate one  it was near the end of a long summer day when we arrived at a small hamlet of about a dozen cottages on the edge of an extensive wooda forest it is called and coming to it we said that here we must stay even if we had to spend the night sitting in a porch the men and women we talked to all assured us that they did not know of anyone who could take us in but there was mr brownjohn who kept the shop and was the right person to apply to accordingly we went to the little general shop and heard that mr brownjohn was not at home his housekeeper a fat dark voluble woman with prominent black eyes who minded the shop in the masters absence told us that mr brownjohn had gone to a neighbouring farmhouse on important business but was expected back shortly we waited and by and by he returned a shabbily dressed weaklooking little old man with pale blue eyes and thin yellowish white hair he could not put us up he said he had no room in his cottage there was nothing for us but to go on to the next place a village three miles distant on the chance of finding a bed there we assured him that we could go no further and after revolving the matter a while longer he again said that we could not stay as there was not a room to be had in the place since poor mrs flowerdew had her trouble she had a spare room and used to take in a lodger occasionally and a good handy woman she was too but nowno mrs flowerdew could not take us in we questioned him and he said that no one had died there and there had been no illness they were all quite well at mrs flowerdews the trouble was of another kind there was no more to be said about it  as nothing further could be got out of him we went in search of mrs flowerdew herself and found her in a pretty vineclad cottage she was a young woman very poorly dressed with a pleasing but careworn face and she had four small bright healthy happyfaced children they were all grouped round her as she stood in the doorway to speak to us and they too were poorly dressed and poorly shod when we told our tale she appeared ready to burst into tears oh how unfortunate it was that she could not take us in it would have made her so happy and the few shillings would have been such a blessing but what could she do nowthe landlords agent had put in a distress and carried off and sold all her best things every stick out of her nice spare room had been taken from them oh it was cruel  as we wished to hear more she told us the whole story they had got behindhand with the rent but that had often been the case only this time it happened that the agent wanted a cottage for a person he wished to befriend and so gave them notice to quit but her husband was a highspirited man and determined to stick to his rights so he informed the agent that he refused to move until he received compensation for his improvements  questioned about these improvements she led us through to the back to show us the ground about half an acre in extent part of which was used as a paddock for the donkey and on the other part there were about a dozen rather sicklylooking young fruit trees her husband she said had planted the orchard and kept the fence of the paddock in order and they refused to compensate him then she took us up to the spare room empty of furniture the floor thick with dust the bed table chairs washhandstand toilet servicethe things she had been so long struggling to get together saving her money for months and months and making so many journeys to the town to buyall all he had taken away and sold for almost nothing  then actually with tears in her eyes she said that now we knew why she couldnt take us inwhy she had to seem so unkind  but we are going to stay we told her it was a very good room she could surely get a few things to put in it and in the meantime we would go and forage for provisions to last us till monday  it is odd to find how easy it is to get what one wants by simply taking it at first she was amazed at our decision then she was delighted and said she would go out to her neighbours and try to borrow all that was wanted in the way of furniture and bedding then we returned to mr brownjohns to buy bread bacon and groceries and he in turn sent us to mr marling for vegetables mr marling heard us and soberly taking up a spade and other implements led us out to his garden and dug us a mess of potatoes while we waited in the meantime good mrs flowerdew had not been idle and we formed the idea that her neighbours must have been her debtors for unnumbered little kindnesses so eager did they now appear to do her a good turn out of one cottage a woman was seen coming burdened with a big roll of bedding from others children issued bearing cane chairs basin and ewer and so on and when we next looked into our room we found it swept and scrubbed mats on the floor and quite comfortably furnished  after our meal in the small parlour which had been given up to us the family having migrated into the kitchen we sat for an hour by the open window looking out on the dim forest and saw the moon risea great golden globe above the treesand listened to the reeling of the nightjars so many were the birds reeling on all sides at various distances that the evening air seemed full of their sounds far and near like many low tremulous sustained notes blown on reeds rising and falling overlapping and mingling and presently from the bushes close by just beyond the weedy forlorn little orchard sounded the rich full throbbing prelude to the nightingales song and that powerful melody that in its purity and brilliance invariably strikes us with surprise seemed to shine out as it were against the background of that diffused mysterious purring of the nightjars even as the golden disc of the moon shone against and above the darkening skies and dusky woods  and as we sat there gazing and listening a human voice came out of the nighta call prolonged and modulated like the cooee of the australian bush far off and faint but the children in the kitchen heard it at the same time for they too had been listening and instantly went mad with excitement  father they all screamed together fathers coming and out they rushed and away they fled down the darkening road exerting their full voices in shrill answering cries  we were anxious to see this unfortunate man who was yet happy in a loving family he had gone early in the morning in his donkeycart to the little market town fourteen miles away to get the few necessaries they could afford to buy doubtless they would be very few we had not long to wait as the white donkey that drew the cart had put on a tremendous spurt at the end notwithstanding that the four youngsters had climbed in to add to his burden but what was our surprise to behold in the charioteer a tall gaunt greyfaced old man with long white hair and beard he must have been seventy that old man with a young wife and four happy brighteyed little children  we could understand it better when he finally settled down in his corner in the kitchen and began to relate the events of the day addressing his poor little wife now busy darning or patching an old garment while the children clustered at his knee listened as to a fairy tale certainly this whitehaired man had not grown old in mind he was keenly interested in all he saw and heard and he had seen and heard much in the little market town that day cattle and pigs and sheep and shepherds and sheepdogs farmers shopkeepers dealers publicans tramps and gentlefolks in carriages and on horseback shops too with beautiful new things in the windows millinery agricultural implements flowers and fruit and vegetables toys and books and sweeties of all colours and the people he had met on the road and at market and what they had said to him about the weather and their business and the prospects of the year how their wives and children were and the clever jokes they had made and his own jokes which were the cleverest of all if he had just returned from central africa or from thibet he could not have had more to tell them nor told it with greater zest  we went to our room but until the small hours the wind of the old travellers talk could still be heard at intervals from the kitchen mingled with occasional shrill explosions of laughter from the listening children  it happened that on the following day spent in idling in the forest and about the hamlet conversing with the cottagers we were told that our old man was a bit of a humbug that he was a great talker with a hundred schemes for the improvement of his fortunes and incidently for the benefit of his neighbours and the world at large but nothing came of it all and he was now fast sinking into the lowest depths of poverty yet who would blame him tis the nature of the gorse to be unprofitably gay all that however is a question for the moralist the point now is that in walking even in that poor way when on account of physical weakness it was often a pain and weariness there are alleviations which may be more to us than positive pleasures and scenes to delight the eye that are missed by the wheelman in his haste or but dimly seen or vaguely surmised in passinggreen refreshing nooks and crystal streamlets and shadowy woodland depths with glimpses of a blue sky beyondall in the wilderness of the human heart     chapter four seeking a shelter   the walks already spoken of at a time when life had little or no other pleasure for us on account of poverty and illhealth were taken at pretty regular intervals two or three times a year it all depended on our means in very lean years there was but one outing it was impossible to escape altogether from the immense unfriendly wilderness of london simply because albeit unfriendly it yet appeared to be the only place in the wide world where our poor little talents could earn us a few shillings a week to live on music and literature but i fancy the nearest crossingsweeper did better and could afford to give himself a more generous dinner every day it occasionally happened that an article sent to some magazine was not returned and always after so many rejections to have one accepted and paid for with a cheque worth several pounds was a cause of astonishment and was as truly a miracle as if the angel of the sun had compassionately thrown us down a handful of gold and out of these little handfuls enough was sometimes saved for the country rambles at easter and whitsuntide and in the autumn it was during one of these easter walks when seeking for a restingplace for the night that we met with another adventure worth telling  we had got to that best part of surrey not yet colonized by wealthy men from the city but where all things are as they were of old when late in the day we came to a pleasant straggling village with one street a mile long here we resolved to stay and walked the length of the street making inquiries but were told by every person we spoke to that the only place we could stay at was the innthe white hart when we said we preferred to stay at a cottage they smiled a pitying smile no there was no such place but we were determined not to go to the inn although it had a very inviting look and was well placed with no other house near it looking on the wide village green with ancient trees shading the road on either side  having passed it and got to the end of the village we turned and walked back still making vain inquiries passing it again and when once more at the startingpoint we were in despair when we spied a man coming along the middle of the road and went out to meet him to ask the weary question for the last time his appearance was rather odd as he came towards us on that blowy march evening with dust and straws flying past and the level sun shining full on him he was tall and slim with a large round smooth face and big paleblue innocentlooking eyes and he walked rapidly but in a peculiar jerky yet shambling manner swinging and tossing his legs and arms about moving along in this disjointed manner in his loose fluttering clothes he put one in mind of a big flimsy newspaper blown along the road by the wind this unpromisinglooking person at once told us that there was a place where we could stay he knew it well for it happened to be his fathers house and his own home it was away at the other end of the village his people had given accommodation to strangers before and would be glad to receive us and make us comfortable  surprised and a little doubtful of our good fortune i asked my young man if he could explain the fact that so many of his neighbours had assured us that no accommodation was to be had in the village except at the inn he did not make a direct reply he said that the ways of the villagers were not the ways of his people he and all his house cherished only kind feelings towards their neighbours whether those feelings were returned or not it was not for him to say and there was something else a small appointment which would keep a man from want for the term of his natural life without absorbing all his time had become vacant in the village several of the young men in the place were anxious to have it then he too came forward as a candidate and all the others jeered at him and tried to laugh him out of it he cared nothing for that and when the examination came off he proved the best man and got the place he had fought his fight and had overcome all his enemies if they did not like him any the better for his victory and did and said little things to injure him he did not mind much he could afford to forgive them  having finished his story he said goodbye and went his way blown as it were along the road by the wind  we were now very curious to see the other members of his family they would we imagined prove amusing if nothing better they proved a good deal better the house we sought for a house it was stood a little way back from the street in a large garden it had in former times been an inn or farmhouse possibly a manorhouse and was large with many small rooms and short narrow crooked staircases halflandings and narrow passages and a few large rooms their low ceilings resting on old oak beams black as ebony outside it was the most picturesque and doubtless the oldest house in the village manygabled with very tall ancient chimneys the roofs of red tiles mottled grey and yellow with age and lichen it was a surprise to find a woodmanfor that was what the man wasliving in such a big place the woodman himself his appearance and character gave us a second and greater surprise he was a wellshaped man of medium height although past middle life he looked young and had no white thread in his ravenblack hair and beard his teeth were white and even and his features as perfect as i have seen in any man his eyes were pure dark blue contrasting rather strangely with his pale olive skin and intense black hair only a woodman but he might have come of one of the oldest and best families in the country if there is any connection between good blood and fine features and a noble expression oddly enough his surname was an uncommon and aristocratic one his wife on the other hand although a very good woman as we found had a distinctly plebeian countenance one day she informed us that she came of a different and better class than her husbands she was the daughter of a small tradesman and had begun life as a ladysmaid her husband was nothing but a labourer his people had been labourers for generations consequently her marriage to him had involved a considerable descent in the social scale hearing this it was hard to repress a smile  the contrast between this man and the ordinary villager of his class was as great in manners and conversation as in features and expression his combined dignity and gentleness and apparent unconsciousness of any caste difference between man and man were astonishing in one who had been a simple toiler all his life  there were some grownup children others growing up with others that were still quite small the boys i noticed favoured their mother and had commonplace faces the girls took after their father and though their features were not so perfect they were exceptionally goodlooking the eldest sonthe disjointed flyawaylooking young man who had conquered all his enemieshad a wife and child the eldest daughter was also married and had one child altogether the three families numbered about sixteen persons each family having its separate set of rooms but all dining at one table how did they do it it seemed easy enough to them they were serious people in a sense although always cheerful and sometimes hilarious when together of an evening or at their meals but they regarded life as a serious matter a state of probation they were nonsmokers total abstainers diligent at their work united profoundly religious a fresh wonder came to light when i found that this poor woodman with so large a family to support who spent ten or twelve hours every day at his outdoor work had yet been able out of his small earnings to buy bricks and other materials and assisted by his sons to build a chapel adjoining his house here he held religious services on sundays and once or twice of an evening during the week these services consisted of extempore prayers a short address and hymns accompanied by a harmonium which they all appeared able to play  what his particular doctrine was i did not inquire nor did i wish for any information on that point doubtless he was a dissenter of some kind living in a village where there was no chapel the services were for the family but were also attended by a few of the villagers and some persons from neighbouring farms who preferred a simpler form of worship to that of the church  it was not strange that this little community should have been regarded with something like disfavour by the other villagers for these others man for man made just as much money and paid less rent for their small cottages and furthermore received doles from the vicar and his welltodo parishioners yet they could not better their position much less afford the good clothing books music and other pleasant things which the independent woodman bestowed on his family and they knew why the woodmans very presence in their midst was a continual reproach a sermon on improvidence and intemperance which they could not avoid hearing by thrusting their fingers into their ears  during my stay with these people something occurred to cause them a very deep disquiet the reader will probably smile when i tell them what it was awaking one night after midnight i heard the unusual sound of voices in earnest conversation in the room below this went on until i fell asleep again in the morning we noticed that our landlady had a somewhat haggard face and that the daughters also had pale faces with purple marks under the eyes as if they had kept their mother company in some sorrowful vigil we were not left long in ignorance of the cause of this cloud the good woman asked if we had been much disturbed by the talking i answered that i had heard voices and had supposed that friends from a distance had arrived overnight and that they had sat up talking to a late hour nothat was not it she said but someone had arrived late a son who was sixteen years old and who had been absent for some days on a visit to relations in another county when they gathered round him to hear his news he confessed that while away he had learnt to smoke and he now wished them to know that he had well considered the matter and was convinced that it was not wrong nor harmful to smoke and was determined not to give up his tobacco they had talked to himfather mother brothers and sistersusing every argument they could find or invent to move him until it was day and time for the woodman to go to his woods and the others to their several occupations but their allnight sitting had been wasted the stubborn youth had not been convinced nor shaken when after morning prayers they got up from their knees the sunlight shining in upon them they had made a last appeal with tears in their eyes and he had refused to give the promise they asked the poor woman was greatly distressed this young fellow i thought favours his mother in features but mentally he is perhaps more like his father being a smoker myself i ventured to put in a word for him they were distressing themselves too much i told her smoking in moderation was not only harmless especially to those who worked out of doors but it was a wellnigh universal habit and many leading men in the religious world both churchmen and dissenters were known to be smokers  her answer which came quickly enough was that they did not regard the practice of smoking as in itself bad but they knew that in some circumstances it was inexpedient and in the case of her son they were troubled at the thought of what smoking would ultimately lead to people she continued did not care to smoke any more than they did to eat and drink in solitude it was a social habit and it was inevitable that her boy should look for others to keep him company in smoking there would be no harm in that in the summertime when young people like to keep out of doors until bedtime but during the long winter evenings he would have to look for his companions in the parlour of the publichouse and it would not be easy scarcely possible to sit long among the others without drinking a little beer it is really no more wrong to drink a little beer than to smoke he would say and it would be true one pipe would lead to another and one glass of beer to another the habit would be formed and at last all his evenings and all his earnings would be spent in the publichouse  she was right and i had nothing more to say except to wish her success in her efforts  it is curious that the strongest protests against the evils of the village pubic which one hears from village women come from those who are not themselves sufferers perhaps it is not curious instinctively we hide our sores bodily and mental from the public gaze  not long ago i was in a small rustic village in wiltshire perhaps the most charming village i have seen in that country there was no inn or alehouse and feeling very thirsty after my long walk i went to a cottage and asked the woman i saw there for a drink of milk she invited me in and spreading a clean cloth on the table placed a jug of new milk a loaf and butter before me for these good things she proudly refused to accept payment as she was a handsome young woman with a clear pleasant voice i was glad to have her sit there and talk to me while i refreshed myself besides i was in search of information and got it from her during our talk my object in going to the village was to see a woman who i had been told was living there i now heard that her cottage was close by but unfortunately while anxious to see her i had no excuse for calling  do you think said i to my young hostess that it would do to tell her that i had heard something of her strange history and misfortunes and wished to offer her a little help is she very poor  oh no she replied please do not offer her money if you see her she would be offended there is no one in this village who would take a shilling as a gift from a stranger we all have enough there is not a poor person among us  what a happy village i exclaimed perhaps you are all total abstainers  she laughed and said that they all brewed their own beerthere was not a total abstainer among them every cottager made from fifty to eighty gallons or more and they drank beer every day but very moderately while it lasted they were all very sober their children would have to go to some neighbouring village to see a tipsy man  i remarked that at the next village which had three publichouses there were a good marry persons so poor that they would gladly at any time take a shilling from any one  it was the same everywhere in the district she said except in that village which had no publichouse not only were they better off and independent of blanket societies and charity in all forms but they were infinitely happier and after the days work the men came home to spend the evening with their wives and children  at this stage i was surprised by a sudden burst of passion on her part she stood up her face flushing red and solemnly declared that if ever a publichouse was opened in that village and if the men took to spending their evenings in it her husband with them she would not endure such a condition of thingsshe wondered that so many women endured itbut would take her little ones and go away to earn her own living under some other roof     chapter five wind wave and spirit   the rambles i have described were mostly inland when by chance they took us down to the sea our impressions and adventures appeared less interesting looking back on the holiday it would seem to us a somewhat vacant time compared to one spent in wandering from village to village i mean if we do not take into account that first impression which the sea invariably makes on us on returning to it after a long absencethe shock of recognition and wonder and joy as if we had been suffering from loss of memory and it had now suddenly come back to us that brief moving experience over there is little the sea can give us to compare with the land how could it be otherwise in our case seeing that we were by it in a crowd our movements and way of life regulated for us in places which appear like overgrown and illorganized convalescent homes there was always a secret intense dislike of all parasitic and holiday places an uncomfortable feeling which made the pleasure seem poor and the remembrance of days so spent hardly worth dwelling on and as we are able to keep in or throw out of our minds whatever we please being autocrats in our own little kingdom i elected to cast away most of the memories of these comparatively insipid holidays but not all and of those i retain i will describe at least two one in the present chapter on the east anglian coast the other later on  it was cold though the month was august it blew and the sky was grey and rain beginning to fall when we came down about noon to a small town on the norfolk coast where we hoped to find lodging and such comforts as could be purchased out of a slender purse it was a small modern pleasure town of an almost startling appearance owing to the material used in building its straight rows of cottages and its ugly square houses and villas this was an orangebrown stone found in the neighbourhood the roofs being all of hard black slate i had never seen houses of such a colour it was stronger more glaring and aggressive than the reddest brick and there was not a green thing to partially screen or soften it nor did the darkness of the wet weather have any mitigating effect on it the town was built on high ground with an open grassy space before it sloping down to the cliff in which steps had been cut to give access to the beach and beyond the cliff we caught sight of the grey desolate windvexed sea but the rain was coming down more and more heavily turning the streets into torrents so that we began to envy those who had found a shelter even in so ugly a place no one would take us in house after house street after street we tried and at every door with apartments to let over it where we knocked the same hateful landladyface appeared with the same triumphant gleam in the fisheyes and the same smile on the mouth that opened to tell us delightedly that she and the town were full up that never had there been known such a rush of visitors applicants were being turned away every hour from every door  after three miserable hours spent in this way we began inquiring at all the shops and eventually at one were told of a poor woman in a small house in a street a good way back from the front who would perhaps be able to taken us in to this place we went and knocked at a low door in a long blank wall in a narrow street it was opened to us by a pale thin sadlooking woman in a rusty black gown who asked us into a shabby parlour and agreed to take us in until we could find something better she had a gentle voice and was full of sympathy and seeing our plight took us into the kitchen behind the parlour which was living and workingroom as well to dry ourselves by the fire  the greatest pleasure in life said once a magnificent young athlete a great pedestrian to me is to rest when you are tired and i should add to dry and warm yourself by a big fire when wet and cold and to eat and drink when you are hungry and thirsty all these pleasures were now ours for very soon tea and chops were ready for us and so strangely human so sisterlike did this quiet helpful woman seem after our harsh experiences on that rough rainy daythat we congratulated ourselves on our good fortune in having found such a haven and soon informed her that we wanted no better place  she worked with her needle to support herself and her one child a little boy of ten and by and by when he came in pretty wet from some outdoor occupation we made his acquaintance and the discovery that he was a little boy of an original character he was so much to his mother who poor soul had nobody else in the world to love that she was always haunted by the fear of losing him he was her boy the child of her body exclusively her own unlike all other boys and her wise heart told her that if she put him in a school he would be changed so that she would no longer know him for her boy for it is true that our schools are factories with a machinery to unmake and remake or fabricate the souls of children much in the way in which shoddy is manufactured you may see a thousand rags or garments of a thousand shapes and colours cast in to be boiled bleached pulled to pieces combed and woven and finally come out as a piece of cloth a thousand yards long of a uniform harmonious pattern smooth glossy and respectable his individuality gone he would in a sense be lost to her and although by nature a weak timid woman though poor and a stranger in a strange place this thought or feeling or ridiculous delusion as most people would call it had made her strong and she had succeeded in keeping her boy out of school  hers was an interesting story left alone in the world she had married one in her own class very happily as she imagined he was in some business in a country town well off enough to provide a comfortable home and he was very good in fact his one fault was that he was too good too openhearted and fond of associating with other good fellows like himself and of pledging them in the cup that cheers and at the same time inebriates nevertheless things went very well for a time until the child was born the business declined and they began to be a little pinched then it occurred to her that she too might be able to do something she started dressmaking and as she had good taste and was clever and quick her business soon prospered this pleased him it relieved him from the necessity of providing for the home and enabled him to follow his own inclination which was to take things easilyto be an idle man with a little ready money in his pocket for betting and other pleasures the money was now provided out of our business this state of things continued without any change except that process of degeneration which continued in him until the child was about four years old when all at once one day he told her they were not doing as well as they might she was giving far too much of her time and attention to domestic mattersto the child especially business was businessa thing it was hard for a woman to understandand it was impossible for her to give her mind properly to it with her thoughts occupied with the child it couldnt be done let the child be put away he said and the receipts would probably be doubled he had been making inquiries and found that for a modest annual payment the boy could be taken proper care of at a distance by good decent people he had heard of  she had never suspected such a thought in his mind and this proposal had the effect of a stunning blow she answered not one word he said his say and went out and she knew she would not see him again for many hours perhaps not for some days she knew too that he would say no more to her on the subject that it would all be arranged about the child with or without her consent his will was law her wishes nothing for she was his wife and humble obedient slave never had she pleaded with or admonished him and never complained even when after her long day of hard work he came in at ten or eleven oclock at night with several of his pals all excited with drink and noisy as himself to call for supper nevertheless she had been happyintensely happy because of the child the love for the man she had married wondering how one so bright and handsome and universally admired and liked could stoop to her who had nothing but love and worship to give in returnthat love was now gone and was not missed so much greater and more satisfying was the love for her boy and now she must lose him two or three silent miserable days passed by while she waited for the dreadful separation until the thought of it became unendurable and she resolved to keep her child and sacrifice everything else secretly she prepared for flight getting together the few necessary things she could carry then with the child in her arms she stole out one evening and began her flight which took her all across england at its widest part and ended at this small coast town the best hidingplace she could think of  the boy was a queer little fellow healthy but colourless with strangely beautiful grey eyes which on first seeing them almost startled one with their intelligence he was shy and almost obstinately silent but when i talked to him on certain subjects the intense suppressed interest he felt would show itself in his face and by and by it would burst out in speechan impetuous torrent of words in a high shrill voice he reminded me of a lark in a cage watch it in its prison when the sun shines forthwhen like the captive falcon in dante it is cheated by a gleamits wingtremblings and all its little tentative motions how the excitement grows and grows in it until although shut up and flight denied it the passion can no longer be contained and it bursts out in a torrent of shrill and guttural sounds which if it were free and soaring would be its song his passion was all for nature and his mother out of her small earnings had managed to get quite a number of volumes together for him these he read and reread until he knew them by heart and on sundays or any other day they could take those two lonely ones would take a basket containing their luncheon her work and a book or two and set out on a long ramble along the coast to pass the day in some solitary spot among the sandhills  with these two the gentle woman and her quiet boy over his book and the kitchen fire to warm and dry us after each wetting the bad weather became quite bearable although it lasted many days and it was amazingly bad the wind blew with a fury from the sea it was hard to walk against it the people in hundreds waited in their dull apartments for a lull and when it came they poured out like hungry sheep from the fold or like children from a school swarming over the green slope down to the beach to scatter far and wide over the sands then in a little while a new menacing blackness would come up out of the sea and by and by a fresh storm of wind would send the people scuttling back into shelter so it went on day after day and when night came the sound of the evertroubled sea grew louder so that shut up in our little rooms in that back street we had it in our ears except at intervals when the wind howled loud enough to drown its great voice and hurled tempests of rain and hail against the roofs and windows  to me the most amazing thing was the spectacle of the swifts it was late for them near the end of august they should now have been far away on their flight to africa yet here they were delaying on that desolate east coast in wind and wet more than a hundred of them it was strange to see so many at one spot and i could only suppose that they had congregated previous to migration at that unsuitable place and were being kept back by the late breeders who had not yet been wrought up to the point of abandoning their broods they haunted a vast ruinous old barnlike building near the front which was probably old a century before the town was built and about fifteen to twenty pairs had their nests under the eaves over this building they hung all day in a crowd rising high to come down again at a frantic speed and at each descent a few birds could be seen to enter the holes while others rushed out to join the throng and then all rose and came down again and swept round and round in a furious chase shrieking as if mad at all hours they drew me to that spot and standing there marvelling at their swaying power and the fury that possessed them they appeared to me like tormented beings and were like those doomed wretches in the halls of eblis whose hearts were in a blaze of unquenchable fire and who every one with hands pressed to his breast went spinning round in an everlasting agonized dance they were tormented and crazed by the two most powerful instincts of birds pulling in opposite directionsthe parental instinct and the passion of migration which called them to the south  in such weather especially on that naked desolate coast exposed to the fury of the winds one marvels at our modern craze for the sea not merely to come and gaze upon and listen to it to renew our youth in its salt exhilarating waters and to lie in delicious idleness on the warm shingle or mossy cliff but to be always for days and weeks and even for months at all hours in all weathers close to it with its murmur as of one in pain for ever in our ears  undoubtedly it is an unnatural a diseased want in us the result of a life too confined and artificial in close dirty overcrowded cities it is to satisfy this craving that towns have sprung up everywhere on our coasts and extended their ugly fronts for miles and leagues with their tens of thousands of windows from which the citysickened wretches may gaze and gaze and listen and feed their sick souls with the ocean that is to say during their indoor hours at other times they walk or sit or lie as close as they can to it following the water as it ebbs and reluctantly retiring before it when it returns it was not so formerly before the discovery was made that the sea could cure us probably our greatgrandfathers didnt even know they were sick at all events those who had to live in the vicinity of the sea were satisfied to be a little distance from it out of sight of its grey desolation and if possible out of hearing of its accents disconsolate this may be seen anywhere on our coasts excepting the seaports and fishing settlements the towns and villages are almost always some distance from the sea often in a hollow or at all events screened by rising ground and woods from it the modern seaside place has in most cases its old town or village not far away but quite as near as the healthy ancients wished to be  the old village nearest to our little naked and ugly modern town was discovered at a distance of about two miles but it might have been two hundred so great was the change to its sheltered atmosphere loitering in its quiet streets among the old picturesque brick houses with tiled or thatched roofs and tall chimneysivy and rose and creepercovered with a background of old oaks and elmsi had the sensation of having come back to my own home in that still air you could hear men and women talking fifty or a hundred yards away the cry or laugh of a child and the clear crowing of a cock also the smaller aerial sounds of nature the tinkling notes of tits and other birdlings in the trees the twitter of swallows and martins and the lisp of leaves and ripple of rain it was sweet and restful in that homelike place and hard to leave it to go back to the front to face the furious blasts once more rut there were compensations  the little town we have seen was overcrowded with late summer visitors all eager for the sea yet compelled to waste so much precious time shut up in apartments and at every appearance of a slight improvement in the weather they would pour out of the houses and the green slope would be covered with a crowd of many hundreds all hurrying down to the beach the crowd was composed mostly of womenabout three to every man i should sayand their children and it was one of the most interesting crowds i had ever come across on account of the large number of persons in it of a peculiarly fine type which chance had brought together at that spot it was the large english blonde and there were so many individuals of this type that they gave a character to the crowd so that those of a different physique and colour appeared to be fewer than they were and were almost overlooked they came from various places about the country in the north and the midlands and appeared to be of the welltodo classes they or many of them were with their families but without their lords they were mostly tall and large in every way very whiteskinned with light or golden hair and large light blue eyes a common character of these women was their quiet reposeful manner they walked and talked and rose up and sat down and did everything in fact with an air of deliberation they gazed in a slow steady way at you and were dignified some even majestic and were like a herd of large beautiful white cows the children too especially the girls some almost as tall as their large mothers though still in short frocks were very fine the one pastime of these was paddling and it was a delight to see their bare feet and legs the legs of those who had been longest on the spotprobably several weeks in some instanceswere of a deep nutty brown hue suffused with pink after these a gradation of colour light brown tinged with buff pinkish buff and cream like the gloire de dijon rose and so on to the delicate tender pink of the clover blossom and finally the purest ivory white of the latest arrivals whose skins had not yet been caressed and coloured by sun and wind  how beautiful are the feet of these girls by the sea who bring us glad tidings of a better time to come and the day of a nobler courage a freer larger life when garments which have long oppressed and hindered shall have been cast away it was as i have said mere chance which had brought so many persons of a particular type together on this occasion and i thought i might go there year after year and never see the like again as a fact i did return when august came round and found a crowd of a different character the type was there but did not predominate it was no longer the herd of beautiful white and strawberry cows with golden horns and large placid eyes nothing in fact was the same for when i looked for the swifts there were no more than about twenty birds instead of over a hundred and although just on the eve of departure they were not behaving in the same excited manner  probably i should not have thought so much about that particular crowd in that tempestuous august and remembered it so vividly but for the presence of three persons in it and the strange contrast they made to the large white type i have described these were a woman and her two little girls aged about eight and ten respectively but very small for their years she was a little black haired and blackeyed woman with a pale sad dark face on which some great grief or tragedy had left its shadow very quiet and subdued in her manner she would sit on a chair on the beach when the weather permitted a book on her knees while her two little ones played about chasing and flying from the waves or with the aid of their long poles vaulting from rock to rock they were dressed in black frocks and scarlet blouses which set off their beautiful small dark faces their eyes sparkled like black diamonds and their loose hair was a wonder to see a black mist or cloud about their heads and necks composed of threads fine as gossamer blacker than jet and shining like spun glasshair that looked as if no comb or brush could ever tame its beautiful wildness and in spirit they were what they seemed such a wild joyous frolicsome spirit with such grace and fleetness one does not look for in human beings but only in birds or in some small birdlike volatile mammala squirrel or a marmoset of the tropical forest or the chinchilla of the desolate mountain slopes the swiftest wildest loveliest most airy and most vocal of small beasties occasionally to watch their wonderful motions more closely and have speech with them i followed when they raced over the sands or flew about over the slippery rocks and felt like a cochinchina fowl or muscovy duck or dodo trying to keep pace with a hummingbird their voices were well suited to their small brilliant forms not loud though highpitched and singularly musical and penetrative like the high clear notes of a skylark at a distance they also reminded me of certain notes which have a human quality in some of our songstersthe swallow redstart pied wagtail whinchat and two or three others such pure and beautiful sounds are sometimes heard in human voices chiefly in children when they are talking and laughing in joyous excitement but for any sort of conversation they were too volatile before i could get a dozen words from them they would be off again flying and flitting along the margin like sandpipers and beating the clearvoiced sandpiper at his own aerial graceful game  by and by i was favoured with a fine exhibition of the spirit animating these two little things the weather had made it possible for the crowd of visitors to go down and scatter itself over the beach when the usual black cloud sprang up and soon burst on us in a furious tempest of wind and rain sending the people flying back to the shelter of a large structure erected for such purposes against the cliff it was a vast barnlike place open to the front the roof supported by wooden columns and here in a few minutes some three or four hundred persons were gathered mostly women and their girls white and blueeyed with long wet golden hair hanging down their backs finding a vacant place on the bench i sat down next to a large motherlylooking woman with a robust or dumpy blueeyed girl about four or five years old on her lap most of the people were standing about in groups waiting for the storm to blow over and presently i noticed my two wildhaired dark little girls moving about in the crowd it was impossible not to seen them for they could not keep still a moment they were here there and everywhere playing hideandseek and skipping and racing wherever they could find an opening and by and by taking hold of each other they started dancing it was a pretty spectacle but most interesting to see was the effect produced on the other children the hundred girls big and little the little ones especially who had been standing there tired and impatient to get out to the sea and who were now becoming more and more excited as they gazed until like children when listening to lively music they began moving feet and hands and soon their whole bodies in time to the swift movements of the little dancers at last plucking up courage first one then another joined them and were caught as they came and whirled round and round in a manner quite new to them and which they appeared to find very delightful by and by i observed that the little rosyfaced dumpy girl on my neighbours knees was taking the infection she was staring her blue eyes opened to their widest in wonder and delight then suddenly she began pleading oh mummy do let me go to the little girlsoh do let me and her mother said no because she was so little and could never fly round like that and so would fall and hurt herself and cry but she pleaded still and was ready to cry if refused until the good anxious mother was compelled to release her and down she slipped and after standing still with her little arms and closed hands held up as if to collect herself before plunging into the new tremendous adventure she rushed out towards the dancers one of them saw her coming and instantly quitting the child she was waltzing with flew to meet her and catching her round the middle began spinning her about as if the solid little thing weighed no more than a feather but it proved too much for her very soon she came down and broke into a loud cry which brought her mother instantly to her and she was picked up and taken back to the seat and held to the broad bosom and soothed with caresses and tender words until the sobs began to subside then even before the tears were dry her eyes were once more gazing at the tireless little dancers taking on child after child as they came timidly forward to have a share in the fun and once more she began to plead with her mummy and would not be denied for she was a most determined little saxon until getting her way she rushed out for a second trial again the little dancer saw her coming and flew to her like a bird to its mate and clasping her laughed her merry musical little laugh it was her sudden glory an expression of pure delight in her power to infuse her own fire and boundless gaiety of soul into all these little blueeyed rosy phlegmatic lumps of humanity  what was it in these human mites these fantastic brownies which in that crowd of rowenas and their children made them seem like beings not only of another race but of another species how came they alone to be distinguished among so many by that irresponsible gaiety as of the most volatile of wild creatures that quickness of sense and mind and sympathy that variety and grace and swiftnessall these brilliant exotic qualities harmoniously housed in their small beautiful elastic and vigorous frames it was their genius their charactersomething derived from their race but what race looking at their mother watching her little ones at their frolics with dark shining eyesthe small ovalfaced brownskinned woman with blackest hairi could but say that she was an iberian pure and simple and that her children were like her in southern europe that type abounds it is also to be met with throughout britain perhaps most common in the southern counties and it is not uncommon in east anglia indeed i think it is in norfolk where we may best see the two most marked subtypes in which it is dividedthe two extremes the small stature narrow head dark skin black hair and eyes are common to both and in both these physical characters are correlated with certain mental traits as for instance a peculiar vivacity and warmth of disposition but they are high and low in the latter subdivision the skin is coarse in texture brown or old parchment in colour with little red in it the black hair is also coarse the forehead small the nose projecting and the facial angle indicative of a more primitive race one might imagine that these people had been interred along with specimens of rude pottery and bone and flint implements a long time back about the beginning of the bronze age perhaps and had now come out of their graves and put on modern clothes at all events i dont think a resident in norfolk would have much difficulty in picking out the portraits of some of his fellowvillagers in mr reeds prehistoric peeps  the mother and her little ones were of the higher subtype they had delicate skins beautiful faces clear musical voices they were iberians in blood but improved purified and refined as by fire gentleized and spiritualized and to the lower types down to the aboriginals as is the bright consummate flower to leaf and stem and root  often and often we are teased and tantalized and mocked by that old question                  oh  so old         thousands of years thousands of years              if all were told  of black and blue eyes blue versus black and black versus blue to put it both ways and by black we mean black with orangebrown lights in itthe eye called tortoiseshell and velvety browns with other browns also hazels blue includes all blues from ultramarine or violet to the palest blue of a pale sky and all greys down to the grey that is almost white our preference for this or that colour is supposed to depend on nothing but individual taste or fancy and association i believe it is something more but i do find that we are very apt to be swayed this way and that by the colour of the eyes of the people we meet in life according as they the people attract or repel us the eyes of the two little girls were black as polished black diamonds until looked at closely when they appeared a beautiful deep brown on which the black pupils were seen distinctly they were so lovely that i predisposed to prefer dark to light felt that this question was now definitely settled for methat black was best that irresistible charm the flamelike spirit which raised these two so much above the othershow could it go with anything but the darkest eyes  but no sooner was the question thus settled definitely and for all time to my very great satisfaction than it was unsettled again i do not know how this came about it may have been the sight of some small childs blue eyes looking up at me like the arch blue eyes of a kitten full of wonder at the world and everything in it           where did you get those eyes so blue          out of the sky as i came through  or it may have been the sight of a harebell and perhaps it came from nothing but the waste shining of the sky at all events there they were remembered again looking at me from the past blue eyes that were beautiful and dear to me whose blue colour was associated with every sweetness and charm in child and woman and with all that is best and highest in human souls and i could not and had no wish to resist their appeal  then came a new experience of the eye that is bluea meeting with one who almost seemed to be less flesh than spirit a middleaged lady frail very frail exceedingly pale from long illhealth prematurely whitehaired with beautiful grey eyes gentle but wonderfully bright altogether she was like a being compounded as to her grosser part of foam and mist and gossamer and thistledown and was swayed by every breath of air and who should she venture abroad in rough weather would be lifted and blown away by the gale and scattered like mist over the earth yet she so frail so timid was the one member of the community who had set herself to do the work of a giantthat of championing all illused and suffering creatures wild or tame holding a protecting shield over them against the innate brutality of the people she had been abused and mocked and jeered at by many while others had regarded her action with an amused smile or else with a cold indifference but eventually some for very shame had been drawn to her side and a change in the feeling of the people had resulted domestic animals were treated better and it was no longer universally believed that all wild animals especially those with wings existed only that men might amuse themselves by killing and wounding and trapping and caging and persecuting them in various other ways  the sight of that burning and shining spirit in its frail tenementfor did i not actually see her spirit and the very soul of her in those eyeswas the last of the unforgotten experiences i had at that place which had startled and repelled me with its ugliness  but no there was one more marvellous as anythe experience of a day of days one of those rare days when nature appears to us spiritualized and is no longer nature when that which had transfigured this visible world is in us too and it becomes possible to believeit is almost a convictionthat the burning and shining spirit seen and recognized in one among a thousand we have known is in all of us and in all things in such moments it is possible to go beyond even the most advanced of the modern physicists who hold that force alone exists that matter is but a disguise a shadow and delusion for we may add that force itselfthat which we call force or energyis but a semblance and shadow of the universal soul  the change in the weather was not sudden the furious winds dropped gradually the clouds floated higher in the heavens and were of a lighter grey there were wider breaks in them showing the lucid blue beyond and the sea grew quieter it had raved and roared too long beating against the iron walls that held it back and was now spent and fallen into an uneasy sleep but still moved uneasily and moaned a little then all at once summer returned coming like a thief in the night for when it was morning the sun rose in splendour and power in a sky without a cloud on its vast azure expanse on a calm sea with no motion but that scarcely perceptible rise and fall as of one that sleeps as the sun rose higher the air grew warmer until it was full summer heat but although a visible heat it was never oppressive for all that day we were abroad and as the tide ebbed a new country that was neither earth nor sea was disclosed an infinite expanse of pale yellow sand stretching away on either side and further and further out until it mingled and melted into the sparkling water and faintly seen line of foam on the horizon and over allthe distant sea the ridge of low dunes marking where the earth ended and the flat yellow expanse betweenthere brooded a soft bluish silvery haze a haze that blotted nothing out but blended and interfused them all until earth and air and sea and sands were scarcely distinguishable the effect delicate mysterious unearthly cannot be described                              ethereal gauze             visible heat airwater and dry sea             last conquest of the eye                                          sun dust             aerial surf upon the shores of earth             ethereal estuary frith of light             bird of the sun transparent winged  do we not see that words fail as pigments dothat the effect is too coarse since in describing it we put it before the mental eye as something distinctly visible a thing of itself and separate but it is not so in nature the effect is of something almost invisible and is yet a part of all and makes all thingssky and sea and landas unsubstantial as itself even living moving things had that aspect far out on the lowest further strip of sand which appeared to be on a level with the sea gulls were seen standing in twos and threes and small groups and in rows but they did not look like gullsfamiliar birds gullshaped with grey and white plumage they appeared twice as big as gulls and were of a dazzling whiteness and of no definite shape though standing still they had motion an effect of the quivering dancing air the visible heat at rest they were seen now as separate objects then as one with the silver sparkle on the sea and when they rose and floated away they were no longer shining and white but like pale shadows of winged forms faintly visible in the haze  they were not birds but spiritsbeings that lived in or were passing through the world and now like the heat made visible and i standing far out on the sparkling sands with the sparkling sea on one side and the line of dunes indistinctly seen as land on the other was one of them and if any person had looked at me from a distance he would have seen me as a formless shining white being standing by the sea and then perhaps as a winged shadow floating in the haze it was only necessary to put out ones arms to float that was the effect on my mind this natural world was changed to a supernatural and there was no more matter nor force in sea or land nor in the heavens above but only spirit     chapter six by swallowfield   one of the most attractive bits of green and wooded country near london i know lies between reading and basingstoke and includes aldermaston with its immemorial oaks in berkshire and silchester with pamber forest in hampshire it has long been one of my favourite haunts summer and winter and it is perhaps the only wooded place in england where i have a home feeling as strong as that which i experience in certain places among the south wiltshire downs and in the absolutely flat country on the severn in somerset and the flat country in cambridgeshire and east anglia especially at lynn and about ely  i am now going back to my first visit to this green retreat it was in the course of one of those easter walks i have spoken of and the way was through reading and by three mile cross and swallowfield on this occasion i conceived a dislike to reading which i have never quite got over for it seemed an unconscionably big place for two slow pedestrians to leave behind worse still when we did leave it we found that reading would not leave us it was like a stupendous octopus in red brick which threw out red tentacles miles and miles long in various directionslittle rows and single and double cottages and villas all in red red brick and its weary accompaniment the everlasting hard slate roof these square red brick boxes with sloping slate tops are built as close as possible to the public road so that the passerby looking in at the windows may see the whole interiorwallpapers pictures furniture and oftentimes the dull expressionless face of the woman of the house staring back at you out of her shallow blue eyes the weather too was against us a grey hard sky like the slate roofs and a cold strong east wind to make the road dusty all day long  arrived at three mile cross it was no surprise to find it no longer recognizable as the hamlet described in our village but it was saddening to look at the cottage in which mary russell mitford lived and was on the whole very happy with her flowers and work for thirty years of her life in its present degraded state it has a sign now and calls itself the mitford arms and a temperance hotel and we were told that you could get tea and bread and butter there but nothing else the cottage has been much altered since miss mitfords time and the open space once occupied by the beloved garden is now filled with buildings including a corrugatediron dissenting chapel  from three mile cross we walked on to swallowfield still by those neverending roadside redbrick cottages and villas for we were not yet properly out of the hated biscuit metropolis it was a big village with the houses scattered far and wide over several square miles of country but just where the church stands it is shady and pleasant the pretty church yard too is very deeply shaded and occupies a small hill with the loddon flowing partly round it then taking its swift way through the village miss mitfords monument is a plain almost an ugly granite cross standing close to the wall shaded by yew elm and beech trees and one is grateful to think that if she never had her reward when living she has found at any rate a very peaceful restingplace  the sexton was there and told us that he was but ten years old when miss mitford died but that he remembered her well and she was a very pleasant little woman others in the place who remembered her said the samethat she was very pleasant and sweet we know that she was sweet and charming but unfortunately the portraits we have of her do not give that impression they represent her as a fat commonplace looking person a little vulgar perhaps i fancy the artists were bunglers i possess a copy of a very small pencil sketch made of her face by a dear old lady friend of mine now dead about the year 1851 or 2 my friend had a gift for portraiture in a peculiar way when she saw a face that greatly interested her in a drawingroom on a platform in the street anywhere it remained very vividly in her mind and on going home she would sketch it and some of these sketches of well known persons are wonderfully good she was staying in the country with a friend who drove with her to swallowfield to call on miss mitford and on her return to her friends house she made the little sketch and in this tiny portrait i can see the refinement the sweetness the animation and charm which she undoubtedly possessed  but let me now venture to step a little outside of my own province my small plota poor pedestrians unimportant impressions of places and faces all these ps come by accident and this i put in parenthetically just because an editor solemnly told me a while ago that he couldnt abide and wouldnt have alliterations artful aid in his periodical let us leave the subject of what miss mitford was to those of her day who knew her a thousand lovely personalities pass away every year and in a little while are no more remembered than the brightplumaged bird that falls in the tropical forest or the vanished orchid bloom of which some one has said that the angels in heaven can look on no more beautiful thing leaving all that let us ask what remains to us of another generation of all she was and did  she was a prolific writer both prose and verse and as we know had an extraordinary vogue in her own time anything that came from her pen had an immediate success indeed so highly was she regarded that nothing she chose to write however poor could fail and she certainly did write a good deal of poor stuff it was all in a sense poor but books and books poor soul she had to write it was in a sense poor because it was mostly ambitious stuff and as the proverb says you cannot fly like an eagle with the wings of a wren she was driven to fly and gave her little wings too much to do and her flights were apt to be mere little weak flutterings over the surface of the ground a wren and she had not a cuckoo but a devouring cormorant to sustainthat dear beautiful father of hers who was more to her than any reprobate son to his devoted mother and who day after day year after year gobbled up her earnings and then would hungrily go on squawking for more until he stumbled into the grave alas he was too long in dying she was worn out by then the little heart beating not so fast and the bright little brain growing dim and very tired  now all the ambitious stuff she wrote to keep the cormorant and incidentally to immortalize herself has fallen deservedly into oblivion but wesome of usdo not forget and never want to forget mary russell mitford her letters remainthe little friendly letters which came from her pen like balls of silvery down from a sunripened plant and were wafted far and wide over the land to those she loved there is a wonderful charm in them they are so spontaneous so natural so perfectly reflect her humour and vivacity her overflowing sweetness her beautiful spirit and one book too remainsthe series of sketches about the poor little hamlet in which she lived so long and laboured so hard to support herself and her parents the turtledove mated with a cormorant driven to produce work and hard up for a subject in a happy moment she took up this humble one lying at her own door and allowed her self to write naturally even as in her most intimate letters this is the reason of the vitality of our tillage it was simple natural and reflected the author herself her tender human heart her impulsive nature her bright playful humorous spirit there is no thought no mind stuff in it and it is a classic it is about the country and she has so little observation that it might have been written in a town out of a book away from natures sights and sounds her rustic characters are not comparable to those of a score or perhaps two or three score of other writers who treat of such subjects the dialogue when she makes them talk is unnatural and her invention so poor that when she puts in a little romance of her own making one regrets it and so one might go on picking it all to pieces like a dandelion blossom nevertheless it endures outliving scores of in a way better books on the same themes because her own delightful personality manifests itself and shines in all these little pictures this short passage describing how she took lizzie the little village child she loved to gather cowslips in the meadows will serve as an illustration    they who know these feelings and who is so happy as not to have known some of them will understand why alfieri became powerless and froissart dull and why even needlework the most effective sedative that grand soother and composer of womens distress fails to comfort me today i will go out into the air this cool pleasant afternoon and try what that will do i will go to the meadows the beautiful meadows and i will have my materials of happiness lizzie and may and a basket for flowers and we will make a cowslip ball did you ever see a cowslip ball lizzie no come away then make haste run lizzie    and on we go fast fast down the road across the lea past the workhouse along by the great pond till we slide into the deep narrow lane whose hedges seem to meet over the water and win our way to the little farmhouse at the end through the farmyard lizzie over the gate never mind the cows they are quiet enough i dont mind em said miss lizzie boldly and truly and with a proud affronted air displeased at being thought to mind anything and showing by her attitude and manner some design of proving her courage by an attack on the largest of the herd in the shape of a pull by the tail i dont mind em i know you dont lizzie but let them alone and dont chase the turkeycock come to me my dear and for wonder lizzie came  in the meantime my other pet mayflower had also gotten into a scrape she had driven about a huge unwieldy sow till the animals grunting had disturbed the repose of a still more enormous newfoundland dog the guardian of the yard  the beautiful white greyhounds mocking treatment of the surly dog on the chain then follows and other pretty scenes and adventures until after some mishaps and much trouble the cowslip ball is at length completed  what a concentration of fragrance and beauty it was golden and sweet to satiety rich in sight and touch and smell lizzie was enchanted and ran off with her prize hiding amongst the trees in the very coyness of ecstasy as if any human eye even mine would be a restraint on her innocent raptures  here the very woman is revealed to us her tender and lively disposition her impulsiveness and childlike love of fun and delight in everything on earth we see in such a passage what her merit really is the reason of our liking or partiality for her her pleasure in everything makes everything interesting and in displaying her feeling without art or disguise she succeeds in giving what we may call a literary expression to personal charmthat quality which is almost untranslatable into written words many women possess it it is in them and issues from them and is like an essential oil in a flower but too volatile to be captured and made use of furthermore women when they write are as a rule even more conventional than men more artificial and out of and away from themselves  i do not know that any literary person will agree with me i have gone aside to write about miss mitford mainly for my own satisfaction frequently when i have wanted to waste half an hour pleasantly with a book i have found myself picking up our village from among many others some waiting for a first perusal and i wanted to know why this was soto find out if not to invent some reason for my liking which would not make me ashamed  at swallowfield we failed to find a place to stay at there was no such place and of the inns named i think the crown cricketers birdinthehand and george and dragon only one was said to provide accommodation for travellers as the law orders but on going to the house we were informed that the landlord or his wife was just dead or dangerously ill i forget which and they could take no one in accordingly we had to trudge back to three mile cross and the old ramshackle wellnigh ruinous inn there it was a wretched place smelling of mould and dryrot however it was not so bad after a fire had been lighted in the grate but first the young girl who waited on us brought in a bundle of newspapers which she proceeded to thrust up the chimneyflue and kindle to warm the flue and make the fire burn she explained  on the following day the weather being milder we rambled on through woods and lanes visiting several villages and arrived in the afternoon at silchester where we had resolved to put up for the night by a happy chance we found a pleasant cottage on the common to stay at and pleasant people in it so that we were glad to sit down for a week there to loiter about the furzy waste or prowl in the forest and haunt the old walls but it was pleasant even indoors with that wide prospect before the window the wooded country stretching many miles away to the hills of kingsclere blue in the distance and crowned with their beechen rings and groves of roman calleva itself and the thoughts i had there i will write in the following chapter here i will only relate how on easter sunday two days after arriving we went to morning service in the old church standing on a mound inside the walls a mile from the village and common  it came to pass that during the service the sun began to shine very brightly after several days of cloud and misty windy wet weather and that brilliance and the warmth in it served to bring a butterfly out of hiding then another then a third red admirals all and they were seen through all the prayers and psalms and hymns and lessons and the sermon preached by the whitehaired rector fluttering against the translucent glass wanting to be out in that splendour and renew their life after so long a period of suspension but the glass was between them and their world of blue heavens and woods and meadow flowers then i thought that after the service i would make an attempt to get them out but soon reflected that to release them it would be necessary to capture them first and that that could not be done without a ladder and butterfly net among the women ladies on either side of and before me there were no fewer than five wearing aigrettes of egret and birdofparadise plumes in their hats or bonnets and these five all remained to take part in that ceremony of eating bread and drinking wine in remembrance of an event supposed to be of importance to their souls here and hereafter it saddened me to leave my poor red admirals in their prison beating their red wings against the coloured glassto leave them too in such company where the aigrette wearers were worshipping a little god of their own little imaginations who did not create and does not regard the swallow and dove and white egret and birdofparadise and who was therefore not my god and whose will as they understood it was nothing to me  it was a consolation when i went out still thinking of the butterflies in their prison and stood by the old ruined walls grown over with ivy and crowned with oak and holly trees to think that in another two thousand years there will be no archaeologist and no soul in silchester or anywhere else in britain or in the world who would take the trouble to dig up the remains of aigrettewearers and their works and who would care what had become of their pitiful little soulstheir immortal part     chapter seven roman calleva   an afternoon in the late november of 1903 frost gales and abundant rains have more than half stripped the oaks of their yellow leaves but the rain is over now the sky once more a pure lucid blue above meall around me in fact since i am standing high on the top of the ancient stupendous earthwork grown over with oak wood and underwood of holly and thorn and hazel with tangle of ivy and bramble and briar it is marvellously still no sound from the village reaches me i only hear the faint rustle of the dead leaves as they fall and the robin for one spied me here and has come to keep me company at intervals he spurts out his brilliant little fountain of sound and that sudden bright melody and the bright colour of the sunlit translucent leaves seem like one thing nature is still and i am still standing concealed among trees or moving cautiously through the dead russet bracken not that i am expecting to get a glimpse of the badger who has his hermitage in this solitary place but i am on forbidden ground in the heart of a sacred pheasant preserve where one must do ones prowling warily hard by almost within a stonesthrow of the woodgrown earthwork on which i stand are the ruinous walls of roman callevathe silchester which the antiquarians have been occupied in uncovering these dozen years or longer the stone walls too like the more ancient earthwork are overgrown with trees and brambles and ivy the trees have grown upon the wall sending roots deep down between the stones through the crumbling cement and so fast are they anchored that never a tree falls but it brings down huge masses of masonry with it this slow levelling process has been going on for centuries and it was doubtless in this way that the buildings within the walls were pulled down long ages ago then the action of the earthworms began and floors and foundations with fallen stones and tiles were gradually buried in the soil and what was once a city was a dense thicket of oak and holly and thorn finally the wood was cleared and the city was a walled wheat fieldso far as we know the ground has been cultivated since the days of king john but the entire history of this green walled space before meless than twenty centuries in durationdoes not seem so very long compared with that of the huge earthen wall i am standing on which dates back to prehistoric times  standing here kneedeep in the dead ruddy bracken in the coloured shade of the oaks idly watching the leaves fall fluttering to the ground thinking in an aimless way of the remains of the two ancient cities before me the british and the roman and of their comparative antiquity i am struck with the thought that the sweet sensations produced in me by the scene differ in character from the feeling i have had in other solitary places the peculiar sense of satisfaction of restfulness of peace experienced here is very perfect but in the wilderness where man has never been or has at all events left no trace of his former presence there is ever a mysterious sense of loneliness of desolation underlying our pleasure in nature here it seems good to know or to imagine that the men i occasionally meet in my solitary rambles and those i see in the scattered rustic village hard by are of the same race and possibly the descendants of the people who occupied this spot in the remote pastiberian and celt and roman and saxon and dane if that hardfeatured and sourvisaged old gamekeeper with the cold blue unfriendly eyes should come upon me here in my hidingplace and scowl as he is accustomed to do standing silent before me gun in hand to hear my excuses for trespassing in his preserves i should say mentally this man is distinctly english and his faroff progenitors somewhere about sixteen hundred years ago probably assisted at the massacre of the inhabitants of the pleasant little city at my feet by and by leaving the ruins i may meet with other villagers of different features and different colour in hair skin and eyes and of a pleasanter expression and in them i may see the remote descendants of other older races of men some who were lords here before the romans came and of others before them even back to neolithic times  this i take it is a satisfaction a sweetness and peace to the soul in nature because it carries with it a sense of the continuity of the human race its undying vigour its everlastingness after all the tempests that have overcome it through all mutations in such immense stretches of time how stable it is  i recall the time when i lived on a vast vacant level green plain an earth which to the eye and to the mind which sees with the eye appeared illimitable like the ocean where the house i was born in was the oldest in the districta century old it was said where the people were the childrens children of emigrants from europe who had conquered and colonized the country and had enjoyed but half a century of national life but the people who had possessed the land before these emigrantswhat of them they were but a memory a tradition a story told in books and hardly more to us than a fable perhaps they had dwelt there for long centuries or for thousands of years perhaps they had come a wandering horde to pass quickly away like a flight of migrating locusts for no memorial existed no work of their hands not the faintest trace of their occupancy  walking one day at the side of a ditch which had been newly cut through a meadow at the end of our plantation i caught sight of a small black object protruding from the side of the cutting which turned out to be a fragment of indian pottery made of coarse clay very black and rudely ornamented on one side on searching further a few more pieces were found i took them home and preserved them carefully experiencing a novel and keen sense of pleasure in their possession for though worthless they were mans handiwork the only real evidence i had come upon of that vanished people who had been before us and it was as if those bits of baked clay with a pattern incised on them by a mans fingernail had in them some magical property which enabled me to realize the past and to see that vacant plain repeopled with long dead and forgotten men  doubtless we all possess the feeling in some degreethe sense of loneliness and desolation and dismay at the thought of an uninhabited world and of long periods when man was not is it not the absence of human life or remains rather than the illimitable wastes of thickribbed ice and snow which daunts us at the thought of arctic and antarctic regions again in the story of the earth as told by geology do we not also experience the same sense of dismay and the soul shrinking back on itself when we come in imagination to those deserts desolate in time when the continuity of the race was broken and the world dispeopled the doctrine of evolution has made us tolerant of the thought of human animalsour progenitors as we must believewho were of brutish aspect and whose period on this planet was so long that compared with it the historic and prehistoric periods are but as the life of an individual a quarter of a million years has perhaps elapsed since the beginning of that cold period which at all events in this part of the earth killed palaeolithic man yet how small a part of his racial life even that time would seem if as some believe his remains may be traced as far back as the eocene but after this rude man of the quaternary and tertiary epochs had passed away there is a void a period which to the imagination seems measureless when sun and moon and stars looked on a waste and mindless world when man once more reappears he seems to have been recreated on somewhat different lines  it is this break in the history of the human race which amazes and daunts us which shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation  here in these words of hermann melville we are let all at once into the true meaning of those disquieting and seemingly indefinable emotions so often experienced even by the most ardent lovers of nature and of solitude in uninhabited deserts on great mountains and on the sea we find here the origin of that horror of mountains which was so common until recent times a friend once confessed to me that he was always profoundly unhappy at sea during long voyages and the reason was that his sustaining belief in a superintending power and in immortality left him when he was on that waste of waters which have no human associations the feeling so intense in his case is known to most if not all of us but we feel it faintly as a disquieting element in nature of which we may be but vaguely conscious  most travelled englishmen who have seen much of the world and resided for long or short periods in many widely separated countries would probably agree that there is a vast difference in the feeling of strangeness or want of harmony with our surroundings experienced in old and in new countries it is a compound feeling and some of its elements are the same in both cases but in one there is a disquieting element which the other is without thus in southern europe egypt syria and in many countries of asia and some portions of africa the wanderer from home might experience dissatisfaction and be ill at ease and wish for old familiar sights and sounds but in a colony like tasmania and in any new country where there were no remains of antiquity no links with the past the feeling would be very much more poignant and in some scenes and moods would be like that sense of desolation which assails us at the thought of the heartless voids and immensities of the universe  he recognizes that he is in a world on which we have but recently entered and in which our position is not yet assured  here standing on this mound as on other occasions past counting i recognize and appreciate the enormous difference which human associations make in the effect produced on us by visible nature in this silent solitary place with the walled field which was once calleva atrebatum at my feet i yet have a sense of satisfaction of security never felt in a land that had no historic past the knowledge that my individual life is but a span a breath that in a little while i too must wither and mingle like one of those fallen yellow leaves with the mould does not grieve me i know it and yet disbelieve it for am i not here alive where men have inhabited for thousands of years feeling what i now feeltheir oneness with everlasting nature and the undying human family the very soil and wet carpet of moss on which their feet were set the standing trees and leaves green or yellow the raindrops the air they breathed the sunshine in their eyes and hearts was part of them not a garment but of their very substance and spirit feeling this death becomes an illusion and the illusion that the continuous life of the species its immortality and the individual life are one and the same is the reality and truth an illusion but as mill says deprive us of our illusions and life would be intolerable happily we are not easily deprived of them since they are of the nature of instincts and ineradicable and this very one which our reason can prove to be the most childish the absurdest of all is yet the greatest the most fruitful of good for the race to those who have discarded supernatural religion it may be a religion or at all events the foundation to build one on for there is no comfort to the healthy natural man in being told that the good he does will not be interred with his bones since he does not wish to think and in fact refuses to think that his bones will ever be interred joy in the choir invisible is to him a mere poetic fancy or at best a rarefied transcendentalism which fails to sustain him if altruism or the religion of humanity is a living vigorous plant and as some believe flourishes more with the progress of the centuries it must like other soulgrowths have a deeper tougher woodier root in our soil     chapter eight a gold day at silchester   it is little to a mans profit to go far afield if his chief pleasure be in wild life his main object to get nearer to the creatures to grow day by day more intimate with them and to see each day some new thing yet the distance has the same fascination for him as for anotherthe call is as sweet and persistent in his ears if he is on a green level country with blue hills on the horizon then especially in the early morning is the call sweetest most irresistible come awaycome away this blue world has better things than any in that green too familiar place the startling scream of the jayyou have heard it a thousand times it is pretty to watch the squirrel in his chestnutred coat among the oaks in their fresh green foliage full of fun as a bright child eating his apple like a child only it is an oakapple shining white or white and rosyred in his little paws but you have seen it so many timescome away  it was not this voice alone which made me forsake the green oaks of silchester and pamber forest to ramble for a season hither and thither in wiltshire dorset and somerset there was something for me to do in those places but the call made me glad to go and long weeksmonthswent by in my wanderings mostly in open downland country too often under gloomy skies chilled by cold winds and wetted by cold rains then having accomplished my purpose and discovered incidentally that the call had mocked me again as on so many previous occasions i returned once more to the old familiar green place  crossing the common i found that where it had been dry in spring one might now sink to his knees in the bog also that the snipe which had vanished for a season were back at the old spot where they used to breed it was a bitter day near the end of an unpleasant summer with the wind back in the old hateful northeast quarter but the sun shone the sky was blue and the flying clouds were of a dazzling whiteness shivering i remembered the south wall and went there since to escape from the wind and bask like some halffrozen serpent or lizard in the heat was the highest good one could look for in such weather to see anything new in wild life was not to be hoped for  that old grey crumbling wall of ancient calleva crowned with big oak and ash and thorn and holly and draped with green bramble and trailing ivy and creepershow good a shelter it is on a cold rough day moving softly so as not to disturb any creature i yet disturbed a ring snake lying close to the wall into which it quickly vanished and then from their old place among the stones a pair of blue stockdoves rushed out with clatter of wings the same blue doves which i had known for three years at that spot a few more steps and i came upon as pretty a little scene in bird life as one could wish for twenty to twentyfive small birds of different speciestits wrens dunnocks thrushes blackbirds chaffinches yellowhammerswere congregated on the lower outside twigs of a bramble bush and on the bare ground beside it close to the foot of the wall the sun shone full on that spot and they had met for warmth and for company the tits and wrens were moving quietly about in the bush others were sitting idly or preening their feathers on the twigs or the ground most of them were making some kind of small soundlittle exclamatory chirps and a variety of chirrupings producing the effect of a pleasant conversation going on among them this was suddenly suspended on my appearance but the alarm was soon over and seeing me seated on a fallen stone and motionless they took no further notice of me two blackbirds were there sitting a little way apart on the bare ground these were silent the raggedest rustiestlooking members of that little company for they were moulting and their drooping wings and tails had many unsightly gaps in them where the old feathers had dropped out before the new ones had grown they were suffering from that annual sickness with temporary loss of their brightest faculties which all birds experience in some degree the unseasonable rains and cold winds had been bad for them and now they were having their sunbath their best medicine and cure  by and by a pertlooking brightfeathered dapper cock chaffinch dropped down from the bush and advancing to one of the two the rustiest and most forlornlooking started running round and round him as if to make a close inspection of his figure then began to tease him at first i thought it was all in funmerely animal spirit which in birds often discharges itself in this way in little pretended attacks and fights but the blackbird had no play and no fight in him no heart to defend himself all he did was to try to avoid the strokes aimed at him and he could not always escape them his spiritlessness served to inspire the chaffinch with greater boldness and then it appeared that the gay little creature was really and truly incensed possibly because the rusty draggled and listless appearance of the larger bird was offensive to him anyhow the persecutions continued increasing in fury until they could not be borne and the blackbird tried to escape by hiding in the bramble but he was not permitted to rest there out he was soon driven and away into another bush and again into still another further away and finally he was hunted over the sheltering wall into the bleak wind on the other side then the persecutor came back and settled himself on his old perch on the bramble well satisfied at his victory over a bird so much bigger than himself all was again peace and harmony in the little social gathering and the pleasant talkeetalkee went on as before about five minutes passed then the hunted blackbird returned and going to the identical spot from which he had been driven composed himself to rest only now he sat facing his lively little enemy  i was astonished to see him back so apparently was the chaffinch he started craned his neck and regarded his adversary first with one eye then with the other what rags and tatters back again so soon i seem to hear him say you miserable travesty of a bird scarcely fit for a weasel to dine on your presence is an insult to us but ill soon settle you youll feel the cold on the other side of the wall when ive knocked off a few more of your rusty rags  down from his perch he came but no sooner had he touched his feet to the ground than the blackbird went straight at him with extraordinary fury the chaffinch taken by surprise was buffeted and knocked over then recovering himself fled in consternation hotly pursued by the sick one into the bush they went but in a moment they were out again darting this way and that now high up in the trees now down to the ground the blackbird always close behind and no little bird flying from a hawk could have exhibited a greater terror than that pert chaffinchthat vivacious and most pugnacious little cock bantam at last they went quite away and were lost to sight by and by the blackbird returned alone and going once more to his place near the second bird he settled down comfortably to finish his sunbath in peace and quiet  i had assuredly witnessed a new thing on that unpromising day something quite different from anything witnessed in my wide rambles and though a little thing it had been a most entertaining comedy in bird life with a very proper ending it was clear that the sick blackbird had bitterly resented the treatment he had received that brooding on it out in the cold his anger had made him strong and that he came back determined to fight with his plan of action matured he was not going to be made a fool every time  the birds all gone their several ways at last i got up from my stone and wondered if the old romans ever dreamed that this wall which they made to endure would after seventeen hundred years have no more important use than thisto afford shelter to a few little birds and to the solitary man that watched themfrom the bleak wind many a strange roman curse on this ungenial climate must these same stones have heard looking through a gap in the wall i saw close by on the other side a dozen men at work with pick and shovel throwing up huge piles of earth they were uncovering a small portion of that ancient buried city and were finding the foundations and floors and hypocausts of silchesters public baths also some broken pottery and trifling ornaments of bronze and bone the workmen in that bitter wind were decidedly better off than the gentlemen from burlington house in charge of the excavations these stood with coats buttoned up and hands thrust deep down in their pockets it seemed to me that it was better to sit in the shelter of the wall and watch the birds than to burrow in the crumbling dust for that small harvest yet i could understand and even appreciate their work although it is probable that the glow i experienced was in part reflected perhaps my mental attitude when standing in that sheltered place and when getting on to the windy wall i looked down on the workers and their work was merely benevolent i had pleasure in their pleasure and a vague desire for a better understanding a closer alliance and harmony it was the desire that we might all see naturethe globe with all it containsas one harmonious whole not as groups of things or phenomena unrelated cast there by chance or by careless or contemptuous gods this dust of past ages dug out of a wheatfield with its fragments of mens workits pottery and tiles and stonesthis is a part too even as the small birds with their little motives and passions so like mans are a part i thought with self shame of my own sins in this connection then considering the lesser faults on the other side i wished that mr st john hope would experience a like softening mood and regret that he had abused the ivy it grieves me to hear it called a noxious weed that perished people whose remains in this land so deeply interest him were the mightiest builders of ruins the world has known but who except the archaeologist would wish to see these piled stones in their naked harshness striking the mind with dismay at the thought of time and its perpetual desolations i like better the old spanish poet who says what of rome its worldconquering power and majesty and glorywhat has it come to the ivy on the wall the yellow wallflower tell it a deadly parasite quotha is it not well that this plant this evergreen tapestry of innumerable leaves should cover and partly hide and partly reveal the strange defeatures the centuries have set on mans greatest works i would have no ruin nor no old and noble building without it for not only does it beautify decay but from long association it has come to be in the mind a very part of such scenes and so interwoven with the human tragedy that like the churchyard yew it seems the most human of green things  here in september great masses of the plant are already showing a greenish creamcolour of the opening blossoms which will be at their perfection in october then when the sun shines there will be no lingering red admiral nor blue fly or fly of any colour nor yellow wasp nor any honeyeating or late honeygathering insect that will not be here to feed on the ivys sweetness and behind the blossoming curtain alive with the minute multitudinous swiftmoving glittering forms some nobler form will be hidden in a hole or fissure in the wall here on many a night i have listened to the sibilant screech of the white owl and the brown owls clear longdrawn quavering lamentation                good ivy what byrdys hast thou               non but the howlet that how how     chapter nine rural rides   abirding on a broncho is the title of a charming little book published some years ago and probably better known to readers on the other side of the atlantic than in england i remember reading it with pleasure and pride on account of the authors name florence merriam seeing that on my mothers side i am partly a merriam myself of the branch on the other side of the atlantic and having been informed that all of that rare name are of one family i took it that we were related though perhaps very distantly abirding on a broncho suggested an equally alliterative title for this chapterbirding on a bike but i will leave it to others for those who go abirding are now very many and are hard put to find fresh titles to their books for several reasons it will suit me better to borrow from cobbett and name this chapter rural rides  sore of us do not go out on bicycles to observe the ways of birds indeed some of our common species have grown almost too familiar with the wheel it has become a positive danger to them they not infrequently mistake its rate of speed and injure themselves in attempting to fly across it recently i had a thrush knock himself senseless against the spokes of my forewheel and cycling friends have told me of similar experiences they have had in some instances the heedless birds getting killed chaffinches are like the children in village streetsthey will not get out of your way by and by in rural places the merciful man will have to ring his bell almost incessantly to avoid running over them as i do not travel at a furious speed i manage to avoid most things even the wandering loveless oilbeetle and the small rosebeetle and that slowmoving insect tortoise the tumbledung two or three seasons ago i was so unfortunate as to run over a large and beautifully bright grass snake near aldermaston once a snake sanctuary he writhed and wriggled on the road as if i had broken his back but on picking him up i was pleased to find that my windinflated rubber tyre had not like the brazen chariot wheel crushed his delicate vertebra he quickly recovered and when released glided swiftly and easily away into cover twice only have i deliberately tried to run down to tread on coattails so to speak of any wild creature one was a weasel the other a stoat running along at a hedgeside before me in both instances just as the front wheel was touching the tail the little flatheaded rascal swerved quickly aside and escaped  even some of the less common and less tame birds care as little for a man on a bicycle as they do for a cow not long ago a peewit trotted leisurely across the road not more than ten yards from my front wheel and on the same day i came upon a green woodpecker enjoying a dustbath in the public road he declined to stir until i stopped to watch him then merely flew about a dozen yards away and attached himself to the trunk of a fir tree at the roadside and waited there for me to go never in all my wanderings afoot had i seen a yaffingale dusting himself like a barndoor fowl  it is not seriously contended that birds can be observed narrowly in this easy way but even for the most conscientious field naturalist the wheel has its advantages it carries him quickly over much barren ground and gives him a better view of the country he traverses finally it enables him to see more birds he will sometimes see thousands in a day where walking he would hardly have seen hundreds and there is joy in mere numbers it was just to get this general rapid sight of the bird life of the neighbouring hilly district of hampshire that i was at newbury on the last day of october the weather was bright though very cold and windy and towards evening i was surprised to see about twenty swallows in northbrook street flying languidly to and fro in the shelter of the houses often fluttering under the eaves and at intervals sitting on ledges and projections these belated birds looked as if they wished to hibernate or find the most cosy holes to die in rather than to emigrate on the following day at noon they came out again and flew up and down in the same feeble aimless manner  undoubtedly a few swallows of all three species but mostly housemartins do lie up in england every winter but probably very few survive to the following spring we should have said that it was impossible that any should survive but for one authentic instance in recent years in which a barnswallow lived through the winter in a semitorpid state in an outhouse at a country vicarage what came of the newbury birds i do not know as i left on the 2nd of novembertore myself away i may say for besides meeting with people i didnt know who treated a stranger with sweet friendliness it is a town which quickly wins ones affections it is built of bricks of a good deep rich rednot the painfully bright red so much in use nowand no person has had the bad taste to spoil the harmony by introducing stone and stucco moreover newbury has in shaw house an elizabethan mansion of the rarest beauty let him that is weary of the ugliness and discords in our town buildings go and stand by the ancient cedar at the gate and look across the wide green lawn at this restful house subdued by time to a tender rosyred colour on its walls and a deep dark red on its roof clouded with grey of lichen  from newbury and the green meadows of the kennet the hampshire hills may be seen looking like the south down range at its highest point viewed from the sussex weald i made for coombe hill the highest hill in hampshire and found it a considerable labour to push my machine up from the pretty treehidden village of east woodhay at its foot the top is a leaguelong tableland with stretches of green elastic turf thickets of furze and bramble and clumps of ancient noble beechesa beautiful lonely wilderness with rabbits and birds for only inhabitants from the highest point where a famous gibbet stands for ever a thousand feet above the sea and where there is a dewpond the highest in england which has never dried up although a large flock of sheep drink in it every summer day one looks down into an immense hollow a devils punch bowl very many times magnifiedand spies far away and far below a few lonely houses half hidden by trees at the bottom this is the romantic village of coombe and hither i went and found the vicar busy in the garden of the small old picturesque parsonage here a very pretty little bird comedy was in progress a pair of stockdoves which had been taken from a rabbithole in the hill and reared by hand had just escaped from the large cage where they had always lived and all the family were excitedly engaged in trying to recapture them they were delightful to seethose two pretty blue birds with red legs running busily about on the green lawn eagerly searching for something to eat and finding nothing they were quite tame and willing to be fed so that anyone could approach them and put as much salt on their tails as he liked but they refused to be touched or taken they were too happy in their new freedom running and flying about in that brilliant sunshine and when i left towards the evening they were still at large  but before quitting that small isolated village in its green basina human heart in a chalk hill almost the highest in englandi wished the hours i spent in it had been days so much was there to see and hear there was the gibbet on the hill for example far up on the rim of the green basin four hundred feet above the village why had that memorial that symbol of a dreadful past been preserved for so many years and generations and why had it been raised so highwas it because the crime of the person put to death there was of so monstrous a nature that it was determined to suspend him if not on a gibbet fifty cubits high at all events higher above the earth than haman the son of hammedatha the agagite the gruesome story is as follows  once upon a time there lived a poor widow woman in coombe with two sons aged fourteen and sixteen who worked at a farm in the village she had a lover a middleaged man living at woodhay a carrier who used to go on two or three days each week with his cart to deliver parcels at coombe but he was a married man and as he could not marry the widow while his wife remained alive it came into his dull berkshire brain that the only way out of the difficulty was to murder her and to this course the widow probably consented accordingly one day he invited or persuaded her to accompany him on his journey to the remote village and on the way he got her out of the cart and led her into a close thicket to show her something he had discovered there what he wished to show her according to one version of the story was a populous hornets nest and having got her there he suddenly flung her against it and made off leaving the cloud of infuriated hornets to sting her to death that night he slept at coombe or stayed till a very late hour at the widows cottage and told her what he had done in telling her he had spoken in his ordinary voice but by and by it occurred to him that the two boys who were sleeping close by in the livingroom might have been awake and listening she assured him that they were both fast asleep but he was not satisfied and said that if they had heard him he would kill them both as he had no wish to swing and he could not trust them to hold their tongues thereupon they got up and examined the faces of the two boys holding a candle over them and saw that they were in a deep sleep as was natural after their long days hard work on the farm and the murderers fears were set at rest yet one of the boys the younger had been wide awake all the time listening trembling with terror with wide eyes to the dreadful tale and only when they first became suspicious instinct came to his aid and closed his eyes and stilled his tremors and gave him the appearance of being asleep early next morning with his terror still on him he told what he had heard to his brother and by and by unable to keep the dreadful secret they related it to someonea carter or ploughman on the farm he in turn told the farmer who at once gave information and in a short time the man and woman were arrested in due time they were tried convicted and sentenced to be hanged in the parish where the crime had been committed  everybody was delighted and coombe most delighted of all for it happened that some of their wise people had been diligently examining into the matter and had made the discovery that the woman had been murdered just outside their borders in the adjoining parish of inkpen so that they were going to enjoy seeing the wicked punished at somebody elses expense inkpen was furious and swore that it would not be saddled with the cost of a great public double execution the line dividing the two parishes had always been a doubtful one now they were going to take the benefit of the doubt and let coombe hang its own miscreants  as neither side would yield the higher authorities were compelled to settle the matter for them and ordered the cost to be divided between the two parishes the gibbet to be erected on the boundary line as far as it could be ascertained this was accordingly done the gibbet being erected at the highest point crossed by the line on a stretch of beautiful smooth elastic turf among prehistoric earthworksa spot commanding one of the finest and most extensive views in southern england the day appointed for the execution brought the greatest concourse of people ever witnessed at that lofty spot at all events since prehistoric times if some of the ancient britons had come out of their graves to look on seated on their earthworks they would have probably rubbed their ghostly hands together and remarked to each other that it reminded them of old times all classes were there from the nobility and gentry on horseback and in great coaches in which they carried their own provisions to the meaner sort who had trudged from all the country round on foot and those who had not brought their own food and beer were catered for by traders in carts the crowd was a hilarious one and no doubt that grand picnic on the beacon was the talk of they country for a generation or longer the two wretches having been hanged in chains on one gibbet were left to be eaten by ravens crows and magpipes and dried by sun and winds until after long years the swinging creaking skeletons with their chains on fell to pieces and were covered with the turf but the gibbet itself was never removed  then a strange thing happened the sheep on a neighbouring farm became thin and sickly and yielded little wool and died before their time no remedies availed and the secret of their malady could not be discovered but it went on so long that the farmer was threatened with utter ruin then by chance it was discovered that the chains in which the murderers had been hanged had been thrown by some evilminded person into a dewpond on the farm this was taken to be the cause of the malady in the sheep at all events the chains having been taken out of the pond and buried deep in the earth the flock recovered it was supposed that the person who had thrown the chains in the water to poison it had done so to ruin the farmer in revenge for some injustice or grudge but even now we are not quite done with the gibbet many many years had gone by when inkpen discovered from old documents that their little dishonest neighbour coombe had taken more land than she was entitled to that not only a part but the whole of that noble hilltop belonged to her it was inkpens turn to chuckle now but she chuckled too soon and coombe running out to look found the old rotten stump of the gibbet still in the ground hands off she cried here stands a post which you set up yourself or which we put up together and agreed that this should be the boundary line for ever inkpen sneaked off to hide herself in her village and coombe determined to keep the subject in mind set up a brandnew stout gibbet in the place of the old rotting one that too decayed and fell to pieces in time and the present gibbet is therefore the third and nobody has ever been hanged on it coombe is rather proud of it but i am not sure that inkpen is  that was one of three strange events in the life of the village which i heard the other two must be passed by they would take long to tell and require a good pen to do them justice to me the best thing in or of the village was the vicar himself my putupon host a man of so blithe a nature so human and companionable that when i a perfect stranger without an introduction or any excuse for such intrusion came down like a wolf on his luncheontable he received me as if i had been an old friend or one of his own kindred and freely gave up his time to me for the rest of that day to count his years he was old he had been vicar of coombe for half a century but he was a young man still and had never had a days illness in his lifehe did not know what a headache was he smoked with me and to prove that he was not a total abstainer he drank my health in a glass of port winevery good wine it was coombe that did itits peaceful life isolated from a distracting world in that hollow hill and the marvellous purity of its air sitting there on my lawn he said you are six hundred feet above the sea although in a hollow four hundred feet deep it was an ideal openair room round and green with the sky for a roof in winter it was sometimes very cold and after a heavy fall of snow the scene was strange and impressive from the tiny village set in its stupendous dazzling white bowl not only on those rare arctic days but at all times it was wonderfully quiet the shout of a child or the peaceful crow of a cock was the loudest sound you heard once a gentleman from london town came down to spend a week at the parsonage towards evening on the very first day he grew restless and complained of the abnormal stillness i like a quiet place well enough he exclaimed but this tingling silence i cant stand and stand it he wouldnt and didnt for on the very next morning he took himself off many years had gone by but the vicar could not forget the londoner who had come down to invent a new way of describing the coombe silence his tingling phrase was a joy for ever  he took me to the churchone of the tiniest churches in the country just the right size for a church in a tiny village and assured me that he had never once locked the door in his fifty yearsday and night it was open to any one to enter it was a refuge and shelter from the storm and the tempest and many a poor homeless wretch had found a dry place to sleep in that church during the last half a century this mans feeling of pity and tenderness for the very poor even the outcast and tramp was a passion but how strange all this would sound in the ears of many country clergymen how many have told me when i have gone to the parsonage to borrow the key that it had been found necessary to keep the church door locked to prevent damage thefts etc have you never had anything stolen i asked him yes once a great many years ago the church plate had been taken away in the night but it was recovered the thief had taken it to the top of the hill and thrown it into the dewpond there no doubt intending to take it out and dispose of it at some more convenient time but it was found and had ever since then been kept safe at the vicarage nothing of value to tempt a man to steal was kept in the church he had never locked it but once in his fifty years it had been locked against him by the churchwardens this happened in the days of the joseph arch agitation when the agricultural labourers condition was being hotly discussed throughout the country the vicars heart was stirred for he knew better than most how hard these conditions were at coombe and in the surrounding parishes he took up the subject and preached on it in his own pulpit in a way that offended the landowners and alarmed the farmers in the district the church wardens who were farmers then locked him out of his church and for two or three weeks there was no public worship in the parish of coombe doubtless their action was applauded by all the substantial men in the neighbourhood the others who lived in the cottages and were unsubstantial didnt matter that storm blew over but its consequences endured one being that the inflammatory parson continued to be regarded with cold disapproval by the squires and their larger tenants but the vicar himself was unrepentant and unashamed on the contrary he gloried in what he had said and done and was proud to be able to relate that a quarter of a century later one of the two men who had taken that extreme course said to him we locked you out of your own church but years have brought me to another mind about that question i see it in a different light now and know that you were right and we were wrong  towards evening i said goodbye to my kind friend and entertainer and continued my rural ride from coombe it is five miles to hurstbourne tarrant another charming highland village and the road sloping down the entire distance struck me as one of the best to be on i had travelled in hampshire running along a narrow green valley with oak and birch and bramble and thorn in their late autumn colours growing on the slopes on either hand probably the beauty of the scene or the swift succession of beautiful scenes with the low sun flaming on the coloured shades served to keep out of my mind something that should have been in it at all events it was odd that i had more than once promised myself a visit to the very village i was approaching solely because william cobbett had described and often stayed in it and now no thought of him and his everdelightful rural rides was in my mind  arrived at the village i went straight to the george and dragon where a friend had assured me i could always find good accommodations but he was wrong there was no room for me i was told by a weirdlooking lean whitehaired old woman with whityblue unfriendly eyes she appeared to resent it that any one should ask for accommodation at such a time when the shooting gents from town required all the rooms available well i had to sleep somewhere i told her couldnt she direct me to a cottage where i could get a bed no she couldntit is always so but after the third time of asking she unfroze so far as to say that perhaps they would take me in at a cottage close by so i went and a poor kind widow who lived there with a son consented to put me up she made a nice fire in the sittingroom and after warming myself before it while watching the firelight and shadows playing on the dim walls and ceiling it came to me that i was not in a cottage but in a large room with an oak floor and wainscoting do you call this a cottage i said to the woman when she came in with tea no i have it as a cottage but it is an old farmhouse called the rookery she returned then for the first time i remembered rural rides this then is the very house where william cobbett used to stay seventy or eighty years ago i said she had never heard of william cobbett she only knew that at that date it had been tenanted by a farmer named blount a roman catholic who had some curious ideas about the land  that settled it blount was the name of cobbetts friend and i had come to the very house where cobbett was accustomed to stay but how odd that my first thought of the man should have come to me when sitting by the fire where cobbett himself had sat on many a cold evening and this was november the second the very day eightyodd years ago when he paid his first visit to the rookery at all events it is the first date he gives in rural rides and he too had been delighted with the place and the beauty of the surrounding country with the trees in their late autumn colours writing on november 2nd 1821 he says the place is commonly called uphusband which is i think as decent a corruption of names as one could wish to meet with however uphusband the people will have it and uphusband it shall be for me that is indeed how he names it all through his book after explaining that husband is a corruption of hurstbourne and that there are two hurstbournes this being the upper one  i congratulated myself on having been refused accommodation at the george and dragon and was more than satisfied to pass an evening without a book sitting there alone listening to an imaginary conversation between those two curious friends lord carnarvon says cobbett told a man in 1820 that he did not like my politics but what did he mean by my politics i have no politics but such as he ought to like to be sure i labour most assiduously to destroy a system of distress and misery but is that any reason why a lord should dislike my politics however dislike them or like them to them to those very politics the lords themselves must come at last  undoubtedly he talked like that just as he wrote and as he spoke in public his style if style it can be called being the most simple direct and colloquial ever written and for this reason when we are aweary of the style of the stylist where the living breathing body becomes of less consequence than its beautiful clothing it is a relief and refreshment to turn from the precious and delicate expression the implicit word sought for high and low and at last found the balance of every sentence and perfect harmony of the whole workto go from it to the simple vigorous unadorned talk of rural rides a classic and as incongruous among classics as a farmer in his smockfrock leggings and stout boots would appear in a company of fine gentlemen in fashionable dress the powerful face is the main thing and we think little of the frock and leggings and how the hair is parted or if parted at all harsh and crabbed as his nature no doubt was and bitter and spiteful at times his conversation must yet have seemed like a perpetual feast of honeyed sweets to his farmer friend doubtless there was plenty of variety in it now he would expatiate on the beauty of the green downs over which he had just ridden the wooded slopes in their glorious autumn colours and the rich villages between this would remind him of malthus that blasphemous monster who had dared to say that the increase in food production did not keep pace with increase of population then a quieting down a breathingspace all about the turnip crop the price of eggs at weyhill fair and the delights of hare coursing until politics would come round again and a fresh outburst from the glorious demagogue in his tantrums  at eight oclock cobbett would say good night and go to bed and early next morning write down what he had said to his friend or some of it and send it off to be printed in his paper that i take it is how rural rides was written and that is why it seems so fresh to us to this day and that to take it up after other books is like going out from a luxurious room full of fine company into the open air to feel the wind and rain on ones face and see the green grass but i very much regret that cobbett tells us nothing of his farmer friend blount i imagine must have been a man of a very fine character to have won the heart and influenced such a person cobbett never loses an opportunity of vilifying the parsons and expressing his hatred of the established church and yet albeit a protestant he invariably softens down when he refers to the roman catholic faith and appears quite capable of seeing the good that is in it  it was blount i think who had soothed the savage breast of the man in this matter the only thing i could hear about blount and his queer notions regarding the land was his idea that the soil could be improved by taking the flints out the soil to look upon cobbett truly says appears to be more than half flint but is a very good quality blount thought to make it better and for many years employed all the aged poor villagers and the children in picking the flints from the ploughed land and gathering them in vast heaps it does not appear that he made his land more productive but his hobby was a good one for the poor of the village the stones too proved useful afterwards to the roadmakers who have been using them these many years a few heaps almost clothed over with a turf which had formed on them in the course of eighty years were still to be seen on the land when i was there  the following day i took no ride the weather was so beautiful it seemed better to spend the time sitting or basking in the warmth and brightness or strolling about at all events it was a perfect day at hurstbourne tarrant though not everywhere for on that third of november the greatest portion of southern england was drowned in a cold dense white fog in london it was dark i heard early in the morning i listened to a cirlbunting singing merrily from a bush close to the george and dragon inn this charming bird is quite common in the neighbourhood although as elsewhere in england the natives know it not by its book name nor by any other and do not distinguish it from its less engaging cousin the yellowhammer  after breakfast i strolled about the common and in doles wood on the down above the village listening to the birds and on my way back encountered a tramp whose singular appearance produced a deep impression on my mind we have heard of a work by some modest pressman entitled monarchs i have met and i sometimes think that one equally interesting might be written on tramps i have met as i have neither time nor stomach for the task i will make a present of the title to any one of my fellowtravellers curious in tramps who cares to use it this makes two good titles i have given away in this chapter with a borrowed one  but if it had been possible for me to write such a book a prominent place would be given in it to the one tramp i have met who could be accurately described as gorgeous i did not cultivate his acquaintance chance threw us together and we separated after exchanging a few polite commonplaces but his big flamboyant image remains vividly impressed on my mind  at noon in the brilliant sunshine as i came loiteringly down the long slope from doles wood to the village he overtook me he was a huge man over six feet high nobly built suggesting a scandinavian origin with a broad blond face good features and prominent blue eyes and his hair was curly and shone like gold in the sunlight had he been a mere labourer in a workmans rough claystained clothes one would have stood still to look at and admire him and say perhaps what a magnificent warrior he would have looked with sword and spear and plumed helmet mounted on a big horse but alas he had the stamp of the irreclaimable blackguard on his face and that same handsome face was just then disfigured with several bruises in three coloursblue black and red doubtless he had been in a drunken brawl on the previous evening and had perhaps been thrown out of some low publichouse and properly punished  in his dress he was as remarkable as in his figure bright blue trousers much too small for his stout legs once the property no doubt of some sporting young gent of loud tastes in colours a spotted fancy waistcoat not long enough to meet the trousers a dirty scarlet tie long black frockcoat shiny in places and a small dirty grey cap which only covered the topmost part of his head of golden hair  walking by the hedgeside he picked and devoured the late blackberries which were still abundant it was a beautiful unkept hedge with scarlet and purple fruit among the manycoloured fading leaves and silvergrey down of oldmansbeard  i too picked and ate a few berries and made the remark that it was late to eat such fruit in november the devil in these parts i told him flies abroad in october to spit on the bramble bushes and spoil the fruit it was even worse further north in norfolk and suffolk where they say the devil goes out at michaelmas and shakes his verminous trousers over the bushes  he didnt smile he went on sternly eating blackberries and then remarked in a bitter tone that devil they talk about must have a busy time to go messing about blackberry bushes in addition to all his other important work  i was silent and presently after swallowing a few more berries he resumed in the same tone very fine very beautiful all thiswaving his hand to indicate the hedge its rich tangle of purplered stems and coloured leaves and scarlet fruit and silvery oldmansbeard an artist enjoys seeing this sort of thing and its nice for all those who go about just for the pleasure of seeing things but when it comes to a man tramping twenty or thirty miles a day on an empty belly looking for work which he cant find he doesnt see it quite in the same way  true i returned with indifference  but he was not to be put off by my sudden coldness and he proceeded to inform me that he had just returned from salisbury plain that it had been noised abroad that ten thousand men were wanted by the war office to work in forming new camps on arrival he found it was not soit was all a liemen were not wantedand he was now on his way to andover penniless and hungry and  by the time he had got to that part of his story we were some distance apart as i had remained standing still while he thinking me still close behind had gone on picking blackberries and talking he was soon out of sight  at noon the following day the weather still being bright and genial i went to crux easton a hilltop village consisting of some low farm buildings cottages and a church not much bigger than a cottage a great house probably once existed here as the hill has a noble avenue of limes which it wears like a comb or crest on the lower slope of the hill the old unkept hedges were richer in colour than in most places owing to the abundance of the spindlewood tree laden with its loose clusters of flamebright purplepink and orange berries  here i saw a pretty thing a cock cirlbunting his yellow breast towards me sitting quietly on a large bush of these same brilliant berries set amidst a mass of splendidly coloured hazel leaves mixed with bramble and tangled with ivy and silvergrey travellersjoy an artists heart would have leaped with joy at the sight but all his skill and oriental colours would have made nothing of it for all visible nature was part of the picture the wide wooded earth and the blue sky beyond and above the bird and the sunshine that glorified all  on the other side of the hedge there were groups of fine old beech trees and strange to see just beyond the green slope and coloured trees was the great whiteness of the fog which had advanced thus far and now appeared motionless i went down and walked by the side of the bank of mist feeling its clammy coldness on one cheek while the other was fanned by the warm bright air seen at a distance of a couple of hundred yards the appearance was that of a beautiful pearlywhite cloud resting upon the earth many fogs had i seen but never one like this so substantiallooking so sharply defined standing like a vast white wall or flattopped hill at the foot of the green sunlit slope i had the fancy that if i had been an artist in sculpture and rapid modeller by using the edge of my hand as a knife i could have roughly carved out a human figure then drawing it gently out of the mass proceeded to press and work it to a better shape the shape let us say of a beautiful woman then if it were done excellently and some manmocking deity or power of the air happened to be looking on he would breathe life and intelligence into it and send it or her abroad to mix with human kind and complicate their affairs for she would seem a woman and would be like some women we have known beautiful with blue flowerlike eyes pale gold or honeycoloured hair very white of skin leightonian almost diaphanous so delicate as to make all other skins appear coarse and made of clay and with her beauty and a mysterious sweetness not of the heart since no heart there would be in that mistcold body she would draw all hearts ever inspiring but never satisfying passion her beauty and alluring smiles being but the brightness of a cloud on which the sun is shining  birds driven by the fog to that sunlit spot were all about me in incredible numbers rooks and daws were congregating on the bushes where their black figures served to intensify the redgold tints of the foliage at intervals the entire vast cawing multitude simultaneously rose up with a sound as of many waters and appeared now at last about to mount up into the blue heavens to float circling there far above the world as they are accustomed to do on warm windless days in autumn but in a little while their brave note would change to one of trouble the sight of that immeasurable whiteness covering so much of the earth would scare them and led by hundreds of clamouring daws they would come down again to settle once more in black masses on the shining yellow trees  close by a ploughed field of about forty acres was the campingground of an army of peewits they were travellers from the north perhaps and were quietly resting sprinkled over the whole area more abundant were the small birds in mixed flocks or hordesfinches buntings and larks in thousands on thousands with a sprinkling of pipits and pied and grey wagtails all busily feeding on the stubble and fresh ploughed land thickly and evenly distributed they appeared to the vision ranging over the brown level expanse as minute animated and variously coloured clodsblack and brown and grey and yellow and olivegreen  it was a rare pleasure to be in this company to revel in their astonishing numbers to feast my soul on them as it werelittle birds in such multitudes that ten thousand frenchmen and italians might have gorged to repletion on their small succulent bodiesand to reflect that they were safe from persecution so long as they remained here in england this is something for an englishman to be proud of  after spending two hours at crux easton with that dense immovable fog close by i at length took the plunge to get to highclere what a change i was at once where all form and colour and melody had been blotted out my clothes were hoary with clinging mist my fingers numb with cold and highclere its scattered cottages appearing like dim smudges through the whiteness was the dreariest village on earth i fled on to newbury in quest of warmth and light and found it indoors but the town was deep in the fog  the next day i ventured out again to look for the sun and found it not but my ramble was not without its reward in a pine wood three miles from the town i stood awhile to listen to the sound as of copious rain of the moisture dropping from the trees when a sudden tempest of loud sharp metallic notesa sound dear to the ornithologists earsmade me jump and down into the very tree before which i was standing dropped a flock of about twenty crossbills so excited and noisy when coming down the instant they touched the tree they became perfectly silent and motionless seven of their number had settled on the outside shoots and sat there within forty feet of me looking like painted wooden images of small green and greenishyellow parrots for a space of fifteen minutes not the slightest movement did they make and at length before going i waved my arms about and shouted to frighten them and still they refused to stir  next morning that memorable fog lifted to englands joy and quitting my refuge i went out once more into the region of high sheepwalks adorned with beechen woods and travellersjoy in the hedges rambling by highclere burghclere and kingsclere the lasthampshires little cuzcois a small and villagelike old red brick town unapproached by a railroad and unimproved therefore still beautiful as were all places in other better less civilized days here in the late afternoon a chilly grey haze crept over the country and set me wishing for a fireside and the sound of friendly voices and i turned my face towards beloved silchester leaving the hills behind me i got away from the haze and went my devious way by serpentine roads through a beautiful wooded undulating country and i wish that for a hundred nay for a thousand years to come i could on each recurring november have such an afternoon ride with that autumnal glory in the trees sometimes seeing the road before me carpeted with pure yellow i said to myself now i am coming to elms but when the road shone red and russetgold before me i knew it was overhung by beeches but the oak is the common tree in this place and from every high point on the road i saw far before me and on either hand the woods and copses all a tawny yellow goldthe hue of the dying oak leaf the tall larches were lemonyellow and when growing among tall pines produced a singular effect best of all was it where beeches grew among the firs and the low sun on my left hand shining through the wood gave the coloured translucent leaves an unimaginable splendour this was the very effect which men inspired by a sacred passion had sought to reproduce in their noblest workthe gothic cathedral and church its dim interior lit by manycoloured stained glass the only choristers in these natural fanes were the robins and the small lyrical wren but on passing through the rustic village of wolverton i stopped for a couple of minutes to listen to the lively strains of a cirlbunting among some farm buildings  then on to silchester its furzy common and scattered village and the vast ruinous walls overgrown with ivy bramble and thorn of ancient roman calleva inside the walls at one spot a dozen men were still at work in the fading light they were just finishingshovelling earth in to obliterate all that had been opened out during the year the old flint foundations that had been revealed the houses with porches and corridors and courtyards and pillared hypocausts the winter room with its wide beautiful floorred and black and white and grey and yellow with geometric pattern and twist and scroll and flower and leaf and quaint figures of man and beast and birdall to be covered up with earth so that the plough may be driven over it again and the wheat grow and ripen again as it has grown and ripened there above the dead city for so many centuries the very earth within those walls had a reddish cast owing to the innumerable fragments of red tile and tessera mixed with it larks and finches were busily searching for seeds in the reddishbrown soil they would soon be gone to their roostingplaces and the tired men to their cottages and the white owl coming from his hidingplace in the walls would have old silchester to himself as he has had it since the cries and moans of the conquered died into silence so long ago     chapter ten the last of his name   i came by chance to the villagenorton we will call it just to call it something but the county in which it is situated need not be named it happened that about noon that day i planned to pass the night at a village where as i was informed at a small country town i had rested in there was a nice innthe fox and grapesto put up at but when i arrived tired and hungry i was told that i could not have a bed and that the only thing to do was to try norton which also boasted an inn it was hard to have to turn some two or three miles out of my road at that late hour on a chance of a shelter for the night but there was nothing else to do so on to norton i went with heavy steps and arrived a little after sunset more tired and hungry than ever only to be told at the inn that they had no accommodation for me that their one spare room had been engaged what am i to do then i demanded of the landlord beyond this village i cannot go tonightdo you want me to go out and sleep under a hedge he called his spouse and after some conversation they said the village baker might be able to put me up as he had a spare bedroom in his house so to the bakers i went and found it a queer ramshackle old place standing a little back from the village street in a garden and green plot with a few fruit trees growing on it to my knock the baker himself came outa mildlooking flabbyfaced man with his mouth full in a very loose suit of pyjamalike garments of a bluish floury colour i told him my story and he listened swallowing his mouthful then cast his eyes down and rubbed his chin which had a small tuft of hairs growing on it and finally said i dont know i must ask my wife but come in and have a cup of teawere just having a cup ourselves and perhaps youd like one  i could have told him that i should like a dozen cups and a great many slices of breadandbutter if there was nothing else more substantial to be had however i only said thank you and followed him in to where his wife a nicelooking woman with black hair and olive face was seated behind the teapot imagine my surprise when i found that besides tea there was a big hot repast on the tablea ham a roast fowl potatoes and cabbage a rice pudding a dish of stewed fruit breadandbutter and other things  you call this a cup of tea i exclaimed delightedly the woman laughed and he explained in an apologetic way that he had formerly suffered grievously from indigestion so that for many years his life was a burden to him until he discovered that if he took one big meal a day after the work was over he could keep perfectly well  i was never hungrier than on this evening and never i think ate a bigger or more enjoyable meal nor have i ever ceased to remember those two with gratitude and if i were to tell here what they told methe history of their two livesi think it would be a more interesting story than the one i am about to relate i stayed a whole week in their hospitable house a week which passed only too quickly for never had i been in a sweeter haunt of peace than this village in a quiet green country remote from towns and stations it was a small rustic place a few old houses and thatched cottages and the ancient church with square norman tower hard to see amid the immense old oaks and elms that grew all about it at the end of the village were the park gates and the park a solitary green place with noble trees was my favourite haunt for there was no one to forbid me the squire being dead the old red elizabethan house empty with only a caretaker in the gardeners lodge to mind it and the estate for sale three years it had been in that condition but nobody seemed to want it occasionally some important person came rushing down in a motorcar but after running over the house he would come out and remarking that it was a rummy old place remount his car and vanish in a cloud of dust to be seen no more  the dead owner i found was much in the village mind and no wonder since norton had never been without a squire until he passed away leaving no one to succeed him it was as if some ancient landmark or an immemorial oak tree on the green in whose shade the villagers had been accustomed to sit for many generations had been removed there was a sense of something wanting something gone out of their lives moreover he had been a man of a remarkable character and though they never loved him they yet reverenced his memory  so much was he in their minds that i could not be in the village and not hear the story of his lifethe story which i said interested me less than that of the good baker and his wife on his fathers death at a very advanced age he came a comparative stranger to norton the first half of his life having been spent abroad he was then a middleaged man unmarried and a bachelor he remained to the end he was of a reticent disposition and was said to be proud formal almost cold in manner furthermore he did not share his neighbours love of sport of any description nor did he care for society and because of all this he was regarded as peculiar not to say eccentric but he was deeply interested in agriculture especially in cattle and their improvement and that object grew to be his master passion it was a period of great depression and as his farms fell vacant he took them into his own hands increased his stock and built model cowhouses and came at last to be known throughout his own country and eventually everywhere as one of the biggest cattlebreeders in england but he was famous in a peculiar way wise breeders and buyers shook their heads and even touched their foreheads significantly and predicted that the squire of norton would finish by ruining himself they were right he ruined himself not that he was mentally weaker than those who watched and cunningly exploited him he was ruined because his object was a higher one than theirs he saw clearly that the prize system is a vicious one and that better results may be obtained without it he proved this at a heavy cost by breeding better beasts than his rivals who were all exhibitors and prizewinners and who by this means got their advertisements and secured the highest prices while he who disdained prizes and looked with disgust at the overfed and polished animals at shows got no advertisements and was compelled to sell at unremunerative prices the buyers it may be mentioned were always the breeders for shows and they made a splendid profit out of it  he carried on the fight for a good many years becoming more and more involved until his creditors took possession of the estate sold off the stock let the farms and succeeded in finding a tenant for the furnished house he went to a cottage in the village and there passed his remaining years to the world he appeared unmoved by his reverses the change from mansion and park to a small thatched cottage with a labourers wife for attendant made no change in the man nor did he resign his seat on the bench of magistrates or any other unpaid office he held to the last he was what he had always been formal and ceremonious more gracious to those beneath him than to equals strict in the performance of his duties living with extreme frugality and giving freely to those in want and very regular in his attendance at church where he would sit facing the tombs and memorials of his ancestors among the people but not of thema man alone and apart respected by all but loved by none  finally he died and was buried with the others and one more memorial with the old name which he bore last was placed on the wall that was the story as it was told me and as it was all about a man who was without charm and had no love interest it did not greatly interest me and i soon dismissed it from my thoughts then one day coming through a grove in the park and finding myself standing before the ancient empty desolate housefor on the squires death everything had been sold and taken awayi remembered that the caretaker had begged me to let him show me over the place i had not felt inclined to gratify him as i had found him a young man of a too active mind whose only desire was to capture some person to talk to and unfold his original ideas and schemes but now having come to the house i thought i would suffer him and soon found him at work in the vast old walled garden he joyfully threw down his spade and let me in and then up to the top floor determined that i should see everything by the time we got down to the ground floor i was pretty tired of empty rooms oak panelled and passages and oak staircases and of talk and impatient to get away but no i had not seen the housekeepers roomi must see thatand so into another great vacant room i was dragged and to keep me as long as possible in that last room he began unlocking and flinging open all the old oak cupboards and presses glancing round at the long array of empty shelves i noticed a small brownpaper parcel thick with dust in a corner and as it was the only movable thing i had seen in that vacant house i asked him what the parcel contained books he repliedthey had been left as of no value when the house was cleared of furniture as i wished to see the books he undid the parcel it contained forty copies of a small quartoshaped book of sonnets with the late squires name as author on the title page i read a sonnet and told him i should like to read them all you can have a copy of course he exclaimed put it in your pocket and keep it when i asked him if he had any right to give one away he laughed and said that if any one had thought the whole parcel worth twopence it would not have been left behind he was quite right a cracked dinnerplate or a saucepan with a hole in it or an earthenware teapot with a broken spout would not have been left but the line was drawn at a book of sonnets by the late squire nobody wanted it and so without more qualms i put it in my pocket and have it before me now opened at page 63 on which appears without a headline the sonnet i first read and which i quote     how beautiful are birds of gods sweet air      free denizens no ugly earthly spot      their boundless happiness doth seem to blot    the swallow swiftly flying here and there    can it be true that dreary household care      doth goad her to incessant flight      if not how can it be that she doth cast her lot    now there now here pursuing summer everywhere      i sadly fear that shallow tiny brain    is not exempt from anxious cares and fears      that mingled heritage of joy and pain    that for some reason everywhere appears      and yet those birds how beautiful they are      sure beauty is to happiness no bar  this has a fault that doth offend the reader of modern verse and there are many of the eighty sonnets in the book which do not equal it in merit he was manifestly an amateur he sometimes writes with labour and he not infrequently ends with the unpardonable weak line nevertheless he had rightly chosen this difficult form in which to express his inner self it suited his grave concentrated thought and each little imperfect poem of fourteen lines gives us a glimpse into a wise beneficent mind he had fought his fight and suffered defeat and had then withdrawn himself silently from the field to die but if he had been embittered he could have relieved himself in this little book there is no trace of such a feeling he only asks in one sonnet where can a balm be found for the heart fretted and torn with eternal cares when we have thought and striven for some great and good purpose when all our striving has ended in disaster his plan he concludes is to go out in the quiet nighttime and look at the stars  here let me quote two more sonnets written in contemplative mood just to give the reader a fuller idea not of the verse as verse but of the spirit in the old squire there is no title to these two     i like a fire of wood there is a kind      of artless poetry in all its ways      when first tis lighted how it roars and plays    and sways to every breath its flames refined    by fancy to some shape by life confined      and then how touching are its latter days      when all its strength decayed and spent the blaze    of fiery youth grey ash is all we find      perhaps we know the tree of which the pile    once formed a part and oft beneath its shade      have sported in our youth or in quaint style       have carved upon its rugged bark a name       of which the memory doth alone remain    a memory doomed alas in turn to fade  bad enough as verse the critic will say refined confined findwhat poor rhymes are these and he will think me wrong to draw these frailties from their forgotten abode but i like to think of the solitary old man sitting by his wood fire in the old house not brooding bitterly on his frustrate life but putting his quiet thoughts into the form of a sonnet the other is equally goodor bad if the critic will have it so     the clock had just struck five and all was still      within my house when straight i open threw      with eager hand the casement dim with dew    oh what a glorious flush of light did fill    that old staircase  and then and there did kill      all those black doubts that ever do renew      their civil war with all thats good and true    within our hearts when body and mind are ill      from this slight incident i would infer      a cheerful truth that men without demur    in times of stress and doubt throw open wide    the windows of their breast nor stung by pride      in stifling darkness gloomily abide      but bid the light flow in on either side  a slight incident and a beautiful thought but all i have so far said about the little book is preliminary to what i wish to say about another sonnet which must also be quoted it is perhaps as a sonnet as ill done as the others but the subject of it specially attracted me as it happened to be one which was much in my mind during my weeks stay at norton that remote little village without a squire or any person of means or education in or near it capable of feeling the slightest interest in the people except the parson an old infirm man who was never seen but once a weekhow wanting in some essential thing it appeared it seemed to me that the one thing which might be done in these small centres of rural life to brighten and beautify existence is precisely the thing which is never done also that what really is being done is of doubtful value and sometimes actually harmful  leaving norton one day i visited other small villages in the neighbourhood and found they were no better off i had heard of the rector of one of these villages as a rather original man and went and discussed the subject with him it is quite useless thinking about it he said the people here are clods and will not respond to any effort you can make to introduce a little light and sweetness into their lives there was no more to be said to him but i knew he was wrong i found the villagers in that part of the country the most intelligent and responsive people of their class i had ever encountered it was a delightful experience to go into their cottages not to read them a homily or to present them with a book or a shilling nor to inquire into their welfare material and spiritual but to converse intimately with a human interest in them as would be the case in a country where there are no caste distinctions it was delightful because they were so responsive so sympathetic so alive now it was just at this time when the subject was in my mind that the book of sonnets came into my handsgiven to me by the generous caretakerand i read in it this one on innocent amusements     there lacks a something to complete the round      of our fair englands homely happiness      a something yet how oft do trifles bless    when greater gifts by far redound    to honours lone but no responsive sound      of joy or mirth awake nay oft oppress      while gifts of which we scarce the moment guess    in neverfailing joys abound    no nation can be truly great      that hath not something childlike in its life      of every day it should its youth renew    with simple joys that sweetly recreate      the jaded mind conjoined in friendly strife      the pleasures of its childhood days pursue  what wise and kindly thoughts he hadthe old squire of norton surely when telling me the story of his life they had omitted something i questioned them on the point did he not in all the years he was at norton house and later when he lived among them in a cottage in the villagedid he not go into their homes and meet them as if he knew and felt that they were all of the same flesh children of one universal father and did he not make them feel this about himthat the differences in fortune and position and education were mere accidents and the answer was no certainly not as if i had asked a preposterous question he was the squire a gentlemanany one might understand that he could not come among them like that that is what a parson can do because he is so to speak paid to keep an eye on them and besides its religion there and a different thing but the squiretheir squire that dignified old gentleman so upright in his saddle so considerate and courteous to every onebut he never forgot his positionnever in that way i also asked if he had never tried to establish or advocated or suggested to them any kind of reunions to take place from time to time or an entertainment or festival to get them to come pleasantly together making a brightness in their livessomething which would not be cricket or football nor any form of sport for a few of the men all the others being mere lookerson and the women and children left out altogether something which would be for and include everyone from the oldest grey labourer no longer able to work to the toddling little ones something of their own invention peculiar to norton which would be their pride and make their village dearer to them and the answer was still no and no and no he had never attempted never suggested anything of the sort how could hethe squire yet he wrote those wise words     no nation can be truly great      that hath not something childlike in its life      of every day  why are we lacking in that which others undoubtedly have a something to complete the round of homely happiness in our little rural centres how is it that we do not properly encourage the things which albeit childlike are essential which sweetly recreate it is not merely the selfishness of those who are well placed and prefer to live for themselves or who have light but care not to shed it on those who are not of their class selfishness is common enough everywhere in men of all races it is not selfishness nor the growth of towns or decay of agriculture which as a fact does not decay nor education nor any of the other causes usually given for the dullness the greyness of village life the chief cause i take it is that gulf or barrier which exists between men and men in different classes in our country or a considerable portion of itthe caste feeling which is becoming increasingly rigid in the rural world if my own observation extending over a period of twentyfive years is not all wrong     chapter eleven salisbury and its doves   never in my experience has there been a worse spring season than that of 1903 for the birds more especially for the shortwinged migrants in april i looked for the woodland warblers and found them not or saw but a few of the commonest kinds it was only too easy to account for this rarity the bitter northeast wind had blown every day and all day long during those weeks when birds are coming and when nearing the end of their journey at its most perilous stage the wind had been dead against them its coldness and force was too much for these delicate travellers and doubtless they were beaten down in thousands into the grey waters of a bitter sea the strongerwinged wheatear was more fortunate since he comes in march and before that spell of deadly weather he was already back in his breeding haunts on salisbury plain and in fact everywhere on that open down country i was there to hear him sing his wild notes to the listening wastesinging them as his pretty fashion is up in the air suspended on quickly vibrating wings like a great black and white moth but he was in no singing mood and at last in desperation i fled to salisbury to wait for loitering spring in that unattractive town  the streets were cold as the open plain and there was no comfort indoors to haunt the cathedral during those vacant days was the only occupation left to me there was some shelter to be had under the walls and the empty vast interior would seem almost cosy on coming in from the wind at service my due feet never failed while morning noon and evening i paced the smooth level green by the hour standing at intervals to gaze up at the immense pile with its central soaring spire asking myself why i had never greatly liked it in the past and did not like it much better now when grown familiar with it undoubtedly it is one of the noblest structures of its kind in englandeven my eyes that look coldly on most buildings could see it and i could admire even reverence but could not love it suffers by comparison with other temples into which my soul has wandered it has not the majesty and appearance of immemorial age the dim religious richness of the interior with much else that goes to make up without and within the expression which is so marked in other mediaeval faneswinchester ely york canterbury exeter and wells to the dry mechanical mind of the architect these great cathedrals are in the highest degree imperfect according to the rules of his art to all others this imperfectness is their chief excellence and glory for they are in a sense a growth a flower of many minds and many periods and are imperfect even as nature is in her rocks and trees and being in harmony with nature and like nature they are inexpressibly beautiful and satisfying beyond all buildings to the aesthetic as well as to the religious sense  occasionally i met and talked with an old man employed at the cathedral one day closing one eye and shading the other with his hand he gazed up at the building for some time and then remarked ill tell you whats wrong with salisburyit looks too noo he was near the mark the fault is that to the professional eye it is faultless the lack of expression is due to the fact that it came complete from its makers brain like a coin from the mint and being all on one symmetrical plan it has the trim neat appearance of a toy cathedral carved out of wood and set on a greenpainted square  after all my thoughts and criticisms on the cathedral as a building were merely incidental my serious business was with the feathered people to be seen there few in the woods and fewer on the windy downs here birds were abundant not only on the building where they were like seafowl congregated on a precipitous rock but they were all about me the level green was the hunting ground of many thrushesa dozen or twenty could often be seen at one timeand it was easy to spot those that had young the worm they dragged out was not devoured another was looked for then another then all were cut up in proper lengths and beaten and bruised and finally packed into a bundle and carried off rooks too were there breeding on the cathedral elms and had no time and spirit to wrangle but could only cawcaw distressfully at the wind which tossed them hither and thither in the air and lashed the tall trees threatening at each fresh gust to blow their nests to pieces small birds of half a dozen kinds were also there and one tinkletinkled his spring song quite merrily in spite of the cold that kept the others silent and made me blue one day i spied a big queen bumblebee on the ground looking extremely conspicuous in its black and chestnut coat on the fresh green sward and thinking it numbed by the cold i picked it up it moved its legs feebly but alas its enemy had found and struck it down and with its hard sharp little beak had drilled a hole in one of the upper plates of its abdomen and from that small opening had cunningly extracted all the meat though still alive it was empty as a blown eggshell poor queen and mother you survived the winter in vain and went abroad in vain in the bitter weather in quest of bread to nourish your few firstbornthe grubs that would help you by and by now there will be no bread for them and for you no populous city in the flowery earth and a great crowd of children to rise up each day when days are long to call you blessed and he who did this thing the unspeakable oxeye with his black and yellow breastcatanic black and ambereven while i made my lamentation was tinkling his merry song overhead in the windy elms  the birds that lived on the huge cathedral itself had the greatest attraction for me and here the daws if not the most numerous were the most noticeable as they ever are on account of their conspicuousness in their black plumage their loquacity and everlasting restlessness far up on the ledge from which the spire rises a kestrel had found a cosy corner in which to establish himself and one day when i was there a number of daws took it on themselves to eject him they gathered near and flew this way and that and cawed and cawed in anger and swooped at him until he could stand their insults no longer and suddenly dashing out he struck and buffeted them right and left and sent them screaming with fear in all directions after this they left him in peace they had forgotten that he was a hawk and that even the gentle mousing windhover has a nobler spirit than any crow of them all  on first coming to the cathedral i noticed a few pigeons sitting on the roof and ledges very high up and not seeing them well i assumed that they were of the common or domestic kind by and by one cooed then another and recognizing the stockdove note i began to look carefully and found that all the birds on the buildingabout thirty pairswere of this species it was a great surprise for though we occasionally find a pair of stockdoves breeding on the ivied wall of some inhabited mansion in the country it was a new thing to find a considerable colony of this shy woodland species established on a building in a town they lived and bred there just as the common pigeonthe varicoloured descendant of the blue rockdoes on st pauls the law courts and the british museum in london only unlike our metropolitan doves both the domestic kind and the ringdove in the parks the salisbury doves though in the town are not of it they come not down to mix with the currents of human life in the streets and open spaces they fly away to the country to feed and dwell on the cathedral above the houses and people just as seabirdskittiwake and guillemot and gannetdwell on the ledges of some vast oceanfronting cliff  the old man mentioned above told me that the birds were called rocks by the townspeople also that they had been there for as long as he could remember six or seven years ago he said when the repairs to the roof and spire were started the pigeons began to go away until there was not one left the work lasted three years and immediately on its conclusion the doves began to return and were now as numerous as formerly how i inquired did these innocent birds get on with their black neighbours seeing that the daw is a cunning creature much given to persecutiona crow in fact as black as any of his family they got on badly he said the doves were early breeders beginning in march and were allowed to have the use of the holes until the daws wanted them at the end of april when they forcibly ejected the young doves he said that in spring he always picked up a good many young doves often unfledged thrown down by the dawn i did not doubt his story i had just found a young bird myselfa little blueskinned yellowmouthed fledgling which had fallen sixty or seventy feet on to the gravel below but in june he said when the daws brought off their young the doves entered into possession once more and were then permitted to rear their young in peace  i returned to salisbury about the middle of may in better weather when there were days that were almost genial and found the cathedral a greater habitacle of birds than ever starlings swifts and swallows were there the lively little martins in hundreds and the doves and daws in their usual numbers all appeared to be breeding and for some time i saw no quarreling at length i spied a pair of doves with a nest in a small cavity in the stone at the back of a narrow ledge about seventy feet from the ground and by standing back some distance i could see the hen bird sitting on the nest while the cock stood outside on the ledge keeping guard i watched this pair for some hours and saw a jackdaw sweep down on them a dozen or more times at long intervals sometimes after swooping down he would alight on the ledge a yard or two away and the male dove would then turn and face him and if he then began sidling up the dove would dash at and buffet him with his wings with the greatest violence and throw him off when he swooped closer the dove would spring up and meet him in the air striking him at the moment of meeting and again the daw would be beaten when i left three days after witnessing this contest the doves were still in possession of their nest and i concluded that they were not so entirely at the mercy of the jackdaw as the old man had led me to believe  it was on this occasion a great pleasure to listen to the doves the stockdove has no set song like the ringdove but like all the other species in the typical genus columba it has the cooing or family note one of the most humanlike sounds which birds emit in the stockdove this is a better more musical and a more varied sound than in any other columba known to me the pleasing quality of the sound as well as the variety in it could be well noted here where the birds were many scattered about on ledges and projections high above the earth and when bird after bird uttered its plaint each repeating his note half a dozen to a dozen times one in slow measured time and deepvoiced like the rockdove but more musical another rapidly with shorter impetuous notes in a higher key as if carried away by excitement there were not two birds that cooed in precisely the same way and the same bird would often vary its manner of cooing  it was best to hear them during the afternoon service in the cathedral when the singing of the choir and throbbing and pealing of the organ which filled the vast interior was heard outside subdued by the walls through which it passed and was like a beautiful mist or atmosphere of sound pervading and enveloping the great building and when the plaining of the doves owing to the rhythmic flow of the notes and their human characters seemed to harmonize with and be a part of that sacred music     chapter twelve whitesheet hill   on easter saturday the roadsides and copses by the little river nadder were full of children gathering primroses they might have filled a thousand baskets without the flowers being missed so abundant were they in that place cold though it was the whole air was laden with the delicious fragrance it was pleasant to see and talk with the little people occupied with the task they loved so well and i made up my mind to see the result of all this flowergathering next day in some of the village churches in the neighbourhoodfovant teffant evias chilmark swallowcliffe tisbury and fonthill bishop i had counted on some improvement in the weathersome bright sunshine to light up the flowerdecorated interiors but easter sunday proved colder than ever with the bitter northeast still blowing the grey travelling cloud still covering the sky and so to get the full benefit of the bitterness i went instead to spend my day on the top of the biggest down above the valley that was whitesheet hill and forms the highest part of the long ridge dividing the valleys of the ebble and nadder  it was roughest and coldest up there and suited my temper best for when the weather seems spiteful one finds a grim sort of satisfaction in defying it on a genial day it would have been very pleasant on that lofty plain for the flat top of the vast down is like a plain in appearance and the earthworks on it show that it was once a populous habitation of man now because of the wind and cloud its aspect was bare and bleak and desolate and after roaming about for an hour exploring the thickest furze patches i began to think that my day would have to be spent in solitude without a living creature to keep me company the birds had apparently all been blown away and the rabbits were staying at home in their burrows not even an insect could i see although the furze was in full blossom the honeysuckers were out of sight and torpid and the bloom itself could no longer look unprofitably gay as the poet says it does not even a wheatear i said for i had counted on that bird in the intervals between the storms although i knew i should not hear his wild delightful warble in such weather  then all at once i beheld that very bird a solitary female flittering on over the flat ground before me perching on the little green antmounds and flirting its tail and bobbing as if greatly excited at my presence in that lonely place i wondered where its mate was following it from place to place as it flew determined now i had found a bird to keep it in sight presently a great blackness appeared low down in the cloudy sky and rose and spread travelling fast towards me and the little wheatear fled in fear from it and vanished from sight over the rim of the down but i was there to defy the weather and so instead of following the bird in search of shelter i sat down among some low furze bushes and waited and watched by and by i caught sight of three magpies rising one by one at long intervals from the furze and flying laboriously towards a distant hilltop grove of pines then i heard the wailing cry of a peewit and caught sight of the bird at a distance and soon afterwards a sound of another characterthe harsh angry cry of a carrion crow almost as deep as the ravens angry voice before long i discovered the bird at a great height coming towards me in hot pursuit of a kestrel they passed directly over me so that i had them a long time in sight the kestrel travelling quietly on in the face of the wind the crow toiling after and at intervals spurting till he got near enough to hurl himself at his enemy emitting his croaks of rage for invariably the kestrel with one of his sudden swallowlike turns avoided the blow and went on as before i watched them until they were lost to sight in the coming blackness and wondered that so intelligent a creature as a crow should waste his energies in that vain chase still one could understand it and even sympathize with him for the kestrel is a most insulting creature towards the bigger birds he knows that they are incapable of paying him out and when he finds them off their guard he will drop down and inflict a blow just for the fun of the thing this outraged crow appeared determined to have his revenge  then the storm broke on me and so fiercely did the rain and sleet thrash me that fearing a cold soaking i fled before it to the rim of the plain where the wheatear had vanished and saw a couple of hundred yards down on the smooth steep slope a thicket of dwarf trees it was the only shelter in sight and to it i went to discover much to my disgust that the trees were nothing but elders for there is no tree that affords so poor a shelter especially on the high open downs where the foliage is scantier than in other situations and lets in the wind and rain in full force upon you  but the elder affects me in two ways i like it on account of early associations and because the birds delight in its fruit though they wisely refuse to build in its branches and i dislike it because its smell is offensive to me and its berries the least pleasant of all wild fruits to my taste i can eat ivyberries in march and yew in its season poison or not and hips and haws and hollyberries and harsh acorn and the rowan which some think acrid but the elderberry i cant stomach  how comes it i have asked more than once that this poor tree is so often seen on the downs where it is so badly fitted to be and makes so sorry an appearance with its weak branches broken and its soft leaves torn by the winds how badly it contrasts with the other trees and bushes that flourish on the downsfurze juniper holly blackthorn and hawthorn  two years ago one day in the early spring i was walking on an extensive down in another part of wiltshire with the tenant of the land who began there as a large sheepfarmer but eventually finding that he could make more with rabbits than with sheep turned most of his land into a warren the higher part of this down was overgrown with furze mixed with holly and other bushes but the slopes were mostly very bare at one spot on a wide bare slope where the rabbits had formed a big group of burrows there was a close little thicket of young elder trees looking exceedingly conspicuous in the bright green of early april calling my companions attention to this little thicket i said something about the elder growing on the open downs where it always appeared to be out of harmony with its surroundings i dont suppose you planted elders here i said  no but i know who did he returned and he then gave me this curious history of the trees five years before the rabbits finding it a suitable spot to dig in probably because of a softer chalk there made a number of deep burrows at that spot when the wheatears or horsemaggers as he called them returned in spring two or three pairs attached themselves to this group of burrows and bred in them there was that season a solitary elderbush higher up on the down among the furze which bore a heavy crop of berries and when the fruit was ripe he watched the birds feeding on it the wheatears among them the following spring seedlings came up out of the loose earth heaped about the rabbit burrows and as they were not cut down by the rabbits for they dislike the elder they grew up and now formed a clump of fifty or sixty little trees of six feet to eight feet in height  who would have thought to find a treeplanter in the wheatear the bird of the stony waste and open naked down who does not even ask for a bush to perch on  it then occurred to me that in every case where i had observed a clump of elder bushes on the bare downside it grew upon a village or collection of rabbit burrows and it is probable that in every case the clump owed its existence to the wheatears who had dropped the seed about their nestingplace the clump where i had sought a shelter from the storm was composed of large old dilapidatedlooking halfdead elders perhaps their age was not above thirty or forty years but they looked older than hawthorns of one or two centuries and under them the rabbits had their diggingshuge old mounds and burrows that looked like a badgers earth here too the burrows had probably existed first and had attracted the wheatears and the birds had brought the seed from some distant bush  crouching down in one of the big burrows at the roots of an old elder i remained for half an hour listening to the thumpthump of the alarmed rabbits about me and the accompanying hiss and swish of the wind and sleet and rain in the ragged branches  the storm over i continued my rambles on whitesheet hill and coming back an hour or two later to the very spot where i had seen and followed the wheatear i all at once caught sight of a second bird lying dead on the turf close to my feet the sudden sight gave me a shock of astonishment mingled with admiration and grief for how pretty it looked though dead lying on its back the little black legs stuck stiffly up the long wings pressed against the sides their black tips touching together like the clasped hands of a corpse and the fanlike black and white tail half open as in life moved perpetually up and down by the wind as if that tailflirting action of the bird had continued after death it was very beautiful in its delicate shape and pale harmonious colouring resting on the goldengreen mossy turf and it was a male undoubtedly the mate of the wheatear i had seen at the spot and its little mate not knowing what death is had probably been keeping watch near it wondering at its strange stillness and greatly fearing for its safety when i came that way and passed by without seeing it  poor little migrant did you come back across half the world for thisback to your home on whitesheet hill to grow cold and fail in the cold april wind and finally to look very pretty lying stiff and cold to the one pair of human eyes that were destined to see you the little birds that come and go and return to us over such vast distances they perish like this in myriads annually flying to and from us they are blown away by death like sere autumn leaves the pestilencestricken multitudes whirled away by the wind they die in myriads that is not strange the strange the astonishing thing is the fact of death what can they tell us of itthe wise men who live or have ever lived on the earthwhat can they say now of the bright intelligent spirit the dear little emotional soul that had so fit a tenement and so fitly expressed itself in motions of such exquisite grace in melody so sweet did it go out like the glowworms lamp the life and sweetness of the flower was its destiny not like that of the soul specialized in a different direction of the saint or poet or philosopher alas they can tell us nothing  i could not go away leaving it in that exposed place on the turf to be found a little later by a magpie or carrion crow or fox and devoured close by there was a small round hillock an old forsaken nest of the little brown ants green and soft with moss and small creeping herbsa suitable grave for a wheatear cutting out a round piece of turf from the side i made a hole with my stick and put the dead bird in and replacing the turf left it neatly buried  it was not that i had or have any quarrel with the creatures i have named or would have them other than they arecarrioneaters and scavengers natures balancekeepers and purifiers the only creatures on earth i loathe and hate are the gourmets the carrioncrows and foxes of the human kind who devour wheatears and skylarks at their tables     chapter thirteen bath and wells revisited   tis so easy to get from london to bath by merely stepping into a railway carriage which takes you smoothly without a stop in two short hours from paddington that i was amazed at myself in having allowed five full years to pass since my previous visit the question was much in my mind as i strolled about noting the oldremembered names of streets and squares and crescents quiet street was the name inscribed on one it was to me the secret name of them all the old impressions were renewed an old feeling partially recovered the wide clean ways the solid stonebuilt houses with their dignified aspect the large distances terrace beyond terrace mansions and vast green lawns and parks and gardens avenues and groups of stately trees especially that unmatched clump of old planes in the circus the whole town the design in the classic style of one master mind set by the avon amid green hills produced a sense of harmony and repose which cannot be equalled by any other town in the kingdom  this idle time was delightful so long as i gave my attention exclusively to houses from the outside and to hills rocks trees waters and all visible nature which here harmonizes with mans works to sit on some high hill and look down on bath sunflushed or half veiled in mist to lounge on camden crescent or climb sion hill or take my ease with the waterdrinkers in the spacious comfortable pump room or better still to rest at noon in the ancient abbeyall this was pleasure pure and simple a quiet drifting back until i found myself younger by five years than i had taken myself to be  i haunted the abbey and the more i saw of it the more i loved it the impression it had made on me during my former visits had faded or else i had never properly seen it or had not seen it in the right emotional mood now i began to think it the best of all the great abbey churches of england and the equal of the cathedrals in its effect on the mind how rich the interior is in its atmosphere of tempered light or tender gloom how tall and graceful the columns holding up the high roof of white stone with its marvellous palmleaf sculpture what a vast expanse of beautifully stained glass i certainly gave myself plenty of time to appreciate it on this occasion as i visited it every day sometimes two or three times and not infrequently i sat there for an hour at a stretch  sitting there one day thinking of nothing i was gradually awakened to a feeling almost of astonishment at the sight of the extraordinary number of memorial tablets of every imaginable shape and size which crowd the walls so numerous are they and so closely placed that you could not find space anywhere to put your hand against the wall we are accustomed to think that in cathedrals and other great ecclesiastical buildings the illustrious dead receive burial and their names and claims on our gratitude and reverence are recorded but in no fane in the land is there so numerous a gathering of the dead as in this place the inscriptioncovered walls were like the pages of an old blackletter volume without margins yet when i came to think of it i could not recall any bath celebrity or great person associated with bath except beau nash who was not perhaps a very great person probably carlyle would have described him as a meeserable creature  leaving my seat i began to examine the inscriptions and found that they had not been placed there in memory of men belonging to bath or even somerset these monuments were erected to persons from all counties in the three kingdoms and from all the big towns those to londoners being most numerous nor were they of persons distinguished in any way here you find john or henry or thomas smith or brown or jones or robinson provision dealer or merchant of clerkenwell or bermondsey or bishopsgate street within or without also many retired captains majors and colonels there were hundreds more whose professions or occupations in life were not stated there were also hundreds of memorials to ladieswidows and spinsters they were all in fact to persons who had come to die in bath after taking the waters and dying they or their friends had purchased immortality on the walls of the abbey with a handful or two of gold here is one of several inscriptions of the kind i took the trouble to copy his early virtues his cultivated talents his serious piety inexpressibly endeared him to his friends and opened to them many bright prospects of excellence and happiness these prospects have all faded and so on for several long lines in very big letters occupying a good deal of space on the wall but what and who was he and what connection had he with bath he was a young man born in the west indies who died in scotland and later his mother coming to bath for her health caused this inscription to be placed on the abbey walls if this policy or tradition is still followed by the abbey authorities it will be necessary for them to build an annexe if it be no longer followed would it be going too far to suggest that these mural tablets to a thousand obscurities which ought never to have been placed there should now be removed and placed in some vault where the relations or descendants of the persons described could find and if they wished it have them removed  but it must be said that the abbey is not without a fair number of memorials with which no one can quarrel the one i admire most to quin the actor has i think the best or the most appropriate epitaph ever written no one however familiar with the words will find fault with me for quoting them here     that tongue which set the table on a roar    and charmed the public ear is heard no more    closed are those eyes the harbingers of wit    which spake before the tongue what shakespeare writ    cold is that hand which living was stretched forth    at friendships call to succor modest worth    here lies james quin deign readers to be taught    whateer thy strength of body force of thought    in natures happiest mood however cast    to this complexion thou must come at last  quins monument strikes one as the greatest there because of garricks living words but there is another very much more beautiful  i first noticed this memorial on the wall at a distance of about three yards too far to read anything in the inscription except the name of sibthorpe which was strange to me but instead of going nearer to read it i remained standing to admire it at that distance the tablet was of white marble and on it was sculptured the figure of a young man with curly head and classic profile he was wearing sandals and a loose mantle held to his breast with one hand while in the other hand he carried a bunch of leaves and flowers he appeared in the act of stepping ashore from a boat of antique shape and the artist had been singularly successful in producing the idea of free and vigorous motion in the figure as well as of some absorbing object in his mind the figure was undoubtedly symbolical and i began to amuse myself by trying to guess its meaning then a curious thing happened a person who had been moving slowly along near me apparently looking with no great interest at the memorials came past me and glanced first at the tablet i was looking at then at me as our eyes met i remarked that i was admiring the best memorial i had found in the abbey and then added ive been trying to make out its meaning you see the man is a traveller and is stepping ashore with a flowering spray in his hand it strikes me that it may have been erected to the memory of a person who introduced some valuable plant into england  yes perhaps he said but who was he  i dont know yet i returned i can only see that his name was sibthorpe  sibthorpe he exclaimed excitedly why this is the very memorial ive been looking for all over the abbey and had pretty well given up all hopes of finding it with that he went to it and began studying the inscription which was in latin john sibthorpe i found was a distinguished botanist author of the flora graeca who died over a century ago  i asked him why he was interested in sibthorpes memorial  well you see im a great botanist myself he explained and have been familiar with his name and work all my life of course he added i dont mean im great in the sense that sibthorpe was im only a little local botanist quite unknown outside my own circle i only mean that im a great lover of botany  i left him there and had the curiosity to look up the great mans life and found some very curious things in it he was a son of humphrey sibthorpe also a great botanist who succeeded the still greater dillenius as sherardian professor of botany at oxford a post which he held for thirtysix years and during that time he delivered one lecture which was a failure john if he did not suck in botany with his mothers milk took it quite early from his father and on leaving the university went abroad to continue his studies eventually he went to greece inflamed with the ambition to identify all the plants mentioned by dioscorides then he set about writing his flora graeca but he had a rough time of it travelling about in that rude land and falling ill he had to leave his work undone when nearing his end he came to bath like so many other afflicted ones only to die and he was very properly buried in the abbey in his will he left an estate the proceeds of which were to be devoted to the completion of his work which was to be in ten folio volumes with one hundred plates in each this was done and the work finished fortyfour years after his death when thirty copies were issued to the patient subscribers at two hundred and forty guineas a copy but the whole cost of the work was set down at 30000 pounds a costlier work it would be hard to find i wonder how many of us have seen it  but i must go back to my subject i was not in bath just to die and lie there like poor sibthorpe with all those strange bedfellows of his nor was i in search of a vacant space the size of my hand on the walls to bespeak it for my own memorial on the contrary i was there as we have seen to knock five years off my age and it was very pleasant as i have said so long as i confined my attention to bath the stonebuilt town of old memories and associationsso long as i was satisfied to loiter in the streets and wide green places and in the pump room and the abbey the bitter came in only when going from places to faces i began to seek out the friends and acquaintances of former days the familiar faces seemed not wholly familiar now a change had been wrought in some cases a great change as in that of some weedy girl who had blossomed into fair womanhood one could not grieve at that but in the middleaged and those who were verging on or past that period it was impossible not to feel saddened at the difference i see no change in you is a lie ready to the lips which would speak some pleasing thing but it does not quite convince men are naturally brutal and use no compliments to one another on the contrary they do not hesitate to make a joke of wrinkles and grey hairstheir own and yours but oh the difference when the familiar face no longer familiar as of old is a womans this is no light thing to her and her eyes being preternaturally keen in such matters see not only the change in you but what is infinitely sadder the changed reflection of herself your eyes have revealed the shock you have experienced you cannot hide it her heart is stabbed with a sudden pain and she is filled with shame and confusion and the pain is but greater if her life has glided smoothlyif she cannot appeal to your compassion finding a melancholy relief in that saddest cry     o grief has changed me since you saw me last  for not grief nor sickness nor want nor care nor any misery or calamity which men fear is her chief enemy time alone she hates and fearsinsidious time who has lulled her mind with pleasant flatteries all these years while subtly taking away her most valued possessions the bloom and colour the grace the sparkle the charm of other years  here is a true and pretty little story which may or may not exactly fit the theme but is very well worth telling a lady of fashion middleaged or thereabouts goodlooking but pale and with the marks of care and disillusionment on her expressive face accompanied by her pretty sixteenyearsold daughter one day called on an artist and asked him to show her his studio he was a very great artist the greatest portraitpainter we have ever had and he did not know who she was but with the sweet courtesy which distinguished him through all his long lifehe died recently at a very advanced agehe at once put his work away and took her round his studio to show her everything he thought would interest her but she was restless and inattentive and by and by leaving the artist talking to her young daughter she began going round by herself moving constantly from picture to picture presently she made an exclamation and turning they saw her standing before a picture a portrait of a girl staring fixedly at it oh she cried and it was a cry of pain was i once as beautiful as that and burst into tears she had found the picture she had been looking for which she had come to see it had been there twenty to twentyfive years and the story of it was as follows  when she was a young girl her mother took her to the great artist to have her portrait painted and when the work was at length finished she and her mother went to see it the artist put it before them and the mother looked at it her face expressing displeasure and said not one word nor did the artist open his lips and at last the girl to break the uncomfortable silence said where shall we hang it mother and the lady replied just where you like my dear so long as you hang it with the face to the wall it was an insolent a cruel thing to say but the artist did not answer her bitterly he said gently that she need not take the portrait as it failed to please her and that in any case he would decline to take the money she had agreed to pay him for the work she thanked him coldly and went her way and he never saw her again and now time the humbler of proud beautiful women had given him his revenge the portrait scorned and rejected when the colour and sparkle of life was in the face had been looked on once more by its subject and had caused her to weep at the change in herself  to return one wishes in these moments of meeting of surprise and sudden revealings that it were permissible to speak from the heart since then the very truth might have more balm than bitterness in it grieve not dear friend of old days that i have not escaped the illusion common to allthe idea that those we have not looked on this long timefull five years let us sayhave remained as they were while we ourselves have been moving onwards and downwards in that path in which our feet are set no one however hardened he may be can escape a shock of surprise and pain but now the illusion i cherished has gonenow i have seen with my physical eyes and a new image with times writing on it has taken the place of the old and brighter one i would not have it otherwise no not if i could would i call back the vanished lustre since all these changes above all that wistful look in the eyes do but serve to make you dearer my sister and friend and fellowtraveller in a land where we cannot find a permanent restingplace  alas it cannot be spoken and we cannot comfort a sister if she cannot divine the thought but to brood over these inevitable changes is as idle as it is to lament that we were born into this mutable world after all it is because of the losses the sadnesses that the world is so infinitely sweet to us the thought is in corys mimnernus in church     all beauteous things for which we live    by laws of time and space decay    but oh the very reason why    i clasp them is because they die  from this sadness in bath i went to a greater in wells where i had not been for ten years and timing my visit so as to have a sunday service at the cathedral of beautiful memories i went on a saturday to shepton mallet a small squalid town a manufacturing town the guidebook calls it well yes it manufactures anglobavarian beer in a gigantic brewery which looks bigger than all the other buildings together the church and a dozen or twenty publichouses included to get some food i went to the only eatinghouse in the place and saw a pleasantlooking woman plump and highcoloured with black hair with an expression of good humour and goodness of every description in her comely countenance she promised to have a chop ready by the time i had finished looking at the church and i said i would have it with a small guinness she could not provide that the house she said was strictly temperance my doctor has ordered me to take it said i and if you are religious remember that st paul tells us to take a little stout when we find it beneficial  yes i know thats what st paul says she returned with a heightened colour and a vicious emphasis on the saints name but we go on a different principle  so i had to go for my lunch to one of the big publichouses called hotels but whether it called itself a cow or horse or stag or angel or a blue or green something i cannot remember they gave me what they called a beefsteak piea tough crust and under it some blackish cubes carved out of the muscle of an antediluvian oxand for this delicious fare and a glass of stout i paid three shillings and odd pence  as i came away shepton mallet was shaken to its foundations by a tremendous and most diabolical sound a prolonged lupine yell or yowl as if a stupendous wolf as big say as the anglobavarian brewery had howled his loudest and longest this infernal row which makes shepton seem like a town or village gone raving mad was merely to inform the men and incidentally the universe that it was time for them to knock off work  turning my back on the place i said to myself what a fool i am to be sure why could i not have been satisfied for once with a cup of coffee with my lunch i should have saved a shilling perhaps eighteenpence to rejoice the soul of some poor tramp and better still i could have discussed some interesting questions with that charming rosyfaced woman what for instance was the reason of her quarrel with the apostle by the by she never rebuked me for misquoting his words and what is the moral effect as seen through her clear brown eyes of the anglobavarian brewery on the population of the small town and the neighbouring villages  the road i followed from shepton to wells winds by the waterside a tributary of the brue in a narrow valley with hills on either side it is a fivemile road through a beautiful country where there is practically no cultivation and the green hills with brown woods in their hollows and here and there huge masses of grey and reddish bath stone cropping out on their sides resembling gigantic castles and ramparts long ruined and overgrown with ivy and bramble produce the effect of a land dispeopled and gone back to a state of wildness  a thaw had come that morning ending the severest frost experienced this winter anywhere in england and the valley was alive with birds happy and tuneful at the end of january as in april looking down on the stream the sudden glory of a kingfisher passed before me but the sootybrown waterouzel with his white bib a haunter too of this water i did not see within a mile or so of wells i overtook a small boy who belonged there and had been to shepton like me noticing the birds i saw a kingfisher i said so did i he returned quickly with pride he described it as a biggish bird with a long neck but its colour was not blueoh no i suggested that it was a heron a longnecked creature under six feet high of no particular colour no it was not a heron and after taking thought he said i think it was a wild duck  bestowing a penny to encourage him in his promising researches into the feathered world i went on by a footpath over a hill and as i mounted to the higher ground there before me rose the noble tower of st cuthberts church and a little to the right of it girt with high trees the magnificent pile of the cathedral with green hills and the pale sky beyond o joy to look again on it to add yet one more enduring image of it to the number i had long treasured for the others were not exactly like this one the building was not looked at from the same point of view at the same season and late hour with the green hills lit by the departing sun and the clear pale winter sky beyond  coming in by the moated palace i stood once more on the green before that west front beautiful beyond all others in spite of the strange defeatures time has written on it i watched the daws numerous as ever still at their old mad games now springing into the air to scatter abroad with ringing cries only to return the next minute and fling themselves back on their old perches on a hundred weatherstained broken statues in the niches and while i stood watching them from the palace trees close by came the loud laugh of the green woodpecker the same wild beautiful sound uttered perhaps by the same bird which i had often heard at that spot ten years ago you will not hear that woodland sound in any other city in the kingdom i wrote in a book of sketches entitled birds and man published in 1901  but of my souls adventures in wells on the two or three following days i will say very little that laugh of the woodpecker was an assurance that nature had suffered no change and the town too like the hills and rocks and running waters seemed unchanged but how different and how sad when i looked for those i once knew whose hands i had hoped to grasp again yes some were living still and a dog too one i used to take out for long walks and many a mad rabbithunta very handsome whiteandliver coloured spaniel i found him lying on a sofa and down he got and wagged his tail vigorously pretending with a pretty human hypocrisy in his gentle yellow eyes that he knew me perfectly well that i was not a bit changed and that he was delighted to see me  on my way back to bath i had a day at bristol it was cattlemarket day and what with the bellowings barkings and shoutings added to the buzz and clang of innumerable electric tramcars and the usual din of street traffic one got the idea that the bristolians had adopted a sort of salvation army theory and were endeavouring to conquer earth it is not heaven in this case by making a tremendous noise i amused myself strolling about and watching the people and as train after train came in late in the day discharging loads of humanity mostly young men and women from the surrounding country coming in for an evenings amusement i noticed again the peculiarly welsh character of the somerset peasantthe shape of the face the colour of the skin and above all the expression  freeman when here below proclaimed it his mission to prove that englishmen were englishmen and not somebody else it appeared to me that any person unbiassed by theories on such a subject looking at that crowd would have come to the conclusion sadly or gladly according to his nature that we are in fact somebody else     chapter fourteen the return of the native   that going back about which i wrote in the second chapter to a place where an unexpected beauty or charm has revealed itself and has made its image a lasting and prized possession of the mind is not the same thing as the revisiting a famous town or city rich in many beauties and old memories such as bath or wells for instance such centres have a permanent attraction and one who is a rover in the land must return to them again and again nor does he fail on each successive visit to find some fresh charm or interest the sadness of such returns after a long interval is only as i have said when we start looking up those with whom we had formed pleasant friendly relations and all because of the illusion that we shall see them as they werethat time has stood still waiting for our return and by and by to our surprise and grief we discover that it is not so that the dear friends of other days long unvisited but unforgotten have become strangers this human loss is felt even more in the case of a return to some small centre a village or hamlet where we knew every one and our intimacy with the people has produced the sense of being one in blood with them it is greatest of all when we return to a childhoods or boyhoods home many writers have occupied themselves with this mournful theme and i imagine that a person of the proper amiellike tender and melancholy moralizing type of mind by using his own and his friends experiences could write a charmingly sad and pretty book on the subject  the really happy returns of this kind must be exceedingly rare i am almost surprised to think that i am able to recall as many as two but they hardly count as in both instances the departure or exile from home happens at so early a time of life that no recollections of the people survivednothing in fact but a vague mental picture of the place one was of a business man i knew in london who lost his early home in a village in the midlands as a boy of eight or nine years of age through the sale of the place by his father who had become impoverished the boy was trained to business in london and when a middleaged man wishing to retire and spend the rest of his life in the country he revisited his native village for the first time and discovered to his joy that he could buy back the old home he was when i last saw him very happy in its possession  the other case i will relate more fully as it is a very curious one and came to my knowledge in a singular way  at a small station near eastleigh a man wearing a highly pleased expression on his face entered the smokingcarriage in which i was travelling to london putting his bag on the rack he pulled out his pipe and threw himself back in his seat with a satisfied air then looking at me and catching my eye he at once started talking i had my newspaper but seeing him in that overflowing mood i responded readily enough for i was curious to know why he appeared so happy and who and what he was not a tradesman nor a bagman and not a farmer though he looked like an openair man nor could i form a guess from his speech and manner as to his native place a robust man of thirtyeight or forty with blue eyes and a saxon face he looked a thorough englishman and yet he struck me as most unenglish in his lively almost eager manner his freedom with a stranger and something too in his speech from time to time his face lighted up when looking to the window his eyes rested on some pretty scenea glimpse of stately old elm trees in a field where cattle were grazing of the vivid green valley of a chalk stream the paler hills beyond the grey church tower or spire of some treehidden village when he discovered that these hills and streams and rustic villages had as great a charm for me as for himself that i knew and loved the two or three places he named in a questioning way he opened his heart and the secret of his present happiness  he was a native of the district born at a farmhouse of which his father in succession to his grandfather had been the tenant it was a small farm of only eightyfive acres and as his father could make no more than a bare livelihood out of it he eventually gave it up when my informant was but three years old and selling all he had emigrated to australia nine years later he died leaving a numerous family poorly provided for the home was broken up and boys and girls had to go out and face the world they had somehow all got on very well and his brothers and sisters were happy enough out there australians in mind thoroughly persuaded that theirs was the better land the best country in the world and with no desire to visit england he had never felt like that somehow his fathers feeling about the old country had taken such a hold of him that he never outlived itnever felt at home in australia however successful he was in his affairs the home feeling had been very strong in his father his greatest delight was to sit of an evening with his children round him and tell them of the farm and the old farmhouse where he was born and had lived so many years and where some of them too had been born he was never tired of talking of it of taking them by the hand as it were and leading them from place to place to the stream the village the old stone church the meadows and fields and hedges the deep shady lanes and above all to the dear old ivied house with its gables and tall chimneys so many times had his father described it that the old place was printed like a map on his mind and was like a picture which kept its brightness even after the image of his boyhoods home in australia had become faded and pale with that mental picture to guide him he believed that he could go to that angle by the porch where the flycatchers bred every year and find their nest where in the hedge the blackberries were most abundant where the elders grew by the stream from which he could watch the moorhens and watervoles that he knew every fence gate and outhouse every room and passage in the old house through all his busy years that picture never grew less beautiful never ceased its call and at last possessed of sufficient capital to yield him a modest income for the rest of his life he came home what he was going to do in england he did not consider he only knew that until he had satisfied the chief desire of his heart and had looked upon the original of the picture he had borne so long in his mind he could not rest nor make any plans for the future  he came first to london and found on examining the map of hampshire that the village of thorpe i will call it where he was born is three miles from the nearest station in the southern part of the county undoubtedly it was thorpe that was one of the few names of places his father had mentioned which remained in his memory always associated with that vivid image of the farm in his mind to thorpe he accordingly wentas pretty a rustic village as he had hoped to find it he took a room at the inn and went out for a long walkjust to see the place he said to the landlord he would make no inquiries he would find his home for himself how could he fail to recognize it but he walked for hours in a widening circle and saw no farm or other house and no ground that corresponded to the picture in his brain  troubled at his failure he went back and questioned his landlord and naturally was asked for the name of the farm he was seeking he had forgotten the namehe even doubted that he had ever heard it but there was his family name to go bydyson did any one remember a farmer dyson in the village he was told that it was not an uncommon name in that part of the country there were no dysons now in thorpe but some fifteen or twenty years ago one of that name had been the tenant of long meadow farm in the parish the name of the farm was unfamiliar and when he visited the place he found it was not the one he sought  it was a grievous disappointment a new sense of loneliness oppressed him for that bright image in his mind with the feeling about his home had been a secret source of comfort and happiness and was like a companion a dear human friend and now he appeared to be on the point of losing it could it be that all that mental picture with the details that seemed so true to life was purely imaginary he could not believe it the old house had probably been pulled down the big trees felled orchard and hedges grabbed upall the old features obliteratedand the land thrown into some larger neighbouring farm it was dreadful to think that such devastating changes had been made but it had certainly existed as he saw it in his mind and he would inquire of some of the old men in the place who would perhaps be able to tell him where his home had stood thirty years ago  at once he set about interviewing all the old men he came upon in his rounds describing to them the farm tenanted by a man named dyson about forty years ago and by and by he got hold of one who knew he listened for a few minutes to the oftrepeated story then exclaimed why sir tis surely woodyates you be talking about  thats the name thats the name he cried woodyyateshow did i ever forget it you knew it thenwhere was it  ill just show you said the old man proud at having guessed rightly and turning started slowly hobbling along till he got to the end of the lane  there was an opening there and a view of the valley with trees blue in the distance at the furthest visible point do you see them trees he said thats where harping is tis two miles or perhaps a little more from thorpe theres a church tower among them trees but you cant see it because tis hid you go by the road till you comes to the church then you go on by the water maybe a quarter of a mile and you comes to woodyates you wont see no difference in it ive knowed it since i were a boy but tis in harping parish not in thorpe  now he remembered the nameharping near thorpeonly thorpe was the more important village where the inn was and the shops  in less than an hour after leaving his informant he was at woodyates feasting his eyes on the old house of his dreams and of his exiled fathers before him inexpressibly glad to recognize it as the very house he had loved so longthat he had been deceived by no false image  for some days he haunted the spot then became a lodger at the farmhouse and now after making some inquiries he had found that the owner was willing to sell the place for something more than its market value and he was going up to london about it  at waterloo i wished him happiness in his old home found again after so many years then watched him as he walked briskly awayas commonplacelooking a man as could be seen on that busy crowded platform in his suit of rough grey tweeds thick boots and bowler hat yet one whose fortune might be envied by many even among the successfulone who had cherished a secret thought and feeling which had been to him like the shadow of a rock and like a cool spring in a dry and thirsty land  and in that host of undistinguished colonials and others of british race from all regions of the earth who annually visit these shores on business or for pleasure or some other object how many there must be who come with some such memory or dream or aspiration in their hearts a greater number probably than we imagine for most of them there is doubtless disappointment and disillusion it is a matter of the heart a sentiment about which some are not given to speak he too my fellowpassenger would no doubt have held his peace had his dream not met with so perfect a fulfilment as it was he had to tell his joy to some one though it were to a stranger     chapter fifteen summer days on the otter   the most characteristic district of south devon the greenest most luxuriant in its vegetation and perhaps the hottest in england is that bit of country between the exe and the axe which is watered by the clyst the otter and the sid in any one of a dozen villages found beside these pretty little rivers a man might spend a month a year a lifetime very agreeably ceasing not to congratulate himself on the good fortune which first led him into such a garden yet after a week or two in this luxurious land i began to be dissatisfied with my surroundings it was june the weather was exceptionally dry and sultry vague thoughts or visitings of mountains and moors and coasts would intrude to make the confinement of deep lanes seem increasingly irksome each day i wandered miles in some new direction never knowing whither the devious path would lead me never inquiring of any person nor consulting map or guide since to do that is to deprive oneself of the pleasure of discovery always with a secret wish to find some exit as it weresome place beyond the everlasting wall of high hedges and green trees where there would be a wide horizon and wind blowing unobstructed over leagues of open country to bring me back the sense of lost liberty i found only fresh woods and pastures new that were like the old other lanes leading to other farmhouses each in its familiar pretty setting of orchard and garden and finally other ancient villages each with its ivygrown grey church tower looking down on a green graveyard and scattered cottages mostly mudbuilt and thatched with straw finding no outlook on any side i went back to the streams oftenest to the otter where lying by the hour on the bank i watched the speckled trout below me and the darkplumaged dipper with shining white breast standing solitary and curtseying on a stone in the middle of the current sometimes a kingfisher would flash by and occasionally i came upon a lonely grey heron but no mammal bigger than a watervole appeared although i waited and watched for the much bigger beast that gives the river its name still it was good to know that he was there and had his den somewhere in the steep rocky bank under the rough tangle of ivy and bramble and roots of overhanging trees one was shot by a farmer during my stay but my desire was for the living not a dead otter consequently when the otterhunt came with blaze of scarlet coats and blowing of brass horns and noise of barking hounds and shouts of excited people it had no sooner got half a mile above ottery st mary where i had joined the straggling procession than falling behind the hunting fury died out of me and i was relieved to hear that no quarry had been found the frightened moorhen stole back to her spotty eggs the dipper returned to his dipping and curtseying to his own image in the stream and i to my idle dreaming and watching  the watching was not wholly in vain since there were here revealed to me things or aspects of things that were new a great deal depends on atmosphere and the angle of vision for instance i have often looked at swans at the hour of sunset on the water and off it or flying and have frequently had them between me and the level sun yet never have i been favoured with the sight of the rosecoloured the red and the goldenyellow varieties of that majestic waterfowl whose natural colour is white on the other hand who ever saw a carrioncrow with crimson eyes yet that was one of the strange things i witnessed on the otter  game is not everywhere strictly preserved in that part of devon and the result is that the crow is not so abhorred and persecuted a fowl as in many places especially in the home counties where the cult of the sacred bird is almost universal at one spot on the stream where my rambles took me on most days a pair of crows invariably greeted my approach with a loud harsh remonstrance and would keep near me flying from tree to tree repeating their angry girdings until i left the place their nest was in a large elm and after some days i was pleased to see that the young had been safely brought off the old birds screamed at me no more then i came on one of their young in the meadow near the river his curious behaviour interested me so much that i stood and watched him for half an hour or longer it was a hot windless day and the bird was by himself among the tall flowering grasses and buttercups of the meadowa queer gaunt unfinished hobbledehoylooking fowl with a head much too big for his body a beak that resembled a huge nose and a very monstrous mouth when i first noticed him he was amusing himself by picking off the small insects from the flowers with his big beak a most unsuitable instrument one would imagine for so delicate a task at the same time he was hungering for more substantial fare and every time a rook flew by over him on its way to or from a neighbouring too populous rookery the young crow would open wide his immense red mouth and emit his harsh throaty hungercall the rook gone he would drop once more into his study of the buttercups to pick from them whatever unconsidered trifle in the way of provender he could find once a small bird a pied wagtail flew near him and he begged from it just as he had done from the rooks the little creature would have run the risk of being itself swallowed had it attempted to deliver a packet of flies into that cavernous mouth i went nearer moving cautiously until i was within about four yards of him when half turning he opened his mouth and squawked actually asking me to feed him then growing suspicious he hopped awkwardly away in the grass eventually he permitted a nearer approach and slowly stooping i was just on the point of stroking his back when suddenly becoming alarmed he swung himself into the air and flapped laboriously off to a low hawthorn twenty or thirty yards away into which he tumbled pellmell like a bundle of old black rags  then i left him and thought no more about the crows except that their young have a good deal to learn upon first coming forth into an unfriendly world but there was a second nest and family close by all the time a day or two later i discovered it accidentally in a very curious way  there was one spot where i was accustomed to linger for a few minutes sometimes for half an hour or so during my daily walks here at the foot of the low bank on the treeless side of the stream there was a scanty patch of sedges a most exposed and unsuitable place for any bird to breed in yet a venturesome moorhen had her nest there and was now sitting on seven eggs first i would take a peep at the eggs for the bird always quitted the nest on my approach then i would gaze into the dense tangle of tree bramble and ivy springing out of the mass of black rock and red clay of the opposite bank in the centre of this rough tangle which overhung the stream there grew an old stunted and crooked fir tree with its tufted top so shut out from the light by the branches and foliage round it that it looked almost black one evening i sat down on the green bank opposite this tangle when the low sun behind me shone level into the mass of rock and rough boles and branches and fixing my eyes on the black centre of the mass i encountered a pair of crimson eyes staring back into mine a level ray of light had lit up that spot which i had always seen in deep shadow revealing its secret after gazing steadily for some time i made out a crows nest in the dwarf pine top and the vague black forms of three young fully fledged crows sitting or standing in it the middle bird had the shining crimson eyes but in a few moments the illusory colour was gone and the eyes were black  it was certainly an extraordinary thing the raggedlooking blackplumaged bird on its ragged nest of sticks in the deep shade with one ray of intense sunlight on its huge noselike beak and bloodred eyes a sight to be remembered for a lifetime it recalled zurbarans picture of the kneeling monk in which the man with everything about him is steeped in the deepest gloom except his nose on which one ray of strong light has fallen the picture of the monk is gloomy and austere in a wonderful degree the crow in his interior with sunlit big beak and crimson eyes looked nothing less than diabolical  i paid other visits to the spot at the same hour and sat long and watched the crows while they watched me occasionally tossing pebbles on to them to make them shift their positions but the magical effect was not produced again  as to the cause of that extraordinary colour in the crows eyes one might say that it was merely the reflected red light of the level sun we are familiar with the effect when polished and wet surfaces such as glass stone and water shine crimson in the light of a setting sun but there is also the fact which is not well known that the eye may show its own hidden redthe crimson colour which is at the back of the retina and which is commonly supposed to be seen only with the ophthalmoscope nevertheless i find on inquiry among friends and acquaintances that there are instances of persons in which the iris when directly in front of the observer with the light behind him always looks crimson and in several of these cases the persons exhibiting this colour or danger signal as it may be called were subject to brain trouble it is curious to find that the crimson colour or light has also been observed in dogs one friend has told me of a pet king charles a lively goodtempered little dog with brown eyes like any other dog which yet when they looked up into yours in a room always shone rubyred instead of hyaline blue or green as is usually the case from other friends i heard of many other cases one was of a child an infant in arms whose eyes sometimes appeared crimson another of a cat with yellow eyes which shone crimsonred in certain lights of human adults i heard of two men great in the world of science both dead now in whose eyes the red light had been seen just before and during attacks of nervous breakdown i heard also of four other persons not distinguished in any way two of them sisters who showed the red light in the eyes all of them suffered from brain trouble and two of them ended their lives in asylums for the insane  discussing these cases with my informants we came to the conclusion that the red light in the human eye is probably always a pathological condition a danger signal but it is not perhaps safe to generalize on these few instances and i must add that all the medical men i have spoken to on the subject shake their heads one great man an eye specialist went so far as to say that it is impossible that the red light in the eye was not seen by my informants but only imagined the ophthalmoscope he said will show you the crimson at the back of the eye but the colour is not and cannot be reflected on the surface of the iris     chapter sixteen in praise of the cow   in spite of discontents i might have remained to this day by the otter in the daily and hourly expectation of seeing some new and wonderful thing in nature in that place where a crimsoneyed carrioncrow had been revealed to me had not a storm of thunder and rain broken over the country to shake me out of a growing disinclination to move we are body and mind very responsive to atmospheric changes for every storm in nature there is a storm in usa change physical and mental we make our own conditions it is true and these react and have a deadening effect on us in the long run but we are never wholly deadened by themif we be not indeed dead if the life we live can be called life we are told that there are rainless zones on the earth and regions of everlasting summer it is hard to believe that the dwellers in such places can ever think a new thought or do a new thing the morning rain did not last very long and before it had quite ceased i took up my knapsack and set off towards the sea determined on this occasion to make my escape  three or four miles from ottery st mary i overtook a cowman driving nine milch cows along a deep lane and inquired my way of him he gave me many and minute directions after which we got into conversation and i walked some distance with him the cows he was driving were all pure devons perfect beauties in their bright red coats in that greenest place where every rainwet leaf sparkled in the new sunlight naturally we talked about the cows and i soon found that they were his own and the pride and joy of his life we walked leisurely and as the animals went on first one then another would stay for a mouthful of grass or to pull down half a yard of green drapery from the hedge it was so lavishly decorated that the damage they did to it was not noticeable by and by we went on ahead of the cows then if one stayed too long or strayed into some inviting sidelane he would turn and utter a long soft call whereupon the straggler would leave her browsing and hasten after the others   he was a big strongly built man a little past middle life and greyhaired with roughhewn faceunprepossessing one would have pronounced him until the intelligent kindly expression of the eyes was seen and the agreeable voice was heard as our talk progressed and we found how much in sympathy we were on the subject i was reminded of that biblical expression about the shining of a mans face wine that maketh glad the heart of mani hope the total abstainers will pardon meand oil that maketh his face to shine we have in one passage this rather goes against our british ideas since we rub no oil or unguents on our skin but only soap which deprives it of its natural oil and too often imparts a dry and hard texture yet in that to us disagreeable aspect of the skin caused by foreign fats there is a resemblance to the sudden brightening and glory of the countenance in moments of blissful emotion or exaltation no doubt the effect is produced by the eyes which are the mirrors of the mind and as they are turned full upon us they produce an illusion seeming to make the whole face shine  in our talk i told him of long rambles on the mendips along the valley of the somerset axe where i had lately been and where of all places in this island the cow should be most esteemed and loved by man yet even there where standing on some elevation cows beyond ones power to number could be seen scattered far and wide in the green vales beneath it had saddened me to find them so silent it is not natural for them to be dumb they have great emotions and mighty voicesthe cattle on a thousand hills their morning and evening lowing is more to me than any other natural soundthe melody of birds the springs and dying gales of the pines the wash of waves on the long shingled beach the hills and valleys of that pastoral country flowing with milk and honey should be vocal with it echoing and reechoing the long call made musical by distance the cattle are comparatively silent in that beautiful district and indeed everywhere in england because men have made them so they have when deprived of their calves no motive for the exercise of their voices for two or three days after their newborn calves have been taken from them they call loudly and incessantly day and night like rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted grief and anxiety inspires that crythey grow hoarse with crying it is a powerful harsh discordant sound unlike the long musical call of the cow that has a calf and remembering it and leaving the pasture goes lowing to give it suck  i also told him of the cows of a distant country where i had lived that had the maternal instinct so strong that they refused to yield their milk when deprived of their young they held it back as the saying is and were in a sullen rage and in a few days their fountains dried up and there was no more milk until calvingtime came round once more  he replied that cows of that temper were not unknown in south devon very proudly he pointed to one of the small herd that followed us as an example in most cases he said the calf was left from two or three days to a week or longer with the mother to get strong and then taken away this plan could not be always followed some cows were so greatly distressed at losing the young they had once suckled that precautions had to be taken and the calf smuggled away as quietly as possible when droppedif possible before the mother had seen it then there were the extreme cases in which the cow refused to be cheated she knew that a calf had been born she had felt it within her and had suffered pangs in bringing it forth if it appeared not on the grass or straw at her side then it must have been snatched away by the human creatures that hovered about her like crows and ravens round a ewe in travail on some lonely mountain side  that was the character of the cow he had pointed out even when she had not seen the calf of which she had been deprived she made so great an outcry and was thrown into such a rage and fever refusing to be milked that finally to save her it was thought necessary to give her back the calf now he concluded it was not attempted to take it away twice a day she was allowed to have it with her and suckle it and she was a very happy animal  i was glad to think that there was at least one completely happy cow in devonshire  after leaving the cowkeeper i had that feeling of revulsion very strongly which all who know and love cows occasionally experience at the very thought of beef i was for the moment more than tolerant of vegetarianism and devoutly hoped that for many days to come i should not be sickened with the sight of a sirloin on some hateful board cold or smoking hot bleeding its red juices into the dish when gashed with a knife as if undergoing a second death we do not eat negroes although their pigmented skins flat feet and woolly heads proclaim them a different species even monkeys flesh is abhorrent to us merely because we fancy that that creature in its ugliness resembles some old men and some women and children that we know but the gentle largebrained social cow that caresses our hands and faces with her rough blue tongue and is more like mans sister than any other nonhuman beingthe majestic beautiful creature with the juno eyes sweeter of breath than the rosiest virginwe slaughter and feed on her fleshmonsters and cannibals that we are  but though cannibals it is very pleasant to find that many cowmen love their cows walking one afternoon by a high unkept hedge near southampton water i heard loud shouts at intervals issuing from a point some distance ahead and on arriving at the spot found an old man leaning idly over a gate apparently concerned about nothing what are you shouting about i demanded cows he answered with a glance across the wide green field dotted with a few big furze and bramble bushes on its far side half a dozen cows were quietly grazing they came fast enough when i was afeeding of em he presently added but now they has to find for theirselves they dont care how long they keeps me i was going to suggest that it would be a considerable saving of time if he went for them but his air of lazy contentment as he leant on the gate showed that time was of no importance to him he was a curiouslooking old man in old frayed clothes broken boots and a cap too small for him he had short legs broad chest and long arms and a very big head long and horselike with a large shapeless nose and grizzled beard and moustache his ears too were enormous and stood out from the head like the handles of a rudely shaped terracotta vase or jar the colour of his face the ears included suggested burnt clay but though nature had made him ugly he had an agreeable expression a sweet benign look in his large dark eyes which attracted me and i stayed to talk with him  it has frequently been said that those who are much with cows and have an affection for them appear to catch something of their expressionto look like cows just as persons of sympathetic or responsive nature and great mobility of face grow to be like those they live and are in sympathy with the cowman who looks like a cow may be more bovine than his fellows in his heavier motions and slower apprehensions but he also exhibits some of the better qualitiesthe repose and placidity of the animal  he said that he was over seventy and had spent the whole of his life in the neighbourhood mostly with cows and had never been more than a dozen miles from the spot where we were standing at intervals while we talked he paused to utter one of his long shouts to which the cows paid no attention at length one of the beasts raised her head and had a long look then slowly crossed the field to us the others following at some distance they were shorthorns all but the leader a beautiful young devon of a uniform rich glossy red but the silky hair on the distended udder was of an intense chestnut and all the parts that were not clothed were red toothe teats the skin round the eyes the moist embossed nose while the hoofs were like polished red pebbles and even the shapely horns were tinged with that colour walking straight up to the old man she began deliberately licking one of his ears with her big rough tongue and in doing so knocked off his old rakish cap picking it up he laughed like a child and remarked she knows me this one doesand she loikes me     chapter seventeen an old road leading nowhere   so many and minute were the directions i received about the way from the blessed cowkeeper and so little attention did i give them my mind being occupied with other things that they were quickly forgotten of half a hundred things i remembered only that i had to bear to the left this i did although it seemed useless seeing that my way was by lanes across fields and through plantations at length i came to a road and as it happened to be on my left hand i followed it it was narrow worn deep by traffic and rains and grew deeper rougher and more untrodden as i progressed until it was like the dry bed of a mountain torrent and i walked on boulderstones between steep banks about fourteen feet high their sides were clothed with ferns grass and rank moss their summits were thickly wooded and the interlacing branches of the trees above mingled with long ropelike shoots of bramble and briar formed so close a roof that i seemed to be walking in a dimly lighted tunnel at length thinking that i had kept long enough to a road which had perhaps not been used for a century also tired of the monotony of always bearing to the left i scrambled out on the righthand side for some time past i had been ascending a low broad flattopped hill and on forcing my way through the undergrowth into the open i found myself on the level plateau an unenclosed spot overgrown with heather and scattered furze bushes with clumps of fir and birch trees before me and on either hand at this elevation a vast extent of country was disclosed the surface was everywhere broken but there was no break in the wonderful greenness which the recent rain had intensified there is too much green to my thinking with too much uniformity in its soft bright tone in south devon after gazing on such a landscape the brown harsh scanty vegetation of the hilltop seemed all the more grateful the heath was an oasis and a refuge i rambled about in it until my feet and legs were wet then i sat down to let them dry and altogether spent several agreeable hours at that spot pleased at the thought that no human fellowcreature would intrude upon me feathered companions were however not wanting the crowing of cock pheasants from the thicket beside the old road warned me that i was on preserved grounds not too strictly preserved however for there was my old friend the carrioncrow out foraging for his young he dropped down over the trees swept past me and was gone at this season in the early summer he may be easily distinguished when flying from his relation the rook when on the prowl the crow glides smoothly and rapidly through the air often changing his direction now flying close to the surface anon mounting high but oftenest keeping nearly on a level with the tree tops his gliding and curving motions are somewhat like those of the herringgull but the wings in gliding are carried stiff and straight the tips of the long flightfeathers showing a slight upward curve but the greatest difference is in the way the head is carried the rook like the heron and stork carries his beak pointing lancelike straight before him he knows his destination and makes for it he follows his nose so to speak turning neither to the right nor the left the foraging crow continually turns his head gulllike and harrierlike from side to side as if to search the ground thoroughly or to concentrate his vision on some vaguely seen object  not only the crow was there a magpie chattered as i came from the brake but refused to show himself and a little later a jay screamed at me as only a jay can there are times when i am intensely in sympathy with the feeling expressed in this earsplitting sound inarticulate but human it is at the same time warning and execration the startled solitarys outburst of uncontrolled rage at the abhorred sight of a fellowbeing in his woodland haunt  small birds were numerous at that spot as if for them also its wildness and infertility had an attraction tits warblers pipits finches all were busy ranging from place to place emitting their various notes now from the treetops then from near the ground now close at hand then far off each change in the height distance and position of the singer giving the sound a different character so that the effect produced was one of infinite variety only the yellowhammer remained constant in one spot in one position and the song at each repetition was the same nevertheless this bird is not so monotonous a singer as he is reputed a lover of open places of commons and waste lands with a bush or dwarf tree for tower to sit upon he is yet one of the most common species in the thickly timbered country of the otter clyst and sid in which i had been rambling hearing him every day and all day long throughout that district where the fields are small and the trees big and near together he has the cirlbuntings habit of perching to sing on the tops of high hedgerow elms and oaks  by and by i had a better bird to listen toa redstart a female flew down within fifteen yards of me her mate followed and perched on a dry twig where he remained a long time for so shy and restless a creature he was in perfect plumage and sitting there motionless in the strong sunlight was wonderfully conspicuous the gayest most exoticlooking bird of his family in england quitting his perch he flew up into a tree close by and began singing and for half an hour thereafter i continued intently listening to his brief strain repeated at short intervalsa song which i think has never been perfectly described practice makes perfect is an axiom that does not apply to the art of song in the bird world since the redstart a member of a highly melodious family with a good voice to start with has never attained to excellence in spite of much practising the song is interesting both on account of its exceptional inferiority and of its character a distinguished ornithologist has said that little birds have two ways of making themselves attractiveby melody and by bright plumage and that most species excel in one or the other way and that the acquisition of gay colours by a species of a sobercoloured melodious family will cause it to degenerate as a songster he is speaking of the redstart unfortunately for the rule there are too many exceptions thus confining ourselves to a single familythat of the finchesin our own islands the most modest coloured have the least melody while those that have the gayest plumage are the best singersthe goldfinch chaffinch siskin and linnet nevertheless it is impossible to listen for any length of time to the redstart and to many redstarts without feeling almost with irritation that its strain is only the prelude of a songa promise never performed that once upon a time in the remote past it was a sweet copious and varied singer and that only a fragment of its melody now remains the opening rapidly warbled notes are so charming that the attention is instantly attracted by them they are composed of two sounds both beautifulthe bright pure gushing robinlike note and the more tender expressive swallowlike note and that is all the song scarcely begins before it ends or collapses for in most cases the pure sweet opening strain is followed by a curious little farrago of gurgling and squeaking sounds and little fragments of varied notes often so low as to be audible only at a few yards distance it is curious that these slight fragments of notes at the end vary in different individuals in strength and character and in number from a single faintest squeal to half a dozen or a dozen distinct sounds in all cases they are emitted with apparent effort as if the bird strained its pipe in the vain attempt to continue the song  the statement that the redstart is a mimic is to be met with in many books about birds i rather think that in jerking out these various little broken notes which end its strain whether he only squeaks or succeeds in producing a pure sound he is striving to recover his own lost song rather than to imitate the songs of other birds  so much entertainment did i find at that spot so grateful did it seem in its openness after long confinement in the lower thickly wooded country that i practically spent the day there at all events the best time for walking was gone when i quitted it and then i could think of no better plan than to climb down into the old long untrodden road or channel again just to see where it would lead me after all i said my time is my own and to abandon the old way i have walked in so long without discovering the end would be a mistake so i went on in it once more and in about twenty minutes it came to an end before a group of old farm buildings in a hollow in the woods the space occupied by the buildings was quite walled round and shut in by a dense growth of trees and bushes and there was no soul there and no domestic animal the place had apparently been vacant many years and the buildings were in a ruinous condition with the roofs falling in  now when i look back on that walk i blame myself for having gone on my way without trying to find out something of the history of that forsaken home to which the lonely old road had led me those ruinous buildings once inhabited so wrapped round and hidden away by trees have now a strange look in memory as if they had a story to tell as if something intelligent had looked from the vacant windows as i stood staring at them and had said we have waited these many years for you to come and listen to our story and you are come at last  something perhaps stirred in me in response to that greeting and message but i failed to understand it and after standing there awhile oppressed by a sense of loneliness i turned aside and creeping and pushing through a mass and tangle of vegetation went on my way towards the coast  possibly that idea or fancy of a story to tell a human tragedy came to me only because of another singular experience i had that day when the afternoon sun had grown oppressively hotanother mystery of a desolate but not in this case uninhabited house the two places somehow became associated together in my mind  the place was a little farmhouse standing some distance from the road in a lonely spot out of sight of any other habitation and i thought i would call and ask for a glass of milk thinking that if things had a promising look on my arrival my modest glass of milk would perhaps expand to a sumptuous fiveoclock tea and my short rest to a long and pleasant one  the house i found on coming nearer was small and meanlooking and very old the farm buildings in a dilapidated condition the thatch rotten and riddled with holes in which many starlings and sparrows had their nests gates and fences were broken down and the ground was everywhere overgrown with weeds and encumbered with old broken and rusty implements and littered with rubbish no person could i see about the place but knew it was inhabited as there were some fowls walking about and some calves shut in a pen in one of the numerous buildings were dolefully callingcalling to be fed seeing a door half open at one end of the house i went to it and rapped on the warped paintless wood with my stick and after about a minute a young woman came from an inner room and asked me what i wanted she was not disturbed or surprised at my sudden appearance there her face was impassive and her eyes when they met mine appeared to look not at me but at something distant and her words were spoken mechanically  i said that i was hot and thirsty and tired and would be glad of a glass of milk  without a word she turned and left me standing there and presently returned with a tumbler of milk which she placed on a deal table standing near me to my remarks she replied in monosyllables and stood impassively her hands at her side her eyes cast down waiting for me to drink the milk and go and when i had finished it and set the glass down and thanked her she turned in silence and went back to that inner room from which she first came and hot and tired as i had felt a few moments before and desirous of an interval of rest in the cool shade i was glad to be out in the burning sun once more for the sight of that young woman had chilled my blood and made the heat outofdoors seem grateful to me  the sight of such a face in the midst of such surroundings had produced a shock of surprise for it was noble in shape the features all fine and the mouth most delicately chiselled the eyes dark and beautiful and the hair of a raven blackness but it was a colourless face and even the lips were pale strongest of all was the expression which had frozen there and was like the look of one on whom some unimaginable disaster or some hateful disillusionment had come not to subdue nor soften but to change all its sweet to sour and its natural warmth to icy cold     chapter eighteen branscombe   health and pleasure resorts and all parasitic towns in fact inland or on the sea have no attractions for me and i was more than satisfied with a day or two of sidmouth then one evening i heard for the first time of a place called branscomba village near the sea over by beer and seaton near the mouth of the axe and the account my old host gave me seemed so attractive that on the following day i set out to find it further information about the unknown village came to me in a very agreeable way in the course of my tramp a hotter walk i never walkedno not even when travelling across a flat sunburnt treeless plain nearer than devon by many degrees to the equator one wonders why that part of devon which lies between the exe and the axe seems actually hotter than other regions which undoubtedly have a higher temperature after some hours of walking with not a little of uphill and downhill i began to find the heat wellnigh intolerable i was on a hard dusty glaring road shut in by dusty hedges on either side not a breath of air was stirring not a bird sang on the vast sky not a cloud appeared if the vertical sun had poured down water instead of light and heat on me my clothing could not have clung to me more uncomfortably coming at length to a group of two or three small cottages at the roadside i went into one and asked for something to quench my thirstcider or milk there was only water to be had but it was good to drink and the woman of the cottage was so pretty and pleasant that i was glad to rest an hour and talk with her in her cool kitchen there are english counties where it would perhaps be said of such a woman that she was one in a thousand but the devonians are a comely race in that blessed county the prettiest peasants are not all diligently gathered with the dew on them and sent away to supply the london flowermarket among the bestlooking women of the peasant class there are two distinct typesthe rich in colour and the colourless a majority are perhaps intermediate but the two extreme types may be found in any village or hamlet and when seen side by sidethe lily and the rose not to say the peonythey offer a strange and beautiful contrast  this woman in spite of the burning climate was white as any pale town lady and although she was the mother of several children the face was extremely youthful in appearance it seemed indeed almost girlish in its delicacy and innocent expression when she looked up at me with her blue eyes shaded by her white sunbonnet the children were five or six in number ranging from a boy of ten to a baby in her armsall clean and healthy looking with bright funloving faces  i mentioned that i was on my way to branscombe and inquired the distance  branscombare you going there oh i wonder what you will think of branscombe she exclaimed her white cheeks flushing her innocent eyes sparkling with excitement  what was branscombe to her i returned with indifference and what did it matter what any stranger thought of it  but it is my home she answered looking hurt at my careless words i was born there and married there and have always lived at branscombe with my people until my husband got work in this place then we had to leave home and come and live in this cottage  and as i began to show interest she went on to tell me that branscombe was oh such a dear queer funny old place that she had been to other villages and townsaxmouth and seaton and beer and to salcombe regis and sidmouth and once to exeter but never never had she seen a place like branscombenot one that she liked half so well how strange that i had never been therehad never even heard of it people that went there sometimes laughed at it at first because it was such a funny tumbledown old place but they always said afterwards that there was no sweeter spot on the earth  her enthusiasm was very delightful and when baby cried in the excitement of talk she opened her breast and fed it before me a pretty sight but for the pure white blueveined skin she might have been taken for a woman of spainthe most natural perhaps the most lovable of the daughters of earth but all at once she remembered that i was a stranger and with a blush turned aside and covered her fair skin her shame too like her first simple unconscious action was natural for we live in a cooler climate and are accustomed to more clothing than the spanish and our closer covering has entered the soul as the late professor kitchen parker would have said and that which was only becoming modesty in the english woman would in the spanish seem rank prudishness  in the afternoon i came to a slender stream clear and swift running between the hills that rose round and large and high on either hand like vast downs some grassy others wooded this was the branscombe and following it i came to the village then for a short mile my way ran by a winding path with the babbling stream below me on one side and on the other the widely separated groups and little rows of thatched cottages  finally i came to the last and largest group of all the end of the village nearest to the sea within ten minutes walk of the shingly beach here i was glad to rest above on the giant downs were stony waste places and heather and gorse where the rabbits live and had for neighbours the adder linnet and wheatear and the small grey titlark that soared up and dropped back to earth all day to his tinkling little tune on the summit of the cliff i had everything i wanted and had come to seekthe wildness and freedom of untilled earth an unobstructed prospect hills beyond hills of malachite stretching away along the coast into infinitude long leagues of red seawall and the wide expanse and everlasting freshness of ocean and the village itself the little old straggling place that had so grand a setting i quickly found that the woman in the cottage had not succeeded in giving me a false impression of her dear home it was just such a quaint unimproved oldworld restful place as she had painted it was surprising to find that there were many visitors and one wondered where they could all stow themselves the explanation was that those who visited branscombe knew it and preferred its hovels to the palaces of the fashionable seaside town no cottage was too mean to have its guest i saw a lady push open the cracked and warped door of an old barn and go in pulling the door to after herit was her bedsittingroom i watched a party of pretty merry girls marching single file down a narrow path past a pigsty then climb up a ladder to the window of a loft at the back of a stone cottage and disappear within it was their bedroom the relations between the villagers and their visitors were more intimate and kind than is usual they lived more together and were more free and easy in company the men were mostly farm labourers and after their days work they would sit outofdoors on the ground to smoke their pipes and where the narrow crooked little street was narrowestat my end of the villagewhen two men would sit opposite each other each at his own door with legs stretched out before them their boots would very nearly touch in the middle of the road when walking one had to step over their legs or if socially inclined one could stand by and join in the conversation when daylight faded the village was very darkno lamp for the visitorsand very silent only the low murmur of the sea on the shingle was audible and the gurgling sound of a swift streamlet flowing from the hill above and hurrying through the village to mingle with the branscombe lower down in the meadows such a profound darkness and quiet one expects in an inland agricultural village here where there were visitors from many distant towns it was novel and infinitely refreshing  no sooner was it dark than all were in bed and asleep not one square path of yellow light was visible to enjoy the sensation i went out and sat down and listened alone to the liquid rippling warbling sound of the swiftflowing streamletthat sweet low music of running water to which the reedwarbler had listened thousands of years ago striving to imitate it until his running rippling song was perfect  a fresh surprise and pleasure awaited me when i explored the coast east of the village it was bold and precipitous in places and from the summit of the cliff a very fine view of the coastline on either hand could be obtained best of all the face of the cliff itself was the breedingplace of some hundreds of herringgulls the eggs at the period of my visit were not yet hatched but highly incubated and at that stage both parents are almost constantly at home as if in a state of anxious suspense i had seen a good many colonies of this gull before at various breeding stations on the coastsouth west and eastbut never in conditions so singularly favourable as at this spot from the vale where the branscombe pours its clear waters through rough masses of shingle into the sea the ground to the east rises steeply to a height of nearly five hundred feet the cliff is thus not nearly so high as many another but it has features of peculiar interest here in some former time there has been a landslip a large portion of the cliff at its highest part falling below and forming a sloping mass a chalky soil mingled with huge fragments of rock which lies like a buttress against the vertical precipice and seems to lend it support the fall must have occurred a very long time back as the vegetation that overspreads the rude slopehawthorn furze and ivyhas an ancient look here are huge masses of rock standing isolated that resemble in their forms ruined castles towers and churches some of them completely overgrown with ivy on this rough slope under the shelter of the cliff with the sea at its feet the villagers have formed their cultivated patches the patches wildly irregular in form some on such steeply sloping ground as to suggest the idea that they must have been cultivated on all fours are divided from each other by ridges and by masses of rock deep fissures in the earth strips of bramble and thorn and furze bushes altogether the effect was very singular the huge rough mass of jumbled rock and soil the ruin wrought by nature in one of her cromwellian moods and scattered irregularly about its surface the plots or patches of cultivated smoothnesspotato rows green parallel lines ruled on a grey ground and big bluegreen equidistant cabbageglobeseach plot with its fringe of spikelike onion leaves crinkled parsley and other garden herbs here the villagers came by a narrow steep and difficult path they had made to dig in their plots while overhead the gulls careless of their presence pass and repass wholly occupied with their own affairs  i spent hours of rare happiness at this spot in watching the birds i could not have seen and heard them to such advantage if their breedingplace had been shared with other species here the herringgulls had the rock to themselves and looked their best in their foamwhite and pearlgrey plumage and yellow legs and beaks while i watched them they watched me not gathered in groups but singly or in pairs scattered up and down all over the face of the precipice above me perched on ledges and on jutting pieces of rock standing motionless thus beautiful in form and colour they looked like sculptured figures of gulls set up on the projections against the rough dark wall of rock just as sculptured figures of angels and saintly men and women are placed in niches on a cathedral front at first they appeared quite indifferent to my presence although in some instances near enough for their yellow irides to be visible while unalarmed they were very silent standing in that clear sunshine that gave their whiteness something of a crystalline appearance or flying to and fro along the face of the cliff purely for the delight of bathing in the warm lucent air gradually a change came over them one by one those that were on the wing dropped on to some projection until they had all settled down and letting my eyes range up and down over the huge wall of rock it was plain to see that all the birds were watching me they had made the discovery that i was a stranger in my rough old travelstained clothes and tweed hat i might have passed for a branscombe villager but i did no hoeing and digging in one of the cultivated patches and when i deliberately sat down on a rock to watch them they noticed it and became suspicious and as time went on and i still remained immovable with my eyes fixed on them the suspicion and anxiety increased and turned to fear and those that were sitting on their nests got up and came close to the edge of the rock to gaze with the others and join in the loud chorus of alarm it was a wonderful sound not like the tempest of noise that may be heard at the breedingseason at lundy island and at many other stations where birds of several species mix their various voicesthe yammeris and the yowlis and skrykking screeking skrymming scowlis and meickle moyes and shoutes of old dunbars wonderful onomatopoetic lines here there was only one species with a clear resonant cry and as every bird uttered that one cry and no other a totally different effect was produced the herringgull and lesser blackbacked gull resemble each other in language as they do in general appearance both have very powerful and clear voices unlike the guttural blackheaded and common gull but the herringgull has a shriller more piercing voice and resembles the blackbacked species just as in human voices a boys clear treble resembles a baritone both birds have a variety of notes and both when the nest is threatened with danger utter one powerful importunate cry which is repeated incessantly until the danger is over and as the birds breed in communities often very populous and all clamour together the effect of so many powerful and unisonant voices is very grand but it differs in the two species owing to the quality of their voices being different the storm of sound produced by the blackbacks is deep and solemn while that of the herringgulls has a ringing sharpness almost metallic  it is probable that in the case i am describing the effect of sharpness and resonance was heightened by the position of the birds perched motionless scattered about on the face of the perpendicular wall of rock all with their beaks turned in my direction raining their cries upon me it was not a monotonous storm of cries but rose and fell for after two or three minutes the excitement would abate somewhat and the cries grow fewer and fewer then the infection would spread again bird after bird joining the outcry and after a while there would be another lull and so on wave following wave of sound i could have spent hours and the hours would have seemed like minutes listening to that strange chorus of ringing chiming cries so novel was its effect and unlike that of any other tempest of sound produced by birds which i had ever heard when by way of a parting caress and benediction given and received i dipped my hands in branscombes clear streamlet it was with a feeling of tender regret that was almost a pain for who does not make a little inward moan an eves lamentation an unworded must i leave thee paradise on quitting any such sweet restful spot however brief his stay in it may have been but when i had climbed to the summit of the great down on the east side of the valley and looked on the wide land and wider sea flashed with the early sunlight i rejoiced full of glory at my freedom for invariably when the peculiar character and charm of a place steals over and takes possession of me i begin to fear it knowing from long experience that it will be a painful wrench to get away and that get away sooner or later i must now i was free once more a wanderer with no ties no business to transact in any town no worries to make me miserable like others nothing to gain and nothing to lose  pausing on the summit to consider which way i should go inland towards axminister or along the coast by beer seton axmouth and so on to lyme regis i turned to have a last look and say a last goodbye to branscombe and could hardly help waving my hand to it  why i asked myself am i not a poet or versemaker so as to say my farewell in numbers my answer was because i am too much occupied in seeing there is no room and time for tranquillity since i want to go on to see something else as blake has it natural objects always did and do weaken deaden and obliterate imagination in me  we know however that they didnt quite quench it in him     chapter nineteen abbotsbury   abbotsbury is an old unspoilt village not on but near the sea divided from it by half a mile of meadowland where all sorts of meadow and water plants flourish and where there are extensive reed and osier beds the roostingplace in autumn and winter of innumerable starlings i am always delighted to come on one of these places where starlings congregate to watch them coming in at days decline and listen to their marvellous hubbub and finally to see their aerial evolutions when they rise and break up in great bodies and play at clouds in the sky when the people of the place the squire and keepers and others who have an interest in the reeds and osiers fall to abusing them on account of the damage they do i put my fingers in my ears but at abbotsbury i did not do so but listened with keen pleasure to the curses they vented and the story they told this was that when the owner of abbotsbury came down for the october shooting and found the starlings more numerous than ever he put himself into a fine passion and reproached his keepers and other servants for not having got rid of the birds as he had desired them to do some of them ventured to say that it was easier said than done whereupon the great man swore that he would do it himself without assistance from any one and getting out a big duckgun he proceeded to load it with the smallest shot and went down to the reed bed and concealed himself among the bushes at a suitable distance the birds were pouring in and when it was growing dark and they had settled down for the night he fired his big piece into the thick of the crowd and by and by when the birds after wheeling about for a minute or two settled down again in the same place he fired again then he went home and early next morning men and boys went into the reeds and gathered a bushel or so of dead starlings but the birds returned in their thousands that evening and his heart being still hot against them he went out a second time to slaughter them wholesale with his big gun then when he had blazed into the crowd once more and the dead and wounded fell like rain into the water below the revulsion came and he was mad with himself for having done such a thing and on his return to the house or palace he angrily told his people to let the starlings alone for the futurenever to molest them again  i thought it one of the loveliest stories i had ever heard there is no hardness comparable to that of the sportsman yet here was one a very monarch among them who turned sick at his own barbarity and repented  beyond the flowery wet meadows favored by starlings and a breedingplace of swans is the famous chesil bank one of the seven wonders of britain and thanks to this great bank a screen between sea and land extending about fourteen miles eastward from portland this part of the coast must remain inviolate from the speculative builder of seaside holiday resorts or towns of lodginghouses  every one has heard of the fleet in connection with the famous swannery of abbotsbury the largest in the land i had heard so much about the swannery that it had but little interest for me the only thing about it which specially attracted my attention was seeing a swan rise up and after passing over my head as i stood on the bank fly straight out over the sea i watched him until he had diminished to a small white spot above the horizon and then still flying he faded from sight do these swans that fly away over the sea and others which appear in small flocks or pairs at poole harbour and at other places on the coast ever return to the fleet probably some do but i fancy some of these explorers must settle down in waters far from home to return no more  the village itself looked upon from this same elevation is very attractive life seems quieter more peaceful there out of sight of the oceans turbulence out of hearing of its accents disconsolate the cottages are seen ranged in a double line along the narrow crooked street like a procession of cows with a few laggards scattered behind the main body one is impressed by its ancient character the cottages are old stonebuilt and thatched older still is the church with its grey square tower and all about are scattered the memorials of antiquitythe chantry on the hill standing conspicuous alone apart above the world the vast old abbey barn and rough thick stone walls ivydraped and crowned with beautiful valerian and other fragments that were once parts of a great religious house  looking back at the great round hill from the village it is impossible not to notice the intense red colour of the road that winds over its green slope one sometimes sees on a hillside a ploughed field of red earth which at a distance might easily be taken for a field of blossoming trifolium viewed nearer the crimson of the clover and red of the earth are very dissimilar distance appears to intensify the red of the soil and to soften that of the flower until they are very nearly of the same hue the road at abbotsbury was near and looked to me more intensely red than any ordinary red earth and the sight was strangely pleasing these two complementary colours red and green delight us most when seen thusa little red to a good deal of green and the more luminous the red and vivid the green the better they please us we see this in flowersin the red geranium for examplewhere there is no brown soil below but green of turf or herbage i sometimes think the red campions and raggedrobins are our most beautiful wild flowers when the sun shines level on the meadow and they are like crimson flowers among the tall translucent grasses i remember the joy it was in boyhood in early spring when the flowers were beginning to bloom when in our gallops over the level grass pampas we came upon a patch of scarlet verbenas the first sight of the intense blooms scattered all about the turf would make us wild with delight and throwing ourselves from our ponies we would go down among the flowers to feast on the sight  green is universal but the red earth which looks so pleasing amid the green is distributed very partially and it may be the redness of the soil and the cliffs in devon have given that county a more vivid personality so to speak than most others think of kent with its white cliffs chalk downs and dullcoloured clays in this connection  the humble subterraneous mole proves himself on occasions a good colourist when he finds a soil of the proper hue to burrow in and the hillocks he throws up from numberless irregular splashes of bright red colour on a green sward the wild animals that strike us as most beautiful when seen against a green background are those which bear the reddest furfox squirrel and red deer one day in a meadow a few miles from abbotsbury i came upon a herd of about fifty milch cows scattered over a considerable space of ground some lying down others standing ruminating and still others moving about and cropping the long flowery grasses all were of that fine rich red colour frequently seen in dorset and devon cattle which is brighter than the reds of other red animals in this country wild and domestic with the sole exception of a rare variety of the collie dog the irish setter and red chouchou come near it so beautiful did these red cows look in the meadow that i stood still for half an hour feasting my eyes on the sight  no less was the pleasure i experienced when i caught sight of that road winding over the hill above the village on going to it i found that it had looked as red as rust simply because it was rustearth made rich and beautiful in colour with iron its red hue variegated with veins and streaks of deep purple or violet i was told that there were hundreds of acres of this earth all round the placeearth so rich in iron that many a mans mouth had watered at the sight of it also that every effort had been made to induce the owner of abbotsbury to allow this rich mine to be worked but wonderful to relate he had not been persuaded  a hard fragment of the red stuff measuring a couple of inches across and weighing about three ounces avoirdupois rustred in colour with purple streaks and yellow mottlings is now lying before me the mineralogist would tell me that its commercial value is naught or something infinitesimal which is doubtless true enough as tens of thousands of tons of the same material lie close to the surface under the green turf and golden blossoming furze at the spot where i picked up my specimen the lapidary would not look at it nevertheless it is the only article of jewellery i possess and i value it accordingly and i intend to keep this native ruby by me for as long as the lords of abbotsbury continue in their present mind the time may come when i shall be obliged to throw it away that any millionaire should hesitate for a moment to blast and blacken any part of the earths surface howsoever green and refreshing to the heart it may be when by so doing he might add to his income seems like a fable or a tale of fairyland it is as if one had accidentally discovered the existence of a little fantastic realm a survival from a remote past almost at ones doors a small independent province untouched by progress asking to be conquered and its antediluvian constitution taken from it  from the summit of that commanding hill over which the red path winds a noble view presents itself of the chesil bank or of about ten miles of it running straight as any roman road to end beneath the rugged stupendous cliffs of portland the ocean itself and not conquering rome raised this artificiallooking wall or rampart to stay its own proud waves formed of polished stones and pebbles about two hundred yards in width flattopped with steeply sloping sides at this distance it has the appearance of a narrow yellow road or causeway between the open sea on one hand and the waters of the fleet a narrow lake ten miles long on the other  when the mackerel visit the coast and come near enough to be taken in a drawnet every villager who owns a share usually a tenth in a fishingboat throws down his spade or whatever implement he happens to have in his hand at the moment and hurries away to the beach to take his share in the fascinating task at four oclock one morning a youth who had been down to the sea to watch came running into the village uttering loud cries which were like excited yellsa sound to rouse the deepest sleeper the mackerel had come for the rest of the day there was a pretty kind of straggling procession of those who went and came between the beach and the villagemen in blue cotton shirts blue jerseys blue jackets and women in grey gowns and big white sunbonnets during the latter part of the day the proceedings were peculiarly interesting to me a lookeron with no share in any one of the boats owing to the catches being composed chiefly of jellyfish some sympathy was felt for the toilers who strained their muscles again and again only to be mocked in the end still a draught of jellyfish was more to my taste than one of mackerel the great weight of a catch of this kind when the net was full was almost too much for the ten or twelve men engaged in drawing it up then to the sound of deep curses from those of the men who were not religious the net would be opened and the great crystalline hemispheres hyaline blue and delicate salmonpink in colour would slide back into the water such rare and exquisite colours have these great glassy flowers of ocean that to see them was a feast and every time a net was hauled up my prayerwhich i was careful not to repeat aloudwas heaven send another big draught of jellyfish  the sun sinking over the hills towards swyre and bridport turned crimson before it touched the horizon the sky became luminous the yellow chesil bank stretching long leagues away and the hills behind it changed their colours to violet the rough sea near the beach glittered like gold the deep green water flecked with foam was mingled with fire the one boat that remained on it tossing up and down near the beach was like a boat of ebony in a glittering fiery sea a dozen men were drawing up the last net but when they gathered round to see what they had takenmackerel or jellyfishi cared no longer to look with them that sudden wonderful glory which had fallen on the earth and sea had smitten me as well and changed me and i was like some needy homeless tramp who has found a shilling piece and even while he is gloating over it all at once sees a great treasure before himglittering gold in heaps and all rarest sparkling gems more than he can gather up  but it is a poor simile no treasures in gold and gems though heaped waisthigh all about could produce in the greediest man hungry for earthly pleasures a delight a rapture equal to mine for this joy was of another and higher order and very rare and was a sense of lightness and freedom from all trammels as if the body had become air essence energy or soul and of union with all visible nature one with sea and land and the entire vast overarching sky  we read of certain saints who were subject to experiences of this kind that they were snatched up into some supramundane region and that they stated on their return to earth that it was not lawful for them to speak of the things they had witnessed the humble naturalist and natureworshipper can only witness the world glorifiedtransfigured what he finds is the important thing i fancy the mystics would have been nearer the mark if they had said that their experiences during their period of exaltation could not be reported or that it would be idle to report them since their questioners lived on the ground and would be quite incapable on account of the minds limitations of conceiving a state above it and outside of its own experience  the glory passed and with it the exaltation the earth and sea turned grey the last boat was drawn up on the slope and the men departed slowly only one remained a roughlooking youth about fifteen years old some important matter which he was revolving in his mind had detained him alone on the darkening beach he sat down then stood up and gazed at the rolling wave after wave to roar and hiss on the shingle at his feet then he moved restlessly about crunching pebbles beneath his thick boots finally making up his mind he took off his coat threw it down and rolled up his shirtsleeves with the resolute air of a man about to engage in a fight with an adversary nearly as big as himself stepping back a little space he made a rush at the sea not to cast himself in it but only as it turned out with the object of catching some water in the hollow of his hands from the top of an incoming wave he only succeeded in getting his legs wet and in hastily retreating he fell on his back nothing daunted he got up and renewed the assault and when he succeeded in catching water in his hands he dashed it on and vigorously rubbed it over his dirty face after repeating the operation about a dozen times receiving meanwhile several falls and wettings he appeared satisfied put on his coat and marched away homewards with a composed air     chapter twenty salisbury revisited   since that visit to salisbury described in a former chapter when i watched and listened to the doves in those cold days in early spring i have been there a good many times but never at the time when the bird colony is most interesting to observe just before and during the early part of the breedingseason at length in the early days of june 1908 the wished opportunity was minewished yet feared seeing that it was possible some disaster had fallen upon that unique colony of stockdoves it is true they appeared to be long established and well able to maintain their foothold on the building in spite of malicious persecuting daws but there was nothing to show that they had been long there seeing that it had been observed by no person but myself that the cathedral doves were stockdoves and not the domestic pigeon found on other large buildings great was my happiness to find them still there as well as the daws and all the other feathered people who make this great building their home even the kestrels were not wanting there were three there one morning quarrelling with the daws in the old way in the old place halfway up the soaring spire the doves were somewhat diminished in number but there were a good many pairs still and i found no dead young ones lying about as they were now probably grown too large to be ejected but several young daws about a dozen i think fell to the ground during my stay undoubtedly they were dragged out of their nests and thrown down perhaps by daws at enmity with their parents or it may be by the doves who are not meekspirited as we have seen or they would not be where they are and may on occasion retaliate by invading their black enemies nestingholes  swallows martins and swifts were numerous the martins especially and it was beautiful to see them for ever wheeling about in a loose swarm about the building they reminded me of bees and flies and sometimes with a strong light on them they were like those small polished black and silverywhite beetles gyrinus which we see in companies on the surface of pools and streams perpetually gliding and whirling about in a sort of complicated dance they looked very small at a height of a couple of hundred feet from the ground and their smallness and numbers and lively and eccentric motions made them very insectlike  the starlings and sparrows were in a small minority among the breeders but including these there were seven species in all and as far as i could make out numbered about three hundred and fifty birdsprobably the largest wild bird colony on any building in england  nor could birds in all this land find a more beautiful building to nest on unless i except wells cathedral solely on account of its west front beloved of daws and where their numerous black company have so fine an appearance wells has its west front salisbury so vast in size is yet a marvel of beauty in its entirety and seeing it as i now did every day and wanting nothing better i wondered at my want of enthusiasm on a previous visit still to me the bird company the sight of their airy gambols and their various voices from the deep humanlike dove tone to the perpetual subdued rippling runningwater sound of the aerial martins must always be a principal element in the beautiful effect nor do i know a building where nature has done more in enhancing the loveliness of mans work with her added colouring the way too in which the colours are distributed is an example of natures most perfect artistry on the lower heavier buttressed parts where the darkest hues should be we find the browns and rustreds of the minute aerial alga mixed with the greys of lichen these darker stainings extending upwards to a height of fifty or sixty feet in places higher then giving place to more delicate hues the pale tender greens and greenish greys in places tinged with yellow the colours always appearing brightest on the smooth surface between the windows and sculptured parts the effect depends a good deal on atmosphere and weather on a day of flying clouds and a blue sky with a brilliant sunshine on the vast building after a shower the colouring is most beautiful it varies more than in the case of colour in the material itself or of pigments because it is a living colour as crabbe rightly says in his lumbering verse     the living stains which natures hand alone    profuse of life pours out upon the stone  greys greens yellows and browns and rustreds are but the colours of a variety of lowly vegetable forms mostly lichens and the aerial alga called iolithus  without this colouring its living stains salisbury would not have fascinated me as it did during this last visit it would have left me cold though all the architects and artists had assured me that it was the most perfectly beautiful building on earth  i also found an increasing charm in the interior and made the discovery that i could go oftener and spend more hours in this cathedral without a sense of fatigue or depression than in any other one known to me because it has less of that peculiar character which we look for and almost invariably find in our cathedrals it has not the rich sombre majesty the dim religious light and heavy vaultlike atmosphere of the other great fanes so airy and light is it that it is almost like being out of doors you do not experience that instantaneous change as of a curtain being drawn excluding the light and air of day and of being shut in which you have on entering other religious houses this is due first to the vast size of the interior the immense length of the nave and the unobstructed view one has inside owing to the removal by the vandal wyatt of the old ponderous stone screenan act for which i bless while all others curse his memory secondly to the comparatively small amount of stained glass there is to intercept the light so graceful and beautiful is the interior that it can bear the light and light suits it best just as a twilight best suits exeter and winchester and other cathedrals with heavy sculptured roofs one marvels at a building so vast in size which yet produces the effect of a palace in fairyland or of a cathedral not built with hands but brought into existence by a miracle  i began to think it not safe to stay in that place too long lest it should compel me to stay there always or cause me to feel dissatisfied and homesick when away  but the interior of itself would never have won me as i had not expected to be won by any building made by man and from the inside i would pass out only to find a fresh charm in that part where nature had come more to mans aid  walking on the cathedral green one morning glancing from time to time at the vast building and its various delicate shades of colour i asked myself why i kept my eyes as if on purpose away from it most of the time now on the trees then on the turf and again on some one walking therewhy in fact i allowed myself only an occasional glance at the object i was there solely to look at i knew well enough but had never put it into plain words for my own satisfaction  we are all pretty familiar from experience with the limitations of the sense of smell and the fact that agreeable odours please us only fitfully the sensation comes as a pleasing shock a surprise and is quickly gone if we attempt to keep it for some time by deliberately smelling a fragrant flower or any perfume we begin to have a sense of failure as if we had exhausted the sense keen as it was a moment ago  there must be an interval of rest for the nerve before the sensation can be renewed in its first freshness now it is the same though in a less degree with the more important sense of sight we look long and steadily at a thing to know it and the longer and more fixedly we look the better if it engages the reasoning faculties but an aesthetic pleasure cannot be increased or retained in that way we must look merely glancing as it were and look again and then again with intervals receiving the image in the brain even as we receive the nimble emanation of a flower and the image is all the brighter for coming intermittently in a large prospect we are not conscious of this limitation because of the wideness of the field and the number and variety of objects or points of interest in it the vision roams hither and thither over it and receives a continuous stream or series of pleasing impressions but to gaze fixedly at the most beautiful object in nature or art does but diminish the pleasure practically it ceases to be beautiful and only recovers the first effect after we have given the mind an interval of rest  strolling about the green with this thought in my mind i began to pay attention to the movements of a man who was manifestly there with the same object as myselfto look at the cathedral i had seen him there for quite half an hour and now began to be amused at the emphatic manner in which he displayed his interest in the building he walked up and down the entire length and would then back away a distance of a hundred yards from the walls and stare up at the spire then slowly approach still gazing up until coming to a stop when quite near the wall he would remain with his eyes still fixed aloft the back of his head almost resting on his back between his shoulders his hat somehow kept on his head but his attitude reminded me of a saying of the arabs who to give an idea of the height of a great rock or other tall object say that to look up at it causes your turban to fall off the americans when they were chewers of tobacco had a different expression they said that to look up at so tall a thing caused the tobacco juice to run down your throat  his appearance when i approached him interested me too his skin was the color of old brown leather and he had a big arched nose clear light blue very shrewd eyes and a big fringe or hedge of ragged white beard under his chin and he was dressed in a new suit of rough dark brown tweeds evidently homemade when i spoke to him saying something about the cathedral he joyfully responded in broadest scotch it was he said the first english cathedral he had ever seen and he had never seen anything made by man to equal it in beauty he had come he told me straight from his home and birthplace a small village in the north of scotland shut out from the world by great hills where the heather grew kneedeep he had never been in england before and had come directly to salisbury on a visit to a relation  well i said now you have looked at it outside come in with me and see the interior  but he refused it was enough for one day to see the outside of such a building he wanted no more just then tomorrow would be soon enough to see it inside it would be the sabbath and he would go and worship there  are you an anglican i asked  he replied that there were no anglicans in his village they had two churchesthe church of scotland and the free church  and what said i will your minister say to your going to worship in a cathedral we have all denominations here in salisbury and you will perhaps find a presbyterian place to worship in  now its strange your saying that he returned with a dry little laugh ive just had a letter from him the morning and he writes on this varra subject let me advise you he tells me in the letter to attend the service in salisbury cathedral nae doot he says there are many things in it youll disapprove of but not everything perhaps and id like ye to go  i was a little sorry for him next day when we had an ordination service very long complicated and i should imagine exceedingly difficult to follow by a wild presbyterian from the hills he probably disapproved of most of it but i greatly admired him for refusing to see anything more of the cathedral than the outside on the first day his method was better than that of an american from indiana he told me i met the following day at the hotel he gave two hours and a half including attendance at the morning service to the cathedral inside and out then rushed off for an hour at stonehenge fourteen miles away on a hired bicycle i advised him to take another dayi did not want to frighten him by saying a weekand he replied that that would make him miss winchester after cycling back from stonehenge he would catch a train to winchester and get there in time to have some minutes in the cathedral before the doors closed he was due in london next morning he had already missed durham cathedral in the north through getting interested in and wasting too much time over some place when he was going there again he had missed exeter cathedral in the south and it would be a little too bad to miss winchester too     chapter twentyone stonehenge   that american from indiana as it was market day at salisbury i asked him before we parted if he had seen the market also if they had market days in the country towns in his state he said he had looked in at the market on his way back from the cathedral no they had nothing of the kind in his state indiana was covered with a network of railroads and electric tram lines and all country produce down to the last newlaid egg was collected and sent off and conveyed each morning to the towns where it was always market day  how sad thought i poor indiana that once had wildness and romance and memories of a vanished race and has now only its pretty meaningless name  i suppose he said before getting on his bicycle theres nothing beside the cathedral and stonehenge to see in wiltshire  no nothing i returned and youll think the time wasted in seeing stonehenge  why  only a few old stones to see  but he went and i have no doubt did think the time wasted but it would be some consolation to him on the other side to be able to say that he had seen it with his own eyes  how did these same few old stones strike me on a first visit it was one of the greatest disillusionments i ever experienced stonehenge looked smallpitiably small for it is a fact that mere size is very much to us in spite of all the teachings of science we have heard of stonehenge in our childhood or boyhoodthat great building of unknown origin and antiquity its circles of stones some still standing others lying prostrate like the stupendous halfshattered skeleton of a giant or monster whose stature reached to the clouds it stands we read or were told on salisbury plain to my uninformed childish mind a plain anywhere was like the plain on which i was bornan absolutely level area stretching away on all sides into infinitude and although the effect is of a great extent of earth we know that we actually see very little of it that standing on a level plain we have a very near horizon on this account any large object appearing on it such as a horse or tree or a big animal looks very much bigger than it would on land with a broken surface  oddly enough my impossible stonehenge was derived from a sober description and an accompanying plate in a sober worka gigantic folio in two volumes entitled a new system of geography dated some time in the eighteenth century how this ponderous work ever came to be out on the pampas over six thousand miles from the land of its origin is a thing to wonder at i remember that the stonehenge plate greatly impressed me and that i sacrilegiously cut it out of the book so as to have it  now we know our reason tells us continually that the mental pictures formed in childhood are false because the child and man have different standards and furthermore the child mind exaggerates everything nevertheless such pictures persist until the scene or object so visualized is actually looked upon and the old image shattered this refers to scenes visualized with the inner eye but the disillusion is almost as great when we return to a home left in childhood or boyhood and look on it once more with the mans eyes how small it is how diminished the hills and the trees that grew to such a vast height whose tops once seemed so close against the skywhat poor little trees they now are and the house itself how low it is and the rooms that seemed so wide and lofty where our footfalls and childish voices sounded as in some vast hall how little and how mean they look             children they are very little  the poet says and they measure things by their size but it seems odd that unless we grow up amid the scenes where our first impressions were received they should remain unaltered in the adult mind the most amusing instance of a false picture of something seen in childhood and continuing through life i have met was that of an italian peasant i knew in south america he liked to talk to me about the cranes those great and wonderful birds he had become acquainted with in childhood in his home on the plains of lombardy the birds of course only appeared in autumn and spring when migrating and passed over at a vast height above the earth these birds he said were so big and had such great wings that if they came down on the flat earth they would be incapable of rising hence they only alighted on the tops of high mountains and as there was nothing for them to eat in such places it being naked rock and ice they were compelled to subsist on each others droppings now it came to pass that one year during his childhood a crane owing to some accident came down to the ground near his home the whole population of the village turned out to see so wonderful a bird and were amazed at its size it was he said the strangest sight he had ever looked on how big was it i asked him was it as big as an ostrich an ostrich he said was nothing to it i might as well ask him how it compared with a lapwing he could give me no measurements it happened when he was a child he had forgotten the exact size but he had seen it with his own eyes and he could see it now in his mindthe biggest bird in the world very well i said if he could see it plainly in his mind he could give some rough idea of the wingspreadhow much would it measure from tip to tip he said it was perhaps fifty yardsperhaps a good deal more  a similar trick was played by my mind about stonehenge as a child i had stood in imagination before it gazing up awestruck on those stupendous stones or climbing and crawling like a small beetle on them and what at last did i see with my physical eyes walking over the downs miscalled a plain anticipating something tremendous i finally got away from the woods at amesbury and spied the thing i sought before me far away on the slope of a green down and stood still and then sat down in pure astonishment was this stonehengethis cluster of poor little grey stones looking in the distance like a small flock of sheep or goats grazing on that immense down how incredibly insignificant it appeared to me dwarfed by its surroundingswoods and groves and farmhouses and by the vast extent of rolling down country visible at that point it was only when i had recovered from the first shock when i had got to the very place and stood among the stones that i began to experience something of the feeling appropriate to the occasion  the feeling however must have been very slight since it permitted me to become interested in the appearance and actions of a few sparrows inhabiting the temple the common sparrow is parasitical on man consequently but rarely found at any distance from human habitations and it seemed a little strange to find them at home at stonehenge on the open plain they were very active carrying up straws and feathers to the crevices on the trioliths where the massive imposts rest on the upright stones i noticed the birds because of their bright appearance they were lighter coloured than any sparrows i have ever seen and one cock bird when flying to and fro in the sunlight looked almost white i formed the idea that this small colony of about a dozen birds had been long established at that place and that the change in their colouring was a direct result of the unusual conditions in which they existed where there was no shade and shelter of trees and bushes and they were perpetually exposed for generations to the full light of the wide open sky  on revisiting stonehenge after an interval of some years i looked for my sparrows and failed to find them it was at the breedingseason when they would have been there had they still existed no doubt the little colony had been extirpated by a sparrowhawk or by the human guardians of the stones as the temple is called by the natives  it remains to tell of my latest visit to the stones i had resolved to go once in my life with the current or crowd to see the sun rise on the morning of the longest day at that place this custom or fashion is a declining one ten or twelve years ago as many as one or two thousand persons would assemble during the night to wait the great event but the watchers have now diminished to a few hundreds and on some years to a few scores the fashion no doubt had its origin when sir norman lockyers theories about stonehenge as a sun temple placed so that the first rays of sun on the longest day of the year should fall on the centre of the socalled altar or sacrificial stone placed in the middle of the circle began to be noised about the country and accepted by every one as the true reading of an ancient riddle but i gather from natives in the district that it is an old custom for people to go and watch for sunrise on the morning of june 21 a dozen or a score of natives mostly old shepherds and labourers who lived near would go and sit there for a few hours and after sunrise would trudge home but whether or not there is any tradition or belief associated with the custom i have not ascertained how long has the custom existed i asked a field labourer from the time of the old peoplethe druids he answered and i gave it up  to be near the spot i went to stay at shrewton a downland village four miles from the stones or rather a group of five pretty little villages almost touching but distinct like five flowers or five berries on a single stem each with its own old church and individual or parish life it is a pretty treeshaded place full of the crooning sound of turtledoves hidden among the wide silent open downs and watered by a clear swift stream or winter bourne which dries up during the heats of late summer and flows again after the autumn rains when the springs rise in the chalk hills while here i rambled on the downs and haunted the stones the road from shrewton to amesbury a straight white band lying across a green country passes within a few yards of stonehenge on the right side of this narrow line the land is all private property but on the left side and as far as one can see it mostly belongs to the war office and is dotted over with camps i roamed about freely enough on both sides sometimes spending hours at a stretch not only on government land but within bounds for the pleasure of spying on the military from a hidingplace in some pine grove or furze patch i was seldom challenged and the sentinels i came across were very mildmannered men they never ordered me away they only said or hinted that the place i was in was not supposed to be free to the public  i come across many persons who lament the recent great change on salisbury plain it is hateful to them the sight of the camp and troops marching and drilling of men in khaki scattered about everywhere over a hundred square leagues of plain the smoke of firing and everlasting booming of guns it is a desecration the wild ancient charm of the land has been destroyed in their case and it saddens and angers them i was pretty free from these uncomfortable feelings  it is said that one of the notions the japanese have about the foxa semisacred animal with themis that if you chance to see one crossing your path in the morning all that comes before your vision on that day will be illusion as an illustration of this belief it is related that a japanese who witnessed the eruption of krakatoa when the heavens were covered with blackness and kindled with intermitting flashes and the earth shaken by the detonations and when all others thinking the end of the world had come were swooning with extreme fear viewed it without a tremor as a very sublime but illusory spectacle for on that very morning he had seen a fox cross his path  a somewhat similar effect is produced on our minds if we have what may be called a sense of historical timea consciousness of the transitoriness of most things humanif we see institutions and works as the branches on a pine or larch which fail and die and fall away successively while the tree itself lives for ever and if we measure their duration not by our own few swift years but by the life of nations and races of men it is i imagine a sense capable of cultivation and enables us to look upon many of mans doings that would otherwise vex and pain us and as some say destroy all the pleasure of our lives not exactly as an illusion as if we were japanese and had seen a fox in the morning but at all events in what we call a philosophic spirit  what troubled me most was the consideration of the effect of the new conditions on the wild life of the plainor of a very large portion of it i knew of this before but it was nevertheless exceedingly unpleasant when i came to witness it myself when i took to spying on the military as an amusement during my idle time here we have tens of thousands of very young men boys in mind the best fed healthiest happiest crowd of boys in all the land living in a pure bracing atmosphere far removed from towns and their amusements and temptations all mad for pleasure and excitement of some kind to fill their vacant hours each day and their holidays naturally they take to birdsnesting and to hunting every living thing they encounter during their walks on the downs every wild thing runs and flies from them and is chased or stoned the weakwinged young are captured and the nests picked or kicked up out of the turf in this way the creatures are being extirpated and one can foresee that when hares and rabbits are no more and even the small birds of the plain larks pipits wheatears stonechats and whincats have vanished the hunters in khaki will take to the chase of yet smaller creaturescraneflies and butterflies and dragonflies and even the fantastic elusive hoverflies which the hunters of little game will perhaps think the most entertaining fly of all  but it would be idle to grieve much at this small incidental and inevitable result of making use of the plain as a military camp and trainingground the old god of war is not yet dead and rotting on his iron hills he is on the chalk hills with us just now walking on the elastic turf and one is glad to mark in his brown skin and sparkling eyes how thoroughly alive he is  a little after midnight on the morning of june 21 1908 a shrewton cock began to crow and that trumpet sound which i never hear without a stirring of the blood on account of old associations informed me that the late moon had risen or was about to rise linking the midsummer evening and morning twilights and i set off to stonehenge it was a fine still night without a cloud in the pale dusky blue sky thinly sprinkled with stars and the crescent moon coming up above the horizon after the cock ceased crowing a tawny owl began to hoot and the long tremulous mellow sound followed me for some distance from the village and then there was perfect silence broken occasionally by the tinkling bells of a little company of cyclists speeding past towards the stones i was in no hurry i only wished i had started sooner to enjoy salisbury plain at its best time when all the things which offend the lover of nature are invisible and nonexistent later when the first light began to appear in the east before two oclock it was no false dawn but insensibly grew brighter and spread further until touches of colour very delicate palest amber then tender yellow and rose and purple began to show i felt then as we invariably feel on such occasions when some special motive has called us forth in time to witness this heavenly change as of a new creation            the miracle of diuturnity           whose instancy unbeds the lark  that all the days of my life on which i had not witnessed it were wasted days  o that unbedding of the lark the world that was so still before now all at once had a sound not a single song and not in one place but a sound composed of a thousand individual sounds rising out of the dark earth at a distance on my right hand and up into the dusky sky spreading far and wide even as the light was spreading on the opposite side of the heavensa sound as of multitudinous twanging girding and clashing instruments mingled with shrill piercing voices that were not like the voices of earthly beings they were not human nor angelic but passionless and it was as if the whole visible world the dim grassy plain and the vast pale sky sprinkled with paling stars moonlit and dawnlit had found a voice to express the mystery and glory of the morning  it was but eight minutes past two oclock when this unbedding of the lark began and the heavenly music lasted about fourteen minutes then died down to silence to recommence about half an hour later at first i wondered why the sound was at a distance from the road on my right hand and not on my left hand as well then i remembered what i had seen on that side how the boys at play on sundays and in fact every day hunt the birds and pull their nests out and i could only conclude that the lark has been pretty well wiped out from all that part of the plain over which the soldiers range  at stonehenge i found a good number of watchers about a couple of hundred already assembled but more were coming in continually and a mile or so of the road to amesbury visible from the stones had at times the appearance of a ribbon of fire from the lamps of this continuous stream of coming cyclists altogether about five to six hundred persons gathered at the stones mostly young men on bicycles who came from all the wiltshire towns within easy distance from salisbury to bath i had a few good minutes at the ancient temple when the sight of the rude upright stones looking black against the moonlit and starsprinkled sky produced an unexpected feeling in me but the mood could not last the crowd was too big and noisy and the noises they made too suggestive of a bank holiday crowd at the crystal palace  at three oclock a ribbon of slategrey cloud appeared above the eastern horizon and broadened by degrees and pretty soon made it evident that the sun would be hidden at its rising at a quarter to four the crowd however was not downhearted it sang and shouted and by and by just outside the barbedwire enclosure a rabbit was unearthed and about three hundred young men with shrieks of excitement set about its capture it was a lively scene a general scrimmage in which everyone was trying to capture an elusive football with ears and legs to it which went darting and spinning about hither and thither among the multitudinous legs until earth compassionately opened and swallowed poor distracted bunny up it was but little better inside the enclosure where the big fallen stones behind the altarstone in the middle on which the first rays of sun would fall were taken possession of by a crowd of young men who sat and stood packed together like guillemots on a rock these too cheated by that rising cloud of the spectacle they had come so far to see wanted to have a little fun and began to be very obstreperous by and by they found out an amusement very much to their taste  motorcars were now arriving every minute bringing importantlooking persons who had timed their journeys so as to come upon the scene a little before 345 when the sun would show on the horizon and whenever one of these big gentlemen appeared within the circle of stones especially if he was big physically and grotesquelooking in his motorist getup he was greeted with a tremendous shout in most cases he would start back and stand still astonished at such an outburst and then concluding that the only way to save his dignity was to face the music he would step hurriedly across the green space to hide himself behind the crowd  the most amusing case was that of a very tall person adorned with an exceedingly long bright red beard who had on a glengarry cap and a great shawl over his overcoat the instant this unfortunate person stepped into the arena a general wild cry of scotland for ever was raised followed by such cheers and yells that the poor man actually staggered back as if he had received a blow then seeing there was no other way out of it he too rushed across the open space to lose himself among the others  all this proved very entertaining and i was glad to laugh with the crowd thinking that after all we were taking a very mild revenge on our hated enemies the tyrants of the roads  the fun over i went soberly back to my village and finding it impossible to get to sleep i went to sundaymorning service at shrewton church it was strangely restful there after that noisy morning crowd at stonehenge the church is white stone with norman pillars and old oak beams laid over the roof painted or distempered bluea quiet peaceful blue there was also a good deal of pleasing blue colour in the glass of the east window the service was as i almost invariably find it in a village church beautiful and impressive listening to the music of prayer and praise with some natural outdoor sound to fill up the pausesthe distant crow of a cock or the song of some bird close bya cornbunting or wren or hedgesparrowand the bright sunlight filling the interior i felt as much refreshed as if kind natures sweet restorer balmy sleep had visited me that morning the sermon was nothing to me i scarcely heard it but understood that it was about the incarnation and the perfection of the plan of salvation and the unreasonableness of the higher criticism and of all who doubt because they do not understand i remembered vaguely that on three successive sundays in three village churches in the wilds of wiltshire i had heard sermons preached on and against the higher criticism i thought it would have been better in this case if the priest had chosen to preach on stonehenge and had said that he devoutly wished we were sunworshippers like the persians as well as christians also that we were buddhists and worshippers of our dead ancestors like the chinese and that we were pagans and idolaters who bow down to sticks and stones if all these added cults would serve to make us more reverent and i wish he could have said that it was as irreligious to go to stonehenge that ancient temple which man raised to the unknown god thousands of years ago to indulge in noise and horseplay at the hour of sunrise as it would be to go to salisbury cathedral for such a purpose     chapter twentytwo the village and the stones   my experiences at the stones had left me with the idea that but for the distracting company the hours i spent there would have been very sweet and precious in spite of the cloud in the east why then i asked not go back on another morning when i would have the whole place to myself if a cloud did not matter much it would matter still less that it was not the day of the year when the red disc flames on the watchers sight directly over that outstanding stone and casts first a shadow then a ray of light on the altar in the end i did not say goodbye to the village on that day but settled down to listen to the tales of my landlady or rather to another instalment of her lifestory and to further chapters in the domestic history of those five small villages in one i had already been listening to her every evening and at odd times during the day for over a week at first with interest then a little impatiently i was impatient at being kept in so to speak outofdoors the world was full of light and heat full of sounds of wild birds and fragrance of flowers and newmown hay there were also delightful children and some that were anything but delightfuldirty ragged little urchins of the slums for even these small rustic villages have their slums and it was now the time when the young birds were fluttering out of their neststheir hunger cries could be heard everywhere and the ragged little barbarians were wild with excitement chasing and stoning the flutterers to slay them or when they succeeded in capturing one without first having broken its wings or legs it was to put it in a dirty cage in a squalid cottage to see it perish miserably in a day or two perhaps i succeeded in saving two or three threatened lives in the lanes and secret green places by the stream perhaps i didnt but in any case it was some satisfaction to have made the attempt  now all this made me a somewhat impatient listener to the village talesthe old unhappy things for they were mostly old and always unhappy yet in the end i had to listen it was her eyes that did it at times they had an intensity in their gaze which made them almost uncanny something like the luminous eyes of an animal hungrily fixed on its prey they held me though not because they glittered i could have gone away if i had thought proper and remained to listen only because the meaning of that singular look in her greygreen eyes which came into them whenever i grew restive had dawned on my careless mind  she was an old woman with snowwhite hair which contrasted rather strangely with her hard red colour but her skin was smooth her face well shaped with fine acquiline features no doubt it had been a very handsome face though never beautiful i imagine it was too strong and firm and resolute too like the face of some man we see which though we have but a momentary sight of it in a passing crowd affects us like a sudden puff of icycold airthe revelation of a singular and powerful personality yet she was only a poor old brokendown woman in a wiltshire village held fast in her chair by a hopeless infirmity with her legs paralysed she was like that prince in the eastern tale on whom an evil spell had been cast turning the lower half of his body into marble but she did not like the prince shed incessant tears and lament her miserable destiny with a loud voice she was patient and cheerful always resigned to the will of heaven anda strange thing this to record of an old woman in a villageshe would never speak of her ailments but though powerless in body her mind was vigorous and active teeming with memories of all the vicissitudes of her exceedingly eventful busy life from the time when she left her village as a young girl to fight her way in the great world to her return to end her life in it old and broken her fight over her children and grandchildren dead or grown up and scattered about the earth  chance having now put me in her way she concluded after a few preliminary or tentative talks that she had got hold of an ideal listener but she feared to lose meshe wanted me to go on listening for ever that was the reason of that painfully intense hungry look in her eyes it was because she discovered certain signs of lassitude or impatience in me a desire to get up and go away and refresh myself in the sun and wind poor old woman she could not spring upon and hold me fast when i attempted to move off or pluck me back with her claws she could only gaze with fiercely pleading eyes and say nothing and so without being fascinated i very often sat on listening still when i would gladly have been outofdoors  she was a good fluent talker moreover she studied her listener and finding that my interest in her own interminable story was becoming exhausted she sought for other subjects chiefly the strange events in the lives of men and women who had lived in the village and who had long been turned to dust they were all more or less tragical in character and it astonished me to think that i had stayed in a dozen or twenty perhaps forty villages in wiltshire and had heard stories equally strange and moving in pretty well every one of them  if each of these small centres possessed a scribe of genius or at any rate one with a capacity for taking pains who would collect and print in proper form these remembered events every village would in time have its own little library of local history the volumes labelled respectively a village tragedy the fields of dulditch lifes little ironies childrens children and various others whose titles every reader will be able to supply  the effect of a long spell of listening to these unwritten tragedies was sometimes strong enough to cloud my reason for on going directly forth into the bright sunshine and listening to the glad sounds which filled the air it would seem that this earth was a paradise and that all creation rejoiced in everlasting happiness excepting man alone whomysterious beingwas born to trouble and disaster as the sparks fly upwards a pure delusion due to our universal and ineradicable passion for romance and tragedy tell a man of a hundred humdrum lives which run their quiet contented course in this village and the monotonous unmoving story or hundred stories will go in at one ear and out at the other therefore such stories are not told and not remembered but that which stirs our pity and terrorthe frustrate life the glorious promise which was not fulfilled the broken hearts and broken fortunes and passion crime remorse retributionall this prints itself on the mind and every such life is remembered for ever and passed on from generation to generation but it would really form only one brief chapter in the long long history of the village life with its thousand chapters  the truth is if we live in fairly natural healthy condition we are just as happy as the lower animals some philosopher has said that the chief pleasure in a mans life as in that of a cow consists in the processes of mastication deglutition and digestion and i am very much inclined to agree with him the thought of death troubles us very littlewe do not believe in it a familiar instance is that of the consumptive whose doctor and friends have given him up and wait but to see the end while he deluded man still sees life an illimitable green sunlit prospect stretching away to an infinite distance before him  death is a reality only when it is very near so close on us that we can actually hear its swift stoaty feet rustling over the dead leaves and for a brief bitter space we actually know that his sharp teeth will presently be in our throat  out in the blessed sunshine i listen to a blackcap warbling very beautifully in a thorn bush near the cottage then to the great shout of excited joy of the children just released from school as they rush pellmell forth and scatter about the village and it strikes me that the bird in the thorn is not more blithehearted than they an old rooki fancy he is old a manywintered crowis loudly cawcawing from the elm tree top he has been abroad all day in the fields and has seen his young able to feed themselves and his own crop full and now he is calling to the others to come and sit there to enjoy the sunshine with him i doubt if he is happier than the human inhabitants of the village the field labourers and shepherds who have been out toiling since the early hours and are now busy in their own gardens and allotments or placidly smoking their pipes at their cottage doors  but i could not stay longer in that village of old unhappy memories and of quiet happy uninteresting lives that leave no memory so after waiting two more days i forced myself to say goodbye to my poor old landlady or rather to say good night as i had to start at one oclock in the morning so as to have a couple of hours before sunrise at the stones on my way to salisbury her latest effort to detain me a day longer had been made and there was no more to say  do you know she said in a low mysterious voice that it is not safe to be alone at midnight on this long lonely roadthe loneliest place in all salisbury plain the safest i said safe as the tower of londonthe protectors of all england are there ah theres where the danger is she returned if you meet some desperate man a deserter with his rifle in his hand perhaps do you think he would hesitate about knocking you over to save himself and at the same time get a little money to help him on his way  i smiled at her simulated anxiety for my safety and set forth when it was very dark but under a fine starry sky the silence too was very profound there was no goodbye from crowing cock or hooting owl on this occasion nor did any cyclist pass me on the road with a flash of light from his lamp and a tinkle from his bell the long straight road on the high down was a dim grey band visible but a few yards before me lying across the intense blackness of the earth by day i prefer as a rule walking on the turf but this road had a rare and peculiar charm at this time it was now the season when the birdsfoottrefoil one of the commonest plants of the downland country was in its fullest bloom so that in many places the green or greygreen turf as far as one could see on every side was sprinkled and splashed with orangeyellow now this creeping spreading plant like most plants that grow on the closecropped sheepwalks whose safety lies in their power to root themselves and live very close to the surface yet must ever strive to lift its flowers into the unobstructed light and air and to overtop or get away from its crowding neighbours on one side of the road where the turf had been cut by the spade in a sharp line the plant had found a rare opportunity to get space and light and had thrust out such a multitude of bowering sprays projecting them beyond the turf as to form a close band or rope of orangeyellow which divided the white road from the green turf and at one spot extended unbroken for upwards of a mile the effect was so singular and pretty that i had haunted this road for days for the pleasure of seeing that flower border made by nature now all colour was extinguished beneath and around me there was a dimness which at a few yards distance deepened to blackness and above me the pale dim blue sky sprinkled with stars but as i walked i had the image of that brilliant band of yellow colour in my mind  by and by the late moon rose and a little later the east began to grow lighter and the dark down to change imperceptibly to dim hoary green then the exquisite colours of the dawn once more and the larks rising in the dim distancea beautiful unearthly soundand so in the end i came to the stones rejoicing in spite of a cloud which now appeared on the eastern horizon to prevent the coming sun from being seen that i had the place to myself the rejoicing came a little too soon a very few minutes later other visitors on foot and on bicycles began to come in and we all looked at each other a little blankly then a motorcar arrived and two gentlemen stepped out and stared at us and one suddenly burst out laughing  i see nothing to laugh at said his companion a little severely  the other in a low voice made some apology or explanation which i failed to catch it was of course not right it was indecent to laugh on such an occasion for we were not of the ebullient sort who go to the stones at three oclock in the morning for a lark but it was very natural in the circumstances and mentally i laughed myself at the absurdity of the situation however the laugher had been rebuked for his levity and this incident over there was nothing further to disturb me or any one in our solemn little gathering  it was a very sweet experience and i cannot say that my early morning outing would have been equally good at any other lonely spot on salisbury plain or anywhere else with a wide starry sky above me the flush of dawn in the east and the larks rising heavenward out of the dim misty earth those rudely fashioned immemorial stones standing dark and large against the pale clear moonlit sky imparted something to the feeling i sat among them alone and had them all to myself as the others fearing to tear their clothes on the barbed wire had not ventured to follow me when i got through the fence outside the enclosure they were some distance from me and as they talked in subdued tones their voices reached me as a low murmura sound not out of harmony with the silent solitary spirit of the place and there was now no other sound except that of a few larks singing fitfully a long way off  just what the element was in that mornings feeling which stonehenge contributed i cannot say it was too vague and uncertain too closely interwoven with the more common feeling for nature no doubt it was partly due to many untraceable associations and partly to a thought scarcely definite enough to be called a thought of mans life in this land from the time this hoary temple was raised down to the beginning of history a vast span a period of ten or more probably of twenty centuries during which great things occurred and great tragedies were enacted which seem all the darker and more tremendous to the mind because unwritten and unknown but with the mighty dead of these blank ages i could not commune doubtless they loved and hated and rose and fell and there were broken hearts and broken lives but as beings of flesh and blood we cannot visualize them and are in doubt even as to their race and of their minds or their philosophy of life we know absolutely nothing we are able as clifford has said in his cosmic emotion to shake hands with the ancient greeks across the great desert of centuries which divides our day from theirs but there is no shaking hands with these ancients of britainor albion seeing that we are on the chalk to our souls they are as strange as the builders of tiuhuanaco or mitla and itzana and the cyclopean ruins of zimbabwe and the carolines  it is thought by some of our modern investigators of psychic phenomena that apparitions result from the coming out of impressions left in the surrounding matter or perhaps in the ether pervading it especially in moments of supreme agitation or agony the apparition is but a restored picture and pictures of this sort are about us in millions but for our peace they are rarely visible as the ability to see them is the faculty of but a few persons in certain moods and certain circumstances here then if anywhere in england we or the persons who are endowed with this unpleasant gift might look for visions of the time when stonehenge was the spiritual capital the mecca of the faithful when all were that the meetingplace of all the intellect the hoary experience the power and majesty of the land  but no visions have been recorded it is true that certain stories of alleged visions have been circulated during the last few years one very pretty and touching is of a child from the london slums who saw things invisible to others this was one of the children of the very poor who are taken in summer and planted all about england in cottages to have a week or a fortnight of country air and sunshine taken to stonehenge she had a vision of a great gathering of people and so real did they seem that she believed in the reality of it all and so beautiful did they appear to her that she was reluctant to leave and begged to be taken back to see it all again unfortunately it is not true a full and careful inquiry has been made into the story of which there are several versions and its origin traced to a little storytelling wiltshire boy who had read or heard of the whiterobed priests of the ancient days at the stones and who just to astonish other little boys naughtily pretended that he had seen it all himself     chapter twentythree following a river   the stream invites us to follow the impulse is so common that it might be set down as an instinct and certainly there is no more fascinating pastime than to keep company with a river from its source to the sea unfortunately this is not easy in a country where running waters have been enclosed which should be as free as the rain and sunshine to all and were once free when england was england still before landowners annexed them even as they annexed or stole the commons and shut up the footpaths and made it an offence for a man to go aside from the road to feel gods grass under his feet well they have also got the road now and cover and blind and choke us with its dust and insolently hoothoot at us out of the way miserable crawlers if you dont want to be smashed  sometimes the way is cut off by huge thorny hedges and fences of barbed wiremans devilish improvement on the bramblebrought down to the waters edge the riverfollower must force his way through these obstacles in most cases greatly to the detriment of his clothes and temper or should they prove impassable he must undress and go into the water worst of all is the thought that he is a trespasser the pheasants crow loudly lest he should forget it occasionally too in these private places he encounters men in velveteens with guns under their arms and other men in tweeds and knickerbockers with or without guns and they all stare at him with amazement in their eyes like disturbed cattle in a pasture and sometimes they challenge him but i must say that although i have been sharply spoken to on several occasions always after a few words i have been permitted to keep on my way and on that way i intend to keep until i have no more strength to climb over fences and force my way through hedges but like a blind and wornout old badger must take to my earth and die  i found the exe easy to follow at first further on exceedingly difficult in places but i was determined to keep near it to have it behind me and before me and at my side following leading a beautiful silvery serpent that was my friend and companion for i was following not the exe only but a dream as well and a memory before i knew it the exe was a beloved stream many rivers had i seen in my wanderings but never one to compare with this visionary river which yet existed and would be found and followed at last my forefathers had dwelt for generations beside it listening all their lives long to its music and when they left it they still loved it in exile and died at last with its music in their ears nor did the connection end there their children and childrens children doubtless had some inherited memory of it or how came i to have this feeling which made it sacred and drew me to it we inherit not from our ancestors only but through them something too from the earth and place that knew them  i sought for and found it where it takes its rise on open exmoor a simple moorland stream not wild and foaming and leaping over rocks but flowing gently between low peaty banks where the little lambs leap over it from side to side in play following the stream down i come at length to exford here the aspect of the country begins to change it is not all brown desolate heath there are green flowery meadows by the river and some wood a little further down and the exe will be a woodland stream but of all the rest of my long walk i shall only say that to see the real beauty of this stream one must go to somerset from exford to dulverton it runs singing aloud foamflecked between high hills clothed to their summits in oak woods after its union with the barle it enters devonshire as a majestic stream and flows calmly through a rich green country its wild romantic charm has been left behind  the uninformed traveller whose principle it is never to look at a guidebook is surprised to find that the small village of exford contains no fewer than half a dozen inns he asks how they are kept going and the natives astonished at his ignorance proceed to enlighten him exford is the headquarters of the staghunt thither the hunters flock in august and spend so much money during thir brief season that the innkeepers grow rich and fat and for the rest of the year can afford to doze peacefully behind their bars here are the kennels and when i visited them they contained forty or fifty couples of staghounds these are gigantic foxhounds selected for their great size from packs all over the country when out exercising these big varicoloured dogs make a fine show it is curious to find that although these individual variations are continually appearingvery large dogs born of dogs of medium sizeothers cannot be bred from them the variety cannot be fixed  the village is not picturesque its one perennial charm is the swift river that flows through it making music on its wide sandy and pebbly floor hither and thither flit the wagtails finding little halfuncovered stones in the current to perch upon both the pied and grey species are there and seeing them together one naturally wishes to resettle for himself the old question as to which is the prettiest and most graceful now this one looks best and now that but the delicately coloured grey and yellow bird has the longest tail and can use it more prettily her tail is as much to her both as ornament and to express emotions as a fan to any flirtatious spanish senora one always thinks of these dainty feathered creatures as females it would seem quite natural to call the wagtail ladybird if that name had not been registered by a diminutive podgy tortoiseshaped black and red beetle  so shallow is the wide stream in the village that a little girl of about seven came down from a cottage and to cool her feet waded out into the middle and there she stood for some minutes on a low flat stone looking down on her own wavering image broken by a hundred hurrying wavelets and ripples this small maidie holding up her short shabby frock with her wee hands her bright brown hair falling over her face as she bent her head down and laughed to see her bare little legs and their flickering reflection beneath made a pretty picture like the wagtails she looked in harmony with her surroundings  so many are the villages towns and places of interest seen so many the adventures met with in this walk starting with the baby streamlet beyond simonsbath and following it down to exeter and exmouth that it would take half a volume to describe them however briefly yet at the end i found that exford had left the most vivid and lasting impression and was remembered with most pleasure it was more to me than winsford that fragrant cool grey and green village the home of immemorial peace second to no english village in beauty with its hoary church tower its great trees its old stone thatched cottages draped in ivy and vine its soothing sound of running waters exeter itself did not impress me so strongly in spite of its cathedral the village of exford printed itself thus sharply on my mind because i had there been filled with wonder and delight at the sight of a face exceeding in loveliness all the faces seen in that west countrya rarest human gem which had the power of imparting to its setting something of its own wonderful lustre the type was a common somerset one but with marked differences in some respects else it could not have been so perfect  the type i speak of is a very distinct one in a crowd in a london street you can easily spot a somerset man who has this mark on his countenance but it shows more clearly in the woman there are more types than one but the variety is less than in other places the women are more like each other and differ more from those that are outside their borders than is the case in other english counties a woman of this prevalent type to be met with anywhere from bath and bedminster to the wilds of exmoor is of a good height and has a pleasant often a pretty face regular features the nose straight rather long with thin nostrils eyes greyblue hair brown neither dark nor light in many cases with a sandy or sunburnt tint black golden reds chestnuts are rarely seen there is always colour in the skin but not deep as a rule it is a light tender brown with a rosy or reddish tinge altogether it is a winning face with smiling eyes there is more in it of that something we can call refinement than is seen in women of the same class in other counties the expression is somewhat infantile a young woman even a middleaged woman will frequently remind you of a little girl of seven or eight summers the innocent eyes and mobile mouth are singularly childlike this peculiarity is the more striking when we consider the figure this is not fully developed according to the accepted standards the hips are too small the chest too narrow and flat the arms too thin true or false the idea is formed of a woman of a childlike affectionate nature but lacking in passion one to be chosen for a sister rather than a wife something in usinstinct or traditionwill have it that the welldeveloped woman is richest in the purely womanly qualitiesthe wifely and maternal feelings the luxuriant types that abound most in devonshire are not common here  it will be understood that the women described are those that live in cottages here as elsewhere as you go higher in the social scalefurther from the soil as it werethe type becomes less and less distinct those of the higher class or better class are few and always in a sense foreigners     chapter twentyfour troston   i doubt if the name of this small suffolk village remote from towns and railroads will have any literary associations for the reader unless he be a person of exceptionally good memory who has taken a special interest in the minor poets of the last century or that it would help him if i add the names of honington and sapiston two other small villages a couple of miles from troston with the slow sedgy little ouse or a branch of it flowing between them yet honington was the birthplace of robert bloomfield known as the suffolk poet in the early part of the last century although crabbe was living then and was great as he is becoming again after many years while at sapiston the rustic village on the other side of the old stone bridge he acquired that love of nature and intimate knowledge of farm life and work which came out later in his farmers boy finally troston the little village in which i write was the home of capel lofft a person of importance in his day who discovered bloomfield found a publisher for his poems and boomed it with amazing success  i dare say it will only provoke a smile of amusement in readers of literary taste when i confess that bloomfields memory is dear to me that only because of this feeling for the forgotten rustic who wrote rhymes i am now here strolling about in the shade of the venerable trees in troston parkthe selfsame trees which the somewhat fantastic capel knew in his day as homer sophocles virgil milton and by other names calling each old oak elm ash and chestnut after one of the immortals  i can even imagine that the literary man if he chanced to be a personal friend would try to save me from myself by begging me not to put anything of this sort into print he would warn me that it matters nothing that bloomfields verse was exceedingly popular for a time that twentyfive or thirty editions of his farmers boy were issued within three years of its publication in 1800 that it continued to be read for half a century afterwards there are other better tests is it alive today what do judges of literature say of it now nothing they smile and thats all the absurdity of his popularity was felt in his own day byron laughed at it crabbe growled and charles lamb said he had looked at the farmers boy and it made him sick well nobody wants to look at it now  much more might be said very easily on this side nevertheless i think i shall go on with my plea for the small versemaker who has long fallen out and though i may be unable to make a case out the kindly critic may find some circumstance to extenuate my follyto say in the end that this appears to be one of the little foolishnesses which might be forgiven  i must confess at starting that the regard i have for one of his poems the farmers boy is not wholly a matter of literary taste or the critical faculty it is also to some extent a matter of associationand as the story of how this comes about is rather curious i will venture to give it  in the distant days of my boyhood and early youth my chief delight was in nature and when i opened a book it was to find something about nature in it especially some expression of the feeling produced in us by nature which was in my case inseparable from seeing and hearing and was to me the most important thing in life for who could look on earth water sky on living or growing or inanimate things without experiencing that mysterious uplifting gladness in him in due time i discovered that the thing i sought for in printed books was to be found chiefly in poetry that half a dozen lines charged with poetic feeling about nature often gave me more satisfaction than a whole volume of prose on such subjects unfortunately this kind of literature was not obtainable in my early home on the then semiwild pampas there were a couple of hundred volumes on the shelvestheology history biography philosophy science travels essays and some old forgotten fiction but no verse was there except shenstone in a small shabby coverless volume this i read and reread until i grew sick of bright roxana tripping oer the green or of gentle delia when a tear bedews her eye to think yon playful kid must die to my uncultivated mindfor i had never been at school and lived in the open air with the birds and beaststhis seemed intolerably artificial for i was like a hungry person who has nothing but kickshaws put before him and eats because he is hungry until he loathes a food which in its taste confounds the appetite never since those distant days have i looked at a shenstone or even seen his name in print or heard it spoken without a slight return of that old sensation of nausea if shenstone alone had come to me the desire for poetry would doubtless have been outlived early in life but there were many passages some very long from the poets in various books on the shelves and these kept my appetite alive there was browns philosophy for example and brown loved to illustrate his point with endless poetic quotations the only drawback in my case being that they were almost exclusively drawn from akenside who was not rural but there were other books in which other poets were quoted and of all these the passages which invariably pleased me most were the descriptions of rural sights and sounds  one day during a visit to the city of buenos ayres i discovered in a mean street in the southern part of the town a secondhand bookshop kept by an old snuffy spectacled german in a long shabby black coat i remember him well because he was a very important person to me it was the first shop of the kind i had seeni doubt if there was another in the town and to be allowed to rummage by the hour among this mass of old books on the dusty shelves and heaped on the brick floor was a novel and delightful experience the books were mostly in spanish french and german but there were some in english and among them i came upon thomsons seasons i remember the thrill of joy i experienced when i snatched up the small thin octavo in its smooth calf binding it was the first book in english i ever bought and to this day when i see a copy of the seasons on a bookstall which is often enough i cannot keep my fingers off it and find it hard to resist the temptation to throw a couple of shillings away and take it home if shillings had not been wanted for bread and cheese i should have had a roomful of copies by now  few books have given me more pleasure and as i still return to it from time to time i do not suppose i shall ever outgrow the feeling in spite of its having been borne in on me when i first conversed with readers of poetry in england that thomson is no longer readthat he is unreadable  after such a find i naturally went back many times to burrow in that delightful rubbish heap and was at length rewarded by the discovery of yet another poem of rural englandthe farmers boy i was prepared to like it for although i did not know anything about the authors early life the few passages i had come across in quotations in james rennies and other old natural history compilations had given me a strong desire to read the whole poem i certainly did like itthis quiet description in verse of a green spot in england my spiritual country which so far as i knew i was never destined to see and that i continue to like it is as i have said the reason of my being in this place  while thus freely admitting that the peculiar circumstances of the case caused me to value this poem and in fact made it very much more to me than it could be to persons born in england with all its poetical literature to browse on i am at the same time convinced that this is not the sole reason for my regard  i take it that the farmers boy is poetry not merely slightly poetized prose in the form of verse although it is undoubtedly poetry of a very humble order  mere descriptions of rural scenes do not demand the higher qualities of the poetimagination and passion the lower kind of inspiration is in fact often better suited to such themes and shows nature by the common light of day as it were instead of revealing it as by a succession of lightning flashes even among those who confine themselves to this lower plane bloomfield is not great his small flame is constantly sinking and flickering out but at intervals it burns up again and redeems the work from being wholly commonplace and trivial he is in fact no better than many another small poet who has been devoured by time since his day and whose work no person would now attempt to bring back it is probable too that many of these lesser singers whose fame was brief would in their day have deeply resented being placed on a level with the suffolk peasantpoet in spite of all this and of the impossibility of saving most of the verse which is only passably good from oblivion i still think the farmers boy worth preserving for more reasons than one but chiefly because it is the only work of its kind  there is no lack of rural poetrythe seasons to begin with and much thomsonian poetry besides treating of nature in a general way then we have innumerable detached descriptions of actual scenes such as we find scattered throughout cowpers task and numberless other works besides all this there are the countless shorter poems each conveying an impression of some particular scene or aspect of nature the poet of the open air like the landscape painter is ever on the look out for picturesque bits and atmospheric effects as a subject in bloomfield we get something altogether differenta simple consistent and fairly complete account of the country peoples toilsome life in a remote agricultural district in englanda small rustic village set amid green and arable fields woods and common lands we have it from the inside by one who had part in it born and bred to the humble life he described and finally it is not given as a full daytoday recordphotographed as we may saywith all the minute unessential details and repetitions but as it appeared when looked back upon from a distance reliving it in memory the sights and sounds and events which had impressed the boys mind standing vividly out of this lowly poem it may be truly said that it is emotion recollected in tranquillity to use the phrase invented by wordsworth when he attempted a definition of poetry generally and signally failed as coleridge demonstrated  it will be said that the facts of bloomfields lifethat he was a farmers boy whose daily tasks were to scare the crows feed the pigs and forty things besides and that later when learning the shoemakers trade in a london garret he put these memories together and made them into a poemare wholly beside the question when we come to judge the work as literature a peasant poet may win a great reputation in his own day on account of the circumstances of the case but in the end his work must be tried by the same standards applied in other and in all cases  there is no getting away from this and all that remains is to endeavour to show that the poem although poor as a whole is not altogether bad but contains many lines that glow with beautiful poetic feeling and many descriptive passages which are admirable furthermore i will venture to say that despite the feebleness of a large part of the work as poetry it is yet worth preserving in its entirety on account of its unique character it may be that i am the only person in england able to appreciate it so fully owing to the way in which it first came to my notice and the critical reader can if he thinks proper discount what i am now saying as mere personal feeling but the case is this when in a distant region of the world i sought for and eagerly read anything i could find relating to country scenes and life in englandthe land of my desirei was never able to get an extended and congruous view of it with a sense of the continuity in human and animal life in its relation to nature it was all broken up into pieces or bits it was in detached scenes vividly reproduced to the inner eye in many cases but unrelated and unharmonized like framed pictures of rural subjects hanging on the walls of a room even the seasons failed to supply this want since thomson in his great work is of no place and abides nowhere but ranges on eagles wings over the entire land and for the matter of that over the whole globe but i did get it in the farmers boy i visualized the whole scene the entire harmonious life i was with him from morn till eve always in that same green country with the same sky cloudy or serene above me in the rustic village at the small church with a thatched roof where the daws nested in the belfry and the children played and shouted among the gravestones in the churchyard in woods and green and ploughed fields and the deep laneswith him and his fellowtoilers and the animals domestic and wild regarding their life and actions from day to day through all the vicissitudes of the year  the poem then appears to fill a place in our poetic literature or to fill a gap at all events from the point of view of those who born and living in distant parts of the earth still dream of the old home this perhaps accounts for the fact which i heard at honington that most of the pilgrims to bloomfields birthplace are americans  bloomfield followed his great example in dividing his poem into the four seasons and he begins thomsonlike with an invitation to the muse     o come blest spirit whatsoeer thou art    thou kindling warmth that hovrest round my heart  but happily he does not attempt to imitate the lofty diction of the seasons or windsor forest the noble poem from which i imagine thomson derived his sonorous style he had a humble mind and knew his limitations and though he adopted the artificial form of verse which prevailed down to his time he was still able to be simple and natural  spring does not contain much of the best of his work but the opening is graceful and is not without a touch of pathos in his apologetic description of himself as giles the farmers boy     natures sublimer scenes neer charmed my eyes    nor science led me    from meaner objects far my raptures flow    quickspringing sorrows transient as the dew    delight from trifles trifles ever new    twas thus with giles meek fatherless and poor    labour his portion    his life was cheerful constant servitude    strange to the world he wore a bashful look    the fields his study nature was his book  the farm is described the farmer his kind hospitable master the animals the sturdy team the cows and the small flock of forescore ewes ploughing sowing and harrowing are described and the result left to the powers above     yet oft with anxious heart he looks around    and marks the first green blade that breaks the ground    in fancy sees his trembling oats uprun    his tufted barley yellow with the sun  while his master dreams of what will be giles has enough to do protecting the buried grain from thieving rooks and crows one of the multifarious tasks being to collect the birds that have been shot for although     their danger well the wary plunderers know    and place a watch on some conspicuous bough    yet oft the skulking gunner by surprise    will scatter death among them as they rise  tis useless he tells us to hang these slain robbers about the fields since in a little while they are no more regarded than the men of rags and straw with sham rifles in their hands it was for him to shift the dead from place to place to arrange them in dying attitudes with outstretched wings finally there was the fox the stealer of dead crows to be guarded against and again at eventide giles must trudge round to gather up his dead and suspend them from twigs out of reach of hungry nightprowlers called up at daybreak each morning he would take his way through deep lanes overarched with oaks to fields remote from home to redistribute his dead birds then to fetch the cows and here we have an example of his close naturalistlike observation in his account of the leading cow the one who coming and going on all occasions is allowed precedence who maintains her station won by many a broil with just pride a picture of the cool dairy and its work succeeds and a lament on the effect of the greed and luxury of the overpopulous capital which drains the whole countryside of all produce which makes the suffolk dairywives run mad for cream leaving nothing but the threetimes skimmed skyblue to make cheese for local consumption what a cheese it is that has the virtue of a post which turns the stoutest blade and is at last flung in despair into the hogtrough where                   it rests in perfect spite    too big to swallow and too hard to bite  we then come to the sheep for giles was shepherd too and here there is more evidence of his observant eye when he describes the character of the animals also in what follows about the young lambs which forms the best passage in this part i remember that when first reading it being then little past boyhood myself how much i was struck by the vivid beautiful description of a crowd of young lambs challenging each other to a game especially at a spot where they have a mound or hillock for a playground which takes them with a sort of goatlike joyous madness for how often in those days i used to ride out to where the flock of one to two thousand sheep were scattered on the plain to sit on my pony and watch the glad romps of the little lambs with keenest delight i cannot but think that bloomfields fidelity to nature in such pictures as these does or should count for something in considering his work he concludes     adown the slope then up the hillock climb    where every molehill is a bed of thyme    then panting stop yet scarcely can refrain    a bird a leaf will set them off again    or if a gale with strength unusual blow    scattering the wildbriar roses into snow    their little limbs increasing efforts try    like a torn rose the fair assemblage fly  this image of the windscattered petals of the wild rose reminds him bitterly of the destined end of these joyous young liveshis whitefleeced little fellowmortals he sees the murdering butcher coming in his cart to demand the firstlings of the flock he cannot suppress a cry of grief and indignationhe can only strive to shut out the shocking image from his soul  summer opens with some reflections on the farmers life in a prosy crabbelike manner and here it may be noted that as a rule bloomfield no sooner attempts to rise to a general view than he grows flat and in like manner he usually fails when he attempts wide prospects and large effects he is at his best only when describing scenes and incidents at the farm in which he himself is a chief actor as in this part when after the sowing of the turnip seed he is sent out to keep the small birds from the ripening corn     there thousands in a flock for ever gay    loud chirping sparrows welcome on the day    and from the mazes of the leafy thorn    drop one by one upon the bending corn  giles trudging along the borders of the field scares them with his brushingpole until overcome by fatigue and heat he takes a rest by the brakes and lying half in sun and half in shade his attention is attracted to the minute insect life that swarms about him     the small dustcoloured beetle climbs with pain    oer the smooth plantain leaf a spacious plain    then higher still by countless steps conveyed    he gains the summit of a shivering blade    and flirts his filmy wings and looks around    exulting in his distance from the ground  it is one of his little exquisite pictures presently his vision is called to the springing lark     just starting from the corn he cheerly sings    and trusts with conscious pride his downy wings    still louder breathes and in the face of day    mounts up and calls on giles to mark his way    close to his eye his hat he instant bends    and forms a friendly telescope that lends    just aid enough to dull the glaring light    and place the wandering bird before his sight    that oft beneath a light cloud sweeps along    lost for a while yet pours a varied song    the eye still follows and the cloud moves by    again he stretches up the clear blue sky    his form his motions undistinguished quite    save when he wheels direct from shade to light  in the end he falls asleep and waking refreshed picks up his poles and starts again brushing round  harvesting scenes succeed with a picture of mary the village beauty taking her share in the work and how the labourers in their unwonted liveliness and newfound wit            confess the presence of a pretty face  she is very rustic herself in her appearance     her hat awry divested of her gown    her creaking stays of leather stout and brown    invidious barrier  why art thou so high    when the slight covering of her neck slips by    then half revealing to the eager sight    her full ripe bosom exquisitely white  the leather stays have no doubt gone the way of many other dreadful things even in the most rustic villages in the land not so the barbarous practice of docking horses tails against which he protests in this place when describing the summer plague of flies and the excessive sufferings of the domestic animals especially of the poor horses deprived of their only defence against such an enemy at his own little farm there was yet another plague in the form of an old brokenwinged gander the pest and tryant of the yard whose unpleasant habit it was to go for the beasts and seize them by the fetlocks the swine alone did not resent the attacks but welcomed them receiving the assaults as caresses and stretching themselves out and lying down and closing their pigs eyes they would emit grunts of satisfaction while the triumphant bird followed by the whole gabbling flock would trample on the heads of their prostrate foes  autumn opens bravely     again the years decline midst storms and floods    the thundring chase the yellow fading woods    invite my song  it contains two of the best things in the poem the first in the opening part describing the swine in the acorn season a delightful picture which must be given in full     no more the fields with scattered grain supply    the restless tenants of the sty    from oak to oak they run with eager haste    and wrangling share the first delicious taste    of fallen acorns yet but thinly found    till a strong gale has shook them to the ground    it comes and roaring woods obedient wave    their home well pleased the joint adventurers leave    the trudging sow leads forth her numerous young    playful and white and clean the briars among    till briars and thorns increasing fence them round    where last years mouldring leaves bestrew the ground    and oer their heads loud lashed by furious squalls    bright from their cups the rattling treasure falls    hot thirsty food whence doubly sweet and cool    the welcome margin of some rushgrown pool    the wild ducks lonely haunt whose jealous eye    guards every point who sits prepared to fly    on the calm bosom of her little lake    too closely screened for ruffian winds to shake    and as the bold intruders press around    at once she starts and rises with a bound    with bristles raised the sudden noise they hear    and ludicrously wild and winged with fear    the herd decamp with more than swinish speed    and snorting dash through sedge and rush and reed    through tangled thickets headlong on they go    then stop and listen for their fancied foe    the hindmost still the growing panic spreads    repeated fright the first alarm succeeds    till follys wages wounds and thorns they reap    yet glorying in their fortunate escape    their groundless terrors by degrees soon cease    and nights dark reign restores their peace    for now the gale subsides and from each bough    the roosting pheasants short but frequent crow    invites to rest and huddling side by side    the herd in closest ambush seek to hide    seek some warm slope with shagged moss oerspread    dried leaves their copious covering and their bed    in vain may giles through gathering glooms that fall    and solemn silence urge his piercing call    whole days and nights they tarry midst their store    nor quit the woods till oaks can yield no more  it is a delightful passage to one that knows a pigthe animal we respect for its intelligence holding it in this respect higher more human than the horse and at the same time laugh at on account of certain ludicrous points about it as for example its liability to lose its head thousands of years of comfortable domestic life have failed to rid it of this inconvenient heritage from the time when wild in woods it ran yet in this particular instance the terror of the swine does not seem wholly inexcusable if we know a wild duck as well as a pig especially the duck that takes to haunting a solitary woodland pool who when intruded on springs up with such a sudden tremendous splash and flutter of wings and outrageous screams that man himself if not prepared for it may be thrown off his balance  passing over other scenes about one hundred and fifty lines we come to the second notable passage when after the sowing of the winter wheat poor giles once more takes up his old occupation of rookscaring it is now as in spring and summer     keen blows the blast and ceaseless rain descends    the halfstripped hedge a sorry shelter lends  and he thinks it would be nice to have a hovel no matter how small to take refuge in and at once sets about its construction     in some sequestered nook embanked around    sods for its walls and straw in burdens bound    dried fuel hoarded is his richest store    and circling smoke obscures his little door    whence creeping forth to dutys call he yields    and strolls the crusoe of the lonely fields    on whitehorn towring and the leafless rose    a frostnipped feast in bright vermilion glows    where clustring sloes in glossy order rise    he crops the loaded branch a cumbrous prize    and on the flame the spluttring fruit he rests    placing green sods to seat the coming guests    his guests by promise playmates young and gay    but ah fresh pastures lure their steps away    he sweeps his hearth and homeward looks in vain    till feeling disappointments cruel pain    his fairy revels are exchanged for rage    his banquet marred grown dull his hermitage    the field becomes his prison till on high    benighted birds to shades and coverts fly  the field becomes his prison and the thought of this trivial restraint which is yet felt so poignantly brings to mind an infinitely greater one look he says     from the poor birdboy with his roasted sloes  to the miserable state of those who are confined in dungeons deprived of daylight and the sight of the green earth whose minds perpetually travel back to happy scenes     trace and retrace the beaten wornout way  whose chief bitterness it is to be forgotten and see no familiar friendly face  winter is i think the best of the four parts it gives the idea that the poem was written as it stands from spring onwards that by the time he got to the last part the writer had acquired a greater ease and assurance at all events it is less patchy and more equal it is also more sober in tone as befits the subject and opens with an account of the domestic animals on the farm their increased dependence on man and the compassionate feelings they evoke in us he is we feel dealing with realities always from the point of view of a boy of sensitive mina and tender heartone taken in boyhood from this life before it had wrought any change in him for in due time the farm boy however fine his spirit may be must harden and grow patient and stolid in heat and cold and wet like the horse that draws the plough or cart and as he hardens he grows callous in his wretched london garret if any change came to him it was only to an increased love and pity for the beasts he had lived among who looked and cried to him to be fed he describes it well the frost and bitter cold the hungry cattle following the cart to the fields the load of turnips thrown out on the hard frozen ground but the turnips too are frozen hard and they cannot eat them until giles following with his beetle splits them up with vigorous blows and the cows gather close round him sending out a cloud of steam from their nostrils  the dim short winter day soon ends but the sound of the flails continues in the barns till long after dark before the weary labourers end their task and trudge home giles too is busy at this time taking hay to the housed cattle many a sweet mouthful being snatched from the load as he staggers beneath it on his way to the racks then follow the wellearned hours of warmth and rest by the fire in the big old kitchen which he describes     for the rude architect unknown to fame    nor symmetry nor elegance his aim    who spread his floors of solid oak on high    on beams roughhewn from age to age that lie    bade his wide fabric unimpaired sustain    the orchards store and cheese and golden grain    bade from its central base capacious laid    the wellwrought chimney rear its lofty head    where since hath many a savoury ham been stored    and tempests howled and christmas gambols roared  the tired ploughman steeped in luxurious heat by and by falls asleep and dreams sweetly until his chilblains or the snapping fire awakes him and he pulls himself up and goes forth yawning to give his team their last feed his lantern throwing a feeble gleam on the snow as he makes his way to the stable having completed his task he pats the sides of those he loves best by way of goodnight and leaves them to their fragrant meal and this kindly action on his part suggests one of the best passages of the poem even old wellfed dobbin occasionally rebels against his slavery and released from his chains will lift his clumsy hoofs and kick disdainful of the dirty wheel shortsighted dobbin     thy chains were freedom and thy toils repose    could the poor posthorse tell thee all his woes    show thee his bleeding shoulders and unfold    the dreadful anguish he endures for gold    hired at each call of business lust or rage    that prompts the traveller on from stage to stage    still on his strength depends their boasted speed    for them his limbs grow weak his bare ribs bleed    and though he groaning quickens at command    their extra shilling in the riders hand    becomes his bitter scourge  the description too long to quote which follows of the tortures inflicted on the posthorse a century ago is almost incredible to us and we flatter ourselves that such things would not be tolerated now but we must get over the ground somehow and i take it that but for the invention of other more rapid means of transit the present generation would be as little concerned at the pains of the posthorse as they are at the horrors enacted behind the closed doors of the physiological laboratories the atrocity of the steel trap the continual murdering by our big game hunters of all the noblest animals left on the globe and finally the annual massacre of millions of beautiful birds in their breeding time to provide ornaments for the hats of our women  come forth he must says bloomfield when he describes how the flogged horse at length gains the end of the stage and trembling under complicated pains when every nerve a separate anguish knows he is finally unharnessed and led to the stable door but has scarcely tasted food and rest before he is called for again                       though limping maimed and sore    he hears the whip the chaise is at the door    the collar tightens and again he feels    his halfhealed wounds inflamed again the wheels    with tiresome sameness in his ears resound    oer blinding dust or miles of flinty ground  this is over and done with simply because the posthorse is no longer wanted and we have to remember that no form of cruelty inflicted whether for sport or profit or from some other motive on the lower animals has ever died out of itself in the land its end has invariably been brought about by legislation through the devotion of men who were the cranks the faddists the sentimentalists of their day who were jeered and laughed at by their fellows and who only succeeded by sheer tenacity and force of character after long fighting against public opinion and a reluctant parliament in finally getting their law  bloomfields was but a small voice crying in the wilderness and he was indeed a small singer in the day of our greatest singers as a poet he was not worthy to unloose the buckles of their shoes but he had one thing in common with the best and greatest the feeling of tender love and compassion for the lower animals which was in thomson and cowper but found its highest expression in his own great contemporaries coleridge shelley and wordsworth in virtue of this feeling he was of their illustrious brotherhood  in conclusion i will quote one more passage from the subject of horses he passes to that of dogs and their occasional reversion to wildness when the mastiff or cur the faithful housedog by day takes to sheepkilling by night as a rule he is exceedingly cunning committing his depredations at a distance frown home and after getting his fill of slaughter he sneaks home in the early hours to spend the day in his kennel licking his guilty paws this is an anxious time for shepherds and farmers and poor giles is compelled to pay late evening visits to his small flock of heavysided ewes penned in their distant fold it is a comfort to him to have a full moon on these lonely expeditions and despite his tremors he is able to appreciate the beauty of the scene     with sauntring steps he climbs the distant stile    whilst all around him wears a placid smile    there views the whiterobed clouds in clusters driven    and all the glorious pageantry of heaven    low on the utmost boundry of the sight    the rising vapours catch the silver light    thence fancy measures as they parting fly    which first will throw its shadow on the eye    passing the source of light and thence away    succeeded quick by brighter still than they    for yet above the wafted clouds are seen    in a remoter sky still more serene    others detached in ranges through the air    spotless as snow and countless as theyre fair    scattered immensely wide from east to west    the beauteous semblance of a flock at rest  this is almost the only passage in the poem in which something of the vastness of visible nature is conveyed he saw the vastness only in the sky on nights with a full moon or when he made a telescope of his hat to watch the flight of the lark it was not a hilly country about his native place and his horizon was a very limited one usually bounded by the hedgerow timber at the end of the level field the things he depicts were seen at short range and the poetry we see was of a very modest kind it was a humble note which pleased me in the days of long ago when i was young and very ignorant and as it pleases me still it may be supposed that mentally i have not progressed with the years nevertheless i am not incapable of appreciating the greater music all that is said in its praise even to the extremest expressions of admiration of those who are moved to a sense of wonder by it find an echo in me but it is not only a delight to me to listen to the lark singing at heavens gate and to the vesper nightingale in the oak copsethe singer of a golden throat and wondrous artistry i also love the smaller vocaliststhe modest shufewing and the lesser whitethroat and the yellowhammer with his simple chant these are very dear to me their strains do not strike me as trivial they have a lesser distinction of their own and i would not miss them from the choir the literary man will smile at this and say that my paper is naught but an idle exercise but i fancy i shall sleep the better tonight for having discharged this ancient debt which has been long on my conscience     chapter twentyfive my friend jack   my friend rack is a retrieververy black very curly perfect in shape but just a retriever and he is really not my friend only he thinks he is which comes to the same thing so convinced is he that i am his guide protector and true master that if i were to give him a downright scolding or even a thrashing he would think it was all right and go on just the same his way of going on is to make a companion of me whether i want him or not i do not want him but his idea is that i want him very much i bitterly blame myself for having made the first advances although nothing came of it except that he growled i met him in a cornish village in a house where i stayed there was a nice kennel there painted green with a bed of clean straw and an empty plate which had contained his dinner but on peeping in i saw no dog next day it was the same and the next and the day after that then i inquired about itwas there a dog in that house or not oh yes certainly there was jack but a very independent sort of dog on most days he looked in ate his dinner and had a nap on his straw but he was not what you would call a homekeeping dog  one day i found him in and after we had looked for about a minute at each other i squatting before the kennel he with chin on paws pretending to be looking through me at something beyond i addressed a few kind words to him which he received with the beforementioned growl i pronounced him a surly brute and went away it was growl for growl nevertheless i was well pleased at having escaped the consequences in speaking kindly to him i am not a doggy person nor even a canophilist the purely parasitic or degenerate pet dog moves me to compassion but the natural vigorous outdoor dog i fear and avoid because we are not in harmony consequently i suffer and am a loser when he forces his company on me the outdoor world i live in is not the one to which a man goes for a constitutional with a dog to save him from feeling lonely or if he has a gun with a dog to help him kill something it is a world which has sound in it distant cries and penetrative calls and low mysterious notes as of insects and corncrakes and frogs chirping and of grasshopper warblerssounds like wind in the dry sedges and there are also sweet and beautiful songs but it is very quiet world where creatures move about subtly on wings on polished scales on softly padded feetrabbits foxes stoats weasels and voles and birds and lizards and adders and slowworms also beetles and dragonflies many are at enmity with each other but on account of their quietude there is no disturbance no outcry and rushing into hiding and having acquired this habit from them i am able to see and be with them the sitting bird the frolicking rabbit the basking adderthey are as little disturbed at my presence as the butterfly that drops down close to my feet to sun his wings on a leaf or frond and makes me hold my breath at the sight of his divine colour as if he had just fluttered down from some brighter realm in the sky think of a dog in this world intoxicated with the odours of so many wild creatures dashing and splashing through bogs and bushes it is ten times worse than a bull in a chinashop the bull can but smash a lot of objects made of baked clay the dog introduces a mad panic in a world of living intelligent beings a fairy realm of exquisite beauty they scuttle away and vanish into hiding as if a deadly wind had blown over the earth and swept them out of existence only the birds remainthey can fly and do not fear for their own lives but are in a state of intense anxiety about their eggs and young among the bushes which he is dashing through or exploring  i had good reason then to congratulate myself on jacks surly behaviour on our first meeting then a few days later a curious thing happened jack was discovered one morning in his kennel and when spoken to came or rather dragged himself out a most pitiable object he was horribly bruised and sore all over his bones appeared to be all broken he was limp and could hardly get on his feet and in that miserable condition he continued for some three days  at first we thought he had been in a big fighthe was inclined that way his master saidbut we could discover no tooth marks or lacerations nothing but bruises perhaps we said he had fallen into the hands of some cruel person in one of the distant moorland farms who had tied him up then thrashed him with a big stick and finally turned him loose to die on the moor or crawl home if he could his master looked so black at this that we said no more about it but jack was a wonderfully tough dog all gristle i think and after three days of lying there like a dead dog he quickly recovered though im quite sure that if his injuries had been distributed among any halfdozen pampered or pet dogs it would have killed them all a morning came when the kennel was empty jack was not deadhe was well again and as usual out  just then i was absent for a week or ten days then back again i went out one fine morning for a long days ramble along the coast a mile or so from home happening to glance back i caught sight of a black dogs face among the bushes thirty or forty yards away gazing earnestly at me it was jack of course nothing but his head visible in an opening among the bushesa black head which looked as if carved in ebony in a wonderful setting of shining yellow furze blossoms the beauty and singularity of the sight made it impossible for me to be angry with him though theres nothing a man more resents than being shadowed or secretly followed and spied upon even by a dog so without considering what i was letting myself in for i cried out jack and instantly he bounded out and came to my side then flew on ahead well pleased to lead the way  i must suffer him this time i said resignedly and went on he always ahead acting as my scout and hunterselfappointed of course but as i had not ordered him back in trumpet tones and hurled a rock at him to enforce the command he took it that he was appointed by me he certainly made the most of his position no one could say that he was lacking in zeal he scoured the country to the right and left and far in advance of me crashing through furze thickets and splashing across bogs and streams spreading terror where he went and leaving nothing for me to look at so it went on until after one oclock when tired and hungry i was glad to go down into a small fishing cove to get some dinner in a cottage i knew jack threw himself down on the floor and shared my meal then made friends with the fishermans wife and got a second meal of saffron cake which being a cornish dog he thoroughly enjoyed  the second half of the day was very much like the first altogether a blank day for me although a very full one for jack who had filled a vast number of wild creatures with terror furiously hunted a hundred or more and succeeded in killing two or three  jack was impossible and would never be allowed to follow me again so i sternly said and so thought but when the time came and i found him waiting for me his brown eyes bright with joyful anticipation i could not scowl at him and thunder out no i could not help putting myself in his place for here he was a dog of boundless energy who must exercise his powers or be miserable with nothing in the village for him except to witness the not very exciting activities of others and that i discovered had been his life he was mad to do something and because there was nothing for him to do his time was mostly spent in going about the village to keep an eye on the movements of the people especially of those who did the work always with the hope that his services might be required in some way by some one he was grateful for the smallest crumbs so to speak housework and work about the housemilking feeding the pigs and so ondid not interest him nor would he attend the labourers in the fields harvest time would make a difference now it was ploughing sowing and hoeing with nothing for jack but he was always down at the fishing cove to see the boats go out or come in and join in the excitement when there was a good catch it was still better when the boat went with provisions to the lighthouse or to relieve the keeper for then jack would go too and if they would not have him he would plunge into the waves and swim after it until the sails were hoisted and it flew like a great gull from him and he was compelled to swim back to land if there was nothing else to do he would go to the stone quarry and keep the quarrymen company sharing their dinner and hunting away the cows and donkeys that came too near then at six oclock he would turn up at the cricketfield where a few young enthusiasts would always attend to practise after working hours  living this way jack was of course known to everybodyas well known as the burly parson the tall policeman and the lazy girl who acted as postman and strolled about the parish once a day delivering the letters when jack trotted down the village street he received as many greetings as any human inhabitanthullo jack or morning jack or where be going jack  but all this variety and all he could do to fit himself into and be a part of the village life and fill up his time did not satisfy him happiness for jack was out on the moorits lonely wet thorny places pregnant with fascinating scents not of flowers and odorous herbs but of alert warmblooded and swiftfooted creatures and i was going therewould i could i be so heartless as to refuse to take him  you see that jack being a dog could not go there alone he was a social being by instinct as well as training dependent on others or on the one who was his head and master his human master or the man who took him out and spoke to him in a tone of authority represented the head of the packthe leading dog for the time being albeit a dog that walked on his hind legs and spoke a bowwow dialect of his own  i thought of all this and of many things besides the dog i remembered was taken by man out of his own world and thrust into one where he can never adapt himself perfectly to the conditions and it was consequently nothing more than simple justice on my part to do what i could to satisfy his desire even at some cost to myself but while i was revolving the matter in my mind feeling rather unhappy about it jack was quite happy since he had nothing to revolve for him it was all settled and done with having taken him out once i must go on taking him out always our two lives hitherto running aparthis in the village where he occupied himself with uncongenial affairs mine on the moor where having but two legs to run on i could catch no rabbitswere now united in one current to our mutual advantage his habits were altered to suit the new life he stayed in now so as not to lose me when i went for a walk and when returning instead of going back to his kennel he followed me in and threw himself down all wet on the rug before the fire his master and mistress came in and stared in astonishment it was against the rules of the house they ordered him out and he looked at them without moving then they spoke again very sharply indeed and he growled a low buzzing growl without lifting his chin from his paws and they had to leave him he had transferred his allegiance to a new master and head of the pack he was under my protection and felt quite safe if i had taken any part in that scene it would have been to order those two persons who had once lorded it over him out of the room  i didnt really mind his throwing over his master and taking possession of the rug in my sittingroom but i certainly did very keenly resent his behaviour towards the birds every morning at breakfasttime it was my chief pleasure to feed them during the bad weather and it was often a difficult task even before jack came on the scene to mix himself in my affairs the lands end is i believe the windiest place in the world and when i opened the window and threw the scraps out the wind would catch and whirl them away like so many feathers over the garden wall and i could not see what became of them it was necessary to go out by the kitchen door at the back the front door facing the sea being impossible and scatter the food on the lawn and then go into watch the result from behind the window the blackbirds and thrushes would wait for a lull to fly in over the wall while the daws would hover overhead and sometimes succeed in dropping down and seizing a crust but often enough when descending they would be caught and whirled away by the blast the poor magpies found their long tails very much against them in the scramble and it was even worse with the pied wagtail he would go straight for the bread and get whirled and tossed about the smooth lawn like a toy bird made of feathers his tail blown over his head it was bad enough and then jack curious about these visits to the lawn came to investigate and finding the scraps proceeded to eat them all up i tried to make him understand better by feeding him before i fed the birds then by scolding and even hitting him but he would not see it he knew better than i did he wasnt hungry and he didnt want bread but he would eat it all the same every scrap of it just to prevent it from being wasted jack was doubtless both vexed and amused at my simplicity in thinking that all this food which i put on the lawn would remain there undevoured by those useless creatures the birds until it was wanted  even this i forgave him for i saw that he had not that with his dog mind he could not understand me i also remembered the words of a wise old cornish writer with regard to the mind of the lower animals but their faculties of mind are no less proportioned to their state of subjection than the shape and properties of their bodies they have knowledge peculiar to their several spheres and sufficient for the underpart they have to act  let me be free from the delusion that it is possible to raise them above this level or in other words to add an inch to their mental stature i have nothing to forgive jack after all and so in spite of everything jack was suffered at home and accompanied me again and again in my walks abroad and there were more blank days or if not altogether blank seeing that there was jack himself to be observed and thought about they were not the kind of days i had counted on having my only consolation was that jack failed to capture more than one out of every hundred or perhaps five hundred of the creatures he hunted and that i was even able to save a few of these but i could not help admiring his tremendous energy and courage especially in cliffclimbing when we visited the headlandsthose stupendous masses and lofty piles of granite which rise like castles built by giants of old he would almost make me tremble for his life when after climbing on to some projecting rock he would go to the extreme end and look down over it as if it pleased him to watch the big waves break in foam on the black rocks a couple of hundred feet below but it was not the big green waves or any sight in nature that drew himhe sniffed and sniffed and wriggled and twisted his black nose and raised and depressed his ears as he sniffed and was excited solely because the upward currents of air brought him tidings of living creatures that lurked in the rocks belowbadger and fox and rabbit one day when quitting one of these places on looking up i spied jack standing on the summit of a precipice about seventyfive feet high jack saw me and waved his tail and then started to come straight down to me from the top a faint rabbit track was visible winding downwards to within twentyfour feet of the ground the rest was a sheer wall of rock down he dashed faster and faster as he got to where the track ended and then losing his footing he fell swiftly to the earth but luckily dropped on a deep spongy turf and was not hurt after witnessing this reckless act i knew how he had come by those frightful bruises on a former occasion he had doubtless fallen a long way down a cliff and had been almost crushed on the stones but the lesson was lost on jack he would have it that where rabbits and foxes went he could go  after all the chief pleasure those blank bad days had for me was the thought that jack was as happy as he could well be but it was not enough to satisfy me and by and by it came into my mind that i had been long enough at that place it was hard to leave jack who had put himself so entirely in my hands and trusted me so implicitly butthe weather was keeping very bad was there ever known such a june as this of 1907 so wet and windy and cold then too the bloom had gone from the furze it was i remembered to witness this chief loveliness that i came looking on the wide moor and faroff boulderstrewn hills and seeing how rusty the bushes were i quoted     the bloom has gone and with the bloom go i  and early in the morning with all my belongings on my back i stole softly forth glancing apprehensively in the direction of the kennel and out on to the windy road it was painful to me to have to decamp in this way it made me think meanly of myself but if jack could read this and could speak his mind i think he would acknowledge that my way of bringing the connection to an end was best for both of us i was not the person or dog on two legs he had taken me for one with a proper desire to kill things i only acted according to my poor lights nothing then remains to be said except that one word which it was not convenient to speak on the windy morning of my departuregoodbye jack
