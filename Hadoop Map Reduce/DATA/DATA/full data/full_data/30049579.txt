the blue and white room in the house of the misses susan and phoebe throssel in quality street and in this little country town there is a satisfaction about living in quality street which even religion cannot give  through the bowed window at the back we have a glimpse of the street  it is pleasantly broad and grassgrown and is linked to the outer world by one demure shop whose door rings a bell every time it opens and shuts  thus by merely peeping every one in quality street can know at once who has been buying a whimsy cake and usually why  this bell is the most familiar sound of quality street now and again ladies pass in their pattens a maid perhaps protecting them with an umbrella for flakes of snow are falling discreetly gentlemen in the street are an event but see just as we raise the curtain there goes the recruiting sergeant to remind us that we are in the period of the napoleonic wars  if he were to look in at the window of the blue and white room all the ladies there assembled would draw themselves up they know him for a rude fellow who smiles at the approach of maiden ladies and continues to smile after they have passed  however he lowers his head today so that they shall not see him his present design being converse with the misses throssels maid  the room is one seldom profaned by the foot of man and everything in it is white or blue  miss phoebe is not present but here are miss susan miss willoughby and her sister miss fanny and miss henrietta turnbull  miss susan and miss willoughby alas already wear caps but all the four are dear ladies so refined that we ought not to be discussing them without a more formal introduction  there seems no sufficient reason why we should choose miss phoebe as our heroine rather than any one of the others except perhaps that we like her name best  but we gave her the name so we must support our choice and say that she is slightly the nicest unless indeed miss susan is nicer  miss fanny is reading aloud from a library book while the others sew or knit  they are making garments for our brave soldiers now far away fighting the corsican ogre   miss fanny   and so the day passed and evening came black mysterious and ghostlike  the wind moaned unceasingly like a shivering spirit and the vegetation rustled uneasily as if something weird and terrifying were about to happen  suddenly out of the darkness there emerged a man  she says the last word tremulously but without looking up  the listeners knit more quickly  the unhappy camilla was standing lost in reverie when without pausing to advertise her of his intentions he took both her hands in his  by this time the knitting has stopped and all are listening as if mesmerised  slowly he gathered her in his arms  miss susan gives an excited little cry  miss fanny  and rained hot burning  miss willoughby  sister  miss fanny greedily  on eyes mouth  miss willoughby sternly  stop  miss susan i am indeed surprised you should bring such an amazing indelicate tale from the library  miss susan with a slight shudder  i deeply regret miss willoughby  sees miss fanny reading quickly to herself  oh fanny  if you please my dear  takes the book gently from her  miss willoughby  i thank you  she knits severely  miss fanny a little rebel  miss susan is looking at the end  miss susan closes the book guiltily  miss susan apologetically  forgive my partiality for romance mary  i fear tis the mark of an old maid  miss willoughby  susan that word  miss susan sweetly  tis what i am  and you also mary my dear  miss fanny defending her sister  miss susan i protest  miss willoughby sternly truthful  nay sister tis true  we are known everywhere now susan you and i as the old maids of quality street  general discomfort  miss susan  i am happy phoebe will not be an old maid  miss henrietta wistfully  do you refer miss susan to v b  miss susan smiles happily to herself  miss susan  miss phoebe of the ringlets as he has called her  miss fanny  other females besides miss phoebe have ringlets  miss susan  but you and miss henrietta have to employ papers my dear proudly phoebe never  miss willoughby in defence of fanny  i do not approve of miss phoebe at all  miss susan flushing  mary had phoebe been dying you would have called her an angel but that is ever the way  tis all jealousy to the bride and good wishes to the corpse  her guests rise hurt my love i beg your pardon  miss willoughby  with your permission miss susan i shall put on my pattens  miss susan gives permission almost haughtily and the ladies retire to the bedroom miss fanny remaining behind a moment to ask a question  miss fanny  a bride  miss susan do you mean that v b has declared  miss susan  fanny i expect it hourly  miss susan left alone is agitated by the terrible scene with miss willoughby  enter phoebe in her bonnet and we see at once that she really is the nicest  she is so flushed with delightful news that she almost forgets to take off her pattens before crossing the blue and white room  miss susan  you seem strangely excited phoebe  phoebe  susan i have met a certain individual  miss susan  v b  phoebe nods several times and her gleaming eyes tell miss susan as much as if they were a romance from the library my dear you are trembling  phoebe bravely  nooh no  miss susan  you put your hand to your heart  phoebe  did i  miss susan in a whisper  my love has he offered  phoebe appalled  oh susan  enter miss willoughby partly cloaked  miss willoughby  how do you do miss phoebe  portentously  susan i have no wish to alarm you but i am of opinion that there is a man in the house  i suddenly felt it while putting on my pattens  miss susan  you meana followerin the kitchen  she courageously rings the bell but her voice falters  i am just a little afraid of patty  enter patty a buxom young woman who loves her mistresses and smiles at them and knows how to terrorise them  patty i hope we may not hurt your feelings but  patty sternly  are you implicating maam that i have a follower  miss susan  oh no patty  patty  so be it  miss susan ashamed  patty come back humbly  i told a falsehood just now i am ashamed of myself  patty severely  as well you might be maam  phoebe so roused that she would look heroic if she did not spoil the effect by wagging her finger at patty  how dare you  there is a man in the kitchen  to the door with him  patty  a glorious soldier to be so treated  phoebe  the door  patty  and if he refuses  they looked perplexed  miss susan  oh dear  phoebe  if he refuses send him here to me  exit patty  miss susan  lionhearted phoebe  miss willoughby  a soldier  nervously i wish it may not be that impertinent recruiting sergeant  i passed him in the street today he closed one of his eyes at me and then quickly opened it  i knew what he meant  phoebe  he does not come  miss susan  i think i hear their voices in dispute  she is listening through the floor  they all stoop or go on their knees to listen and when they are in this position the recruiting sergeant enters unobserved  he chuckles aloud  in a moment phoebe is alone with him  sergeant with an irish accent  your servant maam  phoebe advancing sternly on him  sir she is perplexed as he seems undismayed sergeant  she sees mud from his boots on the carpet  oh oh  brushes carpet sergeant i am wishful to scold you but would you be so obliging as to stand on this paper while i do it  sergeant  with all the pleasure in life maam  phoebe forgetting to be angry  sergeant have you killed people  sergeant  dozens maam dozens  phoebe  how terrible  oh sir i pray every night that the lord in his lovingkindness will root the enemy up  is it true that the corsican ogre eats babies  sergeant  i have spoken with them as have seen him do it maam  phoebe  the man of sin  have you ever seen a vivandiere sir wistfully  i have sometimes wished there were vivandieres in the british army  for a moment she sees herself as one  oh sergeant a shudder goes through me when i see you in the streets enticing those poor young men  sergeant  if you were one of them maam and death or glory was the call you would take the shilling maam  phoebe  oh not for that  sergeant  for king and country maam  phoebe grandly  yes yes for that  sergeant candidly  not that it is all fighting  the sack of captured townsthe loot  phoebe proudly  an english soldier never sacks nor loots  sergeant  no maam  and thenthe girls  phoebe  what girls  sergeant  in the towns thatthat we dont sack  phoebe  how they must hate the haughty conqueror  sergeant  we are not so haughty as all that  phoebe sadly  i think i understand  i am afraid sergeant you do not tell those poor young men the noble things i thought you told them  sergeant  maam i must een tell them what they are wishful to hear there ha been five maam all this week listening to me and then showing me their heels but by a grand stroke of luck i have them at last  phoebe  luck  miss susan opens door slightly and listens  sergeant  the luck maam is that a gentleman of the town has enlisted  that gave them the push forward  miss susan is excited  phoebe  a gentleman of this town enlisted  eagerly  sergeant who  sergeant  nay maam i think it be a secret as yet  phoebe  but a gentleman  tis the most amazing exciting thing sergeant be so obliging  sergeant  nay maam i cant  miss susan at door carried away by excitement  but you must you must  sergeant turning to the door  you see maam  the door is hurriedly closed  phoebe ashamed  sergeant i have not been saying the things i meant to say to you  will you please excuse my turning you out of the house somewhat violently  sergeant  i am used to it maam  phoebe  i wont really hurt you  sergeant  thank you kindly maam  phoebe observing the bedroom door opening a little and speaking in a loud voice  i protest sir we shall permit no followers in this house  should i discover you in my kitchen again i shall pitch you outneck and crop  begone sir  the sergeant retires affably  all the ladies except miss henrietta come out admiring phoebe  the willoughbys are attired for their journey across the street  miss willoughby  miss phoebe we could not but admire you  phoebe alas knows that she is not admirable  phoebe  but the gentleman recruit  miss susan  perhaps they will know who he is at the woollendrapers  miss fanny  let us inquire  but before they go miss willoughby has a duty to perform  miss willoughby  i wish to apologise  miss phoebe you are a dear good girl  if i have made remarks about her ringlets susan it was jealousy  phoebe and miss susan wish to embrace her but she is not in the mood for it come sister  miss fanny the dear woman that she is  phoebe dear i wish you very happy  phoebe presses her hand  miss henrietta entering and not to be outdone  miss phoebe i give you joy  the three ladies go the two younger ones a little tearfully and we see them pass the window  phoebe pained  susan you have been talking to them about v b  miss susan  i could not help it  eagerly now phoebe what is it you have to tell me  phoebe in a low voice  dear i think it is too holy to speak of  miss susan  to your sister  phoebe  susan as you know i was sitting with an unhappy woman whose husband has fallen in the war  when i came out of the cottage he was passing  miss susan  yes  phoebe  he offered me his escort  at first he was very silentas he has often been of late  miss susan  we know why  phoebe  please not to say that i know why  suddenly he stopped and swung his cane  you know how gallantly he swings his cane  miss susan  yes indeed  phoebe  he said i have something i am wishful to tell you miss phoebe perhaps you can guess what it is  miss susan  go on  phoebe  to say i could guess sister would have been unladylike  i said please not to tell me in the public thoroughfare to which he instantly replied then i shall call and tell you this afternoon  miss susan  phoebe  they are interrupted by the entrance of patty with tea  they see that she has brought three cups and know that this is her impertinent way of implying that mistresses as well as maids may have a follower  when she has gone they smile at the daring of the woman and sit down to tea  phoebe  susan to think that it has all happened in a single year  miss susan  such a genteel competency as he can offer such a desirable establishment  phoebe  i had no thought of that dear  i was recalling our first meeting at mrs fotheringays quadrille party  miss susan  we had quite forgotten that our respected local physician was growing elderly  phoebe  until he said allow me to present my new partner mr valentine brown  miss susan  phoebe do you remember how at the teatable he facetiously passed the cakebasket with nothing in it  phoebe  he was so amusing from the first  i am thankful susan that i too have a sense of humour  i am exceedingly funny at times am i not susan  miss susan  yes indeed  but he sees humour in the most unexpected things  i say something so ordinary about loving for instance to have everything either blue or white in this room and i know not why he laughs but it makes me feel quite witty  phoebe a little anxiously  i hope he sees nothing odd or quaint about us  miss susan  my dear i am sure he cannot  phoebe  susan the picnics  miss susan  phoebe the day when he first drank tea in this house  phoebe  he invited himself  miss susan  he merely laughed when i said it would cause such talk  phoebe  he is absolutely fearless  susan he has smoked his pipe in this room  they are both a little scared  miss susan  smoking is indeed a dreadful habit  phoebe  but there is something so dashing about it  miss susan with melancholy  and now i am to be left alone  phoebe  no  miss susan  my dear i could not leave this room  my lovely blue and white room  it is my husband  phoebe who has become agitated  susan you must make my house your home  i have something distressing to tell you  miss susan  you alarm me  phoebe  you know mr brown advised us how to invest half of our money  miss susan  i know it gives us eight per cent though why it should do so i cannot understand but very obliging i am sure  phoebe  susan all that money is lost i had the letter several days ago  miss susan  lost  phoebe  something burst dear and then they absconded  miss susan  but mr brown  phoebe  i have not advertised him of it yet for he will think it was his fault  but i shall tell him today  miss susan  phoebe how much have we left  phoebe  only sixty pounds a year so you see you must live with us dearest  miss susan  but mr brownhe  phoebe grandly  he is a man of means and if he is not proud to have my susan i shall say at once mr brownthe door  she presses her cheek to miss susans  miss susan softly  phoebe i have a wedding gift for you  phoebe  not yet  miss susan  it has been ready for a long time  i began it when you were not ten years old and i was a young woman  i meant it for myself phoebe  i had hoped that hehis name was williambut i think i must have been too unattractive my love  phoebe  sweetestdearest  miss susan  i always associate it with a sprigged poplin i was wearing that summer with a breadth of coloured silk in it being a naval officer but something happened a miss cicely pemberton and they are quite big boys now  so long ago phoebehe was very tall with brown hairit was most foolish of me but i was always so fond of sewingwith long straight legs and such a pleasant expression  phoebe  susan what was it  miss susan  it was a weddinggown my dear  even plain women phoebe we cant help it when we are young we have romantic ideas just as if we were pretty  and so the weddinggown was never used  long before it was finished i knew he would not offer but i finished it and then i put it away  i have always hidden it from you phoebe but of late i have brought it out again and altered it  she goes to ottoman and unlocks it  phoebe  susan i could not wear it  miss susan brings the weddinggown  oh how sweet how beautiful  miss susan  you will wear it my love wont you  and the tears it was sewn with long ago will all turn into smiles on my phoebes weddingday  they are tearfully happy when a knock is heard on the street door  phoebe  that knock  miss susan  so dashing  phoebe  so imperious  she is suddenly panicstricken  susan i think he kissed me once  miss susan startled  you think  phoebe  i know he did  that eveninga week ago when he was squiring me home from the concert  it was raining and my face was wet he said that was why he did it  miss susan  because your face was wet  phoebe  it does not seem a sufficient excuse now  miss susan appalled  o phoebe before he had offered  phoebe in distress  i fear me it was most unladylike  valentine brown is shown in  he is a frank genial young man of twentyfive who honestly admires the ladies though he is amused by their quaintness  he is modestly aware that it is in the blue and white room alone that he is esteemed a wit  brown  miss susan how do you do maam  nay miss phoebe though we have met today already i insist on shaking hands with you again  miss susan  always so dashing  valentine laughs and the ladies exchange delighted smiles  valentine to miss susan  and my other friends i hope i find them in health  the spinet maam seems quite herself today i trust the ottoman passed a good night  miss susan beaming  we are all quite well sir  valentine  may i sit on this chair miss phoebe  i know miss susan likes me to break her chairs  miss susan  indeed sir i do not  phoebe how strange that he should think so  phoebe instantly  the remark was humorous was it not  valentine  how you see through me miss phoebe  the sisters again exchange delighted smiles  valentine is about to take a seat  miss susan thinking aloud  oh dear i feel sure he is going to roll the coverlet into a ball and then sit on it  valentine who has been on the point of doing so abstains and sits guiltily  valentine  so i am dashing miss susan  am i dashing miss phoebe  phoebe  alittle i think  valentine  well but i have something to tell you today which i really think is rather dashing  miss susan gathers her knitting looks at phoebe and is preparing to go  you are not going maam before you know what it is  miss susan  iiindeedto be sureii know mr brown  phoebe  susan  miss susan  i mean i do not know  i mean i can guessi mean phoebe my love explain  she goes out  valentine rather disappointed  the explanation being i suppose that you both know and i had flattered myself twas such a secret  am i then to understand that you had foreseen it all miss phoebe  phoebe  nay sir you must not ask that  valentine  i believe in any case twas you who first put it into my head  phoebe aghast  oh i hope not  valentine  your demure eyes flashed so every time the war was mentioned the little quaker suddenly looked like a gallant boy in ringlets  a dread comes over phoebe but it is in her heart alone it shows neither in face nor voice  phoebe  mr brown what is it you have to tell us  valentine  that i have enlisted miss phoebe  did you surmise it was something else  phoebe  you are going to the wars  mr brown is it a jest  valentine  it would be a sorry jest maam  i thought you knew  i concluded that the recruiting sergeant had talked  phoebe  the recruiting sergeant  i see  valentine  these stirring times miss phoebehe is but half a man who stays at home  i have chafed for months  i want to see whether i have any courage and as to be an army surgeon does not appeal to me it was enlist or remain behind  today i found that there were five waverers i asked them would they take the shilling if i took it and they assented  miss phoebe it is not one man i give to the king but six  phoebe brightly  i think you have done bravely  valentine  we leave shortly for the petersburgh barracks and i go to london tomorrow so this is goodbye  phoebe  i shall pray that you may be preserved in battle mr brown  valentine  and you and miss susan will write to me when occasion offers  phoebe  if you wish it  valentine smiling  with all the stirring news of quality street  phoebe  it seems stirring to us it must have been merely laughable to you who came here from a great city  valentine  dear quality streetthat thought me dashing  but i made friends in it miss phoebe of two very sweet ladies  phoebe timidly  mr brown i wonder why you have been so kind to my sister and me  valentine  the kindness was yours  if at first miss susan amused me chuckling to see her on her knees decorating the little legs of the couch with frills as if it were a child  but it was her sterling qualities that impressed me presently  phoebe  and diddid i amuse you also  valentine  prodigiously miss phoebe  those other ladies they were always scolding you your youthfulness shocked them  i believe they thought you dashing  phoebe nervously  i have sometimes feared that i was perhaps too dashing  valentine laughing at this  you delicious miss phoebe  you were too quiet  i felt sorry that one so sweet and young should live so grey a life  i wondered whether i could put any little pleasures into it  phoebe  the picnics  it was very good of you  valentine  that was only how it began for soon i knew that it was i who got the pleasures and you who gave them  you have been to me miss phoebe like a quiet oldfashioned garden full of the flowers that englishmen love best because they have known them longest the daisy that stands for innocence and the hyacinth for constancy and the modest violet and the rose  when i am far away maam i shall often think of miss phoebes pretty soul which is her garden and shut my eyes and walk in it  she is smiling gallantly through her pain when miss susan returns  miss susan  have youis ityou seem so calm phoebe  phoebe pressing her sisters hand warningly and imploringly susan what mr brown is so obliging as to inform us of is not what we expectednot that at all  my dear he is the gentleman who has enlisted and he came to tell us that and to say goodbye  miss susan  going away  phoebe  yes dear  valentine  am i not the ideal recruit maam a man without a wife or a mother or a sweetheart  miss susan  no sweetheart  valentine  have you one for me miss susan  phoebe hastily lest her sisters face should betray the truth susan we shall have to tell him now  you dreadful man you will laugh and say it is just like quality street  but indeed since i met you today and you told me you had something to communicate we have been puzzling what it could be and we concluded that you were going to be married  valentine  ha ha ha  was that it  phoebe  so like women you know  we thought we perhaps knew her glancing at the weddinggown  we were even discussing what we should wear at the wedding  valentine  ha ha  i shall often think of this  i wonder who would have me miss susan  rising  but i must be off and god bless you both  miss susan forlorn  you are going  valentine  no more mud on your carpet miss susan no more coverlets rolled into balls  a good riddance  miss phoebe a last look at the garden  taking her hand and looking into her face  phoebe  we shall miss you very much mr brown  valentine  there is one little matter  that investment i advised you to make i am happy it has turned out so well  phoebe checking miss susan who is about to tell of the loss of the money  it was good of you to take all that trouble sir  accept our grateful thanks  valentine  indeed i am glad that you are so comfortably left i am your big brother  goodbye again  looks round  this little blue and white room and its dear inmates may they be unchanged when i come back  goodbye  he goes  miss susan looks forlornly at phoebe who smiles pitifully  phoebe  a misunderstanding just a mistake  she shudders lifts the weddinggown and puts it back in the ottoman  miss susan sinks sobbing into a chair  dont dear dontwe can live it down  miss susan fiercely  he is a fiend in human form  phoebe  nay you hurt me sister  he is a brave gentleman  miss susan  the money why did you not let me tell him  phoebe flushing  so that he might offer to me out of pity susan  miss susan  phoebe how are we to live with the quartern loaf at one and tenpence  phoebe  brother james  miss susan  you know very well that brother james will do nothing for us  phoebe  i think susan we could keep a little schoolfor genteel children only of course  i would do most of the teaching  miss susan  you a schoolmistressphoebe of the ringlets every one would laugh  phoebe  i shall hide the ringlets away in a cap like yours susan and people will soon forget them  and i shall try to look staid and to grow old quickly  it will not be so hard to me as you think dear  miss susan  there were other gentlemen who were attracted by you phoebe and you turned from them  phoebe  i did not want them  miss susan  they will come again and others  phoebe  no dear never speak of that to me any more  in woe  i let him kiss me  miss susan  you could not prevent him  phoebe  yes i could  i know i could now  i wanted him to do it oh never speak to me of others after that  perhaps he saw i wanted it and did it to please me  but i meantindeed i didthat i gave it to him with all my love  sister i could bear all the rest but i have been unladylike  the curtain falls and we do not see the sisters again for ten years    end of act i     act ii  the school  ten years later  it is the blue and white room still but many of miss susans beautiful things have gone some of them never to return others are stored upstairs  their place is taken by grim scholastic furniture forms a desk a globe a blackboard heartless maps  it is here that miss phoebe keeps school  miss susan teaches in the room opening off it once the spare bedroom where there is a smaller blackboard for easier sums but no globe as miss susan is easily alarmed  here are the younger pupils unless they have grown defiant when they are promoted to the blue and white room to be under miss phoebes braver rule  they really frighten miss phoebe also but she does not let her sister know this  it is noon on a day in august and through the window we can see that quality street is decorated with flags  we also hear at times martial music from another street  miss phoebe is giving a dancing lesson to half a dozen pupils and is doing her very best now she is at the spinet while they dance and again she is showing them the new step we know it is miss phoebe because some of her pretty airs and graces still cling to her in a forlorn way but she is much changed  her curls are out of sight under a cap her manner is prim the light has gone from her eyes and buoyancy from her figure she looks not ten years older but twenty and not an easy twenty  when the children are not looking at her we know that she has the headache   phoebe who is sometimes at the spinet and sometimes dancing  toes out  so  chest out  georgy  point your toes miss beveridgeso sokeep in line and young ladies remember your toes  georgy in his desire to please has protruded the wrong part of his person  she writes a c on his chest with chalk  c stands for chest georgy this is s  miss susan darts out of the other room  she is less worn than miss phoebe  miss susan whispering so that the pupils may not hear  phoebe how many are fourteen and seventeen  phoebe almost instantly  thirtyone  miss susan  i thank you  she darts off  phoebe  that will do ladies and gentlemen  you may go  they bow or curtsy and retire to miss susans room with the exception of arthur wellesley tomson who is standing in disgrace in a corner with the cap of shame on his head and isabella a forbiddinglooking learned little girl  isabella holds up her hand for permission to speak  isabella  please maam father wishes me to acquire algebra  phoebe with a sinking  algebra  itit is not a very ladylike study isabella  isabella  father says will you or wont you  phoebe  and you are thin  it will make you thinner my dear  isabella  father says i am thin but wiry  phoebe  yes you are  with feeling  you are very wiry isabella  isabella  father says either i acquire algebra or i go to miss protheros establishment  phoebe  very well ii will do my best  you may go  isabella goes and phoebe sits wearily  arthur fingering his cap  please maam may i take it off now  phoebe  certainly not  unhappy boy arthur grins  come here are you ashamed of yourself  arthur blithely  no maam  phoebe in a terrible voice  arthur wellesley tomson fetch me the implement  arthur goes briskly for the cane and she hits the desk with it  arthur surely that terrifies you  arthur  no maam  phoebe  arthur why did you fight with that street boy  arthur  cos he said that when you caned you did not draw blood  phoebe  but i dont do i  arthur  no maam  phoebe  then why fight him  remembering how strange boys are was it for the honour of the school  arthur  yes maam  phoebe  say you are sorry arthur and i wont punish you  he bursts into tears  arthur  you promised to cane me and now you are not going to do it  phoebe incredulous  do you wish to be caned  arthur holding out his hand eagerly  if you please miss phoebe  phoebe  unnatural boy  she canes him in a very unprofessional manner  poor dear boy  she kisses the hand  arthur gloomily  oh maam you will never be able to cane if you hold it like that  you should hold it like this miss phoebe and give it a wriggle like that  she is too softhearted to follow his instructions  phoebe almost in tears  go away  arthur remembering that women are strange  dont cry maam i love you miss phoebe  she seats him on her knee and he thinks of a way to please her  if any boy says you cant cane i will blood him miss phoebe  phoebe shudders and miss susan again darts in  she signs to phoebe to send arthur away  miss susan as soon as arthur has gone  phoebe if a herring and a half cost three hapence how many for elevenpence  phoebe instantly  eleven  miss susan  william smith says it is fifteen and he is such a big boy do you think i ought to contradict him  may i say there are differences of opinion about it  no one can be really sure phoebe  phoebe  it is eleven  i once worked it out with real herrings stoutly  susan we must never let the big boys know that we are afraid of them  to awe them stamp with the foot speak in a ferocious voice and look them unflinchingly in the face  then she pales oh susan isabellas father insists on her acquiring algebra  miss susan  what is algebra exactly is it those three cornered things  phoebe  it is x minus y equals z plus y and things like that and all the time you are saying they are equal you feel in your heart why should they be  the music of the band swells here and both ladies put their hands to their ears  it is the band for tonights ball  we must not grudge their rejoicings susan  it is not every year that there is a waterloo to celebrate  miss susan  i was not thinking of that  i was thinking that he is to be at the ball tonight and we have not seen him for ten years  phoebe calmly  yes ten years  we shall be glad to welcome our old friend back susan  i am going in to your room now to take the latin class  a soldier with a girl passesa yokel follows angrily  miss susan  oh that weary latin i wish i had the whipping of the man who invented it  she returns to her room and the sound of the music dies away  miss phoebe who is not a very accomplished classical scholar is taking a final peep at the declensions when miss susan reappears excitedly  phoebe  what is it  miss susan tragically  william smith  phoebe i tried to look ferocious indeed i did but he saw i was afraid and before the whole school he put out his tongue at me  phoebe  susan  she is lionhearted she remembers arthurs instructions and practises with the cane  miss susan frightened  phoebe he is much too big  let it pass  phoebe  if i let it pass i am a stumblingblock in the way of true education  miss susan  sister  phoebe grandly  susan stand aside  giving the cane arthurs most telling flick she marches into the other room  then while miss susan is listening nervously captain valentine brown is ushered in by patty  he is bronzed and soldierly  he wears the whiskers of the period and is in uniform  he has lost his left hand but this is not at first noticeable  patty  miss susan tis captain brown  miss susan  captain brown  valentine greeting her warmly  reports himself at home again  miss susan gratified  you call this home  valentine  when the other men talked of their homes miss susan i thought of this room  looking about him  mapsdesksheigho but still it is the same dear room  i have often dreamt miss susan that i came back to it in muddy shoes  seeing her alarm  i have not you know  miss susan i rejoice to find no change in you and miss phoebemiss phoebe of the ringletsi hope there be as little change in her  miss susan painfully  phoebe of the ringlets  ah captain brown you need not expect to see her  valentine  she is not here  i vow it spoils all my homecoming  at this moment the door of the other room is filing open and phoebe rushes out followed by william smith who is brandishing the cane valentine takes in the situation and without looking at phoebe seizes william by the collar and marches him out of the school  miss susan  phoebe did you see who it is  phoebe  i saw  in a sudden tremor susan i have lost all my looks  the pupils are crowding in from miss susans room and she orders them back and goes with them  valentine returns and speaks as he enters not recognising phoebe whose back is to him  valentine  a young reprobate madam but i have deposited him on the causeway  i fear  he stops puzzled because the lady has covered her face with her hands  phoebe  captain brown  valentine  miss phoebe it is you  he goes to her but he cannot help showing that her appearance is a shock to him  phoebe without bitterness  yes i have changed very much i have not worn well captain brown  valentine awkwardly  wewe are both older miss phoebe  he holds out his hand warmly with affected high spirits  phoebe smiling reproachfully  it was both hands when you went away  he has to show that his left hand is gone she is overcome i did not know  she presses the empty sleeve in remorse  you never mentioned it in your letters  valentine now grown rather stern  miss phoebe what did you omit from your letters that you had such young blackguards as that to terrify you  phoebe  he is the only one  most of them are dear children and this is the last day of the term  valentine  ah maam if only you had invested all your money as you laid out part by my advice  what a monstrous pity you did not  phoebe  we never thought of it  valentine  you look so tired  phoebe  i have the headache today  valentine  you did not use to have the headache  curse those dear children  phoebe bravely  nay do not distress yourself about me  tell me of yourself  we are so proud of the way in which you won your commission  will you leave the army now  valentine  yes and i have some intention of pursuing again the old life in quality street  he is not a man who has reflected much  he has come back thinking that all the adventures have been his and that the old life in quality street has waited as in a sleep to be resumed on the day of his return  i came here in such high spirits miss phoebe  phoebe with a wry smile  the change in me depresses you  valentine  i was in hopes that you and miss susan would be going to the ball  i had brought cards for you with me to make sure  she is pleased and means to accept  he sighs and she understands that he thinks her too old  phoebe  but now you see that my dancing days are done  valentine uncomfortably  ah no  phoebe taking care he shall not see that he has hurt her  but you will find many charming partners  some of them have been my pupils there was even a pupil of mine who fought at waterloo  valentine  young blades i have heard him on it  she puts her hand wearily to her head  miss phoebewhat a dull grey world it is  she turns away to hide her emotion and miss susan comes in  miss susan  phoebe i have said that you will not take the latin class today and i am dismissing them  valentine  latin  phoebe rather defiantly  i am proud to teach it  breaking down  susanhis armhave you seen  miss susan also is overcome but recovers as the children crowd in  miss susan  hats off gentlemen salute ladies curtsyto the brave captain brown  captain brown salutes them awkwardly and they cheer him to his great discomfort as they pass out  valentine when they have gone  a terrible ordeal maam  the old friends look at each other and there is a silence valentine feels that all the fine tales and merry jests he has brought back for the ladies have turned into dead things  he wants to go away and think  phoebe  i wish you very happy at the ball  valentine sighing  miss susan cannot we turn all these maps and horrors out till the vacation is over  miss susan  indeed sir we always do  by tomorrow this will be my dear blue and white room again and that my sweet spare bedroom  phoebe  for five weeks  valentine making vain belief  and thenthethe dashing mr brown will drop in as of old and behold miss susan on her knees once more putting tucks into my little friend the ottoman and miss phoebemiss phoebe  phoebe  phoebe of the ringlets  she goes out quietly  valentine miserably  miss susan what a shame it is  miss susan hotly  yes it is a shame  valentine suddenly become more of a man  the brave captain brown good god maam how much more brave are the ladies who keep a school  patty shows in two visitors miss charlotte parratt and ensign blades  charlotte is a pretty minx who we are glad to say does not reside in quality street and blades is a callow youth inviting admiration  charlotte as they salute  but i did not know you had company miss susan  miss susan  tis captain brownmiss charlotte parratt  charlotte gushing  the heroic brown  valentine  alas no maam the other one  charlotte  miss susan do you see who accompanies me  miss susan  i cannot quite recall  blades  a few years ago maam there sat in this room a scrubby inky little boyi was that boy  miss susan  can it be our old pupilensign blades  she thinks him very fine and he bows well pleased  blades  once a little boy and now your most obedient maam  miss susan  you have come to recall old memories  blades  not precisely icharlotte explain  charlotte  ensign blades wishes me to say that it must seem highly romantic to you to have had a pupil who has fought at waterloo  miss susan  not exactly romantic  i trust sir that when you speak of having been our pupil you are also so obliging as to mention that it was during our first year  otherwise it makes us seem so elderly  he bows again in what he believes to be a quizzical manner  charlotte  ensign blades would be pleased to hear miss susan what you think of him as a whole  miss susan  indeed sir i think you are monstrous fine innocently  it quite awes me to remember that we used to whip him  valentine delighted  whipped him miss susan  in solemn burlesque of charlotte ensign blades wishes to indicate that it was more than buonaparte could do  we shall meet again bright boy  he makes his adieux and goes  blades  do you think he was quizzing me  miss susan simply  i cannot think so  blades  he said bright boy maam  miss susan  i am sure sir he did not mean it  phoebe returns  phoebe  charlotte i am happy to see you  you look delicious my dearso young and fresh  charlotte  la  do you think so miss phoebe  blades  miss phoebe your obedient  phoebe  it is ensign blades  but how kind of you sir to revisit the old school  please to sit down  charlotte  ensign blades has a favour to ask of you miss phoebe  blades  i learn maam that captain brown has obtained a card for you for the ball and i am here to solicit for the honour of standing up with you  for the moment phoebe is flattered  here she believes is some one who does not think her too old for the dance  then she perceives a meaning smile pass between charlotte and the ensign  phoebe paling  is it that you desire to make sport of me  blades honestly distressed  oh no maam i vowbut ii am such a quiz maam  miss susan  sister  phoebe  i am sorry sir to have to deprive you of some entertainment but i am not going to the ball  miss susan haughtily  ensign blades i bid you my adieux  blades ashamed  if i have hurt miss phoebes feelings i beg to apologise  miss susan  if you have hurt them  oh sir how is it possible for any one to be as silly as you seem to be  blades who cannot find the answer  charlotteexplain  but charlotte considers that their visit has not been sufficiently esteemed and departs with a cold curtsy taking him with her  miss susan turns sympathetically to phoebe but phoebe fighting with her pain sits down at the spinet and plays at first excitedly a gay tune then slowly then comes to a stop with her head bowed  soon she jumps up courageously brushes away her distress gets an algebra book from the desk and sits down to study it  miss susan is at the window where ladies and gentlemen are now seen passing in ball attire  miss susan  what book is it phoebe  phoebe  it is an algebra  miss susan  they are going by to the ball  in anger  my phoebe should be going to the ball too  phoebe  you jest susan  miss susan watches her read  phoebe has to wipe away a tear soon she rises and gives way to the emotion she has been suppressing ever since the entrance of valentine  susan i hate him  oh susan i could hate him if it were not for his poor hand  miss susan  my dear  phoebe  he thought i was old because i am weary and he should not have forgotten  i am only thirty  susan why does thirty seem so much more than twentynine  as if valentine were present  oh sir how dare you look so pityingly at me  because i have had to work so hardis it a crime when a woman works  because i have tried to be courageoushave i been courageous susan  miss susan  god knows you have  phoebe  but it has given me the headache it has tired my eyes  alas miss phoebe all your charm has gone for you have the headache and your eyes are tired  he is dancing with charlotte parratt now susan i vow miss charlotte you are selfish and silly but you are sweet eighteen  oh la captain brown what a quiz you are  that delights him susan see how he waggles his silly head  miss susan  charlotte parratt is a goose  phoebe  tis what gentlemen prefer  if there were a sufficient number of geese to go round susan no woman of sense would ever get a husband  charming miss charlotte you are like a garden miss phoebe was like a garden once but tis a faded garden now  miss susan  if to be ladylike  phoebe  susan i am tired of being ladylike  i am a young woman still and to be ladylike is not enough  i wish to be bright and thoughtless and merry  it is every womans birthright to be petted and admired i wish to be petted and admired  was i born to be confined within these four walls  are they the world susan or is there anything beyond them  i want to know  my eyes are tired because for ten years they have seen nothing but maps and desks  ten years  ten years ago i went to bed a young girl and i woke with this cap on my head  it is not fair  this is not me susan this is some other person i want to be myself  miss susan  phoebe phoebe you who have always been so patient  phoebe  oh no not always  if you only knew how i have rebelled at times you would turn from me in horror  susan i have a picture of myself as i used to be i sometimes look at it  i sometimes kiss it and say poor girl they have all forgotten you  but i remember  miss susan  i cannot recall it  phoebe  i keep it locked away in my room  would you like to see it i shall bring it down  my room  oh susan it is there that the phoebe you think so patient has the hardest fight with herself for there i have seemed to hear and see the phoebe of whom this looking at herself is but an image in a distorted glass  i have heard her singing as if she thought she was still a girl  i have heard her weeping perhaps it was only i who was weeping but she seemed to cry to me let me out of this prison give me back the years you have taken from me  oh where are my pretty curls she cried  where is my youth my youth  she goes out leaving miss susan woeful  presently susan takes up the algebra book and reads  miss susan  a stroke b multiplied by b stroke c equal ab stroke a little 2 stroke ac add bc  poor phoebe  multiply by c stroke a and we get  poor phoebe  c a b stroke a little 2 stroke ac little 2 add bc  oh i cannot believe it stroke a little 2 again add ab little 2 add a little 2c stroke a bc   patty comes in with the lamp  patty  hurting your poor eyes reading without a lamp  think shame miss susan  miss susan with spirit  patty i will not be dictated to  patty looks out at window draw the curtains at once  i cannot allow you to stand gazing at the foolish creatures who crowd to a ball  patty closing curtains  i am not gazing at them maam i am gazing at my sweetheart  miss susan  your sweetheart  softly  i did not know you had one  patty  nor have i maam as yet  but i looks out and thinks i to myself at any moment he may turn the corner  i ha been looking out at windows waiting for him to oblige by turning the corner this fifteen years  miss susan  fifteen years and still you are hopeful  patty  there is not a more hopeful woman in all the kings dominions  miss susan  you who are so much older than miss phoebe  patty  yes maam i ha the advantage of her by ten years  miss susan  it would be idle to pretend that you are specially comely  patty  that may be but my face is my own and the more i see it in the glass the more it pleases me  i never look at it but i say to myself who is to be the lucky man  miss susan  tis wonderful  patty  this will be a great year for females maam  think how many of the men that marched away strutting to the wars have come back limping  who is to take off their wooden legs of an evening miss susan  you maam or me  miss susan  patty  patty doggedly  or miss phoebe  with feeling  the pretty thing that she was miss susan  miss susan  do you remember patty  i think there is no other person who remembers unless it be the misses willoughby and miss henrietta  patty eagerly  give her a chance maam and take her to the balls  there be three of them this week and the last ball will be the best for tis to be at the barracks and you will need a carriage to take you there and there will be the packing of you into it by gallant squires and the unpacking of you out and other devilries  miss susan  patty  patty  if miss phoebe were to dress young again and put candles in her eyes that used to be so bright and coax back her curls  phoebe returns and a great change has come over her  she is young and pretty again  she is wearing the weddinggown of act i her ringlets are glorious her figure youthful her face flushed and animated  patty is the first to see her and is astonished  phoebe signs to her to go  phoebe when patty has gone  susan  miss susan sees and is speechless  susan this is the picture of my old self that i keep locked away in my room and sometimes take out of its box to look at this is the girl who kisses herself in the glass and sings and dances with glee until i put her away frightened lest you should hear her  miss susan  how marvellous  oh phoebe  phoebe  perhaps i should not do it but it is so easy  i have but to put on the old weddinggown and tumble my curls out of the cap passionately  sister am i as changed as he says i am  miss susan  you almost frighten me  the band is heard  phoebe  the music is calling to us  susan i will celebrate waterloo in a little ball of my own  see my curls have begun to dance they are so anxious to dance  one dance susan to phoebe of the ringlets and then i will put her away in her box and never look at her again maam may i have the honour  nay then i shall dance alone  she dances  oh susan i almost wish i were a goose  presently patty returns  she gazes at miss phoebe dancing  patty  miss phoebe  phoebe still dancing  not miss phoebe patty  i am not myself tonight i amlet me see i am my niece  patty in a whisper to susan  but miss susan tis captain brown  miss susan  oh stop phoebe stop  patty  nay let him see her  miss susan hurries scandalised into the other room as valentine enters  valentine  i ventured to come back because phoebe turns to himhe stops abruptly bewildered  i beg your pardon madam i thought it was miss susan or miss phoebe  his mistake surprises her but she is in a wild mood and curtsies then turns away and smiles  he stares as if halfconvinced  patty with an inspiration  tis my mistresses niece sir she is on a visit here  he is deceived  he bows gallantly then remembers the object of his visit  he produces a bottle of medicine  valentine  patty i obtained this at the apothecarys for miss phoebes headache  it should be taken at once  patty  miss phoebe is lying down sir  valentine  is she asleep  patty demurely  no sir i think she be wide awake  valentine  it may soothe her  phoebe  patty take it to aunt phoebe at once  patty goes out sedately with the medicine  valentine after a little awkwardness which phoebe enjoys perhaps i may venture to present myself missmiss  phoebe  misslivvy sir  valentine  i am captain brown miss livvy an old friend of both your aunts  phoebe curtsying  i have heard them speak of a dashing mr brown but i think it cannot be the same  valentine a little chagrined  why not maam  phoebe  i ask your pardon sir  valentine i was sure you must be related  indeed for a moment the likenesseven the voice  phoebe pouting  la sir you mean i am like aunt phoebe  every one says soand indeed tis no compliment  valentine  twould have been a compliment once  you must be a daughter of the excellent mr james throssel who used to reside at great buckland  phoebe  he is still there  valentine  a tedious twenty miles from here as i remember  phoebe  la i have found the journey a monstrous quick one sir  the band is again heard  she runs to the window to peep between the curtains and his eyes follow her admiringly  valentine eagerly  miss livvy you go to the ball  phoebe  alas sir i have no card  valentine  i have two cards for your aunts  as miss phoebe has the headache your aunt susan must take you to the ball  phoebe  oh oh  her feet move to the music  sir i cannot control my feet  valentine  they are already at the ball maam you must follow them  phoebe with all the pentup mischief of ten years  oh sir do you think some pretty gentleman might be partial to me at the ball  valentine  if that is your wish  phoebe  i should love sir to inspire frenzy in the breast of the male  with sudden collapse  i dare not goi dare not  valentine  miss livvy i vow  he turns eagerly to miss susan who enters  i have ventured miss susan to introduce myself to your charming niece  miss susan would like to run away again but the wicked miss phoebe is determined to have her help  phoebe  aunt susan do not be angry with your livvyyour livvy aunt susan  this gentleman says he is the dashing mr brown he has cards for us for the ball auntie  of course we cannot gowe dare not go oh auntie hasten into your bombazine  miss susan staggered  phoebe  phoebe  aunt phoebe wants me to go  if i say she does you know she does  miss susan  but my dear my dear  phoebe  oh auntie why do you talk so much  come come  valentine  i shall see to it miss susan that your niece has a charming ball  phoebe  he means he will find me sweet partners  valentine  nay maam i mean i shall be your partner  phoebe who is not an angel  aunt susan he still dances  valentine  still maam  phoebe  oh sir you are indeed dashing  nay sir please not to scowl i could not avoid noticing them  valentine  noticing what miss livvy  phoebe  the grey hairs sir  valentine  i vow maam there is not one in my head  phoebe  he is such a quiz  i so love a quiz  valentine  then maam i shall do nothing but quiz you at the ball miss susan i beg you  miss susan  oh sir dissuade her  valentine  nay i entreat  phoebe  auntie  miss susan  think my dear think we dare not  phoebe shuddering  no we dare not i cannot go  valentine  indeed maam  phoebe  tis impossible  she really means it and had not the music here taken an unfair advantage of her it is certain that miss phoebe would never have gone to the ball  in after years she and miss susan would have talked together of the monstrous evening when she nearly lost her head but regained it before it could fall off  but suddenly the music swells so alluringly that it is a thousand fingers beckoning her to all the balls she has missed and in a transport she whirls miss susan from the blue and white room to the bedchamber where is the bombazine valentine awaits their return like a conqueror until miss livvys words about his hair return to trouble him  he is stooping gazing intently into a small mirror extracting the grey hairs one by one when patty ushers in the sisters willoughby and miss henrietta miss henrietta is wearing the new veil which opens or closes like curtains when she pulls a string  she opens it now to see what he is doing and the slight sound brings him to his feet  miss henrietta  tis but the new veil sir there is no cause for alarm  they have already learned from patty we may be sure that he is in the house but they express genteel surprise  miss fanny  mary surely we are addressing the gallant captain brown  valentine  it is the misses willoughby and miss henrietta  tis indeed a gratification to renew acquaintance with such elegant and respectable females  the greetings are elaborate  miss willoughby  you have seen miss phoebe sir  valentine  i have had the honour  miss phoebe i regret to say is now lying down with the headache  the ladies are too delicately minded to exchange glances before a man but they are privately of opinion that this meeting after ten years with the dazzling brown has laid miss phoebe low  they are in a twitter of sympathy with her and yearning to see miss susan alone so that they may draw from her an account of the exciting meeting  you do not favour the ball tonight  miss fanny  i confess balls are distasteful to me  miss henrietta  twill be a mixed assembly  i am credibly informed that the woollen drapers daughter has obtained a card  valentine gravely  good god maam is it possible  miss willoughby  we shall probably spend the evening here with miss susan at the card table  valentine  but miss susan goes with me to the ball maam  this is scarcely less exciting to them than the overthrow of the corsican  valentine  nay i hope there be no impropriety  miss livvy will accompany her  miss willoughby bewildered  miss livvy  valentine  their charming niece  the ladies repeat the word in a daze  miss fanny  they had not apprised us that they have a visitor  they think this reticence unfriendly and are wondering whether they ought not to retire hurt when miss susan enters in her bombazine wraps and bonnet  she starts at sight of them and has the bearing of a guilty person  miss willoughby stiffly  we have but now been advertised of your intention for this evening susan  miss henrietta  we deeply regret our intrusion  miss susan wistfully  please not to be piqued mary  twas sosudden  miss willoughby  i cannot remember susan that your estimable brother had a daughter  i thought all the three were sons  miss susan with deplorable readiness  three sons and a daughter surely you remember little livvy mary  miss willoughby bluntly  no susan i do not  miss susan  ii must go  i hear livvy calling  miss fanny tartly  i hear nothing but the band  we are not to see your niece  miss susan  another timetomorrow  pray rest a little before you depart mary  iiphoebe livvythe headache  but before she can go another lady enters gaily  valentine  ah here is miss livvy  the true culprit is more cunning than miss susan and before they can see her she quickly pulls the strings of her bonnet which is like miss henriettas and it obscures her face  miss susan  thisthis is my niece livvymiss willoughby miss henrietta miss fanny willoughby  valentine  ladies excuse my impatience but  miss willoughby  one moment sir  may i ask miss livvy how many brothers you have  phoebe  two  miss willoughby  i thank you  she looks strangely at miss susan and miss phoebe knows that she has blundered  phoebe at a venture  excluding the unhappy thomas  miss susan clever for the only moment in her life  we never mention him  they are swept away on the arms of the impatient captain  miss willoughby miss henrietta and miss fanny  what has thomas done  they have no suspicion as yet of what miss phoebe has done but they believe there is a scandal in the throssel family and they will not sleep happily until they know what it is    end of act ii     act iii  the ball  a ball but not the one to which we have seen miss susan and miss phoebe rush forth upon their career of crime  this is the third of the series the one of which patty has foretold with horrid relish that it promises to be specially given over to devilries  the scene is a canvas pavilion used as a retiring room and for card play and through an opening in the back we have glimpses of gay uniforms and fair ladies intermingled in the bravery of the dance  there is coming and going through this opening and also through slits in the canvas  the pavilion is fantastically decorated in various tastes and is lit with lanterns  a goodnatured moon nevertheless shines into it benignly some of the card tables are neglected but at one a game of quadrille is in progress  there is much movement and hilarity but none from one side of the tent where sit several young ladies all pretty all appealing and all woeful for no gallant comes to ask them if he may have the felicity  the nervous woman chaperoning them and afraid to meet their gaze lest they scowl or weep in reply is no other than miss susan the most unhappy miss susan we have yet seen she sits there gripping her composure in both hands  far less susceptible to shame is the brazen phoebe who may be seen passing the opening on the arm of a cavalier and flinging her trembling sister a mischievous kiss  the younger ladies note the incident alas they are probably meant to notice it and they cower as under a blow   harriet a sadeyed large girl who we hope found a romance at her next ball  are we so disagreeable that no one will dance with us miss susan tis infamous they have eyes for no one but your niece  charlotte  miss livvy has taken ensign blades from me  harriet  if miss phoebe were here i am sure she would not allow her old pupils to be so neglected  the only possible reply for miss susan is to make herself look as small as possible  a lieutenant comes to them once a scorner of woman but now spicer the bewitched  harriet has a moments hope  how do you do sir  spicer with dreadful indifference though she is his dear cousin nay maam how do you do  wistfully  may i stand beside you miss susan  he is a most melancholic young man and he fidgets her  miss susan with spirit  you have been standing beside me sir nearly all the evening  spicer humbly  it is strange to think that he had been favourably mentioned in despatches  indeed i cannot but be cognisant of the sufferings i cause by attaching myself to you in this unseemly manner  accept my assurances maam that you have my deepest sympathy  miss susan  then why do you do it  spicer  because you are her aunt maam  it is a scheme of mine by which i am in hopes to soften her heart  her affection for you maam is beautiful to observe and if she could be persuaded that i seek her hand from a passionate desire to have you for my aunt susando you perceive anything hopeful in my scheme maam  miss susan  no sir i do not  spicer wanders away gloomily takes too much to drink and ultimately becomes a general  ensign blades appears frowning and charlotte ventures to touch his sleeve  charlotte  ensign blades i have not danced with you once this evening  blades with the cold brutality of a lover to another she  nor i with you charlotte  to susan  may i solicit of you miss susan is captain brown miss livvys guardian is he affianced to her  miss susan  no sir  blades  then by what right maam does he interfere  your elegant niece had consented to accompany me to the shrubberyto look at the moon  and now captain brown forbids it  tis unendurable  charlotte  but you may see the moon from here sir  blades glancing at it contemptuously  i believe not maam  the moon still shines on  miss susan primly  i am happy captain brown forbade her  blades  miss susan twas but because he is to conduct her to the shrubbery himself  he flings out pettishly and miss susan looks pityingly at the wallflowers  miss susan  my poor charlotte  may i take you to some very agreeable ladies  charlotte tartly  no you may not  i am going to the shrubbery to watch miss livvy  miss susan  please not to do that  charlotte implying that miss susan will be responsible for her early death  my chest is weak  i shall sit among the dew  miss susan  charlotte you terrify me  at least please to put this cloak about your shoulders  nay my dear allow me  she puts a cloak around charlotte who departs vindictively for the shrubbery  she will not find livvy there however for next moment miss phoebe darts in from the back  phoebe in a gay whisper  susan another offer transcribers note officer major linkwaterrotund man black whiskers fierce expression he has rushed away to destroy himself  we have been unable to find any record of the majors tragic end  an old soldier looking up from a card table whence he has heard the raging of blades  miss livvy maam what is this about the moon  phoebe smiles roguishly  phoebe looking about her  i want my cloak aunt susan  miss susan  i have just lent it to poor charlotte parratt  phoebe  oh auntie  old soldier  and now miss livvy cannot go into the shrubbery to see the moon and she is so fond of the moon  miss phoebe screws her nose at him merrily and darts back to the dance but she has left a defender behind her  a gallant whose name we have not succeeded in discovering  am i to understand sir that you are intimating disparagement of the moon  if a certain female has been graciously pleased to signify approval of that orb any slight cast upon the moon sir i shall regard as a personal affront  old soldier  hoitytoity  but he rises and they face each other as miss susan feels for battle  she is about to rush between their undrawn swords when there is a commotion outside a crowd gathers and opens to allow some officers to assist a fainting woman into the tent  it is miss phoebe and miss susan with a cry goes on her knees beside her  the tent has filled with the sympathetic and inquisitive but captain brown as a physician takes command and by his order they retire  he finds difficulty in bringing the sufferer to and gets little help from miss susan who can only call upon miss phoebe by name  valentine  nay miss susan tis useless calling for miss phoebe tis my fault i should not have permitted miss livvy to dance so immoderately  why do they delay with the cordial  he goes to the back to close the opening and while he is doing so the incomprehensible miss phoebe seizes the opportunity to sit up on her couch of chairs waggle her finger at miss susan and sign darkly that she is about to make a genteel recovery  phoebe  where am i  is that you aunt susan  what has happened  valentine returning  nay you must recline miss livvy  you fainted  you have overfatigued yourself  phoebe  i remember  blades enters with the cordial  valentine  you will sip this cordial  blades  by your leave sir  he hands it to phoebe himself  valentine  she is in restored looks already miss susan  phoebe  i am quite recovered  perhaps if you were to leave me now with my excellent aunt  valentine  be off with you apple cheeks  blades  sir i will suffer no reference to my complexion and if i mistake not this charming lady was addressing you  phoebe  if you please both of you  they retire together and no sooner have they gone than miss phoebe leaps from the couch her eyes sparkling  she presses the cordial on miss susan nay drink it susan  i left it for you on purpose  i have such awful information to impart  drink  miss susan drinks tremblingly and then the bolt is fired  susan miss henrietta and miss fanny are here  miss susan  phoebe  phoebe  suddenly my eyes lighted on them  at once i slipped to the ground  miss susan  you think they did not see you  phoebe  i am sure of it  they talked for a moment to ensign blades and then turned and seemed to be going towards the shrubbery  miss susan  he had heard that you were there with captain brown  he must have told them  phoebe  i was not  but oh sister i am sure they suspect else why should they be here  they never frequent balls  miss susan  they have suspected for a week ever since they saw you in your veil phoebe on the night of the first dance  how could they but suspect when they have visited us every day since then and we have always pretended that livvy was gone out  phoebe  should they see my face it will be idle to attempt to deceive them  miss susan  idle indeed phoebe the scandal  youa schoolmistress  phoebe  that is it sister  a little happiness has gone to my head like strong waters  she is very restless and troubled  miss susan  my dear stand still and think  phoebe  i dare not i cannot  oh susan if they see me we need not open school again  miss susan  we shall starve  phoebe passionately  this horrid forward flirting heartless hateful little toad of a livvy  miss susan  brother jamess daughter as we call her  phoebe  tis all jamess fault  miss susan  sister when you know that james has no daughter  phoebe  if he had really had one think you i could have been so wicked as to personate her  susan i know not what i am saying but you know who it is that has turned me into this wild creature  miss susan  oh valentine brown how could you  phoebe  to weary of phoebepatient ladylike phoebethe phoebe whom i have lostto turn from her with a bah you make me old and become enamoured in a night of a thing like this  miss susan  yes yes indeed yet he has been kind to us also  he has been to visit us several times  phoebe  in the hope to see her  was he not most silent and gloomy when we said she was gone out  miss susan  he is infatuate she hesitates  sister you are not partial to him still  phoebe  no susan no  i did love him all those years though i never spoke of it to you  i put hope aside at once i folded it up and kissed it and put it away like a pretty garment i could never wear again i but loved to think of him as a noble man  but he is not a noble man and livvy found it out in an hour  the gallant  i flirted that i might enjoy his fury  susan there has been a declaration in his eyes all tonight and when he cries adorable miss livvy be mine i mean to answer with an oh la how ridiculous you are  you are much too oldi have been but quizzing you sir  miss susan  phoebe how can you be so cruel  phoebe  because he has taken from me the one great glory that is in a womans life  not a mans loveshe can do without thatbut her own dear sweet love for him  he is unworthy of my love that is why i can be so cruel  miss susan  oh dear  phoebe  and now my triumph is to be denied me for we must steal away home before henrietta and fanny see us  miss susan  yes yes  phoebe dispirited  and tomorrow we must say that livvy has gone back to her father for i dare keep up this deception no longer susan let us go  they are going dejectedly but are arrested by the apparition of miss henrietta and miss fanny peeping into the tent  phoebe has just time to signify to her sister that she will confess all and beg for mercy when the intruders speak  miss henrietta not triumphant but astounded  you miss phoebe  phoebe with bowed head  yes  miss fanny  how amazing  you do not deny maam that you are miss phoebe  phoebe making confession  yes fanny i am miss phoebe  to her bewilderment henrietta and fanny exchange ashamed glances  miss henrietta  miss phoebe we have done you a cruel wrong  miss fanny  phoebe we apologise  miss henrietta  to think how excitedly we have been following her about in the shrubbery  miss fanny  she is wearing your cloak  miss henrietta  ensign blades told us she was gone to the shrubbery  miss fanny  and we were convinced there was no such person  miss henrietta  so of course we thought it must be you  miss fanny who has looked out  i can discern her in the shrubbery still  she is decidedly taller than phoebe  miss henrietta  i thought she looked taller  i meant to say so phoebe twas the cloak deceived us  we could not see her face  phoebe beginning to understand  cloak  you mean henriettayou mean fanny  miss fanny  twas wicked of us my dear but wewe thought that you and miss livvy were the same person  they have evidently been stalking charlotte in miss phoebes cloak  miss susan shudders but miss phoebe utters a cry of reproach and it is some time before they can persuade her to forgive them  it is of course also some time before we can forgive miss phoebe phoebe you look so pretty  are they paying you no attentions my dear  phoebe is unable to resist these delightful openings  the imploring looks miss susan gives her but add to her enjoyment  it is as if the sense of fun she had caged a moment ago were broke loose again  phoebe  alas they think of none but livvy  they come to me merely to say that they adore her  miss henrietta  surely not captain brown  phoebe  he is infatuate about her  miss fanny  poor phoebe  they make much of her and she purrs naughtily to their stroking with lightning peeps at miss susan  affronted providence seeks to pay her out by sending ensign blades into the tent  then the close observer may see miss phoebes heart sink like a bucket in a well miss susan steals from the tent  miss henrietta  mr blades i have been saying that if i were a gentleman i would pay my addresses to miss phoebe much rather than to her niece  blades  maam excuse me  miss henrietta indignant that miss phoebe should be slighted so publicly  sir you are a most ungallant and deficient young man  blades  really maam i assure you  miss henrietta  not another word sir  phoebe in her most oldmaidish manner  miss fanny miss henrietta it is time i spoke plainly to this gentleman  please leave him to me surely twill come best from me  miss henrietta  indeed yes if it be not too painful to you  phoebe  i must do my duty  miss fanny wistfully  if we could remain  phoebe  would it be seemly miss fanny  miss henrietta  come fanny  to blades  sir you bring your punishment upon yourself  they press phoebes hand and go  her heart returns to its usual abode  blades bewildered  are you angry with me miss livvy  phoebe  oh no  blades  miss livvy i have something to say to you of supreme importance to me  with regard to my complexion i am aware miss livvy that it has retained a too youthful bloom  my brother officers comment on it with a certain lack of generosity  anxiously  might i inquire maam whether you regard my complexion as a subject for light talk  phoebe  no indeed sir i only wish i had it  blades who has had no intention of offering but is suddenly carried off his feet by the excellence of the opportunity which is no doubt responsible for many proposals  miss livvy maam you may have it  she has a great and humorous longing that she could turn before his affrighted eyes into the schoolmistress she really is  she would endure much to be able at this moment to say i have listened to you ensign blades with attention but i am really miss phoebe and i must now request you to fetch me the implement under the shock would he have surrendered his palm for punishment  it can never be known for as she looks at him longingly lieutenant spicer enters and he mistakes the meaning of that longing look  spicer  tis my dance maamtis not ensign blades  blades  leave us sir  we have matter of moment to discuss  spicer fearing the worst  his affection miss livvy is not so deep as mine  he is a light and shallow nature  phoebe  pooh  you are both light and shallow natures  blades  both maam  but he is not sure that he has not had a miraculous escape  phoebe severely  tis such as you with your foolish flirting ways that confuse the minds of women and make us try to be as silly as yourselves  spicer crushed  maam  phoebe  i did not mean to hurt you  she takes a hand of each and tries to advise them as if her curls were once more hidden under a cap you are so like little boys in a school  do be good  sit here beside me  i know you are very brave  blades  ha  phoebe  and when you come back from the wars it must be so delightful to you to flirt with the ladies again  spicer  oh maam  phoebe  as soon as you see a lady with a pretty nose you cannot help saying that you adore her  blades in an ecstasy  nay i swear  phoebe  and you offer to her not from love but because you are so deficient in conversation  spicer  charming miss livvy  phoebe with sudden irritation  oh sir go away go away both of you and read improving books  they are cast down  she has not been quite fair to these gallants for it is not really of them she has grown weary so much as of the lady they temporarily adore  if miss phoebe were to analyse her feelings she would find that her remark is addressed to livvy and that it means i have enjoyed for a little pretending to be you but i am not you and i do not wish to be you  your glitter and the airs of you and the racket of you tire me i want to be done with you and to be back in quiet quality street of which i am a part it is really pleasant to me to know that i shall wake up tomorrow slightly middleaged  with the entrance of captain brown however she is at once a frivol again  he frowns at sight of her cavaliers  valentine  gentlemen i instructed this lady to rest and i am surprised to find you in attendance  miss livvy you must be weary of their fatuities and i have taken the liberty to order your chaise  phoebe  it is indeed a liberty  blades  an outrage  phoebe  i prefer to remain  valentine  nay  phoebe  i promised this dance to ensign blades  spicer  to me maam  phoebe  and the following one to lieutenant spicer  mr blades your arm  valentine  i forbid any further dancing  phoebe  forbid  la  blades  sir by what right  valentine  by a right which i hope to make clear to miss livvy as soon as you gentlemen have retired  phoebe sees that the declaration is coming  she steels herself  phoebe  i am curious to know what captain brown can have to say to me in a few minutes mr blades lieutenant spicer i shall be at your service  valentine  i trust not  phoebe  i give them my word  the young gentlemen retire treading air once more  brown surveys her rather grimly  valentine  you are an amazing pretty girl maam but you are a shocking flirt  phoebe  la  valentine  it has somewhat diverted me to watch them go down before you  but i know you have a kind heart and that if there be a rapier in your one hand there is a handkerchief in the other ready to staunch their wounds  phoebe  i have not observed that they bled much  valentine  the blades and the like no  but one may perhaps  phoebe obviously the reference is to himself  perhaps i may wish to see him bleed  valentine grown stern  for shame miss livvy  anger rises in her but she wishes him to proceed  i speak maam in the interests of the man to whom i hope to see you affianced  no she does not wish him to proceed  she had esteemed him for so long she cannot have him debase himself before her now  phoebe  shall wei have changed my mind i consent to go home please to say nothing  valentine  nay  phoebe  i beg you  valentine  no  we must have it out  phoebe  then if you must go on do so  but remember i begged you to desist  who is this happy man  his next words are a great shock to her  valentine  as to who he is maam of course i have no notion  nor i am sure have you else you would be more guarded in your conduct  but some day miss livvy the right man will come  not to be able to tell him all would it not be hard  and how could you acquaint him with this poor sport  his face would change maam as you told him of it and yours would be a false face until it was told  this is what i have been so desirous to say to youby the right of a friend  phoebe in a low voice but bravely  i see  valentine afraid that he has hurt her  it has been hard to say and i have done it bunglingly  ah but believe me miss livvy it is not the flaunting flower men love it is the modest violet  phoebe  the modest violet  you dare to say that  valentine  yes indeed and when you are acquaint with what love really is  phoebe  love  what do you know of love  valentine a little complacently  why maam i know all about it i am in love miss livvy  phoebe with a disdainful inclination of the head  i wish you happy  valentine  with a lady who was once very like you maam  at first phoebe does not understand then a suspicion of his meaning comes to her  phoebe  notnotoh no  valentine  i had not meant to speak of it but why should not i  it will be a fine lesson to you miss livvy  maam it is your aunt phoebe whom i love  phoebe rigid  you do not mean that  valentine  most ardently  phoebe  it is not true how dare you make sport of her  valentine  is it sport to wish she may be my wife  phoebe  your wife  valentine  if i could win her  phoebe bewildered  may i solicit sir for how long you have been attached to miss phoebe  valentine  for nine years i think  phoebe  you think  valentine  i want to be honest  never in all that time had i thought myself in love  your aunts were my dear friends and while i was at the wars we sometimes wrote to each other but they were only friendly letters  i presume the affection was too placid to be love  phoebe  i think that would be aunt phoebes opinion  valentine  yet i remember before we went into action for the first timei suppose the fear of death was upon mesome of them were making their willsi have no near relativei left everything to these two ladies  phoebe softly  did you  what is it that miss phoebe begins to see as she sits there so quietly with her hands pressed together as if upon some treasure  it is phoebe of the ringlets with the stain taken out of her  valentine  and when i returned a week ago and saw miss phoebe grown so tiredlooking and so poor  phoebe  the shock made you feel old i know  valentine  no miss livvy but it filled me with a sudden passionate regret that i had not gone down in that first engagement  they would have been very comfortably left  phoebe  oh sir  valentine  i am not calling it love  phoebe  it was sweet and kind but it was not love  valentine  it is love now  phoebe  no it is only pity  valentine  it is love  phoebe she smiles tremulously  you really mean phoebetired unattractive phoebe that woman whose girlhood is gone  nay impossible  valentine stoutly  phoebe of the fascinating playful ways whose ringlets were once as pretty as yours maam  i have visited her in her home several times this weekyou were always outi thank you for that  i was alone with her and with fragrant memories of her  phoebe  memories  yes that is the phoebe you love the bright girl of the pastnot the schoolmistress in her oldmaids cap  valentine  there you wrong me for i have discovered for myself that the schoolmistress in her oldmaids cap is the noblest miss phoebe of them all  if only he would go away and let miss phoebe cry when i enlisted i remember i compared her to a garden  i have often thought of that  phoebe  tis an old garden now  valentine  the paths maam are better shaded  phoebe  the flowers have grown oldfashioned  valentine  they smell the sweeter  miss livvy do you think there is any hope for me  phoebe  there was a man whom miss phoebe lovedlong ago  he did not love her  valentine  now here was a fool  phoebe  he kissed her once  valentine  if miss phoebe suffered him to do that she thought he loved her  phoebe  yes yes  she has to ask him the ten years old question do you opinion that this makes her action in allowing it less reprehensible  it has been such a pain to her ever since  valentine  how like miss phoebe  sternly  but that man was a knave  phoebe  no he was a good manonly a littleinconsiderate  she knows now that he has even forgotten that he did it  i suppose men are like that  valentine  no miss livvy men are not like that  i am a very average man but i thank god i am not like that  phoebe  it was you  valentine after a pause  did miss phoebe say that  phoebe  yes  valentine  then it is true  he is very grave and quiet  phoebe  it was raining and her face was wet  you said you did it because her face was wet  valentine  i had quite forgotten  phoebe  but she remembers and how often do you think the shameful memory has made her face wet since  the face you love captain brown you were the first to give it pain  the tired eyeshow much less tired they might be if they had never known you  you who are torturing me with every word what have you done to miss phoebe  you who think you can bring back the bloom to that faded garden and all the pretty airs and graces that fluttered round it once like little birds before the nest is torn downbring them back to her if you can sir it was you who took them away  valentine  i vow i shall do my best to bring them back  miss phoebe shakes her head miss livvy with your help  phoebe  my help  i have not helped  i tried to spoil it all  valentine smiling  to spoil it  you mean that you sought to flirt even with me  ah i knew you did  but that is nothing  phoebe  oh sir if you could overlook it  valentine  i do  phoebe  and forget these hateful balls  valentine  hateful  nay i shall never call them that  they have done me too great a service  it was at the balls that i fell in love with miss phoebe  phoebe  what can you mean  valentine  she who was never at a ball  checking himself humorously  but i must not tell you it might hurt you  phoebe  tell me  valentine gaily  then on your own head be the blame  it is you who have made me love her miss livvy  phoebe  sir  valentine  yes it is odd and yet very simple  you who so resembled her as she was for an hour maam you bewitched me yes i confess it but twas only for an hour  how like i cried at first but soon it was how unlike  there was almost nothing she would have said that you said you did so much that she would have scorned to do  but i must not say these things to you  phoebe  i ask it of you captain brown  valentine  well  miss phoebes ladylikeness on which she set such store that i used to make merry of the wordi gradually perceived that it is a womans most beautiful garment and the casket which contains all the adorable qualities that go to the making of a perfect female when miss livvy rolled her eyesah  he stops apologetically  phoebe  proceed sir  valentine  it but made me the more complacent that never in her life had miss phoebe been guilty of the slightest deviation from the strictest propriety  she shudders  i was always conceiving her in your place  oh it was monstrous unfair to you  i stood looking at you miss livvy and seeing in my mind her and the pretty things she did and you did not do why maam that is how i fell in love with miss phoebe at the balls  phoebe  i thank you  valentine  maam tell me do you think there is any hope for me  phoebe  hope  valentine  i shall go to her  miss phoebe i will sayoh maam so reverentlymiss phoebe my beautiful most estimable of women let me take care of you for ever more  miss phoebe presses the words to her heart and then drops them  phoebe  beautiful  la aunt phoebe  valentine  ah maam you may laugh at a rough soldier so much enamoured but tis true  marry me miss phoebe i will say and i will take you back through those years of hardships that have made your sweet eyes too patient  instead of growing older you shall grow younger  we will travel back together to pick up the many little joys and pleasures you had to pass by when you trod that thorny path alone  phoebe  cant becant be  valentine  nay miss phoebe has loved me  tis you have said it  phoebe  i did not mean to tell you  valentine  she will be my wife yet  phoebe  never  valentine  you are severe miss livvy  but it is because you are partial to her and i am happy of that  phoebe in growing horror of herself  i partial to her  i am laughing at both of you  miss phoebe  la that old thing  valentine sternly  silence  phoebe  i hate her and despise her  if you knew what she is  he stops her with a gesture  valentine  i know what you are  phoebe  that paragon who has never been guilty of the slightest deviation from the strictest propriety  valentine  never  phoebe  that garden  valentine  miss livvy for shame  phoebe  your garden has been destroyed sir the weeds have entered it and all the flowers are choked  valentine  you false woman what do you mean  phoebe  i will tell you  but his confidence awes her  what faith you have in her  valentine  as in my god  speak  phoebe  i cannot tell you  valentine  no you cannot  phoebe  it is too horrible  valentine  you are too horrible  is not that it  phoebe  yes that is it  miss susan has entered and caught the last words  miss susan shrinking as from a coming blow  what is too horrible  valentine  maam i leave the telling of it to her if she dare  and i devoutly hope those are the last words i shall ever address to this lady  he bows and goes out in dudgeon  miss susan believes all is discovered and that miss phoebe is for ever shamed  miss susan taking phoebe in her arms  my love my dear what terrible thing has he said to you  phoebe forgetting everything but that she is loved  not terribleglorious  susan tis phoebe he loves tis me not livvy he loves me he loves me  mephoebe  miss susans bosom swells  it is her great hour as much as phoebes    end of act iii     act iv  the blue and white room  if we could shut our eyes to the two sisters sitting here in woe this would be to the male eye at least the identical blue and white room of ten years ago the same sun shining into it and playing familiarly with miss susans treasures  but the ladies are changed  it is not merely that miss phoebe has again donned her schoolmistresss gown and hidden her curls under the cap  to see her thus once more her real self after the escapade of the ball is not unpleasant and the cap and gown do not ill become the quiet room  but she now turns guiltily from the sun that used to be her intimate her face is drawn her form condensed into the smallest space and her hands lie trembling in her lap  it is disquieting to note that any life there is in the room comes not from her but from miss susan  if the house were to go on fire now it would be she who would have to carry out miss phoebe  whatever of import has happened since the ball patty knows it and is enjoying it  we see this as she ushers in miss willoughby  note also with concern that at mention of the visitors name the eyes of the sisters turn affrightedly not to the door by which their old friend enters but to the closed door of the spare bedchamber  patty also gives it a meaning glance then the three look at each other and two of them blanch   miss willoughby the fourth to look at the door  i am just run across susan to inquire how miss livvy does now  miss susan  she is still very poorly mary  miss willoughby  i am so unhappy of that  i conceive it to be a nervous disorder  miss susan almost too glibly  accompanied by trembling flutterings and spasms  miss willoughby  the excitements of the ball  you have summoned the apothecary at last i trust phoebe  miss phoebe once so ready of defence can say nothing  miss susan to the rescue  it is livvys own wish that he should not be consulted  miss willoughby looking longingly at the door  may i go in to see her  miss susan  i fear not mary  she is almost asleep and it is best not to disturb her  peeping into the bedroom  lie quite still livvy my love quite still  somehow this makes patty smile so broadly that she finds it advisable to retire  miss willoughby sighs and produces a small bowl from the folds of her cloak  miss willoughby  this is a little arrowroot of which i hope miss livvy will be so obliging as to partake  miss susan taking the bowl  i thank you mary  phoebe ashamed  susan we ought not  miss susan shameless  i will take it to her while it is still warm  she goes into the bedroom  miss willoughby gazes at miss phoebe who certainly shrinks  it has not escaped the notice of the visitor that miss phoebe has become the more timid of the sisters and she has evolved an explanation  miss willoughby  phoebe has captain brown been apprised of miss livvys illness  phoebe uncomfortably  i think not miss willoughby  miss willoughby sorry for phoebe and speaking very kindly  is this right phoebe  you informed fanny and henrietta at the ball of his partiality for livvy  my dear it is hard for you but have you any right to keep them apart  phoebe discovering only now what are the suspicions of her friends is that what you think i am doing miss willoughby  miss willoughby  such a mysterious illness  sweetly  long ago phoebe i once caused much unhappiness through foolish jealousy  that is why i venture to hope that you will not be as i was my dear  phoebe  i jealous of livvy  miss willoughby with a sigh  i thought as little of the lady i refer to but he thought otherwise  phoebe  indeed miss willoughby you wrong me  but miss willoughby does not entirely believe her and there is a pause so long a pause that unfortunately miss susan thinks she has left the house  miss susan peeping in  is she gone  miss willoughby hurt  no susan but i am going  miss susan distressed  mary  she follows her out but miss willoughby will not be comforted and there is a coldness between them for the rest of the day  miss susan is not so abashed as she ought to be  she returns and partakes with avidity of the arrowroot  miss susan  phoebe i am well aware that this is wrong of me but marys arrowroot is so delicious  the ladiesfingers and petticoattails those officers sent to livvy i ate them also  once on a time this would have amused miss phoebe but her sense of humour has gone  she is crying  phoebe if you have such remorse you will weep yourself to death  phoebe  oh sister were it not for you how gladly would i go into a decline  miss susan after she has soothed phoebe a little  my dear what is to be done about her  we cannot have her supposed to be here for ever  phoebe  we had to pretend that she was ill to keep her out of sight and now we cannot say she has gone away for the miss willoughbys windows command our door and they are always watching  miss susan peeping from the window  i see fanny watching now  i feel phoebe as if livvy really existed  phoebe mournfully  we shall never be able to esteem ourselves again  miss susan who has in her the makings of a desperate criminal phoebe why not marry him  if only we could make him think that livvy had gone home  then he need never know  phoebe  susan you pain me  she who marries without telling allhers must ever be a false face  they are his own words  patty enters importantly  patty  captain brown  phoebe starting up  i wrote to him begging him not to come  miss susan quickly  patty i am sorry we are out  but valentine has entered in time to hear her words  valentine not unmindful that this is the room in which he is esteemed a wit  i regret that they are out patty but i will await their return  the astonishing man sits on the ottoman beside miss susan but politely ignores her presence  it is not my wish to detain you patty  patty goes reluctantly and the sisters think how like him and how delightful it would be if they were still the patterns of propriety he considers them  phoebe bravely  captain brown  valentine rising  you miss phoebe  i hear miss livvy is indisposed  phoebe  she isvery poorly  valentine  but it is not that unpleasant girl i have come to see it is you  miss susan meekly  how do you do  valentine ignoring her  and i am happy miss phoebe to find you alone  miss susan appealingly  how do you do sir  phoebe  you know quite well sir that susan is here  valentine  nay maam excuse me  i heard miss susan say she was gone out  miss susan is incapable of prevarication  miss susan risinghelpless  what am i to do  phoebe  dont go susantis what he wants  valentine  i have her word that she is not present  miss susan  oh dear  valentine  my faith in miss susan is absolute  at this she retires into the bedroom and immediately his manner changes  he takes miss phoebes hands into his own kind ones you coward miss phoebe to be afraid of valentine brown  phoebe  i wrote and begged you not to come  valentine  you implied as a lover miss phoebe but surely always as a friend  phoebe  oh yes yes  valentine  you told miss livvy that you loved me once  how carefully you hid it from me  phoebe more firmly  a woman must never tell  you went away to the great battles  i was left to fight in a little one  women have a flag to fly mr brown as well as men and old maids have a flag as well as women  i tried to keep mine flying  valentine  but you ceased to care for me  tenderly  i dare ask your love no more but i still ask you to put yourself into my keeping miss phoebe let me take care of you  phoebe  it cannot be  valentine  this weary teaching  let me close your school  phoebe  please sir  valentine  if not for your own sake i ask you miss phoebe to do it for mine  in memory of the thoughtless recruit who went off laughing to the wars  they say ladies cannot quite forget the man who has used them ill miss phoebe do it for me because i used you ill  phoebe  i beg youno more  valentine manfully  there it is all ended  miss phoebe here is my hand on it  phoebe  what will you do now  valentine  i also must work  i will become a physician again with some drab old housekeeper to neglect me and the house  do you foresee the cobwebs gathering and gathering miss phoebe  phoebe  oh sir  valentine  you shall yet see me in quality street wearing my stock all awry  phoebe  oh oh  valentine  and with snuff upon my sleeve  phoebe  sir sir  valentine  no skulker maam i hope but gradually turning into a grumpy crusty bottlenosed old bachelor  phoebe  oh mr brown  valentine  and all because you will not walk across the street with me  phoebe  indeed sir you must marryand i hope it may be some one who is really like a garden  valentine  i know but one  that reminds me miss phoebe of something i had forgot  he produces a paper from his pocket  tis a trifle i have wrote about you  but i fear to trouble you  phoebes hands go out longingly for it  phoebe reading  lines to a certain lady who is modestly unaware of her resemblance to a garden  wrote by her servant v b  the beauty of this makes her falter  she looks up  valentine with a poets pride  there is more of it maam  phoebe reading    the lilies are her pretty thoughts     her shoulders are the may   her smiles are all forgetmenots     the path s her gracious way    the roses that do line it are     her fancies walking round   tis sweetly smelling lavender     in which my ladys gowned   miss phoebe has thought herself strong but she is not able to read such exquisite lines without betraying herself to a lovers gaze  valentine excitedly  miss phoebe when did you cease to care for me  phoebe retreating from him but clinging to her poem  you promised not to ask  valentine  i know not why you should miss phoebe but i believe you love me still  miss phoebe has the terrified appearance of a detected felon  miss susan returns  miss susan  you are talking so loudly  valentine  miss susan does she care for me still  miss susan forgetting her pride of sex  oh sir how could she help it  valentine  then by gad miss phoebe you shall marry me though i have to carry you in my arms to the church  phoebe  sir how can you  but miss susan gives her a look which means that it must be done if only to avoid such a scandal  it is at this inopportune moment that miss henrietta and miss fanny are announced  miss henrietta  i think miss willoughby has already popped in  phoebe with a little spirit  yes indeed  miss susan a mistress of sarcasm  how is mary fanny  she has not been to see us for several minutes  miss fanny somewhat daunted  mary is so partial to you susan  valentine  your servant miss henrietta miss fanny  miss fanny  how do you do sir  miss henrietta wistfully  and how do you find miss livvy sir  valentine  i have not seen her miss henrietta  miss henrietta  indeed  miss fanny  not even you  valentine  you seem surprised  miss fanny  nay sir you must not say so but really phoebe  phoebe  fanny you presume  valentine puzzled  if one of you ladies would deign to enlighten me  to begin with what is miss livvys malady  miss henrietta  he does not know  oh phoebe  valentine  ladies have pity on a dull man and explain  miss fanny timidly  please not to ask us to explain  i fear we have already said more than was proper  phoebe forgive  to captain brown this but adds to the mystery and he looks to phoebe for enlightenment  phoebe desperate  i understand sir there is a belief that i keep livvy in confinement because of your passion for her  valentine  my passion for miss livvy  why miss fanny i cannot abide hernor she me  looking manfully at miss phoebe furthermore i am proud to tell you that this is the lady whom i adore  miss fanny  phoebe  valentine  yes maam  the ladies are for a moment bereft of speech and the uplifted phoebe cannot refrain from a movement which if completed would be a curtsy  her punishment follows promptly  miss henrietta from her heart  phoebe i am so happy tis you  miss fanny  dear phoebe i give you joy  and you also sir  miss phoebe sends her sister a glance of unutterable woe and escapes from the room  it is most illbred of her  miss susan i do not understand  miss henrietta  is it that miss livvy is an obstacle  miss susan who knows that there is no hope for her but in flight i think i hear phoebe calling mea sudden indisposition  pray excuse me henrietta  she goes  miss henrietta  we know not sir whether to offer you our felicitations  valentine cogitating  may i ask maam what you mean by an obstacle  is there some mystery about miss livvy  miss henrietta  so much so sir that we at one time thought she and miss phoebe were the same person  valentine  pshaw  miss fanny  why will they admit no physician into her presence  miss henrietta  the blinds of her room are kept most artfully drawn  miss fanny plaintively  we have never seen her sir  neither miss susan nor miss phoebe will present her to us  valentine impressed  indeed  miss henrietta and miss fanny encouraged by his sympathy draw nearer the door of the interesting bedchamber  they falter  any one who thinks however that they would so far forget themselves as to open the door and peep in has no understanding of the ladies of quality street  they are nevertheless not perfect for miss henrietta knocks on the door  miss henrietta  how do you find yourself dear miss livvy  there is no answer  it is our pride to record that they come away without even touching the handle  they look appealing at captain brown whose face has grown grave  valentine  i think ladies as a physician  he walks into the bedroom  they feel an ignoble drawing to follow him but do not yield to it  when he returns his face is inscrutable  miss henrietta  is she very poorly sir  valentine  ha  miss fanny  we did not hear you address her  valentine  she is not awake maam  miss henrietta  it is provoking  miss fanny sternly just  they informed mary that she was nigh asleep  valentine  it is not a serious illness i think maam  with the permission of miss phoebe and miss susan i will make myself more acquaint with her disorder presently  he is desirous to be alone but we must not talk lest we disturb her  miss fanny  you suggest our retiring sir  valentine  nay miss fanny  miss fanny  you are very obliging but i think henrietta  miss henrietta rising  yes fanny  no doubt they are the more ready to depart that they wish to inform miss willoughby at once of these strange doings  as they go miss susan and miss phoebe return and the adieux are less elaborate than usual  neither visitors nor hostesses quite know what to say  miss susan is merely relieved to see them leave but miss phoebe has read something in their manner that makes her uneasy  phoebe  why have they departed so hurriedly sir  theythey did not go in to see livvy  valentine  no  she reads danger in his face  phoebe  why do you look at me so strangely  valentine somewhat stern  miss phoebe i desire to see miss livvy  phoebe  impossible  valentine  why impossible  they tell me strange stories about no ones seeing her  miss phoebe i will not leave this house until i have seen her  phoebe  you cannot  but he is very determined and she is afraid of him  will you excuse me sir while i talk with susan behind the door  the sisters go guiltily into the bedroom and captain brown after some hesitation rings for patty  valentine  patty come here  why is this trick being played upon me  patty with all her wits about her  trick sir  who would dare  valentine  i know patty that miss phoebe has been miss livvy all the time  patty  i give in  valentine  why has she done this  patty beseechingly  are you laughing sir  valentine  i am very far from laughing  patty turning on him  twas you that began it all by not knowing her in the white gown  valentine  why has this deception been kept up so long  patty  because you would not see through it  oh the wicked denseness  she thought you were infatuate with miss livvy because she was young and silly  valentine  it is infamous  patty  i will not have you call her names  twas all playful innocence at first and now she is so feared of you she is weeping her soul to death and all i do i cannot rouse her  i ha a follower in the kitchen maam says i to infuriate her  give him a glass of cowslip wine says she like a gentle lamb  and ill she can afford it you having lost their money for them  valentine  what is that  on the contrary all the money they have patty they owe to my having invested it for them  patty  that is the money they lost  valentine  you are sure of that  patty  i can swear to it  valentine  deceived me about that also  good god but why  patty  i think she was feared you would offer to her out of pity  she said something to miss susan about keeping a flag flying  what she meant i know not  but he knows and he turns away his face  are you laughing sir  valentine  no patty i am not laughing  why do they not say miss livvy has gone home  it would save them a world of trouble  patty  the misses willoughby and miss henriettathey watch the house all day  they would say she cannot be gone for we did not see her go  valentine enlightened at last  i see  patty  and miss phoebe and miss susan wring their hands for they are feared miss livvy is bedridden here for all time  now his sense of humour asserts itself  thank the lord you re laughing  at this he laughs the more and it is a gay captain brown on whom miss susan opens the bedroom door  this desperate woman is too full of plot to note the change in him  miss susan  i am happy to inform you sir that livvy finds herself much improved  valentine bolting  it is joy to me to hear it  miss susan  she is coming in to see you  patty aghast  oh maam  valentine frowning on patty  i shall be happy to see the poor invalid  patty  maam  but miss susan believing that so far all is well has returned to the bedchamber  captain brown bestows a quizzical glance upon the maid  valentine  go away patty  anon i may claim a service of you but for the present go  patty  butbut  valentine  retire woman  she has to go and he prepares his face for the reception of the invalid  phoebe comes in without her cap the ringlets showing again  she wears a dressing jacket and is supported by miss susan  valentine gravely  your servant miss livvy  phoebe weakly  how do you do  valentine  allow me miss susan  he takes miss susans place but after an exquisite moment miss phoebe breaks away from him feeling that she is not worthy of such bliss  phoebe  no no ii can walk alonesee  she reclines upon the couch  miss susan  how do you think she is looking  he makes a professional examination of the patient and they are very ashamed to deceive him but not so ashamed that they must confess  what do you think  valentine solemnly  she will recover  may i say maam it surprises me that any one should see much resemblance between you and your aunt phoebe  miss phoebe is decidedly shorter and more thickset  phoebe sitting up  no i am not  valentine  i said miss phoebe maam  she reclines  but tell me is not miss phoebe to join us  phoebe  she hopes you will excuse her sir  miss susan vaguely  taking the opportunity of airing the room  valentine  ah of course  miss susan opening bedroom door and catting mendaciously  captain brown will excuse you phoebe  valentine  certainly miss susan  well maam i think i could cure miss livvy if she is put unreservedly into my hands  miss susan with a sigh  i am sure you could  valentine  then you are my patient miss livvy  phoebe nervously  twas but a passing indisposition i am almost quite recovered  valentine  nay you still require attention  do you propose making a long stay in quality street maam  phoebe  iii hope not  itit depends  miss susan forgetting herself  mary is the worst  valentine  i ask your pardon  phoebe  aunt susan you are excited  valentine  but you are quite right miss livvy home is the place for you  phoebe  would that i could go  valentine  you are going  phoebe  yessoon  valentine  indeed i have a delightful surprise for you miss livvy you are going today  phoebe  today  valentine  not merely today but now  as it happens my carriage is standing idle at your door and i am to take you in it to your homesome twenty miles if i remember  phoebe  you are to take me  valentine  nay tis no trouble at all and as your physician my mind is made up  some wraps for her miss susan  miss susan  butbut  phoebe in a panic  sir i decline to go  valentine  come miss livvy you are in my hands  phoebe  i decline  i am most determined  valentine  you admit yourself that you are recovered  phoebe  i do not feel so well now  aunt susan  miss susan  sir  valentine  if you wish to consult miss phoebe  miss susan  oh no  valentine  then the wraps miss susan  phoebe  auntie dont leave me  valentine  what a refractory patient it is  but reason with her miss susan and i shall ask miss phoebe for some wraps  phoebe  sir  to their consternation he goes cheerily into the bedroom  miss phoebe saves herself by instant flight and nothing but mesmeric influence keeps miss susan rooted to the blue and white room  when he returns he is loaded with wraps and still cheerfully animated as if he had found nothing untoward in livvys bedchamber  valentine  i think these will do admirably miss susan  miss susan  but phoebe  valentine  if i swathe miss livvy in these  miss susan  phoebe  valentine  she is still busy airing the room  the extraordinary man goes to the couch as if unable to perceive that its late occupant has gone and miss susan watches him fascinated  come miss livvy put these over you  allow methis one over your shoulders so  be so obliging as to lean on me  be brave maam you cannot fallmy arm is round you gently gently miss livvy ah

door is unable to rouse her it is heard however by miss phoebe who steals back into the room her cap upon her head to give her courage  phoebe  he is gone  miss susans rapt face alarms her  oh susan
