youngestborn of eternity child and heir of all the past times with their good and evil and parent of all the future is ever a new era to the thinking man and comes with new questions and significance however commonplace it look to know it and what it bids us do is ever the sum of knowledge for all of us this new day sent us out of heaven this also has its heavenly omensamid the bustling trivialities and loud empty noises its silent monitions which if we cannot read and obey it will not be well with us nonor is there any sin more fearfully avenged on men and nations than that same which indeed includes and presupposes all manner of sins the sin which our old pious fathers called judicial blindnesswhich we with our light habits may still call misinterpretation of the time that now is disloyalty to its real meanings and monitions stupid disregard of these stupid adherence active or passive to the counterfeits and mere current semblances of these this is true of all times and days  but in the days that are now passing over us even fools are arrested to ask the meaning of them few of the generations of men have seen more impressive days days of endless calamity disruption dislocation confusion worse confounded if they are not days of endless hope too then they are days of utter despair for it is not a small hope that will suffice the ruin being clearly either in action or in prospect universal there must be a new world if there is to be any world at all that human things in our europe can ever return to the old sorry routine and proceed with any steadiness or continuance there this small hope is not now a tenable one these days of universal death must be days of universal newbirth if the ruin is not to be total and final it is a time to make the dullest man consider and ask himself whence he came whither he is bounda veritable new era to the foolish as well as to the wise   not long ago the world saw with thoughtless joy which might have been very thoughtful joy a real miracle not heretofore considered possible or conceivable in the worlda reforming pope a simple pious creature a good countrypriest invested unexpectedly with the tiara takes up the new testament declares that this henceforth shall be his rule of governing no more finesse chicanery hypocrisy or false or foul dealing of any kind gods truth shall be spoken gods justice shall be done on the throne called of st peter an honest pope papa or father of christendom shall preside there and such a throne of st peter and such a christendom for an honest papa to preside in the european populations everywhere hailed the omen with shouting and rejoicing leading articles and tarbarrels thinking people listened with astonishmentnot with sorrow if they were faithful or wise with awe rather as at the heralding of death and with a joy as of victory beyond death something pious grand and as if awful in that joy revealing once more the presence of a divine justice in this world for to such men it was very clear how this poor devoted pope would prosper with his new testament in his band an alarming business that of governing in the throne of st peter by the rule of veracity by the rule of veracity the socalled throne of st peter was openly declared above three hundred years ago to be a falsity a huge mistake a pestilent dead carcass which this sun was weary of more than three hundred years ago the throne of st peter received peremptory judicial notice to quit authentic order registered in heavens chancery and since legible in the hearts of all brave men to take itself awayto begone and let us have no more to do with it and its delusions and impious deliriumsand it has been sitting every day since it may depend upon it at its own peril withal and will have to pay exact damages yet for every day it has so sat law of veracity what this popedom had to do by the law of veracity was to give up its own foul galvanic life an offence to gods and men honestly to die and get itself buried  far from this was the thing the poor pope undertook in regard to itand yet on the whole it was essentially this too reforming pope said one of our acquaintance often in those weeks was there ever such a miracle about to break up that huge imposthume too by curing it turgot and necker were nothing to this god is great and when a scandal is to end brings some devoted man to take charge of it in hope not in despairbut cannot he reform asked many simple personsto whom our friend in grim banter would reply reform a popedomhardly a wretched old kettle ruined from top to bottom and consisting mainly now of foul grime and rust stop the holes of it as your antecessors have been doing with temporary putty it may hang together yet a while begin to hammer at it solder at it to what you call mend and rectify itit will fall to sherds as sure as rust is rust go all into nameless dissolutionand the fat in the fire will be a thing worth looking at poor popeso accordingly it has proved the poor pope amid felicitations and tarbarrels of various kinds went on joyfully for a season but he had awakened he as no other man could do the sleeping elements mothers of the whirlwinds conflagrations earthquakes questions not very soluble at present were even sages and heroes set to solve them began everywhere with new emphasis to be asked questions which all official men wished and almost hoped to postpone till doomsday doomsday itself had come that was the terrible truth  for sure enough if once the law of veracity be acknowledged as the rule for human things there will not anywhere be want of work for the reformer in very few places do human things adhere quite closely to that law here was the papa of christendom proclaiming that such was actually the casewhereupon all over christendom such results as we have seen the sicilians i think were the first notable body that set about applying this new strange rule sanctioned by the general father they said to themselves we do not by the law of veracity belong to naples and these neapolitan officials we will by favor of heaven and the pope be free of these fighting ensued insurrection fiercely maintained in the sicilian cities with much bloodshed much tumult and loud noise vociferation extending through all newspapers and countries the effect of this carried abroad by newspapers and rumor was great in all places greatest perhaps in paris which for sixty years past has been the city of insurrections the french people had plumed themselves on being whatever else they were not at least the chosen soldiers of liberty who took the lead of all creatures in that pursuit at least and had become as their orators editors and litterateurs diligently taught them a people whose bayonets were sacred a kind of messiah people saving a blind world in its own despite and earning for themselves a terrestrial and even celestial glory very considerable indeed and here were the wretched downtrodden populations of sicily risen to rival them and threatening to take the trade out of their hand  no doubt of it this hearing continually of the very popes glory as a reformer of the very sicilians fighting divinely for liberty behind barricadesmust have bitterly aggravated the feeling of every frenchman as he looked around him at home on a louisphilippism which had become the scorn of all the world ichabod is the glory departing from us under the sun is nothing baser by all accounts and evidences than the system of repression and corruption of shameless dishonesty and unbelief in anything but human baseness that we now live under the italians the very pope have become apostles of liberty and france iswhat is francewe know what france suddenly became in the end of february next and by a clear enough genealogy we can trace a considerable share in that event to the good simple pope with the new testament in his hand an outbreak or at least a radical change and even inversion of affairs hardly to be achieved without an outbreak everybody felt was inevitable in france but it had been universally expected that france would as usual take the initiative in that matter and had there been no reforming pope no insurrectionary sicily france had certainly not broken out then and so but only afterwards and otherwise the french explosion not anticipated by the cunningest men there on the spot scrutinizing it burst up unlimited complete defying computation or control  close following which as if by sympathetic subterranean electricities all europe exploded boundless uncontrollable and we had the year 1848 one of the most singular disastrous amazing and on the whole humiliating years the european world ever saw not since the irruption of the northern barbarians has there been the like everywhere immeasurable democracy rose monstrous loud blatant inarticulate as the voice of chaos everywhere the official holyofholies was scandalously laid bare to dogs and the profaneenter all the world see what kind of official holy it is kings everywhere and reigning persons stared in sudden horror the voice of the whole world bellowing in their ear begone ye imbecile hypocrites histrios not heroes off with you off and what was peculiar and notable in this year for the first time the kings all made haste to go as if exclaiming we are poor histrios we sure enoughdid you want heroes dont kill us we couldnt help it not one of them turned round and stood upon his kingship as upon a right he could afford to die for or to risk his skin upon by no manner of means that i say is the alarming peculiarity at present democracy on this new occasion finds all kings conscious that they are but playactors the miserable mortals enacting their high life below stairs with faith only that this universe may perhaps be all a phantasm and hypocrisisthe truculent constable of the destinies suddenly enters scandalous phantasms what do you here are solemnly constituted impostors the proper kings of men did you think the life of man was a grimacing dance of apes to be led always by the squeak of your paltry fiddle ye miserable this universe is not an upholstery puppetplay but a terrible gods fact and you i thinkhad not you better begone they fled precipitately some of them with what we may call an exquisite ignominyin terror of the treadmill or worse and everywhere the people or the populace take their own government upon themselves and open kinglessness what we call anarchyhow happy if it be anarchy plus a streetconstableis everywhere the order of the day such was the history from baltic to mediterranean in italy france prussia austria from end to end of europe in those march days of 1848 since the destruction of the old roman empire by inroad of the northern barbarians i have known nothing similar  and so then there remained no king in europe no king except the public haranguer haranguing on barrelhead in leading article or getting himself aggregated into a national parliament to harangue and for about four months all france and to a great degree all europe roughridden by every species of delirium except happily the murderous for most part was a weltering mob presided over by m de lamartine at the hoteldeville a most eloquent fairspoken literary gentleman whom thoughtless persons took for a prophet priest and heavensent evangelist and whom a wise yankee friend of mine discerned to be properly the first stumporator in the world standing too on the highest stumpfor the time a sorrowful spectacle to men of reflection during the time he lasted that poor m de lamartine with nothing in him but melodious wind and soft sawder which he and others took for something divine and not diabolic sad enough the eloquent latest impersonation of chaoscomeagain able to talk for itself and declare persuasively that it is cosmos however you have but to wait a little in such cases all balloons do and must give up their gas in the pressure of things and are collapsed in a sufficiently wretched manner before long  and so in city after city streetbarricades are piled and truculent more or less murderous insurrection begins populace after populace rises king after king capitulates or absconds and from end to end of europe democracy has blazed up explosive much higher more irresistible and less resisted than ever before testifying too sadly on what a bottomless volcano or universal powdermine of most inflammable mutinous chaotic elements separated from us by a thin earthrind society with all its arrangements and acquirements everywhere in the present epoch rests the kind of persons who excite or give signal to such revolutionsstudents young men of letters advocates editors hot inexperienced enthusiasts or fierce and justly bankrupt desperadoes acting everywhere on the discontent of the millions and blowing it into flamemight give rise to reflections as to the character of our epoch never till now did young men and almost children take such a command in human affairs a changed time since the word senior seigneur or elder was first devised to signify lord or superioras in all languages of men we find it to have been not an honorable document this either as to the spiritual condition of our epoch in times when men love wisdom the old man will ever be venerable and be venerated and reckoned noble in times that love something else than wisdom and indeed have little or no wisdom and see little or none to love the old man will cease to be venerated and looking more closely also you will find that in fact he has ceased to be venerable and has begun to be contemptible a foolish boy still a boy without the graces generosities and opulent strength of young boys in these days what of lordship or leadership is still to be done the youth must do it not the mature or aged man the mature man hardened into sceptical egoism knows no monition but that of his own frigid cautious avarices mean timidities and can lead nowhither towards an object that even seems noble but to return  this mad state of matters will of course before long allay itself as it has everywhere begun to do the ordinary necessities of mens daily existence cannot comport with it and these whatever else is cast aside will have their way some remountingvery temporary remountingof the old machine under new colors and altered forms will probably ensue soon in most countries the old histrionic kings will be admitted back under conditions under constitutions with national parliaments or the like fashionable adjuncts and everywhere the old daily life will try to begin again but there is now no hope that such arrangements can be permanent that they can be other than poor temporary makeshifts which if they try to fancy and make themselves permanent will be displaced by new explosions recurring more speedily than last time in such baleful oscillation afloat as amid raging bottomless eddies and conflicting seacurrents not steadfast as on fixed foundations must european society continue swaying now disastrously tumbling then painfully readjusting itself at ever shorter intervalstill once the new rockbasis does come to light and the weltering deluges of mutiny and of need to mutiny abate again  for universal democracy whatever we may think of it has declared itself as an inevitable fact of the days in which we live and he who has any chance to instruct or lead in his days must begin by admitting that new streetbarricades and new anarchies still more scandalous if still less sanguinary must return and again return till governing persons everywhere know and admit that democracy it may be said everywhere is herefor sixty years now ever since the grand or first french revolution that fact has been terribly announced to all the world in message after message some of them very terrible indeed and now at last all the world ought really to believe it that the world does believe it that even kings now as good as believe it and know or with just terror surmise that they are but temporary phantasm playactors and that democracy is the grand alarming imminent and indisputable reality this among the scandalous phases we witnessed in the last two years is a phasis full of hope a sign that we are advancing closer and closer to the very problem itself which it will behoove us to solve or die that all fighting and campaigning and coalitioning in regard to the existence of the problem is hopeless and superfluous henceforth the gods have appointed it so no pitt nor body of pitts or mortal creatures can appoint it otherwise democracy sure enough is here one knows not how long it will keep hidden underground even in russiaand here in england though we object to it resolutely in the form of streetbarricades and insurrectionary pikes and decidedly will not open doors to it on those terms the tramp of its million feet is on all streets and thoroughfares the sound of its bewildered thousandfold voice is in all writings and speakings in all thinkings and modes and activities of men the soul that does not now with hope or terror discern it is not the one we address on this occasion  what is democracy this huge inevitable product of the destinies which is everywhere the portion of our europe in these latter days there lies the question for us whence comes it this universal big black democracy whither tends it what is the meaning of it a meaning it must have or it would not be here if we can find the right meaning of it we may wisely submitting or wisely resisting and controlling still hope to live in the midst of it if we cannot find the right meaning if we find only the wrong or no meaning in it to live will not be possiblethe whole social wisdom of the present time is summoned in the name of the giver of wisdom to make clear to itself and lay deeply to heart with an eye to strenuous valiant practice and effort what the meaning of this universal revolt of the european populations which calls itself democracy and decides to continue permanent may be  certainly it is a drama full of action event fast following event in which curiosity finds endless scope and there are interests at stake enough to rivet the attention of all men simple and wise whereat the idle multitude lift up their voices gratulating celebrating skyhigh in rhyme and prose announcement more than plentiful that now the new era and longexpected year one of perfect human felicity has come glorious and immortal people sublime french citizens heroic barricades triumph of civil and religious libertyo heaven one of the inevitablest private miseries to an earnest man in such circumstances is this multitudinous efflux of oratory and psalmody from the universal foolish human throat drowning for the moment all reflection whatsoever except the sorrowful one that you are fallen in an evil heavyladen longeared age and must resignedly bear your part in the same the front wall of your wretched old crazy dwelling long denounced by you to no purpose having at last fairly folded itself over and fallen prostrate into the street the floors as may happen will still hang on by the mere beamends and coherency of old carpentry though in a sloping direction and depend there till certain poor rusty nails and wormeaten dovetailings give waybut is it cheering in such circumstances that the whole household burst forth into celebrating the new joys of light and ventilation liberty and picturesqueness of position and thank god that now they have got a house to their mind my dear household cease singing and psalmodying lay aside your fiddles take out your workimplements if you have any for i can say with confidence the laws of gravitation are still active and rusty nails wormeaten dovetailings and secret coherency of old carpentry are not the best basis for a householdin the lanes of irish cities i have heard say the wretched people are sometimes found living and perilously boiling their potatoes on such swingfloors and inclined planes hanging on by the joistends but i did not hear that they sang very much in celebration of such lodging no they slid gently about sat near the back wall and perilously boiled their potatoes in silence for most part  high shouts of exultation in every dialect by every vehicle of speech and writing rise from far and near over this last avatar of democracy in 1848 and yet to wise minds the first aspect it presents seems rather to be one of boundless misery and sorrow what can be more miserable than this universal hunting out of the high dignitaries solemn functionaries and potent grave and reverend signiors of the world this stormful risingup of the inarticulate dumb masses everywhere against those who pretended to be speaking for them and guiding them these guides then were mere blind men only pretending to see these rulers were not ruling at all they had merely got on the attributes and clothes of rulers and were surreptitiously drawing the wages while the work remained undone the kings were shamkings playacting as at drury laneand what were the people withal that took them for real  it is probably the hugest disclosure of falsity in human things that was ever at one time made these reverend dignitaries that sat amid their farshining symbols and longsounding longadmitted professions were mere impostors then not a true thing they were doing but a false thing the story they told men was a cunningly devised fable the gospels they preached to them were not an account of mans real position in this world but an incoherent fabrication of dead ghosts and unborn shadows of traditions cants indolences cowardicesa falsity of falsities which at last ceases to stick together wilfully and against their will these high units of mankind were cheats then and the low millions who believed in them were dupesa kind of inverse cheats too or they would not have believed in them so long a universal bankruptcy of imposture that may be the brief definition of it imposture everywhere declared once more to be contrary to nature nobody will change its word into an act any fartherfallen insolvent unable to keep its head up by these false pretences or make its pot boil any more for the present a more scandalous phenomenon wide as europe never afflicted the face of the sun bankruptcy everywhere foul ignominy and the abomination of desolation in all high places odious to look upon as the carnage of a battlefield on the morrow morninga massacre not of the innocents we cannot call it a massacre of the innocents but a universal tumbling of impostors and of impostures into the street  such a spectacle can we call it joyful there is a joy in it to the wise man too yes but a joy full of awe and as it were sadder than any sorrowlike the vision of immortality unattainable except through death and the grave and yet who would not in his heart of hearts feel piously thankful that imposture has fallen bankrupt by all means let it fall bankrupt in the name of god let it do so with whatever misery to itself and to all of us imposture be it known thenknown it must and shall beis hateful unendurable to god and man let it understand this everywhere and swiftly make ready for departure wherever it yet lingers and let it learn never to return if possible the eternal voices very audibly again are speaking to proclaim this message from side to side of the world not a very cheering message but a very indispensable one  alas it is sad enough that anarchy is here that we are not permitted to regret its being herefor who that had for this divine universe an eye which was human at all could wish that shams of any kind especially that shamkings should continue no at all costs it is to be prayed by all men that shams may cease good heavens to what depths have we got when this to many a man seems strange yet strange to many a man it does seem and to many a solid englishman wholesomely digesting his pudding among what are called the cultivated classes it seems strange exceedingly a mad ignorant notion quite heterodox and big with mere ruin he has been used to decent forms long since fallen empty of meaning to plausible modes solemnities grown ceremonialwhat you in your iconoclast humor call shams all his life long never heard that there was any harm in them that there was any getting on without them did not cotton spin itself beef grow and groceries and spiceries come in from the east and the west quite comfortably by the side of shams kings reigned what they were pleased to call reigning lawyers pleaded bishops preached and honorable members perorated and to crown the whole as if it were all real and no sham there did not scrip continue salable and the banker pay in bullion or paper with a metallic basis the greatest sham i have always thought is he that would destroy shams  even so to such depth have i the poor knowing person of this epoch gotalmost below the level of lowest humanity and down towards the state of apehood and oxhood for never till in quite recent generations was such a scandalous blasphemy quietly set forth among the sons of adam never before did the creature called man believe generally in his heart that lies were the rule in this earth that in deliberate longestablished lying could there be help or salvation for him could there be at length other than hindrance and destruction for him o heavyside my solid friend this is the sorrow of sorrows what on earth can become of us till this accursed enchantment the general summary and consecration of delusions be cast forth from the heart and life of one and all cast forth it will be it must or we are tending at all moments whitherward i do not like to name alas and the casting of it out to what heights and what depths will it lead us in the sad universe mostly of lies and shams and hollow phantasms grown very ghastly now in which as in a safe home we have lived this century or two to heights and depths of social and individual divorce from delusionsof reform in right sacred earnest of indispensable amendment and stern sorrowful abrogation and order to departsuch as cannot well be spoken at present as dare scarcely be thought at present which nevertheless are very inevitable and perhaps rather imminent several of them truly we have a heavy task of work before us and there is a pressing call that we should seriously begin upon it before it tumble into an inextricable mass in which there will be no working but only suffering and hopelessly perishing   or perhaps democracy which we announce as now come will itself manage it democracy once modelled into suffrages furnished with ballotboxes and such like will itself accomplish the salutary universal change from delusive to real and make a new blessed world of us by and byto the great mass of men i am aware the matter presents itself quite on this hopeful side democracy they consider to be a kind of government the old model formed long since and brought to perfection in england now two hundred years ago has proclaimed itself to all nations as the new healing for every woe set up a parliament the nations everywhere say when the old king is detected to be a shamking and hunted out or not set up a parliament let us have suffrages universal suffrages and all either at once or by due degrees will be right and a real millennium come such is their way of construing the matter  such alas is by no means my way of construing the matter if it were i should have had the happiness of remaining silent and been without call to speak here it is because the contrary of all this is deeply manifest to me and appears to be forgotten by multitudes of my contemporaries that i have had to undertake addressing a word to them the contrary of all thisand the farther i look into the roots of all this the more hateful ruinous and dismal does the state of mind all this could have originated in appear to me to examine this recipe of a parliament how fit it is for governing nations nay how fit it may now be in these new times for governing england itself where we are used to it so long this too is an alarming inquiry to which all thinking men and good citizens of their country who have an ear for the small still voices and eternal intimations across the temporary clamors and loud blaring proclamations are now solemnly invited invited by the rigorous fact itself which will one day and that perhaps soon demand practical decision or redecision of it from uswith enormous penalty if we decide it wrong i think we shall all have to consider this question one day better perhaps now than later when the leisure may be less if a parliament with suffrages and universal or any conceivable kind of suffrages is the method then certainly let us set about discovering the kind of suffrages and rest no moment till we have got them but it is possible a parliament may not be the method possible the inveterate notions of the english people may have settled it as the method and the everlasting laws of nature may have settled it as not the method not the whole method nor the method at all if taken as the whole if a parliament with never such suffrages is not the method settled by this latter authority then it will urgently behoove us to become aware of that fact and to quit such methodwe may depend upon it however unanimous we be every step taken in that direction will by the eternal law of things be a step from improvement not towards it  not towards it i say if so unanimity of votingthat will do nothing for us if so your ship cannot double cape horn by its excellent plans of voting the ship may vote this and that above decks and below in the most harmonious exquisitely constitutional manner the ship to get round cape horn will find a set of conditions already voted for and fixed with adamantine rigor by the ancient elemental powers who are entirely careless how you vote if you can by voting or without voting ascertain these conditions and valiantly conform to them you will get round the cape if you cannot the ruffian winds will blow you ever back again the inexorable icebergs dumb privycouncillors from chaos will nudge you with most chaotic admonition you will be flung half frozen on the patagonian cliffs or admonished into shivers by your iceberg councillors and sent sheer down to davy jones and will never get round cape horn at all unanimity on board shipyes indeed the ships crew may be very unanimous which doubtless for the time being will be very comfortable to the ships crew and to their phantasm captain if they have one but if the tack they unanimously steer upon is guiding them into the belly of the abyss it will not profit them muchships accordingly do not use the ballotbox at all and they reject the phantasm species of captains one wishes much some other entitiessince all entities lie under the same rigorous set of lawscould be brought to show as much wisdom and sense at least of selfpreservation the first command of nature phantasm captains with unanimous votings this is considered to be all the law and all the prophets at present  if a man could shake out of his mind the universal noise of political doctors in this generation and in the last generation or two and consider the matter face to face with his own sincere intelligence looking at it i venture to say he would find this a very extraordinary method of navigating whether in the straits of magellan or the undiscovered sea of time to prosper in this world to gain felicity victory and improvement either for a man or a nation there is but one thing requisite that the man or nation can discern what the true regulations of the universe are in regard to him and his pursuit and can faithfully and steadfastly follow these these will lead him to victory whoever it may be that sets him in the way of thesewere it russian autocrat chartist parliament grand lama force of public opinion archbishop of canterbury mcroudy the seraphic doctor with his lastevangel of political economysets him in the sure way to please the author of this universe and is his friend of friends and again whoever does the contrary is for a like reason his enemy of enemies this may be taken as fixed  and now by what method ascertain the monition of the gods in regard to our affairs how decipher with best fidelity the eternal regulation of the universe and read from amid such confused embroilments of human clamor and folly what the real divine message to us is a divine message or eternal regulation of the universe there verily is in regard to every conceivable procedure and affair of man faithfully following this said procedure or affair will prosper and have the whole universe to second it and carry it across the fluctuating contradictions towards a victorious goal not following this mistaking this disregarding this destruction and wreck are certain for every affair how find it all the world answers me count heads ask universal suffrage by the ballotboxes and that will tell universal suffrage ballotboxes count of heads welli perceive we have got into strange spiritual latitudes indeed within the last halfcentury or so either the universe or else the heads of men must have altered very much half a century ago and down from father adams time till then the universe wherever i could hear tell of it was wont to be of somewhat abstruse nature by no means carrying its secret written on its face legible to every passerby on the contrary obstinately hiding its secret from all foolish slavish wicked insincere persons and partially disclosing it to the wise and nobleminded alone whose number was not the majority in my time  or perhaps the chief end of man being now in these improved epochs to make money and spend it his interests in the universe have become amazingly simplified of late capable of being voted on with effect by almost anybody to buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest truly if that is the summary of his social duties and the final divine message he has to follow we may trust him extensively to vote upon that but if it is not and never was or can be if the universe will not carry on its divine bosom any commonwealth of mortals that have no higher aimbeing still a temple and hall of doom not a mere weavingshop and cattlepen if the unfathomable universe has decided to reject human beavers pretending to be men and will abolish pretty rapidly perhaps in hideous muddeluges their markets and them unless they think of itin that case it were better to think of it and the democracies and universal suffrages i can observe will require to modify themselves a good deal  historically speaking i believe there was no nation that could subsist upon democracy of ancient republics and demoi and populi we have heard much but it is now pretty well admitted to be nothing to our purposea universalsuffrage republic or a generalsuffrage one or any but a mostlimitedsuffrage one never came to light or dreamed of doing so in ancient times when the mass of the population were slaves and the voters intrinsically a kind of kings or men born to rule others when the voters were real aristocrats and manageable dependents of suchthen doubtless voting and confused jumbling of talk and intrigue might without immediate destruction or the need of a cavaignac to intervene with cannon and sweep the streets clear of it go on and beautiful developments of manhood might be possible beside it for a season beside it or even if you will by means of it and in virtue of it though that is by no means so certain as is often supposed alas no the reflective constitutional mind has misgivings as to the origin of old greek and roman nobleness and indeed knows not how this or any other human nobleness could well be originated or brought to pass by voting or without voting in this world except by the grace of god very mainlyand remembers with a sigh that of the seven sages themselves no fewer than three were bits of despotic kings gr turannoi tyrants so called such being greatly wanted there and that the other four were very far from red republicans if of any political faith whatever we may quit the ancient classical concern and leave it to collegeclubs and speculative debatingsocieties in these late days  of the various french republics that have been tried or that are still on trialof these also it is not needful to say any word but there is one modern instance of democracy nearly perfect the republic of the united states which has actually subsisted for threescore years or more with immense success as is affirmed to which many still appeal as to a sign of hope for all nations and a model republic is not america an instance in point why should not all nations subsist and flourish on democracy as america does  of america it would ill beseem any englishman and me perhaps as little as another to speak unkindly to speak unpatriotically if any of us even felt so sure enough america is a great and in many respects a blessed and hopeful phenomenon sure enough these hardy millions of anglosaxon men prove themselves worthy of their genealogy and with the axe and plough and hammer if not yet with any much finer kind of implements are triumphantly clearing out wide spaces seedfields for the sustenance and refuge of mankind arenas for the future history of the world doing in their day and generation a creditable and cheering feat under the sun but as to a model republic or a model anything the wise among themselves know too well that there is nothing to be said nay the title hitherto to be a commonwealth or nation at all among the gr ethne of the world is strictly considered still a thing they are but striving for and indeed have not yet done much towards attaining their constitution such as it may be was made here not there went over with them from the oldpuritan english workshop readymade deduct what they carried with them from england readymadetheir common english language and that same constitution or rather elixir of constitutions their inveterate and now as it were inborn reverence for the constables staff two quite immense attainments which england had to spend much blood and valiant sweat of brow and brain for centuries long in achievingand what new elements of polity or nationhood what noble new phasis of human arrangement or social device worthy of prometheus or of epimetheus yet comes to light in america cotton crops and indian corn and dollars come to light and half a world of untilled land where populations that respect the constable can live for the present without government this comes to light and the profound sorrow of all nobler hearts here uttering itself as silent patient unspeakable ennui there coming out as vague elegiac wailings that there is still next to nothing more anarchy plus a streetconstable that also is anarchic to me and other than quite lovely  i foresee too that long before the waste lands are full the very streetconstable on these poor terms will have become impossible without the waste lands as here in our europe i do not see how he could continue possible many weeks cease to brag to me of america and its model institutions and constitutions to men in their sleep there is nothing granted in this world nothing or as good as nothing to men that sit idly caucusing and ballotboxing on the graves of their heroic ancestors saying it is well it is well corn and bacon are granted not a very sublime boon on such conditions a boon moreover which on such conditions cannot lastno america too will have to strain its energies in quite other fashion than this to crack its sinews and all but break its heart as the rest of us have had to do in thousandfold wrestle with the pythons and muddemons before it can become a habitation for the gods americas battle is yet to fight and we sorrowful though nothing doubting will wish her strength for it new spiritual pythons plenty of them enormous megatherions as ugly as were ever born of mud loom huge and hideous out of the twilight future on america and she will have her own agony and her own victory but on other terms than she is yet quite aware of hitherto she but ploughs and hammers in a very successful manner hitherto in spite of her roastgoose with applesauce she is not much roastgoose with applesauce for the poorest workingman well surely that is something thanks to your respect for the streetconstable and to your continents of fertile waste landbut that even if it could continue is by no means enough that is not even an instalment towards what will be required of you my friend brag not yet of our american cousins their quantity of cotton dollars industry and resources i believe to be almost unspeakable but i can by no means worship the like of these what great human soul what great thought what great noble thing that one could worship or loyally admire has yet been produced there none the american cousins have yet done none of these things what they have done growls smelfungus tired of the subject they have doubled their population every twenty years they have begotten with a rapidity beyond recorded example eighteen millions of the greatest bores ever seen in this world beforethat hitherto is their feat in historyand so we leave them for the present and cannot predict the success of democracy on this side of the atlantic from their example  alas on this side of the atlantic and on that democracy we apprehend is forever impossible so much with certainty of loud astonished contradiction from all manner of men at present but with sure appeal to the law of nature and the everabiding fact may be suggested and asserted once more the universe itself is a monarchy and hierarchy large liberty of voting there all manner of choice utmost freewill but with conditions inexorable and immeasurable annexed to every exercise of the same a most free commonwealth of voters but with eternal justice to preside over it eternal justice enforced by almighty power this is the model of constitutions this nor in any nation where there has not yet in some supportable and withal some constantly increasing degree been confided to the noblest with his select series of nobler the divine everlasting duty of directing and controlling the ignoble has the kingdom of god which we all pray for come nor can his will even tend to be done on earth as it is in heaven till then my christian friends and indeed my shamchristian and antichristian and all manner of men are invited to reflect on this they will find it to be the truth of the case the noble in the high place the ignoble in the low that is in all times and in all countries the almighty makers law  to raise the shamnoblest and solemnly consecrate him by whatever method newdevised or slavishly adhered to from old wont this little as we may regard it is in all times and countries a practical blasphemy and nature will in nowise forget it alas there lies the origin the fatal necessity of modern democracy everywhere it is the noblest not the shamnoblest it is godalmightys noble not the courttailors noble nor the ableeditors noble that must in some approximate degree be raised to the supreme place he and not a counterfeitunder penalties penalties deep as death and at length terrible as hellonearth my constitutional friendwill the ballotbox raise the noblest to the chief place does any sane man deliberately believe such a thing that nevertheless is the indispensable result attain it how we may if that is attained all is attained if not that nothing he that cannot believe the ballotbox to be attaining it will be comparatively indifferent to the ballotbox excellent for keeping the ships crew at peace under their phantasm captain but unserviceable under such for getting round cape horn alas that there should be human beings requiring to have these things argued of at this late time of day  i say it is the everlasting privilege of the foolish to be governed by the wise to be guided in the right path by those who know it better than they this is the first right of man compared with which all other rights are as nothingmere superfluities corollaries which will follow of their own accord out of this if they be not contradictions to this and less than nothing to the wise it is not a privilege far other indeed doubtless as bringing preservation to their country it implies preservation of themselves withal but intrinsically it is the harshest duty a wise man if he be indeed wise has laid to his hand a duty which he would fain enough shirk which accordingly in these sad times of doubt and cowardly sloth he has long everywhere been endeavoring to reduce to its minimum and has in fact in most cases nearly escaped altogether it is an ungoverned world a world which we flatter ourselves will henceforth need no governing on the dust of our heroic ancestors we too sit ballotboxing saying to one another it is well it is well by inheritance of their noble struggles we have been permitted to sit slothful so long by noble toil not by shallow laughter and vain talk they made this english existence from a savage forest into an arable inhabitable field for us and we idly dreaming it would grow spontaneous crops foreverfind it now in a too questionable state peremptorily requiring real labor and agriculture again real agriculture is not pleasant much pleasanter to reap and winnow with ballotbox or otherwise than to plough  who would govern that can get along without governing he that is fittest for it is of all men the unwillingest unless constrained by multifarious devices we have been endeavoring to dispense with governing and by very superficial speculations of laissezfaire supplyanddemand c c to persuade ourselves that it is best so the real captain unless it be some captain of mechanical industry hired by mammon where is he in these days most likely in silence in sad isolation somewhere in remote obscurity trying if in an evil ungoverned time he cannot at least govern himself the real captain undiscoverable the phantasm captain everywhere very conspicuousit is thought phantasm captains aided by ballotboxes are the true method after all they are much the pleasantest for the time being and so no dux or duke of any sort in any province of our affairs now leads the dukes bailiff leads what little leading is required for getting in the rents and the duke merely rides in the statecoach it is everywhere so and now at last we see a world all rushing towards strange consummations because it is and has long been so   i do not suppose any reader of mine or many persons in england at all have much faith in fraternity equality and the revolutionary millenniums preached by the french prophets in this age but there are many movements here too which tend inevitably in the like direction and good men who would stand aghast at red republic and its adjuncts seem to me travelling at full speed towards that or a similar goal certainly the notion everywhere prevails among us too and preaches itself abroad in every dialect uncontradicted anywhere so far as i can hear that the grand panacea for social woes is what we call enfranchisement emancipation or translated into practical language the cutting asunder of human relations wherever they are found grievous as is like to be pretty universally the case at the rate we have been going for some generations past let us all be free of one another we shall then be happy free without bond or connection except that of cashpayment fair days wages for the fair days work bargained for by voluntary contract and law of supplyanddemand this is thought to be the true solution of all difficulties and injustices that have occurred between man and man  to rectify the relation that exists between two men is there no method then but that of ending it the old relation has become unsuitable obsolete perhaps unjust it imperatively requires to be amended and the remedy is abolish it let there henceforth be no relation at all from the sacrament of marriage downwards human beings used to be manifoldly related one to another and each to all and there was no relation among human beings just or unjust that had not its grievances and difficulties its necessities on both sides to bear and forbear but henceforth be it known we have changed all that by favor of heaven the voluntary principle has come up which will itself do the business for us and now let a new sacrament that of divorce which we call emancipation and spout of on our platforms be universally the order of the dayhave men considered whither all this is tending and what it certainly enough betokens cut every human relation which has anywhere grown uneasy sheer asunder reduce whatsoever was compulsory to voluntary whatsoever was permanent among us to the condition of nomadicin other words loosen by assiduous wedges in every joint the whole fabric of social existence stone from stone till at last all now being loose enough it can as we already see in most countries be overset by sudden outburst of revolutionary rage and lying as mere mountains of anarchic rubbish solicit you to sing fraternity c over it and to rejoice in the new remarkable era of human progress we have arrived at  certainly emancipation proceeds with rapid strides among us this good while and has got to such a length as might give rise to reflections in men of a serious turn westindian blacks are emancipated and it appears refuse to work irish whites have long been entirely emancipated and nobody asks them to work or on condition of finding them potatoes which of course is indispensable permits them to workamong speculative persons a question has sometimes risen in the progress of emancipation are we to look for a time when all the horses also are to be emancipated and brought to the supplyanddemand principle horses too have motives are acted on by hunger fear hope love of oats terror of platted leather nay they have vanity ambition emulation thankfulness vindictiveness some rude outline of all our human spiritualitiesa rude resemblance to us in mind and intelligence even as they have in bodily frame the horse poor dumb fourfooted fellow he too has his private feelings his affections gratitudes and deserves good usage no human master without crime shall treat him unjustly either or recklessly lay on

as were never seen before these things are not sport they are terribly true in this country at this hour  between our black west indies and our white ireland between these two extremes of lazy refusal to work and of famishing inability to find any work what a world have we made of it with our fierce mammonworships and our benevolent philanderings and idle godless nonsenses of one kind and another supplyanddemand leaveitalone voluntary principle time will mend ittill british industrial existence seems fast becoming one huge poisonswamp of reeking pestilence physical and moral a hideous living golgotha of souls and bodies buried alive such a curtius gulf communicating with the nether deeps as the sun never saw till now these scenes which the morning chronicle is bringing home to all minds of menthanks to it for a service such as newspapers have seldom doneought to excite unspeakable reflections in every mind thirty thousand outcast needlewomen working themselves swiftly to death three million paupers rotting in forced idleness helping said needlewomen to die these are but items in the sad ledger of despair  thirty thousand wretched women sunk in that putrefying well of abominations they have oozed in upon london from the universal stygian quagmire of british industrial life are accumulated in the well of the concern to that extent british charity is smitten to the heart at the laying bare of such a scene passionately undertakes by enormous subscription of money or by other enormous effort to redress that individual horror as i and all men hope it may but alas what next this general well and cesspool once baled clean out today will begin before night to fill itself anew the universal stygian quagmire is still there opulent in women ready to be ruined and in men ready towards the same sad cesspool will these waste currents of human ruin ooze and gravitate as heretofore except in draining the universal quagmire itself there is no remedy and for that what is the method cry many in an angry manner to whom for the present i answer only not emancipation it would seem my friends not the cutting loose of human ties something far the reverse of that  many things have been written about shirtmaking but here perhaps is the saddest thing of all not written anywhere till now that i know of shirts by the thirty thousand are made at twopencehalfpenny each and in the mean while no needlewoman distressed or other can be procured in london by any housewife to give for fair wages fair help in sewing ask any thrifty housemother high or low and she will answer in high houses and in low there is the same answer no real needlewoman distressed or other has been found attainable in any of the houses i frequent imaginary needlewomen who demand considerable wages and have a deepish appetite for beer and viands i hear of everywhere but their sewing proves too often a distracted puckering and botching not sewing only the fallacious hope of it a fond imagination of the mind good sempstresses are to be hired in every village and in london with its famishing thirty thousand not at all or hardlyis not nogovernment beautiful in human business to such length has the leavealone principle carried it by way of organizing labor in this affair of shirtmaking let us hope the leavealone principle has now got its apotheosis and taken wing towards higher regions than ours to deal henceforth with a class of affairs more appropriate for it  reader did you ever hear of constituted anarchy anarchy the choking sweltering deadly and killing rule of norule the consecration of cupidity and braying folly and dim stupidity and baseness in most of the affairs of men slopshirts attainable three halfpence cheaper by the ruin of living bodies and immortal souls solemn bishops and high dignitaries our divine pillars of fire by night debating meanwhile with their largest wigs and gravest look upon something they call prevenient grace alas our noble men of genius heavens real messengers to us they also rendered nearly futile by the wasteful timepreappointed they everywhere and assiduously trained by all their pedagogues and monitors to rise in parliament to compose orations write books or in short speak words for the approval of reviewers instead of doing real kingly work to be approved of by the gods our government a highly responsible one responsible to no god that i can hear of but to the twentyseven million gods of the shilling gallery a government tumbling and drifting on the whirlpools and muddeluges floating atop in a conspicuous manner nowhitherlike the carcass of a drowned ass authentic chaos come up into this sunny cosmos again and all men singing gloria in excelsis to it in spirituals and temporals in field and workshop from manchester to dorsetshire from lambeth palace to the lanes of whitechapel wherever men meet and toil and traffic togetheranarchy anarchy and only the streetconstable though with everincreasing difficulty still maintaining himself in the middle of it that so for one thing this blessed exchange of slopshirts for the souls of women may transact itself in a peaceable manneri for my part do profess myself in eternal opposition to this and discern well that universal ruin has us in the wind unless we can get out of this my friend crabbe in a late number of his intermittent radiator pertinently enough exclaims  when shall we have done with all this of british liberty voluntary principle dangers of centralization and the like it is really getting too bad for british liberty it seems the people cannot be taught to read british liberty shuddering to interfere with the rights of capital takes six or eight millions of money annually to feed the idle laborer whom it dare not employ for british liberty we live over poisonous cesspools gullydrains and detestable abominations and omnipotent london cannot sweep the dirt out of itself british liberty produceswhat floods of hansard debates every year and apparently little else at present if these are the results of british liberty i for one move we should lay it on the shelf a little and look out for something other and farther we have achieved british liberty hundreds of years ago and are fast growing on the strength of it one of the most absurd populations the sun among his great museum of absurdities looks down upon at present   curious enough the model of the world just now is england and her constitution all nations striving towards it poor france swimming these last sixty years in seas of horrid dissolution and confusion resolute to attain this blessedness of free voting or to die in chase of it prussia too solid germany itself has all broken out into crackling of musketry loud pamphleteering and frankfort parliamenting and palavering germany too will scale the sacred mountains how steep soever and by talisman of ballotbox inhabit a political elysium henceforth all the nations have that one hope very notable and rather sad to the humane onlooker for it is sadly conjectured all the nations labor somewhat under a mistake as to england and the causes of her freedom and her prosperous cottonspinning and have much misread the nature of her parliament and the effect of ballotboxes and universal suffrages there  what if it were because the english parliament was from the first and is only just now ceasing to be a council of actual rulers real governing persons called peers mitred abbots lords knights of the shire or howsoever called actually ruling each his section of the countryand possessing it must be said in the lump or when assembled as a council uncommon patience devoutness probity discretion and good fortunethat the said parliament ever came to be good for much in that case it will not be easy to imitate the english parliament and the ballotbox and suffrage will be the mere bow of robin hood which it is given to very few to bend or shoot with to any perfection and if the peers become mere big capitalists railway directors gigantic hucksters kings of scrip without lordly quality or other virtue except cash and the mitred abbots change to mere ableeditors masters of parliamentary eloquence doctors of political economy and such like and all have to be elected by a universalsuffrage ballotboxi do not see how the english parliament itself will long continue seaworthy nay i find england in her own big dumb heart wherever you come upon her in a silent meditative hour begins to have dreadful misgivings about it  the model of the world then is at once unattainable by the world and not much worth attaining england as i read the omens is now called a second time to show the nations how to live for by her parliament as chief governing entity i fear she is not long for this world poor england must herself again in these new strange times the old methods being quite worn out learn how to live that now is the terrible problem for england as for all the nations and she alone of all not yet sunk into open anarchy but left with time for repentance and amendment she wealthiest of all in material resource in spiritual energy in ancient loyalty to law and in the qualities that yield such loyaltyshe perhaps alone of all may be able with huge travail and the strain of all her faculties to accomplish some solution she will have to try it she has now to try it she must accomplish it or perish from her place in the world  england as i persuade myself still contains in it many kings possesses as old rome did many men not needing election to command but eternally elected for it by the maker himself englands one hope is in these just now they are among the silent i believe mostly far away from platforms and public palaverings not speaking forth the image of their nobleness in transitory words but imprinting it each on his own little section of the world in silent facts in modest valiant actions that will endure forevermore they must sit silent no longer they are summoned to assert themselves to act forth and articulately vindicate in the teeth of howling multitudes of a world too justly maddened into all manner of delirious clamors what of wisdom they derive from god england and the eternal voices summon them poor england never so needed them as now up be doing everywhere the hour of crisis has verily come in all sections of english life the godmade king is needed is pressingly demanded in most in some cannot longer without peril as of conflagration be dispensed with he wheresoever he finds himself can say here too am i wanted here is the kingdom i have to subjugate and introduce gods laws intogods laws instead of mammons and mcroudys and the old anarchs here is my work here or nowhereare there many such who will answer to the call in england it turns on that whether england rapidly crumbling in these very years and months shall go down to the abyss as her neighbors have all done or survive to new grander destinies without solution of continuity probably the chief question of the world at present  the true commander and king he who knows for himself the divine appointments of this universe the eternal laws ordained by god the maker in conforming to which lies victory and felicity in departing from which lies and forever must lie sorrow and defeat for each and all of the posterity of adam in every time and every place he who has sworn fealty to these and dare alone against the world assert these and dare not with the whole world at his back deflect from thesehe i know too well is a rare man difficult to discover not quite discoverable i apprehend by manoeuvring of ballotboxes and riddling of the popular clamor according to the most approved methods he is not sold at any shop i know ofthough sometimes as at the sign of the ballotbox he is advertised for sale difficult indeed to discover and not very much assisted or encouraged in late times to discover himselfwhich i think might be a kind of help encouraged rather and commanded in all ways if he be wise to hide himself and give place to the windy counterfeit of himself such as the universal suffrages can recognize such as loves the most sweet voices of the universal suffrageso peter what becomes of such a people what can become  did you never hear with the minds ear as well that fateful hebrew prophecy i think the fatefulest of all which sounds daily through the streets ou clo ou cloa certain people once upon a time clamorously voted by overwhelming majority not he barabbas not he him and what he is and what he deserves we know well enough a reviler of the chief priests and sacred chancery wigs a seditious heretic physicalforce chartist and enemy of his country and mankind to the gallows and the cross with him barabbas is our man barabbas we are for barabbas they got barabbashave you well considered what a fund of purblind obduracy of opaque flunkyism grown truculent and transcendent what an eye for the phylacteries and want of eye for the eternal noblenesses sordid loyalty to the prosperous semblances and hightreason against the supreme fact such a vote betokens in these natures for it was the consummation of a long series of such they and their fathers had long kept voting so a singular people who could both produce such divine men and then could so stone and crucify them a people terrible from the beginningwell they got barabbas and they got of course such guidance as barabbas and the like of him could give them and of course they stumbled ever downwards and devilwards in their truculent stiffnecked way andand at this hour after eighteen centuries of sad fortune they prophetically sing ou clo in all the cities of the world might the world at this late hour but take note of them and understand their song a little  yes there are some things the universal suffrage can decideand about these it will be exceedingly useful to consult the universal suffrage but in regard to most things of importance and in regard to the choice of men especially there is astonishing as it may seem next to no capability on the part of universal suffragei request all candid persons who have never so little originality of mind and every man has a little to consider this if true it involves such a change in our now fashionable modes of procedure as fills me with astonishment and alarm if popular suffrage is not the way of ascertaining what the laws of the universe are and who it is that will best guide us in the way of thesethen woe is to us if we do not take another method delolme on the british constitution will not save us deaf will the parcae be to votes of the house to leading articles constitutional philosophies the other methodalas it involves a stopping short or vital change of direction in the glorious career which all europe with shouts heavenhigh is now galloping along and that happen when it may will to many of us be probably a rather surprising business  one thing i do know and can again assert with great confidence supported by the whole universe and by some two hundred generations of men who have left us some record of themselves there that the few wise will have by one method or another to take command of the innumerable foolish that they must be got to take itand that in fact since wisdom which means also valor and heroic nobleness is alone strong in this world and one wise man is stronger than all men unwise they can be got that they must take it and having taken must keep it and do their gods message in it and defend the same at their lifes peril against all men and devils this i do clearly believe to be the backbone of all future society as it has been of all past and that without it there is no society possible in the world and what a business this will be before it end in some degree of victory again and whether the time for shouts of triumph and tremendous cheers upon it is yet come or not yet by a great way i perceive too well a business to make us all very serious indeed a business not to be accomplished but by noble manhood and devout alldaring allenduring loyalty to heaven such as fatally sleeps at presentsuch as is not dead at present either unless the gods have doomed this world of theirs to die a business which long centuries of faithful travail and heroic agony on the part of all the noble that are born to us will not end and which to us of this tremendous cheering century it were blessedness very great to see successfully begun begun tried by all manner of methods if there is one wise statesman or man left among us it verily must bebegun successfully or unsuccessfully we do hope to see it   in all european countries especially in england one class of captains and commanders of men recognizable as the beginning of a new real and not imaginary aristocracy has already in some measure developed itself the captains of industryhappily the class who above all or at least first of all are wanted in this time in the doing of material work we have already men among us that can command bodies of men and surely on the other hand there is no lack of men needing to be commanded the sad class of brothermen whom we had to describe as hodges emancipated horses reduced to roving faminethis too has in all countries developed itself and in fatal geometrical progression is ever more developing itself with a rapidity which alarms every one on this ground if not on all manner of other grounds it may be truly said the organization of labor not organizable by the mad methods tried hitherto is the universal vital problem of the world  to bring these hordes of outcast captainless soldiers under due captaincy this is really the question of questions on the answer to which turns among other things the fate of all governments constitutional and otherthe possibility of their continuing to exist or the impossibility captainless uncommanded these wretched outcast soldiers since they cannot starve must needs become banditti streetbarricadersdestroyers of every government that cannot put them under captains and send them upon enterprises and in short render life human to them our english plan of poor laws which we once piqued ourselves upon as sovereign is evidently fast breaking down ireland now admitted into the idle workhouse is rapidly bursting it in pieces that never was a human destiny for any honest son of adam nowhere but in england could it have lasted at all and now with ireland sharer in it and the fulness of time come it is as good as ended alas yes here in connemara your crazy ship of the state otherwise dreadfully rotten in many of its timbers i believe has sprung a leak spite of all hands at the pump the water is rising the ship i perceive will founder if you cannot stop this leak  to bring these captainless under due captaincy the anxious thoughts of all men that do think are turned upon that question and their efforts though as yet blindly and to no purpose under the multifarious impediments and obscurations all point thitherward isolated men and their vague efforts cannot do it government everywhere is called uponin england as loudly as elsewhereto give the initiative a new strange task of these new epochs which no government never so constitutional can escape from undertaking for it is vitally necessary to the existence of society itself it must be undertaken and succeeded in too or worse will followand as we already see in irish connaught and some other places will follow soon to whatever thing still calls itself by the name of government were it never so constitutional and impeded by official impossibilities all men will naturally look for help and direction what to do in this extremity if help or direction is not given if the thing called government merely drift and tumble to and fro nowhither on the popular vortexes like some carcass of a drowned ass constitutionally put at the top of affairs popular indignation will infallibly accumulate upon it one day the popular lightning descending forked and horrible from the black air will annihilate said supreme carcass and smite it home to its native ooze againyour lordship this is too true though irreverently spoken indeed one knows not how to speak of it and to me it is infinitely sad and miserable spoken or notunless perhaps the voluntary principle will still help us through perhaps this irish leak in such a rotten distressed condition of the ship with all the crew so anxious about it will be kind enough to stop of itself  dismiss that hope your lordship let all real and imaginary governors of england at the pass we have arrived at dismiss forever that fallacious fatal solace to their donothingism of itself too clearly the leak will never stop by human skill and energy it must be stopped or there is nothing but the seabottom for us all a chief governor of england really ought to recognize his situation to discern that doing nothing and merely drifting to and fro in however constitutional a manner he is a squanderer of precious moments moments that perhaps are priceless a truly alarming chief governor surely to a chief governor of england worthy of that high namesurely to him as to every living man in every conceivable situation short of the kingdom of the deadthere is something possible some plan of action other than that of standing mildly with crossed arms till he and wesink complex as his situation is he of all governors now extant among these distracted nations has as i compute by far the greatest possibilities the captains actual or potential are there and the million captainless and such resources for bringing them together as no other has to these outcast soldiers of his unregimented roving banditti for the present or unworking workhouse prisoners who are almost uglier than banditti to these floods of irish beggars ablebodied paupers and nomadic lackalls now stagnating or roaming everywhere drowning the face of the world too truly into an untenantable swamp and stygian quagmire has the chief governor of this country no word whatever to say nothing but rate in aid time will mend it necessary business of the session and after me the deluge a chief governor that can front his irish difficulty and steadily contemplate the horoscope of irish and british pauperism and whitherward it is leading him and us in this humor must be awhat shall we call such a chief governor alas in spite of old use and wontlittle other than a tolerated solecism growing daily more intolerable he decidedly ought to have some word to say on this matterto be incessantly occupied in getting something which he could practically sayperhaps to the following or a much finer effect   speech of the british primeminister to the floods of irish and other beggars the ablebodied lackalls nomadic or stationary and the general assembly outdoor and indoor of the pauper populations of these realms  vagrant lackalls foolish most of you criminal many of you miserable all the sight of you fills me with astonishment and despair what to do with you i know not long have i been meditating and it is hard to tell here are some three millions of you as i count so many of you fallen sheer over into the abysses of open beggary and fearful to think every new unit that falls is loading so much more the chain that drags the others over on the edge of the precipice hang uncounted millions increasing i am told at the rate of 1200 a day they hang there on the giddy edge poor souls cramping themselves down holding on with all their strength but falling falling one after another and the chain is getting heavy so that ever more fall and who at last will stand what to do with you the question what to do with you especially since the potato died is like to break my heart  one thing after much meditating i have at last discovered and now know for some time back that you cannot be left to roam abroad in this unguided manner stumbling over the precipices and loading ever heavier the fatal chain upon those who might be able to stand that this of locking you up in temporary idle workhouses when you stumble and subsisting you on indian meal till you can sally forth again on fresh roamings and fresh stumblings and ultimate descent to the devilthat this is not the plan and that it never was or could out of england have been supposed to be much as i have prided myself upon it  vagrant lackalls i at last perceive all this that has been sung and spoken for a long while about enfranchisement emancipation freedom suffrage civil and religious liberty over the world is little other than sad temporary jargon brought upon us by a stern necessitybut now ordered by a sterner to take itself away again a little sad temporary jargon i say made up of sense and nonsensesense in small quantities and nonsense in very largeand if taken for the whole or permanent truth of human things it is no better than fatal infinite nonsense eternally untrue all men i think will soon have to quit this to consider this as a thing pretty well achieved and to look out towards another thing much more needing achievement at the time that now is  all men will have to quit it i believe but to you my indigent friends the time for quitting it has palpably arrived to talk of glorious selfgovernment of suffrages and hustings and the fight of freedom and such like is a vain thing in your case by all human definitions and conceptions of the said fight of freedom you for your part have lost it and can fight no more glorious selfgovernment is a glory not for you not for hodges emancipated horses nor you no i say no you for your part have tried it and failed left to walk your own road the willowisps beguiled you your short sight could not descry the pitfalls the deadly tumult and press has whirled you hither and thither regardless of your struggles and your shrieks and here at last you lie fallen flat into the ditch drowning there and dying unless the others that are still standing please to pick you up the others that still stand have their own difficulties i can tell youbut you by imperfect energy and redundant appetite by doing too little work and drinking too much beer you i bid you observe have proved that you cannot do it you lie there plainly in the ditch and i am to pick you up again on these mad terms help you ever again as with our best heartsblood to do what once for all the gods have made impossible to load the fatal chain with your perpetual staggerings and sprawlings and ever again load it till we all lie sprawling my indigent incompetent friends i will not know that whoever may be sons of freedom you for your part are not and cannot be such not free you i think whoever may be free you palpably are fallen captivecaitiff as they once named ityou do silently but eloquently demand in the name of mercy itself that some genuine command be taken of you  yes my indigent incompetent friends some genuine practical command suchif i rightly interpret those mad chartisms repeal agitations red republics and other delirious inarticulate howlings and bellowings which all the populations of the world now utter evidently cries of pain on their and your partis the demand which you captives make of all men that are not captive but are still free free menalas had you ever any notion who the free men were who the notfree the incapable of freedom the free men if you could have understood it they are the wise men the patient selfdenying valiant the nobles of the world who can discern the law of this universe what it is and piously obey it these in late sad times having cast you loose you are fallen captive to greedy sons of profitandloss to bad and ever to worse and at length to beer and the devil algiers brazil or dahomey hold nothing in them so authentically slave as you are my indigent incompetent friends  good heavens and i have to raise some eight or nine millions annually six for england itself and to wreck the morals of my working population beyond all moneys worth to keep the life from going out of you a small service to you as i many times bitterly repeat alas yes before high heaven i must declare it such i think the old spartans who would have killed you instead had shown more humanity more of manhood than i thus do more humanity i say more of manhood and of sense for what the dignity of man demands imperatively of you and of me and of us all we call it charity beneficence and other fine names this brutish workhouse scheme of ours and it is but sluggish heartlessness and insincerity and cowardly lowness of soul not humanity or manhood i think perhaps apehood ratherpaltry imitancy from the teeth outward of what our heart never felt nor our understanding ever saw dim indolent adherence to extraneous and extinct traditions traditions now really about extinct not living now to almost any of us and still haunting with their spectralities and gibbering ghosts in a truly baleful manner almost all of us making this our struggling twelfth hour of the night inexpressibly hideous  but as for you my indigent incompetent friends i have to repeat with sorrow but with perfect clearness what is plainly undeniable and is even clamorous to get itself admitted that you are of the nature of slavesor if you prefer the word of nomadic and now even vagrant and vagabond servants that can find no master on those terms which seems to me a much uglier word emancipation you have been emancipated with a vengeance foolish souls i say the whole world cannot emancipate you fealty to ignorant unruliness to gluttonous sluggish improvidence to the beerpot and the devil who is there that can emancipate a man in that predicament not a whole reform bill a whole french revolution executed for his behoof alone nothing but god the maker can emancipate him by making him anew  to forward which glorious consummation will it not be well o indigent friends that you fallen flat there shall henceforth learn to take advice of others as to the methods of standing plainly i let you know and all the world and the worlds know that i for my part mean it so not as glorious unfortunate sons of freedom but as recognized captives as unfortunate fallen brothers requiring that i should command you and if need were control and compel you can there henceforth be a relation between us ask me not for indian meal you shall be compelled to earn it first know that on other terms i will not give you any before heaven and earth and god the maker of us all i declare it is a scandal to see such a life kept in you by the sweat and heartsblood of your brothers and that if we cannot mend it death were preferable go to we must get out of thisunutterable coil of nonsenses constitutional philanthropical c in which surely without mutual hatred if with less of love than is supposed we are all strangling one another your want of wants i say is that you be commanded in this world not being able to command yourselves know therefore that it shall be so with you nomadism i give you notice has ended needful permanency soldierlike obedience and the opportunity and the necessity of hard steady labor for your living have begun know that the idle workhouse is shut against you henceforth you cannot enter there at will nor leave at will you shall enter a quite other refuge under conditions strict as soldiering and not leave till i have done with you he that prefers the glorious or perhaps even the rebellious inglorious career of freedom let him prove that he can travel there and be the master of himself and right good speed to him he who has proved that he cannot travel there or be the master of himselflet him in the name of all the gods

the devils of the pit which are walking too openly among us  work for you work surely is not quite undiscoverable in an earth so wide as ours if we will take the right methods for it indigent friends we will adopt this new relation which is old as the world this will lead us towards such rigorous conditions not to be violated on either side lie in this relation conditions planted there by god

those laws of the shoptill are indisputable to me and practically useful in certain departments of the universe as the multiplicationtable itself once i even tried to sail through the immensities with them and to front the big coming eternities with them but i found it would not do as the supreme rule of statesmanship or government of mensince this universe is not wholly a shopno you rejoice in my improved tariffs freetrade movements and the like on every hand for which be thankful and even sing litanies if you choose but here at last in the idleworkhouse movementunexampled yet on earth or in the waters under the earthi am fairly brought to a stand and have had to make reflections of the most alarming and indeed awful and as it were religious nature professors of the dismal science i perceive that the length of your tether is now pretty well run and that i must request you to talk a little lower in future by the side of the shoptillsee your small law of god is hung up along with the multiplicationtable itself but beyond and above the shoptill allow me to say you shall as good as hold your peace respectable professors i perceive it is not now the gigantic hucksters but it is the immortal gods yes they in their terror and their beauty in their wrath and their beneficence that are coming into play in the affairs of this world soft you a little do not you interrupt me but

will be too late  you perceive my friends we have actually got into the new era there has been such prophesying of here we all are arrived at lastand it is by no means the land flowing with milk and honey we were led to expect very much the reverse a terrible new country this no neighbors in it yet that i can see but irrational flabby monsters philanthropic and other of the giant species hyenas laughing hyenas predatory wolves probably devils blue or perhaps blueandyellow devils as st guthlac found in croyland long ago a huge untrodden haggard country the chaotic battlefield of frost and fire a country of savage glaciers granite mountains of foul jungles unhewed forests quaking bogswhich we shall have our own ados to make arable and habitable i think we must stick by it howeverof all enterprises the impossiblest is that of getting out of it and shifting into another to work then one and all hands to work     no ii model prisons march 1 1850  the deranged condition of our affairs is a universal topic among men at present and the heavy miseries pressing in their rudest shape on the great dumb inarticulate class and from this by a sure law spreading upwards in a less palpable but not less certain and perhaps still more fatal shape on all classes to the very highest are admitted everywhere to be great increasing and now almost unendurable how to diminish themthis is every mans question for in fact they do imperatively need diminution and unless they can be diminished there are many other things that cannot very long continue to exist beside them a serious question indeed how to diminish them  among the articulate classes as they may be called there are two ways of proceeding in regard to this one large body of the intelligent and influential busied mainly in personal affairs accepts the social iniquities or whatever you may call them and the miseries consequent thereupon accepts them admits them to be extremely miserable pronounces them entirely inevitable incurable except by heaven and eats its pudding with as little thought of them as possible not a very noble class of citizens these not a very hopeful or salutary method of dealing with social iniquities this of theirs however it may answer in respect to themselves and their personal affairs but now there is the select small minority in whom some sentiment of public spirit and human pity still survives among whom or not anywhere the good cause may expect to find soldiers and servants their method of proceeding in these times is also very strange they embark in the philanthropic movement they calculate that the miseries of the world can be cured by bringing the philanthropic movement to bear on them to universal public misery and universal neglect of the clearest public duties let private charity superadd itself there will thus be some balance restored and maintained again thusor by what conceivable method on these terms they for their part embark in the sacred cause resolute to cure a worlds woes by rosewater desperately bent on trying to the uttermost that mild method it seems not to have struck these good men that no world or thing here below ever fell into misery without having first fallen into folly into sin against the supreme ruler of it by adopting as a law of conduct what was not a law but the reverse of one and that till its folly till its sin be cast out of it there is not the smallest hope of its misery goingthat not for all the charity and rosewater in the world will its misery try to go till then  this is a sad error all the sadder as it is the error chiefly of the more humane and nobleminded of our generation among whom as we said or elsewhere not at all the cause of real reform must expect its servants at present and for a long while past whatsoever young soul awoke in england with some disposition towards generosity and social heroism or at lowest with some intimation of the beauty of such a dispositionhe in whom the poor world might have looked for a reformer and valiant mender of its foul ways was almost sure to become a philanthropist reforming merely by this rosewater method to admit that the worlds ways are foul and not the ways of god the maker but of satan the destroyer many of them and that they must be mended or we all die that if huge misery prevails huge cowardice falsity disloyalty universal injustice high and low have still longer prevailed and must straightway try to cease prevailing this is what no visible reformer has yet thought of doing all socalled reforms hitherto are grounded either on openly admitted egoism cheap bread to the cottonspinner voting to those that have no vote and the like which does not point towards very celestial developments of the reform movement or else upon this of remedying social injustices by indiscriminate contributions of philanthropy a method surely still more unpromising such contributions being indiscriminate are but a new injustice these will never lead to reform or abolition of injustice whatever else they lead to  not by that method shall we get round cape horn by never such unanimity of voting under the most approved phantasm captains it is miserable to see having as it were quite lost our way round cape horn and being sorely admonished by the iceberg and other dumb councillors the pilotsinstead of taking to their sextants and asking with a seriousness unknown for a long while what the laws of wind and water and of earth and of heaven aredecide that now in these new circumstances they will to the worthy and unworthy serve out a double allowance of grog in this way they hope to do itby steering on the old wrong tack and serving out more and more copiously what little aqua vitae may be still on board philanthropy emancipation and pity for human calamity is very beautiful but the deep oblivion of the law of right and wrong this indiscriminate mashing up of right and wrong into a patent treacle of the philanthropic movement is by no means beautiful this on the contrary is altogether ugly and alarming  truly if there be not something inarticulate among us not yet uttered but pressing towards utterance which is much wiser than anything we have lately articulated or brought into word or action our outlooks are rather lamentable the great majority of the powerful and activeminded sunk in egoistic scepticisms busied in chase of lucre pleasure and mere vulgar objects looking with indifference on the worlds woes and passing carelessly by on the other side and the select minority of whom better might have been expected bending all their strength to cure them by methods which can only make bad worse and in the end render cure hopeless a blind loquacious pruriency of indiscriminate philanthropism substituting itself with much selflaudation for the silent divinely awful sense of right and wrongtestifying too clearly that here is no longer a divine sense of right and wrong that in the smoke of this universal and alas inevitable and indispensable revolutionary fire and burning up of wornout rags of which the world is full our lifeatmosphere has for the time become one vile london fog and the eternal loadstars are gone out for us gone outyet very visible if you can get above the fog still there in their place and quite the same as they always were to whoever does still know of loadstars the proceedings which expand themselves daily of these sublime philanthropic associations and universal sluggardandscoundrel protectionsocieties are a perpetual affliction with their emancipations and abolition principles and reigns of brotherhood and new methods of love they have done great things in the white and in the black world during late years and are preparing for greater  in the interest of human reform if there is ever to be any reform and return to prosperity or to the possibility of prospering it is urgent that the nonsense of all this and it is mostly nonsense but not quite should be sent about its business straightway and forbidden to deceive the wellmeaning souls among us any more reform if we will understand that divine word cannot begin till then one day i do know this as is the doom of all nonsense will be drummed out of the world with due placard stuck on its back and the populace flinging dead cats at it but whether soon or not is by no means so certain i rather guess not at present not quite soon fraternity in other countries has gone on till it found itself unexpectedly manipulating guillotines by its chosen robespierres and become a fraternity like cains much to its amazement for in fact it is not all nonsense there is an infinitesimal fraction of sense in it withal which is so difficult to disengagewhich must be disengaged and laid hold of before fraternity can vanish  but to our subjectthe model prison and the strange theory of life now in action there that for the present is my share in the wide adventure of philanthropism the worlds share and how and when it is to be liquidated and ended rests with the supreme destinies  several months ago some friends took me with them to see one of the london prisons a prison of the exemplary or model kind an immense circuit of buildings cut out girt with a high ringwall from the lanes and streets of the quarter which is a dim and crowded one gateway as to a fortified place then a spacious court like the square of a city broad staircases passages to interior courts fronts of stately architecture all round it lodges some thousand or twelve hundred prisoners besides the officers of the establishment surely one of the most perfect buildings within the compass of london we looked at the apartments sleepingcells diningrooms workingrooms general courts or special and private excellent all the neplusultra of human care and ingenuity in my life i never saw so clean a building probably no duke in england lives in a mansion of such perfect and thorough cleanness  the bread the cocoa soup meat all the various sorts of food in their respective cookingplaces we tasted found them of excellence superlative the prisoners sat at work light work picking oakum and the like in airy apartments with glass roofs of agreeable temperature and perfect ventilation silent or at least conversing only by secret signs others were out taking their hour of promenade in clean flagged courts methodic composure cleanliness peace substantial wholesome comfort reigned everywhere supreme the women in other apartments some notable murderesses among them all in the like state of methodic composure and substantial wholesome comfort sat sewing in long ranges of washhouses dryinghouses and whatever pertains to the gettingup of clean linen were certain others with all conceivable mechanical furtherances not too arduously working the notable murderesses were though with great precautions of privacy pointed out to us and we were requested not to look openly at them or seem to notice them at all as it was found to cherish their vanity when visitors looked at them schools too were there intelligent teachers of both sexes studiously instructing the still ignorant of these thieves  from an inner upper room or gallery we looked down into a range of private courts where certain chartist notabilities were undergoing their term chartist notability first struck me very much i had seen him about a year before by involuntary accident and much to my disgust magnetizing a silly young person and had noted well the unlovely voracious look of him his thick oily skin his heavy dullburning eyes his greedy mouth the dusky potent insatiable animalism that looked out of every feature of him a fellow adequate to animalmagnetize most things i did supposeand here was the post i now found him arrived at next neighbor to him was notability second a philosophic or literary chartist walking rapidly to and fro in his private court a clean highwalled place the world and its cares quite excluded for some months to come master of his own time and spiritual resources to as i supposed a really enviable extent what literary man to an equal extent i fancied i for my own part so left with paper and ink and all taxes and botherations shut out from me could have written such a book as no reader will here ever get of me never o reader never here in a mere house with taxes and botherations here alas one has to snatch ones poor book bit by bit as from a conflagration and to think and live comparatively as if the house were not ones own but mainly the worlds and the devils notability second might have filled one with envy  the captain of the place a gentleman of ancient military or royalnavy habits was one of the most perfect governors professionally and by nature zealous for cleanliness punctuality good order of every kind a humane heart and yet a strong one soft of speech and manner yet with an inflexible rigor of command so far as his limits went iron hand in a velvet glove as napoleon defined it a man of real worth challenging at once love and respect the light of those mild bright eyes seemed to permeate the place as with an allpervading vigilance and kindly yet victorious illumination in the soft definite voice it was as if nature herself were promulgating her orders gentlest mildest orders which however in the end there would be no disobeying which in the end there would be no living without fulfilment of a true aristos and commander of men a man worthy to have commanded and guided forward in good ways twelve hundred of the best commonpeople in london or the world he was here for many years past giving all his care and faculty to command and guide forward in such ways as there were twelve hundred of the worst i looked with considerable admiration on this gentleman and with considerable astonishment the reverse of admiration on the work he had here been set upon  this excellent captain was too old a commander to complain of anything indeed he struggled visibly the other way to find in his own mind that all here was best but i could sufficiently discern that in his natural instincts if not mounting up to the region of his thoughts there was a continual protest going on against much of it that nature and all his inarticulate persuasion however much forbidden to articulate itself taught him the futility and unfeasibility of the system followed here the visiting magistrates he gently regretted rather than complained had lately taken his treadwheel from him men were just now pulling it down and how he was henceforth to enforce discipline on these bad subjects was much a difficulty with him they cared for nothing but the treadwheel and for having their rations cut short of the two sole penalties hard work and occasional hunger there remained now only one and that by no means the better one as he thought the sympathy of visitors too their pity for his interesting scoundrelsubjects though he tried to like it was evidently no joy to this practical mind pity yes but pity for the scoundrelspecies for those who will not have pity on themselves and will force the universe and the laws of nature to have no pity on them meseems i could discover fitter objects of pity  in fact it was too clear this excellent man had got a field for his faculties which in several respects was by no means the suitable one to drill twelve hundred scoundrels by the method of kindness and of abolishing your very treadwheelhow could any commander rejoice to have such a work cut out for him you had but to look in the faces of these twelve hundred and despair for most part of ever commanding them at all miserable distorted blockheads the generality apefaces impfaces angry dogfaces heavy sullen oxfaces degraded underfoot perverse creatures sons of indocility greedy mutinous darkness and in one word of stupidity which is the general mother of such stupidity intellectual and stupidity moral for the one always means the other as you will with surprise or not discover if you look had borne this progeny basenatured beings on whom in the course of a maleficent subterranean life of london scoundrelism the genius of darkness called satan devil and other names had now visibly impressed his seal and had marked them out as soldiers of chaos and of himappointed to serve in his regiments first of the line second ditto and so on in their order him you could perceive they would serve but not easily another than him these were the subjects whom our brave captain and prisongovernor was appointed to command and reclaim to other service by the method of love with a treadwheel abolished  hopeless forevermore such a project these abject ape wolf ox imp and other diabolicanimal specimens of humanity who of the very gods could ever have commanded them by love a collar round the neck and a cartwhip flourished over the back these in a just and steady human hand were what the gods would have appointed them and now when by long misconduct and neglect they had sworn themselves into the devils regiments of the line and got the seal of chaos impressed on their visage it was very doubtful whether even these would be of avail for the unfortunate commander of twelve hundred men by love without hope except of peaceably teasing oakum or fear except of a temporary loss of dinner he was to guide these men and wisely constrain themwhitherward nowhither that was his goal if you will think well of it that was a second fundamental falsity in his problem false in the warp and false in the woof thought one of us about as false a problem as any i have seen a good man set upon lately to guide scoundrels by love that is a false woof i take it a method that will not hold together hardly for the flower of men will love alone do and for the sediment and scoundrelism of men it has not even a chance to do and then to guide any class of men scoundrel or other nowhither which was this poor captains problem in this prison with oakum for its one element of hope or outlook how can that prosper by love or by any conceivable method that is a warp wholly false out of which false warp or originally false condition to start from combined and daily woven into by your false woof or methods of love and such like there arises for our poor captain the falsest of problems and for a man of his faculty the unfairest of situations his problem was not to command good men to do something but bad men to do with superficial disguises nothing   on the whole what a beautiful establishment here fitted up for the accommodation of the scoundrelworld male and female as i said no duke in england is for all rational purposes which a human being can or ought to aim at lodged fed tended taken care of with such perfection of poor craftsmen that pay rates and taxes from their days wages of the dim millions that toil and moil continually under the sun we know what is the lodging and the tending of the johnsons goldsmiths lodged in their squalid garrets working often enough amid famine darkness tumult dust and desolation what work they have to doof these as of spiritual backwoodsmen understood to be preappointed to such a life and like the pigs to killing quite used to it i say nothing but of dukes which duke i could ask has cocoa soup meat and food in general made ready so fit for keeping him in health in ability to do and to enjoy which duke has a house so thoroughly clean pure and airy lives in an element so wholesome and perfectly adapted to the uses of soul and body as this same which is provided here for the devils regiments of the line no duke that i have ever known dukes are waited on by deleterious french cooks by perfunctory grooms of the chambers and expensive crowds of eyeservants more imaginary than real while here science human intellect and beneficence have searched and sat studious eager to do their very best they have chosen a real artist in governing to see their best in all details of it done happy regiments of the line what soldier to any earthly or celestial power has such a lodging and attendance as you here no soldier or servant direct or indirect of god or of man in this england at present joy to you regiments of the line your master i am told has his elect and professes to be prince of the kingdoms of this world and truly i see he has power to do a good turn to those he loves in england at least shall we say may he may the devil give you good of it ye elect of scoundrelism i will rather pass by uttering no prayer at all musing rather in silence on the singular worship of god or practical reverence done to human worth which is the outcome and essence of all real worship whatsoever among the posterity of adam at this day  for all round this beautiful establishment or oasis of purity intended for the devils regiments of the line lay continents of dingy poor and dirty dwellings where the unfortunate not yet enlisted into that force were struggling manifoldlyin their workshops in their marbleyards and timberyards and tanyards in their close cellars cobblerstalls hungry garrets and poor dark tradeshops with redherrings and tobaccopipes crossed in the windowto keep the devil outofdoors and not enlist with him and it was by a tax on these that the barracks for the regiments of the line were kept up visiting magistrates impelled by exeter hall by ableeditors and the philanthropic movement of the age had given orders to that effect rates on the poor servant of god and of her majesty who still serves both in his way painfully selling redherrings rates on him and his redherrings to boil right soup for the devils declared elect never in my travels in any age or clime had i fallen in with such visiting magistrates before reserved they i should suppose for these ultimate or penultimate ages of the world rich in all prodigies political spiritualages surely with such a length of ears as was never paralleled before  if i had a commonwealth to reform or to govern certainly it should not be the devils regiments of the line that i would first of all concentrate my attention on with them i should be apt so make rather brief work to them one would apply the besom try to sweep them with some rapidity into the dustbin and well out of ones road i should rather say fill your thrashingfloor with docks ragweeds mugworths and ply your flail upon themthat is not the method to obtain sacks of wheat away you begone swiftly ye regiments of the line in the name of god and of his poor struggling servants sore put to it to live in these bad days i mean to rid myself of you with some degree of brevity to feed you in palaces to hire captains and schoolmasters and the choicest spiritual and material artificers to expend their industries on you no by the eternal i have quite other work for that class of artists sevenandtwenty millions of neglected mortals who have not yet quite declared for the devil mark it my diabolic friends i mean to lay leather on the backs of you collars round the necks of you and will teach you after the example of the gods that this world is not your inheritance or glad to see you in it you ye diabolic canaille what has a governor much to do with you you i think he will rather swiftly dismiss from his thoughtswhich have the whole celestial and terrestrial for their scope and not the subterranean of scoundreldom alone you i consider he will sweep pretty rapidly into some norfolk island into some special convict colony or remote domestic moorland into some stonewalled silentsystem under hard drillsergeants just as rhadamanthus and inflexible as he and there leave you to reap what you have sown he meanwhile turning his endeavors to the thousandfold immeasurable interests of men and godsdismissing the one extremely contemptible interest of scoundrels sweeping that into the cesspool tumbling that over london bridge in a very brief manner if needful who are you ye thriftless sweepings of creation that we should forever be pestered with you have we no work to do but drilling devils regiments of the line  if i had schoolmasters my benevolent friend do you imagine i would set them on teaching a set of unteachables who as you perceive have already made up their mind that black is whitethat the devil namely is the advantageous master to serve in this world my esteemed benefactor of humanity it shall be far from me minds open to that particular conviction are not the material i like to work upon when once my schoolmasters have gone over all the other classes of society from top to bottom and have no other soul to try with teaching all being thoroughly taughti will then send them to operate on these regiments of the line then and assure yourself never till then the truth is i am sick of scoundreldom my esteemed benefactor it always was detestable to me and here where i find it lodged in palaces and waited on by the benevolent of the world it is more detestable not to say insufferable to me than ever  of beneficence benevolence and the people that come together to talk on platforms and subscribe five pounds i will say nothing here indeed there is not room here for the twentieth part of what were to be said of them the beneficence benevolence and sublime virtue which issues in eloquent talk reported in the newspapers with the subscription of five pounds and the feeling that one is a good citizen and ornament to societyconcerning this there were a great many unexpected remarks to be made but let this one for the present occasion suffice  my sublime benevolent friends dont you perceive for one thing that here is a shockingly unfruitful investment for your capital of benevolence precisely the worst indeed which human ingenuity could select for you laws are unjust temptations great c c alas i know it and mourn for it and passionately call on all men to help in altering it but according to every hypothesis as to the law and the temptations and pressures towards vice here are the individuals who of all the society have yielded to said pressure these are of the worst substance for enduring pressure the others yet stand and make resistance to temptation to the laws injustice under all the perversities and strangling impediments there are the rest of the society still keep their feet and struggle forward marching under the banner of cosmos of god and human virtue these select few as i explain to you are they who have fallen to chaos and are sworn into certain regiments of the line a superior proclivity to chaos is declared in these by the very fact of their being here of all the generation we live in these are the worst stuff these i say are the elixir of the infatuated among living mortals if you want the worst investment for your benevolence here you accurately have it o my surprising friends nowhere so as here can you be certain that a given quantity of wise teaching bestowed of benevolent trouble taken will yield zero or the net minimum of return it is sowing of your wheat upon irish quagmires laboriously harrowing it in upon the sand of the seashore o my astonishing benevolent friends  yonder in those dingy habitations and shops of red herring and tobaccopipes where men have not yet quite declared for the devil there i say is land here is mere seabeach thither go with your benevolence thither to those dingy caverns of the poor and there instruct and drill and manage there where some fruit may come from it and above all and inclusive of all cannot you go to those solemn human shams phantasm captains and supreme quacks that ride prosperously in every thoroughfare and with severe benevolence ask them what they are doing here they are the men whom it would behoove you to drill a little and tie to the halberts in a benevolent manner if you could we cannot say you yes my friends to a certain extent you can by many wellknown active methods and by all manner of passive methods you can strive thitherward i advise you thither with whatever social effort there may lie in you the wellhead and consecrated thriceaccursed chief fountain of all those waters of bitternessit is they those solemn shams and supreme quacks of yours little as they or you imagine it them with severe benevolence put a stop to them send to their father far from the sight of the true and justif you would ever see a just world here  what sort of reformers and workers are you that work only on the rotten material that never think of meddling with the material while it continues sound that stress it and strain it with new rates and assessments till once it has given way and declared itself rotten whereupon you snatch greedily at it and say now let us try to do some good upon it you mistake in every way my friends the fact is you fancy yourselves men of virtue benevolence what not and you are not even men of sincerity and honest sense i grieve to say it but it is true good from you and your operations is not to be expected you may go down   howard is a beautiful philanthropist eulogized by burke and in most mens minds a sort of beatified individual how glorious having finished off ones affairs in bedfordshire or in fact finding them very dull inane

circumnavigation of charity to collate distresses to gauge wretchedness to take the dimensions of human misery really it is very fine captain cooks voyage for the terra australis rosss franklins for the ditto borealis men make various cruises and voyages in this worldfor want of money want of work and one or the other wantwhich are attended with their difficulties too and do not make the cruiser a demigod on the whole i have myself nothing but respect comparatively speaking for the dull solid howard and his benevolence and other impulses that set him cruising heaven had grown weary of jailfevers and other the like unjust penalties inflicted upon scoundrelsfor scoundrels too and even the very devil should not have more than their dueand heaven in its opulence created a man to make an end of that created him disgusted him with the grocer business tried him with calvinism rural ennui and sore bereavement in his bedfordshire retreatand in short at last got him set to his work and in a condition to achieve it for which i am thankful to heaven and do alsowith doffed hat humbly salute john howard a practical solid man if a dull and even dreary carries his weighingscales in his pocket when your jailer answers the prisoners allowance of food is so and so and we observe it sacredly here for example is a rationhey a ration this and solid john suddenly produces his weighingscales weighs it marks down in his tablets what the actual quantity of it is that is the art and manner of the man a man full of english accuracy english veracity solidity  simplicity by whom this universal jailcommission not to be paid for in money but far otherwise is set about with all the slow energy the patience practicality sedulity and sagacity common to the best english commissioners paid in money and not expressly otherwise  for it is the glory of england that she has a turn for fidelity in practical work that shamworkers though very numerous are rarer than elsewhere that a man who undertakes work for you will still in various provinces of our affairs do it instead of merely seeming to do it john howard without pay in money did this of the jailfever as other englishmen do work in a truly workmanlike manner his distinction was that he did it without money he had not 500 pounds or 5000 pounds a year of salary for it but lived merely on his bedfordshire estates and as snigsby irreverently expresses it by chewing his own cud and sure enough if any man might chew the cud of placid reflections solid howard a mournful man otherwise might at intervals indulge a little in that luxuryno moneysalary had he for his work he had merely the income of his properties and what he could derive from within is this such a sublime distinction then well let it pass at its value there have been benefactors of mankind who had more need of money than he and got none too milton it is known did his paradise lost at the easy rate of five pounds kepler worked out the secret of the heavenly motions in a dreadfully painful manner going over the calculations sixty times and having not only no public money but no private either and in fact writing almanacs for his breadandwater while he did this of the heavenly motions having no bedfordshire estates nothing but a pension of 18 pounds which they would not pay him the valuable faculty of writing almanacs and at length the invaluable one of dying when the heavenly bodies were vanquished and battles conflagration had collapsed into cold dark ashes and the starvation reached too high a pitch for the poor man  howard is not the only benefactor that has worked without money for us there have been some moreand will be i hope for the destinies are opulent and send here and there a man into the world to do work for which they do not mean to pay him in money and they smite him beneficently with sore afflictions and blight his world all into grim frozen ruins round himand can make a wandering exile of their dante and not a softbedded podesta of florence if they wish to get a divine comedy out of him nay that rather is their way when they have worthy work for such a man they scourge him manifoldly to the due pitch sometimes nearly of despair that he may search desperately for his work and find it they urge him on still with beneficent stripes when needful as is constantly the case between whiles and in fact have privately decided to reward him with beneficent death by and by and not with money at all o my benevolent friend i honor howard very much but it is on this side idolatry a long way not to an infinite but to a decidedly finite extent and youput not the modest noble howard a truly modest man to the blush by forcing these reflections on us  cholera doctors hired to dive into black dens of infection and despair they rushing about all day from lane to lane with their life in their hand are found to do their function which is a much more rugged one than howards or what say we cholera doctors ragged losels gathered by beat of drum from the overcrowded streets of cities and drilled a little and dressed in red do not they stand fire in an uncensurable manner and handsomely give their life if needful at the rate of a shilling per day human virtue if we went down to the roots of it is not so rare the materials of human virtue are everywhere abundant as the light of the sun raw materialso woe and loss and scandal thrice and threefold that they so seldom are elaborated and built into a result that they lie yet unelaborated and stagnant in the souls of widespread dreary millions fermenting festering and issue at last as energetic vice instead of strong practical virtue a mrs manning dying gamealas is not that the foiled potentiality of a kind of heroine too not a heroic judith not a mother of the gracchi now but a hideous murderess fit to be the mother of hyenas to such extent can potentialities be foiled education kingship commandwhere is it whither has it fled woe a thousand times that this which is the task of all kings captains priests public speakers landowners bookwriters millowners and persons possessing or pretending to possess authority among mankindis left neglected among them all and instead of it so little done but protocolling blackorwhite surplicing partridgeshooting parliamentary eloquence and popular twaddleliterature with such results as we see   howard abated the jailfever but it seems to me he has been the innocent cause of a far more distressing fever which rages high just now what we may call the benevolentplatform fever howard is to be regarded as the unlucky fountain of that tumultuous frothy oceantide of benevolent sentimentality abolition of punishment allabsorbing prisondiscipline and general morbid sympathy instead of hearty hatred for scoundrels which is threatening to drown human society as in deluges and leave instead of an edifice of society fit for the habitation of men a continent of fetid ooze inhabitable only by mudgods and creatures that walk upon their belly few things more distress a thinking soul at this time  most sick am i o friends of this sugary disastrous jargon of philanthropy the reign of love new era of universal brotherhood and not paradise to the welldeserving but paradise to allandsundry which possesses the benighted minds of men and women in our day my friends i think you are much mistaken about paradise no paradise for anybody he that cannot do without paradise go his ways suppose you tried that for a while i reckon that the safer version unhappy sugary brethren this is all untrue this other contrary to the fact not a tatter of it will hang together in the wind and weather of fact in brotherhood with the base and foolish i for one do not mean to live not in brotherhood with them was life hitherto worth much to me in pity in hope not yet quite swallowed of disgustotherwise in enmity that must last through eternity in unappeasable aversion shall i have to live with these brotherhood no be the thought far from me they are adams childrenalas yes i well remember that and never shall forget it hence this rage and sorrow but they have gone over to the dragons they have quitted the fathers house and set up with the old serpent till they return how can they be brothers they are enemies deadly to themselves and to me and to you till then till then while hope yet lasts i will treat them as brothers fallen insanewhen hope has ended with tears grown sacred and wrath grown sacred i will cut them off in the name of god it is at my peril if i do not with the servant of satan i dare not continue in partnership him i must put away resolutely and forever lest as it is written i become partaker of his plagues  beautiful black peasantry who have fallen idle and have got the devil at your elbow interesting white felonry who are not idle but have enlisted into the devils regiments of the lineknow that my benevolence for you is comparatively trifling what i have of that divine feeling is due to others not to you a universal sluggardandscoundrel protection society is not the one i mean to institute in these times where so much wants protection and is sinking to sad issues for want of it the scoundrel needs no protection the scoundrel that will hasten to the gallows why not rather clear the way for him better he reach his goal and outgate by the natural proclivity than be so expensively dammed up and detained poisoning everything as he stagnates and meanders along to arrive at last a hundred times fouler and swollen a hundred times bigger benevolent men should reflect on thisand you quashee my pumpkinnot a bad fellow either this poor quashee when tolerably guidedidle quashee i say you must get the devil sent away from your elbow my poor dark friend in this world there will be no existence for you otherwise no not as the brother of your folly will i live beside you please to withdraw out of my way if i am not to contradict your folly and amend it and put it in the stocks if it will not amend by the eternal maker it is on that footing alone that you and i can live together and if you had respectable traditions dated from beyond magna charta or from beyond the deluge to the contrary and written sheepskins that would thatch the face of the worldbehold i for one individual do not believe said respectable traditions nor regard said written sheepskins except as things which you till you grow wiser will believe adieu quashee i will wish you better guidance than you have had of late  on the whole what a reflection is it that we cannot bestow on an unworthy man any particle of our benevolence our patronage or whatever resource is ourswithout withdrawing it it and all that will grow of it from one worthy to whom it of right belongs we cannot i say impossible it is the eternal law of things incompetent duncan mpastehorn the hapless incompetent mortal to whom i give the cobbling of my bootsand cannot find in my heart to refuse it the poor drunken wretch having a wife and ten children he withdraws the job from sober plainly competent and meritorious mr sparrowbill generally short of work too discourages sparrowbill teaches him that he too may as well drink and loiter and bungle that this is not a scene for merit and demerit at all but for dupery and whining flattery and incompetent cobbling of every descriptionclearly tending to the ruin of poor sparrowbill what harm had sparrowbill done me that i should so help to ruin him and i couldnt save the insalvable mpastehorn i merely yielded him for insufficient work here and there a halfcrownwhich he oftenest drank and now sparrowbill also is drinking  justice justice woe betides us everywhere when for this reason or for that we fail to do justice no beneficence benevolence or other virtuous contribution will make good the want and in what a rate of terrible geometrical progression far beyond our poor computation any act of injustice once done by us grows rooting itself ever anew spreading ever anew like a banyantreeblasting all life under it for it is a poisontree there is but one thing needed for the world but that one is indispensable justice justice in the name of heaven give us justice and we live give us only counterfeits of it or succedanea for it and we die   oh this universal syllabub of philanthropic twaddle my friend it is very sad now when christianity is as good as extinct in all hearts to meet this ghastlyphantasm of christianity parading through almost all i will clean your foul thoroughfares and make your devilscloaca of a world into a garden of heaven jabbers this phantasm itself a phosphorescence and unclean the worst it is written comes from corruption of the bestsemitic forms now lying putrescent dead and still unburied this phosphorescence rises i say sometimes such a blockhead idol and miserable white mumbojumbo fashioned out of deciduous sticks and cast clothes out of extinct cants and modern sentimentalisms as that which they sing litanies to at exeter hall and extensively elsewhere was perhaps never set up by human folly before unhappy creatures that is not the maker of the universe not that look one moment at the universe and see that is a paltry phantasm engendered in your own sick brain whoever follows that as a reality will fall into the ditch  reform reform all men see and feel is imperatively needed reform must either be got and speedily or else we die and nearly all the men that speak instruct us saying have you quite done your interesting negroes in the sugar islands rush to the jails then o ye reformers snatch up the interesting scoundrelpopulation there to them be nursingfathers and nursingmothers and oh wash and dress and teach and recover to the service of heaven these poor lost souls so we assure you will society attain the needful reform and life be still possible in this world thus sing the oracles everywhere nearly all the men that speak though we doubt not there are as usual immense majorities consciously or unconsciously wiser who hold their tongue but except this of whitewashing the scoundrelpopulation one sees little reform going on there is perhaps some endeavor to do a little scavengering and as the allincluding point to cheapen the terrible cost of government but neither of these enterprises makes progress owing to impediments  whitewash your scoundrelpopulation sweep out your abominable gutters if not in the name of god ye brutish slatterns then in the name of cholera and the royal college of surgeons do these two thingsand observe much cheaper if you pleasewell here surely is an evangel of freedom and real program of a new era what surliest misanthrope would not find this world lovely were these things done scoundrels whitewashed some degree of scavengering upon the gutters and at a cheap rate thirdly that surely is an occasion on which if ever on any the genius of reform may pipe all handspoor old genius of reform bedrid this good while with little but broken ballotboxes and tattered stripes of benthamee constitutions lying round him and on the walls mere shadows of clothingcolonels ratesinaid poorlaw unions defunct potato and the irish difficultyhe does not seem long for this world piping to that effect   not the least disgusting feature of this gospel according to the platform is its reference to religion and even to the christian religion as an authority and mandate for what it does christian religion does the christian or any religion prescribe love of scoundrels then i hope it prescribes a healthy hatred of scoundrelsotherwise what am i in heavens name to make of it me for one it will not serve as a religion on those strange terms just hatred of scoundrels i say fixed irreconcilable inexorable enmity to the enemies of god this and not love for them and incessant whitewashing and dressing and cockering of them must if you look into it be the backbone of any human religion whatsoever christian religion in what words can i address you ye unfortunates sunk in the slushy ooze till the worship of mudserpents and unutterable pythons and poisonous slimy monstrosities seems to you the worship of god this is the rotten carcass of christianity this malodorous phosphorescence of postmortem sentimentalism o heavens from the christianity of oliver cromwell wrestling in grim fight with satan and his incarnate blackguardisms hypocrisies injustices and legion of human and infernal angels to that of eloquent mr hesperus fiddlestring denouncing capital punishments and inculcating the benevolence on platforms what a road have we travelled  a foolish stumporator perorating on his platform mere benevolences seems a pleasant object to many persons a harmless or insignificant one to almost all look at him however scan him till you discern the nature of him he is not pleasant but ugly and perilous that beautiful speech of his takes captive every long ear and kindles into quasisacred enthusiasm the minds of not a few but it is quite in the teeth of the everlasting facts of this universe and will come only to mischief for every party concerned consider that little spouting wretch within the paltry skin of him it is too probable he holds few human virtues beyond those essential for digesting victual envious cowardly vain splenetic hungry soul what heroism in word or thought or action will you ever get from the like of him he in his necessity has taken into the benevolent line warms the cold vacuity of his inner man to some extent in a comfortable manner not by silently doing some virtue of his own but by fiercely recommending hearsay pseudovirtues and respectable benevolences to other people do you call that a good trade longeared fellowcreatures more or less resembling himself answer hear hear live fiddlestring forever wherefrom follow abolition congresses odes to the gallowsperhaps some dirty little bill getting itself debated next session in parliament to waste certain nights of our legislative year and cause skipping in our morning newspaper till the abortion can be emptied out again and sent fairly floating down the gutters  not with entire approbation do i for one look on that eloquent individual wise benevolence if it had authority would order that individual i believe to find some other trade eloquent individual pleading here against the laws of naturefor many reasons i bid thee close that mouth of thine enough of balderdash these longeared have now drunk depart thou do some benevolent work at lowest be silent disappear i say away and jargon no more in that manner lest a worst thing befall thee exeat fiddlestringbeneficent men are not they who appear on platforms pleading against the almighty makers laws these are the maleficent men whose lips it is pity that some authority cannot straightway shut pandoras box is not more baleful than the gifts these eloquent benefactors are pressing on us close your pedlers pack my friend swift away with it pernicious fraught with mere woe and sugary poison is that kind of benevolence and beneficence  truly one of the saddest sights in these times is that of poor creatures on platforms in parliaments and other situations making and unmaking laws in whose soul full of mere vacant hearsay and windy babble is and was no image of heavens law whom it never struck that heaven had a law or that the earthcould not have what kind of law you pleased human statutebooks accordingly are growing horrible to think of an impiety and poisonous futility every law of them that is so made all nature is against it it will and can do nothing but mischief wheresoever it shows itself in nature and such laws lie now like an incubus over this earth so innumerable are they how long o lord how longo ye eternities divine silences do you dwell no more then in the hearts of the noble and the true and is there no inspiration of the almighty any more vouchsafed us the inspiration of the morning newspapersalas we have had enough of that and are arrived at the gates of death by means of that   really one of the most difficult questions this we have in these times what to do with our criminals blandly observed a certain lawdignitary in my hearing once taking the cigar from his mouth and pensively smiling over a group of us under the summer beechtree as favonius carried off the tobaccosmoke and the group said nothing only smiled and nodded answering by new tobaccoclouds what to do with our criminals asked the official lawdignitary again as if entirely at a lossi suppose said one ancient figure not engaged in smoking the plan would be to treat them according to the real law of the case to make the law of england in respect of them correspond to the law of the universe criminals i suppose would prove manageable in that way if we could do approximately as god almighty does towards them in a word if we could try to do justice towards themill thank you for a definition of justice sneered the official person in a cheerily scornful and triumphant manner backed by a slight laugh from the honorable company which irritated the other speakerwell i have no pocket definition of justice said he to give your lordship it has not quite been my trade to look for such a definition i could rather fancy it had been your lordships trade sitting on your high place this long while but one thing i can tell you justice always is whether we define it or not everything done suffered or proposed in parliament or out of it is either just or else unjust either is accepted by the gods and eternal facts or is rejected by them your lordship and i with or without definition do a little know justice i will hope if we dont both know it and do it we are hourly travelling down towardsheavens must i name such a place that is the place we are bound to with all our tradingpack and the small or extensive budgets of human business laid on us and there if we dont know justice we and all our budgets and acts of parliament shall find lodging when the day is donethe official person a polite man otherwise grinned as he best could some semblance of a laugh mirthful as that of the ass eating thistles and ended in hah oh ah  indeed it is wonderful to hear what account we at present give ourselves of the punishment of criminals no revengeo heavens no all preachers on sunday strictly forbid that and even at least on sundays prescribe the contrary of that it is for the sake of example that you punish to protect society and its purse and skin to deter the innocent from falling into crime and especially withal for the purpose of improving the poor criminal himselfor at lowest of hanging and ending him that he may not grow worse for the poor criminal is to be improved if possible against him no revenge even on weekdays nothing but love for him and pity and help poor fellow is he not miserable enough very miserablethough much less so than the master of him called satan is understood on sundays to have long deservedly been  my friends will you permit me to say that all this to one poor judgment among your number is the mournfulest twaddle that human tongues could shake from them that it has no solid foundation in the nature of things and to a healthy human heart no credibility whatever permit me to say only to hearts long drowned in dead tradition and for themselves neither believing nor disbelieving could this seem credible think and ask yourselves in spite of all this preaching and perorating from the teeth outward hearts that are quite strangers to eternal fact and acquainted only at all hours with temporary semblances parading about in a prosperous and persuasive condition hearts that from their first appearance in this world have breathed since birth in all spiritual matters which means in all matters not pecuniary the poisonous atmosphere of universal cant could believe such a thing cant moral cant religious cant political an atmosphere which envelops all things for us unfortunates and has long done which goes beyond the zenith and below the nadir for us and has as good as choked the spiritual life out of all of usgod pity such wretches with little or nothing real about them but their purse and their abdominal department hearts alas which everywhere except in the metallurgic and cottonspinning provinces have communed with no reality or awful presence of a fact godlike or diabolic in this universe or this unfathomable life at all hungerstricken asphyxied hearts which have nourished themselves on what they call religions christian religions good heaven once more fancy the christian religion of oliver cromwell or of some noble christian man whom you yourself may have been blessed enough once long since in your life to know these are not untrue religions they are the putrescences and foul residues of religions that are extinct that have plainly to every honest nostril been dead some time and the remains of whicho ye eternal heavens will the nostril never be delivered from themsuch hearts when they get upon platforms and into questions not involving money can believe many things  i take the liberty of asserting that there is one valid reason and only one for either punishing a man or rewarding him in this world one reason which ancient piety could well define that you may do the will and commandment of god with regard to him that you may do justice to him this is your one true aim in respect of him aim thitherward with all your heart and all your strength and all your soul thitherward and not elsewhither at all this aim is true and will carry you to all earthly heights and benefits and beyond the stars and heavens all other aims are purblind illegitimate untrue and will never carry you beyond the shopcounter nay very soon will prove themselves incapable of maintaining you even there find out what the law of god is with regard to a man make that your human law or i say it will be ill with you and not well if you love your thief or murderer if nature and eternal fact love him then do as you are now doing but if nature and fact do not love him if they have set inexorable penalties upon him and planted natural wrath against him in every godcreated human heartthen i advise you cease and change your hand  reward and punishment alas alas i must say you reward and punish pretty much alike your dignities peerages promotions your kingships your brazen statues erected in capital and county towns to our select demigods of your selecting testify loudly enough what kind of heroes and heroworshippers you are woe to the people that no longer venerates as the emblem of god himself the aspect of human worth that no longer knows what human worth and unworth is sure as the decrees of the eternal that people cannot come to good by a course too clear by a necessity too evident that people will come into the hands of the unworthy and either turn on its bad career or stagger downwards to ruin and abolition does the hebrew people prophetically sing ou clo in all thoroughfares these eighteen hundred years in vain  to reward men according to their worth alas the perfection of this we know amounts to the millennium neither is perfect punishment according to the like rule to be attainednor even by a legislator of these chaotic days to be too zealously attempted but when he does attempt ityes when he summons out the society to sit deliberative on this matter and consult the oracles upon it and solemnly settle it in the name of god then if never before he should try to be a little in the right in settling itin regard to reward of merit i do not bethink me of any attempt whatever worth calling an attempt on the part of modern governments which surely is an immense oversight on their part and will one day be seen to have been an altogether fatal one but as to the punishment of crime happily this cannot be quite neglected when men have a purse and a skin they seek salvation at least for these and the four pleas of the crown are a thing that must and will be attended to by punishment capital or other by treadmilling and blind rigor or by whitewashing and blind laxity the extremely disagreeable offences of theft and murder must be kept down within limits  and so you take criminal caitiffs murderers and the like and hang them on gibbets for an example to deter others whereupon arise friends of humanity and object with very great reason as i consider if your hypothesis be correct what right have you to hang any poor creature for an example he can turn round upon you and say why make an example of me a merely illsituated pitiable man have you no more respect for misfortune misfortune i have been told is sacred and yet you hang me now i am fallen into your hands choke the life out of me for an example again i ask why make an example of me for your own convenience aloneall revenge being out of the question it seems to me the caitiff is unanswerable and he and the philanthropic platforms have the logic all on their side  the one answer to him is caitiff we hate thee and discern for some six thousand years now that we are called upon by the whole universe to do it not with a diabolic but with a divine hatred god himself we have always understood hates sin with a most authentic celestial and eternal hatred a hatred a hostility inexorable unappeasable which blasts the scoundrel and all scoundrels ultimately into black annihilation and disappearance from the sum of things the path of it as the path of a flaming sword he that has eyes may see it walking inexorable divinely beautiful and divinely terrible through the chaotic gulf of human history and everywhere burning as with unquenchable fire the false and deathworthy from the true and lifeworthy making all human history and the biography of every man a gods cosmos in place of a devils chaos so is it in the end even so to every man who is a man and not a mutinous beast and has eyes to see to thee caitiff these things were and are quite incredible to us they are too awfully certainthe eternal law of this universe whether thou and others will believe it or disbelieve we not to be partakers in thy destructive adventure of defying god and all the universe dare not allow thee to continue longer among us as a palpable deserter from the ranks where all men at their eternal peril are bound to be palpable deserter taken with the red band fighting thus against the whole universe and its laws wesend thee back into the whole universe solemnly expel thee from our community and will in the name of god not with joy and exultation but with sorrow stern as thy own hang thee on wednesday next and so end  other ground on which to deliberately slay a disarmed fellowman i can see none example effects upon the public mind effects upon this and upon that all this is mere appendage and accident of all this i make no attempt to keep accountsensible that no arithmetic will or can keep account of it that its effects on this hand and on that transcend all calculation one thing if i can calculate it will include all and produce beneficial effects beyond calculation and no ill effect at all anywhere or at any time what the law of the universe or law of god is with regard to this caitiff that by all sacred research and consideration i will try to find out to that i will come as near as human means admit that shall be my exemplar and example all men shall through me see that and be profited beyond calculation by seeing it  what this law of the universe or law made by god is men at one time read it in their bible in many bibles books and authentic symbols and monitions of nature and the world of fact that is and of human speech or wise interpretation of fact there are still clear indications towards it most important it is for this and for some other reasons that men do in some way get to see it a little and if no man could now see it by any bible there is written in the heart of every man an authentic copy of it direct from heaven itself there if he have learnt to decipher heavens writing and can read the sacred oracles a sad case for him if he altogether cannot every born man may still find some copy of it  revenge my friends revenge and the natural hatred of scoundrels and the ineradicable tendency to revancher oneself upon them and pay them what they have merited this is forevermore intrinsically a correct and even a divine feeling in the mind of every man only the excess of it is diabolic the essence i say is manlike and even godlikea monition sent to poor man by the maker himself thou poor reader in spite of all this melancholy twaddle and blotting out of heavens sunlight by mountains of horsehair and officiality hast still a human heart if in returning to thy poor peaceable dwellingplace after an honest hard days work thou wert to find for example a brutal scoundrel who for lucre or other object of his had slaughtered the life that was dearest to thee thy true wife for example thy true old mother swimming in her blood the human scoundrel or twolegged wolf standing over such a tragedy i hope a man would have so much divine rage in his heart as to snatch the nearest weapon and put a conclusion upon said human wolf for one a palpable messenger of satan that one accredited by all the devils to be put an end to by all the children of god the soul of every godcreated man flames wholly into one divine blaze of sacred wrath at sight of such a devilsmessenger authentic firsthand monition from the eternal maker himself as to what is next to be done do it or be thyself an ally of devilsmessengers a sheep for twolegged human wolves well deserving to be eaten as thou soon wilt be  my humane friends i perceive this same sacred glow of divine wrath or authentic monition at first hand from god himself to be the foundation for all criminal law and official horsehairandbombazine procedure against scoundrels in this world this firsthand gospel from the eternities imparted to every mortal this is still and will forever be your sanction and commission for the punishment of human scoundrels see well how you will translate this message from heaven and the eternities into a form suitable to this world and its times let not violence haste blind impetuous impulse preside in executing it the injured man invincibly liable to fall into these shall not himself execute it the whole world in person of a minister appointed for that end and surrounded with the due solemnities and caveats with bailiffs apparitors advocates and the hushed expectation of all men shall do it as under the eye of god who made all men how it shall be done this is ever a vast question involving immense considerations thus edmund burke saw in the two houses of parliament with king constitution and all manner of civillists and chancellors wigs and exchequer budgets only the method of getting twelve just men put into a jurybox that in burkes view was the summary of what they were all meant for how the judge will do it yes indeedbut let him see well that he does do it for it is a thing that must by no means be left undone a sacred gospel from the highest not to be smothered under horsehair and bombazine or drowned in platform froth or in any wise omitted or neglected without the most alarming penalties to all concerned  neglect to treat the hero as hero the penaltieswhich are inevitable too and terrible to think of as your hebrew friends can tell youmay be some time in coming they will only gradually come not all at once will your thirty thousand needlewomen your three million paupers your connaught fallen into potential cannibalism and other fine consequences of the practice come to lightthough come to light they will and ou clo itself may be in store for you if you persist steadily enough but neglect to treat even your declared scoundrel as scoundrel this is the last consummation of the process the drop by which the cup runs over the penalties of this most alarming extensive and such as you little dream of will straightway very rapidly come dim oblivion of right and wrong among the masses of your population will come doubts as to right and wrong indistinct notion that right and wrong are not eternal but accidental and settled by uncertain votings and talkings will come prurient influenza of platform benevolence and paradise to allandsundry will come in the general putrescence of your religions as you call them a strange new religion named of universal love with sacraments mainly ofdivorce with balzac sue and company for evangelists and madame sand for virgin will comeand results fast following therefrom which will astonish you very much  the terrible anarchies of these years says crabbe in his radiator are brought upon us by a necessity too visible by the crime of kingsalas yes but by that of peoples too not by the crime of one class but by the fatal obscuration and all but obliteration of the sense of right and wrong in the minds and practices of every class what a scene in the drama of universal history this of ours a worldwide loud bellow and bray of universal misery lowing with crushed maddened heart its inarticulate prayer to heavenvery pardonable to me and in some of its transcendent developments as in the grand french revolution most respectable and evermemorable for injustice reigns everywhere and this murderous struggle for what they call fraternity and so forth has a spice of eternal sense in it though so terribly disfigured amalgam of sense and nonsense eternal sense by the grain and temporary nonsense by the square mile as is the habit with poor sons of men which pardonable amalgam however if it be taken as the pure final sense i must warn you and all creatures is unpardonable criminal and fatal nonsensewith which i for one will take care not to concern myself  dogs should not be taught to eat leather says the old adage noand where by general fault and error and the inevitable nemesis of things the universal kennel is set to diet upon leather and from its keepers its liberal premiers or whatever their title is will accept or expect nothing else and calls it by the pleasant name of progress reform emancipation abolitionprinciples and the likei consider the fate of said kennel and of said keepers to be a thing settled red republic in phrygian nightcap organization of labor a la louis blanc streetbarricades and then murderous cannonvolleys a la cavaignac and windischgratz follow out of one another as grapes must new wine and sour allsplitting vinegar do vinegar is but vinaigre or the selfsame wine grown sharp if moreover i find the worship of human nobleness abolished in any country and a new astonishing phallusworship with universal balzacsand melodies and litanies in treble and in bass established in its stead what can i compute but that nature in horrible throes will repugn against such substitutionthat in short the astonishing new phallusworship with its finer sensibilities of the heart and great satisfying loves with its sacred kiss of peace for scoundrel and hero alike with its allembracing brotherhood and universal sacrament of divorce will have to take itself away again   the ancient germans it appears had no scruple about public executions on the contrary they thought the just gods themselves might fitly preside over these that these were a solemn and highest act of worship if justly done when a german man had done a crime deserving death they in solemn general assembly of the tribe doomed him and considered that fate and all nature had from the beginning doomed him to die with ignominy certain crimes there were of a supreme nature him that had perpetrated one of these they believed to have declared himself a prince of scoundrels him once convicted they laid hold of nothing doubting bore him after judgment to the deepest convenient peatbog plunged him in there drove an oaken frame down over him solemnly in the name of gods and men there prince of scoundrels that is what we have had to think of thee on clear acquaintance our grim goodnight to thee is that in the name of all the gods lie there and be our partnership with thee dissolved henceforth it will be better for us we imagine  my friends after all this beautiful whitewash and humanity and prisondiscipline and such blubbering and whimpering and soft litany to divine and also to quite other sorts of pity as we have had for a century nowgive me leave to admonish you that that of the ancient germans too was a thing inexpressibly necessary to keep in mind if that is not kept in mind the universal litany to pity is a mere universal nuisance and torpid blasphemy against the gods i do not much respect it that purblind blubbering and litanying as it is seen at present and the litanying over scoundrels i go the length of disrespecting and in some cases even of detesting yes my friends scoundrel is scoundrel that remains forever a fact and there exists not in the earth whitewash that can make the scoundrel a friend of this universe he remains an enemy if you spent your life in whitewashing him he wont whitewash this one wont the one method clearly is that after fair trial you dissolve partnership with him send him in the name of heaven whither he is striving all this while and have done with him and in a time like this i would advise you see likewise that you be speedy about it for there is immense work and of a far hopefuler sort to be done elsewhere   alas alas to see once the prince of scoundrels the supreme scoundrel him whom of all men the gods liked worst solemnly laid hold of and hung upon the gallows in sight of the people what a lesson to all the people sermons might be preached the son of thunder and the mouth of gold might turn their periods now with some hope for here in the most impressive way is a divine sermon acted didactic as no spoken sermon could be didactic devotional tooin awed solemnity a recognition that eternal justice rules the world that at the call of this human pity shall fall silent and man be stern as his master and mandatory isunderstand too that except upon a basis of even such rigor sorrowful silent inexorable as that of destiny and doom there is no true pity possible the pity that proves so possible and plentiful without that basis is mere ignavia and cowardly effeminacy maudlin laxity of heart grounded on blinkard dimness of headcontemptible as a drunkards tears  to see our supreme scoundrel hung upon the gallows alas that is far from us just now there is a worst man in england toocurious to think ofwhom it would be inexpressibly advantageous to lay hold of and hang the first of all but we do not know him with the least certainty the least approach even to a guesssuch buzzards and dullards and poor children of the dusk are we in spite of our statistics unshackled presses and torches of knowledgenot eagles soaring sunward not brothers of the lightnings and the radiances we a dim horneyed owlpopulation intent mainly on the catching of mice alas the supreme scoundrel alike with the supreme hero is very far from being known nor have we the smallest apparatus for dealing with either of them if he were known our supreme scoundrel sits i conjecture wellcushioned in high places at this time rolls softly through the world and lives a prosperous gentleman instead of sinking him in peatbogs we mount the brazen image of him on high columns such is the worlds temporary judgment about its supreme scoundrels a mad world my masters to get the supreme scoundrel always accurately the first hanged this which presupposes that the supreme hero were always the first promoted this were precisely the millennium itself clear evidence that the millennium had come alas we must forbear hope of this much water will run by before we see this  and yet to quit all aim towards it to go blindly floundering along wrapt up in clouds of horsehair bombazine and sheepskin officiality oblivious that there exists such an aim this is indeed fatal in every human law there must either exist such an aim or else the law is not a human but a diabolic one diabolic i say no quantity of bombazine or lawyers wigs threereadings and solemn trumpeting and bowwowing in high places or in low can hide from me its frightful infernal tendencybound and sinking at all moments gradually to gehenna this law and dragging down much with it to decree injustice by a law inspired prophets have long since seen what every clear soul may still see that of all anarchies and devilworships there is none like this that this is the throne of iniquity set up in the name of the highest the human apotheosis of anarchy itself quiet anarchy you exultingly say yes quiet anarchy which the longer it sits quiet will have the frightfuler account to settle at last for every doit of the account as i often say will have to be settled one day as sure as god lives principal and compound interest rigorously computed and the interest is at a terrible rate per cent in these cases alas the aspect of certain beatified anarchies sitting quiet and of others in a state of infernal explosion for sixty years back this the one view our europe offers at present makes these days very sad  my unfortunate philanthropic friends it is this longcontinued oblivion of the soul of law that has reduced the criminal question to such a pass among us many other things have come and are coming for the same sad reason to a pass not the supreme scoundrel have our laws aimed at but in an uncertain fitful manner at the inferior or lowest scoundrel who robs shoptills and puts the skin of mankind in danger how can parliament get through the criminal question parliament oblivious of heavenly law will find itself in hopeless reductio ad absurdum in regard to innumerable other questionsin regard to all questions whatsoever by and by there will be no existence possible for parliament on these current terms parliament in its lawmakings must really try to attain some vision again of what heavens laws are a thing not easy to do a thing requiring sad sincerity of heart reverence pious earnestness valiant manful wisdomqualities not overabundant in parliament just now nor out of it i fear  adieu my friends my anger against you is gone my sad reflections on you and on the depths to which you and i and all of us are sunk in these strange times are not to be uttered at present you would have saved the sarawak pirates then the almighty maker is wroth that the sarawak cutthroats with their poisoned spears are away what must his wrath be that the thirty thousand needlewomen are still here and the question of prevenient grace not yet settled o my friends in sad earnest sad and deadly earnest there much needs that god would mend all this and that we should help him to mend itand dont you think for one thing farmer hodges horses in the sugar islands are pretty well emancipated now my clear opinion farther is we had better quit the scoundrelprovince of reform better close that under hatches in some rapid summary manner and go elsewhither with our reform efforts a whole world for want of reform is drowning and sinking threatening to swamp itself into a stygian quagmire uninhabitable by any nobleminded man let us to the wellheads i say to the chief fountains of these waters of bitterness and there strike home and dig to puddle in the embouchures and drowned outskirts and ulterior and ultimate issues and cloacas of the affair what profit can there be in that nothing to be saved there nothing to be fished up there except with endless peril and spread of pestilence a miscellany of broken waifs and dead dogs in the name of heaven quit that     no iii downing street april 1 1850  from all corners of the wide british dominion there rises one complaint against the ineffectuality of what are nicknamed our redtape establishments our government offices colonial office foreign office and the others in downing street and the neighborhood to me individually these branches of human business are little known but every british citizen and reflective passerby has occasion to wonder much and inquire earnestly concerning them to all men it is evident that the social interests of one hundred and fifty millions of us depend on the mysterious industry there carried on and likewise that the dissatisfaction with it is great universal and continually increasing in intensityin fact mounting we might say to the pitch of settled despair  every colony every agent for a matter colonial has his tragic tale to tell you of his sad experiences in the colonial office what blind obstructions fatal indolences pedantries stupidities on the right and on the left he had to do battle with what a worldwide jungle of redtape inhabited by doleful creatures deaf or nearly so to human reason or entreaty he had entered on and how he paused in amazement almost in despair passionately appealed now to this doleful creature now to that and to the dead redtape jungle and to the living universe itself and to the voices and to the silencesand on the whole found that it was an adventure in sorrowful fact equal to the fabulous ones by old knightserrant against dragons and wizards in enchanted wildernesses and waste howling solitudes not achievable except by nearly superhuman exercise of all the four cardinal virtues and unexpected favor of the special blessing of heaven his adventure achieved or found unachievable he has returned with experiences new to him in the affairs of men what this colonial office inhabiting the head of downing street really was and had to do or try doing in gods practical earth he could not by any means precisely get to know believes that it does not itself in the least precisely know believes that nobody knowsthat it is a mystery a kind of heathen myth and stranger than any piece of the old mythological pantheon for it practically presides over the destinies of many millions of living men  such is his report of the colonial office and if we oftener hear such a report of that than we do of the home office foreign office or the restthe reason probably is that colonies excite more attention at present than any of our other interests the forty colonies it appears are all pretty like rebelling just now and are to be pacified with constitutions luckier constitutions let us hope than some late ones have been loyal canada for instance had to quench a rebellion the other year and this year in virtue of its constitution it is called upon to pay the rebels their damages which surely is a rather surprising result however constitutionalmen have rents and moneys dependent in the colonies emigration schemes black emancipations newzealand and other schemes and feel and publish more emphatically what their downingstreet woes in these respects have been  were the state of poor sallow english ploughers and weavers what we may call the sallow or yellow emancipation interest as much in object with exeterhall philanthropists as that of the black blockheads now all emancipated and going at large without work or need of working in westindia clover and fattening very much in it one delights to hear then perhaps the home office its huge virtual task better understood and its small actual performance better seen into might be found still more deficient and behind the wants of the age than the colonial itself is  how it stands with the foreign office again one still less knows seizures of sapienza and the like sudden appearances of britain in the character of herculesharlequin waving with big bullyvoice her huge swordofsharpness over fieldmice and in the air making horrid circles horrid catherinewheels and deathdisks of metallic terror from said huge sword to see how they will like itdo from time to time astonish the world in a not pleasant manner herculesharlequin the attorney triumphant the worlds busybody none of these are parts this nation has a turn for she if you consulted her would rather not play these parts but another seizures of sapienza correspondences with sotomayor remonstrances to otho king of athens fleets hanging by their anchor in behalf of the majesty of portugal and in short the whole or at present very nearly the whole of that industry of protocolling diplomatizing remonstrating admonishing and having the honor to behas sunk justly in public estimation to a very low figure  for in fact it is reasonably asked what vital interest has england in any cause now deciding itself in foreign parts once there was a papistry and protestantism important as life eternal and death eternal more lately there was an interest of civil order and horrors of the french revolution important at least as rentroll and preservation of the game but now what is there no cause in which any god or man of this british nation can be thought to be concerned shamkingship now recognized and even selfrecognized everywhere to be sham wrestles and struggles with mere ballotbox anarchy not a pleasant spectacle to british minds both parties in the wrestle professing earnest wishes of peace to us what have we to do with it except answer earnestly peace yes certainly and mind our affairs elsewhere the british nation has no concern with that indispensable sorrowful and shameful wrestle now going on everywhere in foreign parts the british nation already by selfexperience centuries old understands all that was lucky enough to transact the greater part of that in noble ancient ages while the wrestle had not yet become a shameful one but on both sides of it there was wisdom virtue heroic nobleness fruitful to all timethricelucky british nation the british nation i say has nothing to learn there has now quite another set of lessons to learn far ahead of what is going on there sad example there of what the issue is and how inevitable and how imminent might admonish the british nation to be speedy with its new lessons to bestir itself as men in peril of conflagration do with the neighboring houses all on fire to obtain for its own very pressing behoof if by possibility it could some real captaincy instead of an imaginary one to remove resolutely and replace by a better sort its own peculiar species of teaching and guiding histrios of various name who here too are numerous exceedingly and much in need of gentle removal while the play is still good and the comedy has not yet become tragic and to be a little swift about it withal and so to escape the otherwise inevitable evil day this britain might learn but she does not need a protocolling establishment with much having the honor to be to teach it her  noshe has in fact certain cottons hardwares and such like to sell in foreign parts and certain wines portugal oranges baltic tar and other products to buy and does need i suppose some kind of consul or accredited agent accessible to british voyagers here and there in the chief cities of the continent through which functionary or through the pennypost if she had any specific message to foreign courts it would be easy and proper to transmit the same special messagecarriers to be still called ambassadors if the name gratified them could be sent when occasion great enough demanded not sent when it did not but for all purposes of a resident ambassador i hear persons extensively and well acquainted among our foreign embassies at this date declare that a wellselected times reporter or own correspondent ordered to reside in foreign capitals and keep his eyes open and though sparingly his pen going would in reality be much more effectiveand surely we see well he would come a good deal cheaper considerably cheaper in expense of money and in expense of falsity and grimacing hypocrisy of which no human arithmetic can count the ultimate cost incalculably cheaper if this is the fact why not treat it as such if this is so in any measure we had better in that measure admit it to be so the time i believe has come for asking with considerable severity how far is it so nay there are men now current in political society men of weight though also of wit who have been heard to say that there was but one reform for the foreign officeto set a live coal under it and with of course a firebrigade which could prevent the undue spread of the devouring element into neighboring houses let that reform it in such odor is the foreign office too if it were not that the public oppressed and nearly stifled with a mere infinitude of bad odors neglects this onein fact being able nearly always to avoid the street where it is escapes this one and except a passing curse once in the quarter or so as good as forgets the existence of it  such from sad personal experience and credited prevailing rumor is the exoteric public conviction about these sublime establishments in downing street and the neighborhood the esoteric mysteries of which are indeed still held sacred by the initiated but believed by the world to be mere dalailama pills manufactured let not refined lips hint how and quite unsalvatory to mankind every one may remark what a hope animates the eyes of any circle when it is reported or even confidently asserted that sir robert peel has in his mind privately resolved to go one day into that stable of king augeas which appalls human hearts so rich is it highpiled with the droppings of two hundred years and herculeslike to load a thousand nightwagons from it and turn running water into it and swash and shovel at it and never leave it till the antique pavement and real basis of the matter show itself clean again in any intelligent circle such a rumor like the first break of day to men in darkness enlightens all eyes and each says devoutly faxitis o ye righteous powers that have pity on us all england grateful with kindling looks will rise in the rear of him and from its deepest heart bid him good speed  for it is universally felt that some esoteric man well acquainted with the mysteries and properties good and evil of the administrative stable is the fittest to reform it nay can alone reform it otherwise than by sheer violence and destruction which is a way we would avoid that in fact sir robert peel is at present the one likely or possible man to reform it and secondly it is felt that reform in that downingstreet department of affairs is precisely the reform which were worth all others that those administrative establishments in downing street are really the government of this huge ungoverned empire that to clean out the dead pedantries unveracities indolent somnolent impotences and accumulated dungmountains there is the beginning of all practical good whatsoever yes get down once again to the actual pavement of that ascertain what the thing is and was before dung accumulated in it and what it should and may and must for the lifes sake of this empire henceforth become here clearly lies the heart of the whole matter political reform if this be not reformed is naught and a mere mockery  what england wants and will require to have or sink in nameless anarchies is not a reformed parliament meaning thereby a parliament elected according to the six or the four or any other number of points and cunningly devised improvements in hustings mechanism but a reformed executive or sovereign body of rulers and administratorssome improved method innumerable improvements in our poor blind methods of getting hold of these not a better talkingapparatus the best conceivable talkingapparatus would do very little for us at presentbut an infinitely better actingapparatus the benefits of which would be invaluable now and henceforth the practical question puts itself with everincreasing stringency to all english minds can we by no industry energy utmost expenditure of human ingenuity and passionate invocation of the heavens and earth get to attain some twelve or ten or six men to manage the affairs of this nation in downing street and the chief posts elsewhere who are abler for the work than those we have been used to this long while for it is really a heroic work and cannot be done by histrios and dexterous talkers having the honor to be it is a heavy and appalling work and at the starting of it especially will require herculean men such mountains of pedant exuviae and obscene owldroppings have accumulated in those regions long the habitation of doleful creatures the old pavements the natural facts and real essential functions of those establishments have not been seen by eyes for these two hundred years last past herculean men acquainted with the virtues of running water and with the divine necessity of getting down to the clear pavements and old veracities who tremble before no amount of pedant exuviae no loudest shrieking of doleful creatures who tremble only to live themselves like inane phantasms and to leave their life as a paltry contribution to the guano mountains and not as a divine eternal protest against them  these are the kind of men we want these the nearest possible approximation to these are the men we must find and have or go bankrupt altogether for the concern as it is will evidently not hold long together how true is this of crabbe men sit in parliament eightythree hours per week debating about many things men sit in downing street doing protocols syrian treaties greek questions portuguese spanish french egyptian and aethiopian questions dexterously writing despatches and having the honor to be not a question of them is at all pressing in comparison with the english question pacifico the miraculous gibraltar jew has been hustled by some populace in greeceupon him let the british lion drop very rapidly indeed a constitutional tear radetzky is said to be advancing upon milani am sorry to hear it and perhaps it does deserve a despatch or friendly letter once and away but the irish giant named of despair is advancing upon london itself laying waste all english cities towns and villages that is the interesting government despatch of the day i notice him in piccadilly bluevisaged thatched in rags a blue child on each arm hungerdriven widemouthed seeking whom he may devour he missioned by the just heavens too truly and too sadly their divine missionary come at last in this authoritative manner will throw us all into doubting castle i perceive that is the phenomenon worth protocolling about and writing despatches upon and thinking of with all ones faculty day and night if one wishes to have the honor to beanything but a phantasm governor of england just now i entreat your lordships all but undivided attention to that domestic irish giant named of despair for a great many years to come prophecy of him there has long been but now by the rot of the potato blessed be the just gods who send us either swift death or some beginning of cure at last he is here in person and there is no denying him or disregarding him any more and woe to the public watchman that ignores him and sees pacifico the gibraltar jew instead   what these strange entities in downing street intrinsically are who made them why they were made how they do their function and what their function so huge in appearance may in netresult amount tois probably known to no mortal the unofficial mind passes by in dark wonder not pretending to know the official mind must not blabthe official mind restricted to its own square foot of territory in the vast labyrinth is probably itself dark and unable to blab we see the outcome the mechanism we do not see how the tailors clip and sew in that sublime sweating establishment of theirs we know not that the coat they bring us out is the sorrowfulest fantastic mockery of a coat a mere intricate artistic network of traditions and formalities an embroiled reticulation made of weblistings and superannuated thrums and tatters endurable to no grown nation as a coat is mournfully clear  two kinds of fundamental error are supposable in such a set of offices these two acting and reacting are the vice of all inefficient offices whateverfirst that the work such as it may be is ill done in these establishments that it is delayed neglected slurred over committed to hands that cannot do it well that in a word the questions sent thither are not wisely handled but unwisely not decided truly and rapidly but with delays and wrong at last which is the principal character and the infallible result of an insufficient intellect being set to decide them or second what is still fataler the work done there may itself be quite the wrong kind of work not the kind of supervision and direction which colonies and other such interests home or foreign do by the nature of them require from the central government not that but a quite other kind the sotomayor correspondence for example is considered by many persons not to be mismanaged merely but to be a thing which should never have been managed at all a quite superfluous concern which and the like of which the british government has almost no call to get into at this new epoch of time and not sotomayor only nor sapienza only in regard to that foreign office but innumerable other things if our witty friend of the live coal have reason in him of the colonial office too it is urged that the questions they decide and operate upon are in very great part questions which they never should have meddled with but almost all of which should have been decided in the colonies themselvesmother country or colonial office reserving its energy for a quite other class of objects which are terribly neglected just now  these are the two vices that beset government offices both of them originating in insufficient intellectthat sad insufficiency from which directly or indirectly all evil whatsoever springs and these two vices act and react so that where the one is the other is sure to be and each encouraging the growth of the other both if some cleaning of the augeas stable have not intervened for a long while will be found in frightful development you cannot have your work well done if the work be not of a right kind if it be not work prescribed by the law of nature as well as by the rules of the office laziness which lies in wait round all human laboroffices will in that case infallibly leak in and vitiate the doing of the work the work is but idle if the doing of it will but pass what need of more the essential problem as the rules of office prescribe it for you if nature and fact say nothing is that your work be got to pass if the work itself is worth nothing or little or an uncertain quantity what more can gods or men require of it or above all can i who am the doer of it require but that it be got to pass  and now enters another fatal effect the mother of evernew mischiefs which renders welldoing or improvement impossible and drives bad everywhere continually into worse the work being what we see a stupid subaltern will do as well as a gifted one the essential point is that he be a quiet one and do not bother me who have the driving of him nay for this latter object is not a certain height of intelligence even dangerous i want no mettled arab horse with his flashing glances arched neck and elastic step to draw my wretched sandcart through the streets a broken grassfed galloway irish garron or painful ass with nothing in the belly of him but patience and furze will do it safelier for me if more slowly nay i myself am i the worse for being of a feeble order of intelligence what the irreverent speculative world calls barren redtapish limited and even intrinsically dark and small and if it must be said stupidto such a climax does it come in all government and other offices where human stupidity has once introduced itself as it will everywhere do and no scavenger god intervenes the work at first of some worth is ill done and becomes of less worth and of ever less and finally of none the worthless work can now afford to be ill done and human stupidity at a double geometrical ratio with frightful expansion grows and accumulatestowards the unendurable  the reforming hercules sir robert peel or whoever he is to be that enters downing street will ask himself this question first of all what work is now necessary not in form and by traditionary use and wont but in very fact for the vital interests of the british nation to be done here the second question how to get it well done and to keep the best hands doing it well will be greatly simplified by a good answer to that oh for an eye that could see in those hideous mazes and a heart that could dare and do strenuous faithful scrutiny not of what is thought to be what in the redtape regions but of what really is what in the realms of fact and nature herself deepseeing wise and courageous eyes that could look through innumerable cobweb veils and detect what fact or nofact lies at heart of themhow invaluable these for alas it is long since such eyes were much in the habit of looking steadfastly at any department of our affairs and poor commonplace creatures helping themselves along in the way of makeshift from year to year in such an element do wonderful works indeed such creatures like moles are safe only underground and their engineerings there become very daedalean in fact such unfortunate persons have no resource but to become what we call pedants to ensconce themselves in a safe world of habitudes of applicable or inapplicable traditions not coveting rather avoiding the general daylight of commonsense as very extraneous to them and their procedure by long persistence in which course they become completed pedants hidebound impenetrable able to defy the hostile extraneous element an alarming kind of men such men left to themselves for a century or two in any colonial foreign or other office will make a terrible affair of it  for the one enemy we have in this universe is stupidity darkness of mind of which darkness again there are many sources every sin a source and probably selfconceit the chief source darkness of mind in every kind and variety does to a really tragic extent abound but of all the kinds of darkness surely the pedant darkness which asserts and believes itself to be light is the most formidable to mankind for empires or for individuals there is but one class of men to be trembled at and that is the stupid class the class that cannot see who alas are they mainly that will not see a class of mortals under which as administrators kings priests diplomatists c the interests of mankind in every european country have sunk overloaded as under universal nightmare near to extinction and indeed are at this moment convulsively writhing decided either to throw off the unblessed superincumbent nightmare or roll themselves and it to the abyss vain to reform parliament to invent ballotboxes to reform this or that the real administration practical management of the commonwealth goes all awry choked up with longaccumulated pedantries so that your appointed workers have been reduced to work as moles and it is one vast boring and counterboring on the part of eyeless persons irreverently called stupid and a daedalean bewilderment writing impossible on all efforts or proposals supervenes   the state itself not in downing street alone but in every department of it has altered much from what it was in past times and it will again have to alter very much to alter i think from top to bottom if it means to continue existing in the times that are now coming and come  the state left to shape itself by dim pedantries and traditions without distinctness of conviction or purpose beyond that of helping itself over the difficulty of the hour has become instead of a luminous vitality permeating with its light all provinces of our affairs a most monstrous agglomerate of inanities as little adapted for the actual wants of a modern community as the worst citizen need wish the thing it is doing is by no means the thing we want to have done what we want let the dullest british man endeavor to raise in his mind this question and ask himself in sincerity what the british nation wants at this time is it to have with endless jargoning debating motioning and countermotioning a settlement effected between the honorable mr this and the honorable mr that as to their respective pretensions to ride the high horse really it is unimportant which of them ride it going upon past experience long continued now i should say with brevity either of themneither of them if our government is to be a nogovernment what is the matter who administers it fling an orangeskin into st jamess street let the man it hits be your man he if you breed him a little to it and tie the due official bladders to his ankles will do as well as another this sublime problem of balancing himself upon the vortexes with the long loadedpole in his hands and will with straddling painful gestures float hither and thither walking the waters in that singular manner for a little while as well as his foregoers did till he also capsize and be left floating feet uppermost after which you choose another  what an immense pother by parliamenting and palavering in all corners of your empire to decide such a question as that i say if that is the function almost any human creature can learn to discharge it fling out your orangeskin again and save an incalculable labor and an emission of nonsense and falsity and electioneering beer and bribery and balderdash which is terrible to think of in deciding your national parliament in so far as it has only that question to decide may be considered as an enormous national palaver existing mainly for imaginary purposes and certain in these days of abbreviated labor to get itself sent home again to its partridgeshootings foxhuntings and above all to its ratcatchings if it could but understand the time of day and know as our indignant crabbe remarks that the real nimrod of this era who alone does any good to the era is the ratcatcher  the notion that any government is or can be a nogovernment without the deadliest peril to all noble interests of the commonwealth and by degrees slower or swifter to all ignoble ones also and to the very gullydrains and thief lodginghouses and mosaic sweating establishments and at last without destruction to such nogovernment itselfwas never my notion and i hope it will soon cease altogether to be the worlds or to be anybodys but if it be the correct notion as the world seems at present to flatter itself i point out improvements and abbreviations dismiss your national palaver make the times newspaper your national palaver which needs no beerbarrels or hustings and is cheaper in expense of money and of falsity a thousand and a million fold have an economical redtape drilling establishment it were easier to devise such a thing than a right modern universityand fling out your orangeskin among the graduates when you want a new premier  a mighty question indeed who shall be premier and take in hand the rudder of government otherwise called the spigot of taxation shall it be the honorable felix parvulus or the right honorable felicissimus zero by our electioneerings and hansard debatings and everenduring tempest of jargon that goes on everywhere we manage to settle that to have it declared with no bloodshed except insignificant blood from the nose in hustingstime but with immense beershed and inkshed and explosion of nonsense which darkens all the air that the right honorable zero is to be the man that we firmly settle zero all shivering with rapture and with terror mounts into the high saddle cramps himself on with knees heels hands and feet and the horse gallopswhither it lists that the right honorable zero should attempt controlling the horsealas alas he sticking on with beak and claws is too happy if the horse will only gallop anywhither and not throw him measure polity plan or scheme of public good or evil is not in the head of felicissimus except if he could but devise it some measure that would please his horse for the moment and encourage him to go with softer paces godward or devilward as it might be and save felicissimuss leather which is fast wearing this is what we call a government in england for nearly two centuries now  i wish felicissimus were saddlesick forever and a day he is a dreadful object however much we are used to him if the horse had not been bred and broken in for a thousand years by real riders and horsesubduers perhaps the best and bravest the world ever saw what would have become of felicissimus and him long since this horse by secondnature religiously respects all fences gallops if never so madly on the highways aloneseems to me of late like a desperate sleswick thunderhorse who had lost his way galloping in the labyrinthic lanes of a woody flat country passionate to reach his goal unable to reach it because in the flat leafy lanes there is no outlook whatever and in the bridle there is no guidance whatever so he gallops stormfully along thinking it is forward and forward and alas it is only round and round out of one old lane into the othernay according to some he mistakes his own footprints which of course grow ever more numerous for the sign of a more and more frequented road and his despair is hourly increasing my impression is he is certain soon such is the growth of his necessity and his despair toplunge across the fence into an opener survey of the country and to sweep felicissimus off his back and comb him away very tragically in the process poor sleswicker i wish you were better ridden i perceive it lies in the fates you must now either be better ridden or else not long at all this plunging in the heavy labyrinth of overshaded lanes with ones stomach getting empty ones ireland falling into cannibalism and no vestige of a goal either visible or possible cannot last   colonial offices foreign home and other offices got together under these strange circumstances cannot well be expected to be the best that human ingenuity could devise the wonder rather is to see them so good as they are who made them ask me not made they clearly were for we see them here in a concrete condition writing despatches and drawing salary with a view to buy pudding but how those offices in downing street were made who made them or for what kind of objects they were made would be hard to say at present dim visions and phantasmagories gathered from the books of horace walpole memoirs of bubb doddington memoirs of my lady sundon lord fanny hervey and innumerable others rise on us beckoning fantastically towards not an answer but some conceivable intimations of an answer and proclaiming very legibly the old text quam parva sapientia in respect of this hardworking muchsubduing british nation giving rise to endless reflections in a thinking englishman of this day alas it is ever so each generation has its task and does it better or worse greatly neglecting what is not immediately its task our poor grandfathers so busy conquering indias founding colonies inventing spinningjennies kindling lancashires and bromwichams took no thought about the government of all that left it all to be governed by lord fanny and the hanover succession or how the gods pleased and now we the poor grandchildren find that it will not stick together on these terms any longer that our sad dangerous and sore task is to discover some government for this big world which has been conquered to us that the redtape offices in downing street are near the end of their rope that if we can get nothing better in the way of government it is all over with our world and us how the downingstreet offices originated and what the meaning of them was or is let dryasdust when in some lucid moment the whim takes him instruct us enough for us to know and see clearly with urgent practical inference derived from such insight that they were not made for us or for our objects at all that the devouring irish giant is here and that he cannot be fed with redtape and will eat us if we cannot feed him  on the whole let us say felicissimus made themor rather it was the predecessors of felicissimus who were not so dreadfully hunted sticking to the wild and ever more desperate sleswicker in the leafy labyrinth of lanes as he now is he i think will never make anything but be combed off by the elmboughs and left sprawling in the ditch but in past time this and the other heavyladen redtape soul had withal a glow of patriotism in him now and then in his whirling element a gleam of human ingenuity some eye towards business that must be done at all events for him and every one parliament needed to be persuaded that business was done by the contributions of many such heavyladen souls driven on by necessity outward and inward these singular establishments are here contributionswho knows how far back they go far beyond the reign of george the second or perhaps the reign of william conqueror noble and genuine some of them were many of them were i need not doubt for there is no human edifice that stands long but has got itself planted here and there upon the basis of fact and being built in many respects according to the laws of statics no standing edifice especially no edifice of state but has had the wise and brave at work in it contributing their lives to it and is cemented whether it know the fact or not by the blood of heroes none not even the foreign office home office still less the national palaver itself william conqueror i find must have had a firstrate home office for his share the domesday book done in four years and done as it is with such an admirable brevity explicitness and completeness testifies emphatically what kind of undersecretaries and officials william had silent officials and secretaries i suppose not wasting themselves in parliamentary talk reserving all their intelligence for silent survey of the huge dumb fact silent consideration how they might compass the mastery of that happy secretaries happy william  but indeed nobody knows what inarticulate traditions remnants of old wisdom priceless though quite anonymous survive in many modern things that still have life in them ben brace with his taciturnities and rugged stoical ways with his tarry breeches stiff as plankbreeches i perceive is still a kind of lodbrog loadedbreeks in more senses than one and derives little conscious of it many of his excellences from the old seakings and saxon pirates themselves and how many blakes and nelsons since have contributed to ben things are not so false always as they seem said a certain professor to me once of this you will find instances in every country and in your england more than anyand i hope will draw lessons from them an english seventyfour if you look merely at the articulate law and methods of it is one of the impossiblest entities the captain is appointed not by preeminent merit in sailorship but by parliamentary connection the men this was spoken some years ago are got by impressment a pressgang goes out knocks men down on the streets of seatowns and drags them on boardif the ship were to be stranded i have heard they would nearly all run ashore and desert can anything be more unreasonable than a seventyfour articulately almost nothing but it has inarticulate traditions ancient methods and habitudes in it stoicisms noblenesses true rules both of sailing and of conduct enough to keep it afloat on natures veridical bosom after all see if you bid it sail to the end of the world it will lift anchor go and arrive the raging oceans do not beat it back it too as well as the raging oceans has a relationship to nature and it does not sink but under the due conditions is borne along if it meet with hurricanes it rides them out if it meet an enemys ship it shivers it to powder and in short it holds on its way and to a wonderful extent does what it means and pretends to do assure yourself my friend there is an immense fund of truth somewhere or other stowed in that seventyfour   more important than the past history of these offices in downing street is the question of their future history the question how they are to be got mended truly an immense problem inclusive of all others whatsoever which demands to be attacked and incessantly persisted in by all good citizens as the grand problem of society and the one thing needful for the commonwealth a problem in which all men with all their wisdoms and all their virtues faithfully and continually cooperating at it will never have done enough and will still only be struggling towards perfection in it in which some men can do muchin which every man can do something every man and thou my present reader canst do this be thyself a man abler to be governed more reverencing the divine faculty of governing more sacredly detesting the diabolical semblance of said faculty in self and others so shalt thou if not govern yet actually according to thy strength assist in real governing and know always and even lay to heart with a quite unusual solemnity with a seriousness altogether of a religious nature that as human stupidity is verily the accursed parent of all this mischief so human intelligence alone to which and to which only is victory and blessedness appointed here below will or can cure it if we knew this as devoutly as we ought to do the evil and all other evils were curablealas if we had from of old known this as all men made in gods image ought to do the evil never would have been perhaps few nations have ever known it less than we for a good while back have done hence these sorrows  what a people are the poor thibet idolaters compared with us and our religions which issue in the worship of king hudson as our dalailama they across such hulls of abject ignorance have seen into the heart of the matter we with our torches of knowledge everywhere brandishing themselves and such a human enlightenment as never was before have quite missed it reverence for human worth earnest devout search for it and encouragement of it loyal furtherance and obedience to it this i say is the outcome and essence of all true religions and was and ever will be we have not known this no loud as our tongues sometimes go in that direction we have no true reverence for human intelligence for human worth and wisdom none or too littleand i pray for a restoration of such reverence as for the change from stygian darkness to heavenly light as for the return of life to poor sick moribund society and all its interests human intelligence means little for most of us but beaver contrivance which produces spinningmules cheap cotton and large fortunes wisdom unless it give us railway scrip is not wise  true nevertheless it forever remains that intellect is the real object of reverence and of devout prayer and zealous wish and pursuit among the sons of men and even well understood the one object it is the inspiration of the almighty that giveth men understanding for it must be repeated and ever again repeated till poor mortals get to discern it and awake from their baleful paralysis and degradation under foul enchantments that a man of intellect of real and not sham intellect is by the nature of him likewise inevitably a man of nobleness a man of courage rectitude pious strength who even because he is and has been loyal to the laws of this universe is initiated into discernment of the same to this hour a missioned of heaven whom if men follow it will be well with them whom if men do not follow it will not be well human intellect if you consider it well is the exact summary of human worth and the essence of all worthships and worships is reverence for that same this much surprises you friend peter but i assure you it is the factand i would advise you to consider it and to try if you too do not gradually find it so with me it has long been an article not of faith only but of settled insight of conviction as to what the ordainments of the maker in this universe are ah could you and the rest of us but get to know it and everywhere religiously act upon itas our fortieth article which includes all the other thirtynine and without which the thirtynine are good for almost nothingthere might then be some hope for us in this world there is but one appalling creature the stupid man considered to be the missioned of heaven and followed by men he is our king men say heand they follow him through straight or winding courses i for one know well whitherward  abler men in downing street abler men to govern us yes that sure enough would gradually remove the dungmountains however high they are that would be the way nor is there any other way to remedy whatsoever has gone wrong in downing street and in the wide regions spiritual and temporal which downing street presides over for the able man meet him where you may is definable as the born enemy of falsity and anarchy and the born soldier of truth and order into what absurdest element soever you put him he is there to make it a little less absurd to fight continually with it till it become a little sane and human again peace on other terms he for his part cannot make with it not he while he continues able or possessed of real intellect and not imaginary there is but one man fraught with blessings for this world fated to diminish and successively abolish the curses of the world and it is he for him make search him reverence and follow know that to find him or miss him means victory or defeat for you in all downing streets and establishments and enterprises here belowi leave your lordship to judge whether this has been our practice hitherto and would humbly inquire what your lordship thinks is likely to be the consequence of continuing to neglect this it ought to have been our practice ought in all places and all times to be the practice in this world so says the fixed law of things forevermoreand it must cease to be not the practice your lordship and cannot too speedily do so i think  much has been done in the way of reforming parliament in late years but that of itself seems to avail nothing or almost less the men that sit in downing street governing us are not abler men since the reform bill than were those before it precisely the same kind of men obedient formerly to tory traditions obedient now to whig ditto and popular clamors respectable men of office respectably commonplace in facilitywhile the situation is becoming terribly original rendering their outlooks and ours more ominous every day  indisputably enough the meaning of all reformmovement electing and electioneering of popular agitation parliamentary eloquence and all political effort whatsoever is that you may get the ten ablest men in england put to preside over your ten principal departments of affairs to sift and riddle the nation so that you might extricate and sift out the true ten gold grains or ablest men and of these make your governors or public officers leaving the dross and common sandy or silty material safely aside as the thing to be governed not to govern certainly all ballotboxes caucuses kenningtoncommon meetings parliamentary debatings red republics russian despotisms and constitutional or unconstitutional methods of society among mankind are intended to achieve this one end and some of them it will be owned achieve it very illif you have got your gold grains if the men you have got are actually the ablest then rejoice with whatever astonishment accept your ten and thank the gods under this ten your destruction will at least be milder than under another but if you have not got them if you are very far from having got them then do not rejoice at all then lament very much then admit that your sublime political constitutions and contrivances do not prove themselves sublime but ridiculous and contemptible that your worlds wonder of a political mill the envy of surrounding nations does not yield you real meal yields you only powder of millstones called hansard debatings and a detestable brown substance not unlike the grindings of dried horsedung or prepared streetmud which though sold under royal patent and much recommended by the trade is quite unfit for culinary purposes   but the disease at least is not mysterious whatever the remedy be our diseasealas is it not clear as the sun that we suffer under what is the disease of all the miserable in this world want of wisdom that in the head there is no vision and that thereby all the members are dark and in bonds no vision in the head heroism faith devout insight to discern what is needful noble courage to do it greatly defective there not seeing eyes there but spectacles constitutionally ground which to the unwary seem to see a quite fatal circumstance had you never so many parliaments how is your ship to be steered by a pilot with no eyes but a pair of glass ones got from the constitutional optician he must steer by the ear i think rather than by the eye by the shoutings he catches from the shore or from the parliamentary benches nearer handone of the frightfulest objects to see steering in a difficult sea reformed parliaments in that case reformleagues outer agitations and excitements in never such abundance cannot profit all this is but the writhing and painful blind convulsion of the limbs that are in bonds that are all in dark misery till the head be delivered till the pressure on the brain be removed  or perhaps there is now no heroic wisdom left in england england once the land of heroes is itself sunk now to a dim owlery and habitation of doleful creatures intent only on moneymaking and other forms of catching mice for whom the proper gospel is the gospel of mcroudy and all nobler impulses and insights are forbidden henceforth perhaps these present agreeable occupants of downing street such as the parliamentary mill has yielded them are the best the miserable soil had grown the most herculean ten men that could be found among the english twentyseven millions are these there are not in any place under any figure ten diviner men among us well in that case the riddling and searching of the twentyseven millions has been successful here are our ten divinest men with these unhappily not divine enough we must even content ourselves and die in peace what help is there no help no hope in that case  but again if these are not our divinest men then evidently there always is hope there always is possibility of help and ruin never is quite inevitable till we have sifted out our actually divinest ten and set these to try their band at governingthat this has been achieved that these ten men are the most herculean souls the english population held within it is a proposition credible to no mortal no thank god low as we are sunk in many ways this is not yet credible evidently the reverse of this proposition is the fact ten much diviner men do certainly exist by some conceivable not forever impossible method and methods ten very much diviner men could be sifted outcourage let us fix our eyes on that important fact and strive all thitherward as towards a door of hope   parliaments i think have proved too well in late years that they are not the remedy it is not parliaments reformed or other that will ever send herculean men to downing street to reform downing street for us to diffuse therefrom a light of heavenly order instead of the murk of stygian anarchy over this sad world of ours that function does not lie in the capacities of parliment that is the function of a kingif we could get such a priceless entity which we cannot just now failing which statesmen or temporary kings and at the very lowest one real statesman to shape the dim tendencies of parliament and guide them wisely to the goal he i perceive will be a primary condition indispensable for any progress whatsoever  one such perhaps might be attained one such might prove discoverable among our parliamentary populations that one in such an enterprise as this of downing street might be invaluable one noble man at once of natural wisdom and practical experience one intellect still really human and not redtapish owlish and pedantical appearing there in that dim chaos with word of command to brandish herculeslike the divine broom and shovel and turn running water in upon the place and say as with a fiat here shall be truth and real work and talent to do it henceforth i will seek for able men to work here as for the elixir of life to this poor place and mewhat might not one such man effect there  nay one such is not to be dispensed with anywhere in the affairs of men in every ship i say there must be a seeing pilot not a mere hearing one it is evident you can never get your ship steered through the difficult straits by persons standing ashore on this bank and that and shouting their confused directions to you ware that colonial sandbankstarboard now the nigger questionlarboard larboard the suffrage movement financial reform your clothingcolonels overboard the qualification movement warererehelmalee bear a hand there will you hrrr lubbers imbeciles fitter for a tailors shopboard than a helm of government hrrrand so the ship wriggles and tumbles and on the whole goes as wind and current drive no ship was ever steered except to destruction in that manner i deliberately say so no ship of a state either if you cannot get a real pilot on board and put the helm into his hands your ship is as good as a wreck one real pilot on board may save you all the bellowing from the banks that ever was will not and by the nature of things cannot nay your pilot will have to succeed if he do succeed very much in spite of said bellowing he will hear all that and regard very little of itin a patient mildspoken wise manner will regard all of it as what it is and i never doubt but there is in parliament itself in spite of its vague palaverings which fill us with despair in these times a dumb instinct of inarticulate sense and stubborn practical english insight and veracity that would manfully support a statesman who could take command with really manful notions of reform and as one deserving to be obeyed oh for one such even one more precious to us than all the bullion in the bank or perhaps that ever was in it just now  for it is wisdom alone that can recognize wisdom folly or imbecility never can and that is the fatalest ban it labors under dooming it to perpetual failure in all things failure which in downing street and places of command is especially accursed cursing not one but hundreds of millions who is there that can recognize real intellect and do reverence to it and discriminate it well from sham intellect which is so much more abundant and deserves the reverse of reverence he that himself has itone really human intellect invested with command and charged to reform downing street for us would continually attract real intellect to those regions and with a divine magnetism search it out from the modest corners where it lies hid and every new accession of intellect to downing street would bring to it benefit only and would increase such divine attraction in it the parent of all benefit there and elsewhere   what method then by what method ask many method alas to secure an increased supply of human intellect to downing street there will evidently be no quite effectual method but that of increasing the supply of human intellect otherwise definable as human worth in society generally increasing the supply of sacred reverence for it of loyalty to it and of lifeanddeath desire and pursuit of it among all classesif we but knew such a method alas that were simply the method of making all classes servants of heaven and except it be devout prayer to heaven i have never heard of any method to increase the reverence for human intellect or gods light and the detestation of human stupidity or the devils darkness what method is there no methodexcept even this that we should each of us pray for it instead of praying for mere scrip and the like that heaven would please to vouchsafe us each a little of it one by one as perhaps heaven in its infinite bounty by stern methods gradually will perhaps heaven has mercy too in these sore plagues that are oppressing us and means to teach us reverence for heroism and human intellect by such baleful experience of what issue imbecility and parliamentary eloquence lead to such reverence i do hope and even discover and observe is silently yet extensively going on among us even in these sad years in which small salutary fact there burns for us in this black coil of universal baseness fast becoming universal wretchedness an inextinguishable hope faroff but sure a divine pillar of fire by night courage courage  meanwhile that our one reforming statesman may have free command of what intellect there is among us and room to try all means for awakening and inviting ever more of it there has one small project of improvement been suggested which finds a certain degree of favor wherever i hear it talked of and which seems to merit much more consideration than it has yet received practical men themselves approve of it hitherto so far as it goes the one objection being that the world is not yet prepared to insist on itwhich of course the world can never be till once the world consider it and in the first place hear tell of it i have for my own part a good opinion of this project the old unreformed parliament of rotten boroughs had one advantage but that is hereby in a far more fruitful and effectual manner secured to the new  the proposal is that secretaries under and upper that all manner of changeable or permanent servants in the government offices shall be selected without reference to their power of getting into parliamentthat in short the queen shall have power of nominating the halfdozen or halfscore officers of the administration whose presence is thought necessary in parliament to official seats there without reference to any constituency but her own only which of course will mean her prime ministers a very small encroachment on the present constitution of parliament offering the minimum of change in present methods and i almost think a maximum in results to be derived therefromthe queen nominates john thomas the fittest man she much inquiring can hear tell of in her three kingdoms president of the poorlaw board under secretary of the colonies under or perhaps even upper secretary of what she and her premier find suitablest for a working head so eminent a talent so precious and grants him by her direct authority seat and vote in parliament so long as he holds that office upper secretaries having more to do in parliament and being so bound to be in favor there would i suppose at least till new times and habits come be expected to be chosen from among the peoples members as at present but whether the prime minister himself is in all times bound to be first a peoples member and which or how many of his secretaries and subordinates he might be allowed to take as queens members my authority does not sayperhaps has not himself settled the project being yet in mere outline or foreshadow the practical embodiment in all details to be fixed by authorities much more competent than he the soul of his project is that the crown also have power to elect a few members to parliament  from which project however wisely it were embodied there could probably at first or all at once no great accession of intellect to the government offices ensue though a little might even at first and a little is always precious but in its ulterior operation were that faithfully developed and wisely presided over i fancy an immense accession of intellect might ensuenay a natural ingress might thereby be opened to all manner of accessions and the actual flower of whatever intellect the british nation had might be attracted towards downing street and continue flowing steadily thither for let us see a little what effects this simple change carries in it the possibilities of here are beneficent germs which the presence of one truly wise man as chief minister steadily fostering them for even a few years with the sacred fidelity and vigilance that would beseem him might ripen into living practices and habitual facts invaluable to us all  what it is that secretaries of state managers of colonial establishments of home and foreign government interests have really and truly to do in parliament might admit of various estimate in these times an apt debater in parliament is by no means certain to be an able administrator of colonies of home or foreign affairs nay rather quite the contrary is to be presumed of him for in order to become a brilliant speaker if that is his character considerable portions of his natural internal endowment must have gone to the surface in order to make a shining figure there and precisely so much the less few men in these days know how much less must remain available in the internal silent state or as faculty for thinking for devising and acting which latter and which alone is the function essential for him in his secretaryship not to tell a good story for himself in parliament and to the twentyseven millions many of them fools not that but to do good administration to know with sure eye and decide with just and resolute heart what is what in the things committed to his charge this and not that is the service which poor england whatever it may think and maunder does require and want of the official man in downing street given a good official man or secretary he really ought as far as it is possible to be left working in the silent state no mortal can both work and do good talking in parliament or out of it the feat is impossible as that of serving two hostile masters  nor would i if it could be helped much trouble my good secretary with addressing parliament needful explanations yes in a free country surelybut not to every frivolous and vexatious person in or out of parliament who chooses to apply for them there should be demands for explanation too which were reckoned frivolous and vexatious and censured as such these i should say are the not needful explanations and if my poor secretary is to be called out from his workshop to answer every one of thesehis workshop will become what we at present see it deservedly or not little other than a pillory the poor secretary a kind of talkingmachine exposed to dead cats and rotten eggs and the work got out of him or of it will as heretofore be very inconsiderable indeedalas on this side also important improvements are conceivable and will even i imagine get them whence we may be found indispensable one day the honorable gentleman whom you interrupt here he in his official capacity is not an individual now but the embodiment of a nation he is the people of england engaged in the work of secretaryship this one and cannot forever afford to let the three tailors of tooley street break in upon him at all hours  but leaving this let us remark one thing which is very plain that whatever be the uses and duties real or supposed of a secretary in parliament his faculty to accomplish these is a point entirely unconnected with his ability to get elected into parliament and has no relation or proportion to it and no concern with it whatever lord tommy and the honorable john are not a whit better qualified for parliamentary duties to say nothing of secretary duties than plain tom and jack they are merely better qualified as matters stand for getting admitted to try them which state of matters a reforming premier much in want of abler men to help him now proposes altering tom and jack once admitted by the queens writ there is every reason to suppose will do quite as well there as lord tommy and the honorable john in parliament quite as well and elsewhere in the other infinitely more important duties of a government office which indeed are and remain the essential vital and intrinsic duties of such a personage is there the faintest reason to surmise that tom and jack if well chosen will fall short of lord tommy and the honorable john no shadow of a reason were the intrinsic genius of the men exactly equal there is no shadow of a reason but rather there is quite the reverse for tom and jack have been at least workers all their days not idlers gamepreservers and mere human clotheshorses at any period of their lives and have gained a schooling thereby of which lord tommy and the honorable john unhappily strangers to it for most part can form no conception tom and jack have already on this most narrow hypothesis a decided superiority of likelihood over lord tommy and the honorable john  but the hypothesis is very narrow and the fact is very wide the hypothesis counts by units the fact by millions consider how many toms and jacks there are to choose from well or ill the aristocratic class from whom members of parliament can be elected extends only to certain thousands from these you are to choose your secretary if a seat in parliament is the primary condition but the general population is of twentyseven millions from all sections of which you can choose if the seat in parliament is not to be primary make it ultimate instead of primary a last investiture instead of a first indispensable condition and the whole british nation learned unlearned professional practical speculative and miscellaneous is at your disposal in the lowest broad strata of the population equally as in the highest and narrowest are produced men of every kind of genius man for man your chance of genius is as good among the millions as among the unitsand class for class what must it be from all classes not from certain hundreds now but from several millions whatsoever man the gods had gifted with intellect and nobleness and power to help his country could be chosen o heavens couldif not by tenpound constituencies and the force of beer then by a reforming premier with eyes in his head who i think might do it quite infinitely better infinitely better for ignobleness cannot by the nature of it choose the noble no there needs a seeing man who is himself noble cognizant by internal experience of the symptoms of nobleness shall we never think of this shall we never more remember this then it is forever true and nature and fact however we may rattle our ballotboxes do at no time forget it  from the lowest and broadest stratum of society where the births are by the million there was born almost in our own memory a robert burns son of one who had not capital for his poor moorfarm of twenty pounds a year robert burns never had the smallest chance to got into parliament much as robert burns deserved for all our sakes to have been found there for the manit was not known to men purblind sunk in their poor dim vulgar element but might have been known to men of insight who had any loyalty or any royalty of their ownwas a born king of men full of valor of intelligence and heroic nobleness fit for far other work than to break his heart among poor mean mortals gauging beer him no tenpound constituency chose nor did any reforming premier in the deepsunk british nation overwhelmed in foggy stupor with the loadstars all gone out for it there was no whisper of a notion that it could be desirable to choose himexcept to come and dine with you and in the interim to gauge and yet heavenborn mr pitt at that period was by no means without need of heroic intellect for other purposes than gauging but sorrowful strangulation by redtape much tighter then than it now is when so many revolutionary earthquakes have tussled it quite tied up the meagre pitt and he said on hearing of this burns and his sad hampered case literature will take care of itselfyes and of you too if you dont mind it answers one  and so like apollo taken for a neatherd and perhaps for none of the best on the admetus establishment this new norse thor had to put up with what was going to gauge ale and be thankful pouring his celestial sunlight through scottish songwritingthe narrowest chink ever offered to a thundergod before and the meagre pitt and his dundasses and redtape phantasms growing very ghastly now to think of did not in the least know or understand the impious godforgetting mortals that heroic intellects if heaven were pleased to send such were the one salvation for the world and for them and all of us no they had done very well without such did not see the use of such went along very well without such well presided over by a singular heroic intellect called george the third and the thundergod as was rather fit of him departed early still in the noon of life somewhat weary of gauging aleo peter what a scandalous torpid element of yellow london fog favorable to owls only and their mousing operations has blotted out the stars of heaven for us these several generations backwhich i rejoice to see is now visibly about to take itself away again or perhaps to be dispelled in a very tremendous manner   for the sake of my democratic friends one other observation is not this proposal the very essence of whatever truth there is in democracy this that the able man be chosen in whatever rank be is found that he be searched for as hidden treasure is be trained supervised set to the work which he alone is fit for all democracy lies in this this i think is worth all the ballotboxes and suffragemovements now going not that the noble soul born poor should be set to spout in parliament but that he should be set to assist in governing men this is our grand democratic interest with this we can be saved without this were there a parliament spouting in every parish and hansard debates to stem the thames we perishdie constitutionally drowned in mere oceans of palaver  all reformers constitutional persons and men capable of reflection are invited to reflect on these things let us brush the cobwebs from our eyes let us bid the inane traditions be silent for a moment and ask ourselves like men dreadfully intent on having it done by what method or methods can the able men from every rank of life be gathered as diamondgrains from the general mass of sand the able men not the shamableand set to do the work of governing contriving administering and guiding for us it is the question of questions all that democracy ever meant lies there the attainment of a truer and truer aristocracy or government again by the best  reformed parliaments have lamentably failed to attain it for us and i believe will and must forever fail one true reforming statesman one noble worshipper and knower of human intellect with the quality of an experienced politician too he backed by such a parliament as england once recognizing him would loyally send and at liberty to choose his working subalterns from all the englishmen alive he surely might do something something by one means or another is becoming fearfully necessary to be done he i think might accomplish more for us in ten years than the best conceivable reformed parliament and utmost extension of the suffrage in twice or ten times ten  what is extremely important too you could try this method with safety extension of the suffrage you cannot so try with even an approximately heroic prime minister you could get nothing but good from prescribing to him thus to choose the fittest man under penalties to choose not the fittest of the four or the three men that were in parliament but the fittest from the whole twentyseven millions that he could hear ofat his peril nothing but good from this from extension of the suffrage some think you might get quite other than good from extension of the suffrage till it became a universal counting of heads one sees not in the least what wisdom could be extracted a parliament of the paris pattern such as we see just now might be extracted and from that solution into universal slush drownage of all interests divine and human in a noahsdeluge of parliamentary eloquencesuch as we hope our sins heavy and manifold though they are have not yet quite deserved   who then is to be the reforming statesman and begin the noble work for us he is the preliminary one such with him we may prosecute the enterprise to length after length without him we cannot stir in it at all a true king temporary king that dare undertake the government of britain on condition of beginning in sacred earnest to reform it not at this or that extremity but at the heart and centre that will expurgate downing street and the practical administration of our affairs clear out its accumulated mountains of pendantries and cobwebs bid the pedants and the dullards depart bid the gifted and the seeing enter and inhabit so that henceforth there be heavenly light there instead of stygian dusk that gods vivifying light instead of satans deadening and killing dusk may radiate therefrom and visit with healing all regions of this british empirewhich now writhes through every limb of it in dire agony as if of death the enterprise is great the enterprise may be called formidable and even awful but there is none nobler among the sublunary affairs of mankind just now nay tacitly it is the enterprise of every man who undertakes to be british premier in these timesand i cannot esteem him an enviable premier who because the engagement is tacit flatters himself that it does not exist show it me in the bond he says your lordship it actually exists and i think you will see it yet in another kind of bond than that sheepskin one   but truly in any time what a strange feeling enough to alarm a very big lordship this that he of the size he is has got to the apex of english affairs smallest wrens we know by training and the aid of machinery are capable of many things for this world abounds in miraculous combinations far transcending anything they do at drury lane in the melodramatic way a world which as solid as it looks is made all of aerial and even of spiritual stuff permeated all by incalculable sleeping forces and electricities and liable to go off at any time into the hugest developments upon a scratch thoughtfully or thoughtlessly given on the right pointnay for every one of us could not the sputter of a poor pistolshot shrivel the immensities together like a burnt scroll and make the heavens and the earth pass away with a great noise smallest wrens and canarybirds of some dexterity can be trained to handle lucifermatches and have before now fired off whole powdermagazines and parks of artillery perhaps without much astonishment to the canarybird the canarybird can hold only its own quantity of astonishment and may possibly enough retain its presence of mind were even doomsday to come it is on this principle that i explain to myself the equanimity of some men and premiers whom we have known  this and the other premier seems to take it with perfect coolness and yet i say what a strange feeling to find himself chief governor of england girding on upon his moderately sized new soul the old battleharness of an oliver cromwell an edward longshanks a william conqueror i then am the ablest of english attainable men this english people which has spread itself over all lands and seas and achieved such works in the ageswhich has done america india the lancashire cottontrade bromwicham irontrade newtons principia shakspeares dramas and the british constitutionthe apex of all its intelligences and mighty instincts and dumb longings it is i william conquerors big gifts and edwards and elizabeths olivers lightning soul noble as sinai and the

arkwrights brindleys touches too of the phoenixmelodies and sunny heroisms of our shakspeares of our singers sages and inspired thinkers all this is in me i will hopethough rather shy of exhibiting it on common occasions the pattern englishman raised by solemn acclamation upon the bucklers of the english people and saluted with universal god save theehas now the honor to announce himself after fifteen hundred years of constitutional study as to methods of raising on the bucklers which is the operation of operations the english people surely pretty well skilled in it by this time has raisedthe remarkable individual now addressing you the bestcombined sample of whatsoever divine qualities are in this big people the consummate flower of all that they have done and been the ultimate product of the destinies and english man of men arrived at last in the fulness of time iswho think you ye worlds the ithuriel javelin by which with all these heroisms and accumulated energies old and new the english people means to smite and pierce is this poor tailorsbodkin hardly adequate to bore an eylethole who now has the honor togood heavens if it were not that men generally are very much of the canarybird here are reflections sufficient to annihilate any man almost before starting  but to us also it ought to be a very strange reflection this then is the length we have brought it to with our constitutioning and ballotboxing and incessant talk and effort in every kind for so many centuries back this the golden flower of our grand alchemical projection which has set the world in astonishment so long and been the envy of surrounding nations iswhat we here see to be governed by his lordship and guided through the undiscovered paths of time by this respectable degree of human faculty with our utmost souls travail we could discover by the sublimest methods eulogized by all the world no abler englishman than this  really it should make us pause upon the said sublime methods and ask ourselves very seriously whether notwithstanding the eulogy of all the world they can be other than extremely astonishing methods that require revisal and reconsideration very much indeed for the kind of man we get to govern us all conclusions whatsoever centre there and likewise all manner of issues flow infallibly therefrom ask well who is your chief governor says one for around him men like to him will infallibly gather and by degrees all the world will be made in his image he who is himself a noble man has a chance to know the nobleness of men he who is not has none and as for the poor publicalas is not the kind of man you set upon it the liveliest symbol of its and your veracity and victory and blessedness or unveracity and misery and cursedness the general summation and practical outcome of all else whatsoever in the public and in you  time was when an incompetent governor could not be permitted among men he was and had to be by one method or the other clutched up from his place at the helm of affairs and hurled down into the hold perhaps even overboard if he could not really steer and we call those ages barbarous because they shuddered to see a phantasm at the helm of their affairs an eyeless pilot with constitutional spectacles steering by the ear mainly and we have changed all that nogovernment is now the best and a tailors foreman who gives no trouble is preferable to any other for governing my friends such truly is the current idea but you dreadfully mistake yourselves and the fact is not such the fact now beginning to disclose itself again in distressed needlewomen famishing connaughts revolting colonies and a general rapid advance towards social ruin remains really what it always was and will so remain  men have very much forgotten it at present and only here a man and there a man begins again to bethink himself of it but all men will gradually get reminded of it perhaps terribly to their cost and the sooner they all lay it to heart again i think it will be the better for in spite of our oblivion of it the thing remains forever true nor is there any constitution or body of constitutions were they clothed with never such venerabilities and general acceptabilities that avails to deliver a nation from the consequences of forgetting it nature i assure you does forevermore remember it and a hundred british constitutions are but as a hundred cobwebs between her and the penalty she levies for forgetting it tell me what kind of man governs a people you tell me with much exactness what the net sumtotal of social worth in that people has for some time been whether they have loved the phylacteries or the eternal noblenesses whether they have been struggling heavenward like eagles brothers of the radiances or groping owllike with horneyed diligence catching mice and balances at their bankerspoor devils you will see it all in that one fact a fact long prepared beforehand which if it is a peaceably received one must have been acquiesced in judged to be best by the poor mousing owls intent only to have a large balance at their bankers and keep a whole skin  such sordid populations which were long blind to heavens light are getting themselves burnt up rapidly in these days by streetinsurrection and hellfireas is indeed inevitable my esteemed mcroudy light accept the blessed light if you will have it when heaven vouchsafes you refuse you prefer delolme on the british constitution the gospel according to mcroudy and a good balance at your bankers very well the light is more and more withdrawn and for some time you have a general dusk very favorable for catching mice and the opulent owlery is very happy and welloff at its bankersand furthermore by due sequence infallible as the foundations of the universe and natures oldest law the light returns on you condensed this time into lightning which there is not any skin whatever too thick for taking in     no iv the new downing street april 15 1850  in looking at this wreck of governments in all european countries there is one consideration that suggests itself sadly elucidative of our modern epoch these governments we may be well assured have gone to anarchy for this one reason inclusive of every other whatsoever that they were not wise enough that the spiritual talent embarked in them the virtue heroism intellect or by whatever other synonyms we designate it was not adequateprobably had long been inadequate and so in its dim helplessness had suffered or perhaps invited falsity to introduce itself had suffered injustices and solecisms and contradictions of the divine fact to accumulate in more than tolerable measure whereupon said governments were overset and declared before all creatures to be too false  this is a reflection sad but important to the modern governments now fallen anarchic that they had not spiritual talent enough and if this is so then surely the question how these governments came to sink for want of intellect is a rather interesting one intellect in some measure is born into every century and the nineteenth flatters itself that it is rather distinguished that way what had become of this celebrated nineteenth centurys intellect surely some of it existed and was developed withalnay in the undeveloped unconscious or inarticulate state it is not dead but alive and at work if mutely not less beneficently some think even more so and yet governments it would appear could by no means get enough of it almost none of it came their way what had become of it truly there must be something very questionable either in the intellect of this celebrated century or in the methods governments now have of supplying their wants from the same one or other of two grand fundamental shortcomings in regard to intellect or human enlightenment is very visible in this enlightened century of ours for it has now become the most anarchic of centuries that is to say has fallen practically into such egyptian darkness that it cannot grope its way at all  nay i rather think both of these shortcomings fatal deficits both are chargeable upon us and it is the joint harvest of both that we are now reaping with such havoc to our affairs i rather guess the intellect of the nineteenth century so full of miracle to heavyside and others is itself a mechanical or beaver intellect rather than a high or eminently human one a dim and mean though authentic kind of intellect this venerable only in defect of better this kind will avail but little in the higher enterprises of human intellect especially in that highest enterprise of guiding men heavenward which after all is the one real governing of them on this godsearthan enterprise not to be achieved by beaver intellect but by other higher and highest kinds this is deficit first and then secondly governments have really to a fatal and extraordinary extent neglected in late ages to supply themselves with what intellect was going having as was too natural in the dim time taken up a notion that human intellect or even beaver intellect was not necessary to them at all but that a little of the vulpine sort if attainable supported by routine redtape traditions and tolerable parliamentary eloquence on occasion would very well suffice a most false and impious notion leading to fatal lethargy on the part of governments while nature and fact were preparing strange phenomena in contradiction to it  these are two very fatal deficitsthe remedy of either of which would be the remedy of both could we but find it for indeed they are vitally connected one of them is sure to produce the other and both once in action together the advent of darkness certain enough to issue in anarchy by and by goes on with frightful acceleration if governments neglect to invite what noble intellect there is then too surely all intellect not omnipotent to resist bad influences will tend to become beaverish ignoble intellect and quitting high aims which seem shut up from it will help itself forward in the way of making money and such like or will even sink to be sham intellect helping itself by methods which are not only beaverish but vulpine and so ignoble as not to have common honesty the government taking no thought to choose intellect for itself will gradually find that there is less and less of a good quality to choose from thus as in all impieties it does bad grows worse at a frightful double rate of progression and your impiety is twice cursed if you are impious enough to tolerate darkness you will get ever more darkness to tolerate and at that inevitable stage of the account inevitable in all such accounts when actual light or else destruction is the alternative you will call to the heavens and the earth for light and none will come  certainly this evil for one has not wrought its own cure but has wrought precisely the reverse and has been hourly eating away what possibilities of cure there were and so i fear in spite of rumors to the contrary it always is with evils with solecisms against nature and contradictions to the divine fact of things not an evil of them has ever wrought its own cure in my experiencebut has continually grown worse and wider and uglier till some good generally a good man not able to endure the abomination longer rose upon it and cured or else extinguished it evil governments divested of gods light because they have loved darkness rather are not likelier than other evils to work their own cure out of that bad plight  it is urgent upon all governments to pause in this fatal course persisted in the goal is fearfully evident every hours persistence in it is making return more difficult intellect exists in all countries and the function appointed it by heavengovernments had better not attempt to contradict that for they cannot intellect has to govern in this world and will do it if not in alliance with socalled governments of redtape and routine then in divine hostility to such and sometimes alas in diabolic hostility to such and in the end as sure as heaven is higher than downing street and the laws of nature are tougher than redtape with entire victory over them and entire ruin to them if there is one thinking man among the politicians of england i consider these things extremely well worth his attention just now   who are available to your offices in downing street all the gifted souls of every rank who are born to you in this generation these are appointed by the true eternal divine right which will never become obsolete to be your governors and administrators and precisely as you employ them or neglect to employ them will your state be favored of heaven or disfavored this noble young soul you can have him on either of two conditions and on one of them since he is here in the world you must have him as your ally and coadjutor or failing that as your natural enemy which shall it be i consider that every government convicts itself of infatuation and futility or absolves and justifies itself before god and man according as it answers this question with all sublunary entities this is the question of questions what talent is born to you how do you employ that the crop of spiritual talent that is born to you of human nobleness and intellect and heroic faculty this is infinitely more important than your crops of cotton or corn or wine or herrings or whaleoil which the newspapers record with such anxiety every season this is not quite counted by seasons therefore the newspapers are silent but by generations and centuries i assure you it becomes amazingly sensible and surpasses as heaven does earth all the corn and wine and whaleoil and california bullion or any other crop you grow if that crop cease the other cropsplease to take them also if you are anxious about them that once ceasing we may shut shop for no other crop whatever will stay with us nor is worth having if it would  to promote men of talent to search and sift the whole society in every class for men of talent and joyfully promote them has not always been found impossible in many forms of polity they have done it and still do it to a certain degree the degree to which they succeed in doing it marks as i have said with very great accuracy the degree of divine and human worth that is in them the degree of success or real ultimate victory they can expect to have in this worldthink for example of the old catholic church in its merely terrestrial relations to the state and see if your reflections and contrasts with what now is are of an exulting character progress of the species has gone on as with sevenleague boots and in various directions has shot ahead amazingly with three cheers from all the world but in this direction the most vital and indispensable it has lagged terribly and has even moved backward till now it is quite gone out of sight in clouds of cottonfuzz and railwayscrip and has fallen fairly over the horizon to rearward  in those most benighted feudal societies full of mere tyrannous steel barons and totally destitute of tenpound franchises and ballotboxes there did nevertheless authentically preach itself everywhere this grandest of gospels without which no other gospel can avail us much to all souls of men awake ye noble souls here is a noble career for you i say everywhere a road towards promotion for human nobleness lay wide open to all men the pious soulwhich if you reflect will mean the ingenuous and ingenious the gifted intelligent and noblyaspiring soulsuch a soul in whatever rank of life it were born had one path inviting it a generous career whereon by human worth and valor all earthly heights and heaven itself were attainable in the lowest stratum of social thraldom nowhere was the noble soul doomed quite to choke and die ignobly the church poor old benighted creature had at least taken care of that the noble aspiring soul not doomed to choke ignobly in its penuries could at least run into the neighboring convent and there take refuge education awaited it there strict training not only to whatever useful knowledge could be had from writing and reading but to obedience to pious reverence selfrestraint annihilation of selfreally to human nobleness in many most essential respects no questions asked about your birth genealogy quantity of moneycapital or the like the one question was is there some human nobleness in you or is there not the poor neatherds son if he were a noble of nature might rise to priesthood to highpriesthood to the top of this worldand best of all he had still high heaven lying high enough above him to keep his head steady on whatever height or in whatever depth his way might lie  a thriceglorious arrangement when i reflect on it most salutary to all high and low interests a truly human arrangement you made the born noble yours welcoming him as what he was the sent of heaven you did not force him either to die or become your enemy idly neglecting or suppressing him as what he was not a thing of no worth you accepted the blessed light and in the shape of infernal lightning it needed not to visit you how like an immense mineshaft through the dim oppressed strata of society this institution of the priesthood ran opening from the lowest depths towards all heights and towards heaven itself a free road of egress and emergence towards virtuous nobleness heroism and welldoing for every born man this we may call the living lungs and bloodcirculation of those old feudalisms when i think of that immeasurable allpervading lungs present in every corner of human society every meanest hut a cell of said lungs inviting whatsoever noble pious soul was born there to the path that was noble for him and leading thereby sometimes if he were worthy to be the papa of christendom and commander of all kingsi perceive how the old christian society continued healthy vital and was strong and heroic when i contrast this with the noble aims now held out to noble souls born in remote huts or beyond the verge of palaceyard and think of what your lordship has done in the way of making priests and papasi see a society without lungs fast wheezing itself to death in horrid convulsions and deserving to die  over europe generally in these years i consider that the state has died has fairly coughed its last in street musketry and fallen down dead incapable of any but galvanic life henceforthowing to this same fatal want of lungs which includes all other wants for a state and furthermore that it will never come alive again till it contrive to get such indispensable vital apparatus the outlook toward which consummation is very distant in most communities of europe if you let it come to death or suspended animation in states the case is very bad vain to call in universalsuffrage parliaments at that stage the universalsuffrage parliaments cannot give you any breath of life cannot find any wisdom for you by long impiety you have let the supply of noble human wisdom die out and the wisdom that now courts your universal suffrages is beggarly human attorneyism or shamwisdom which is not an insight into the laws of gods universe but into the laws of hungry egoism and the devils chicane and can in the end profit no community or man  no the kind of heroes that come mounted on the shoulders of the universal suffrage and install themselves as prime ministers and healing statesmen by force of able editorship do not bid very fair to bring nations back to the ways of god eloquent highlacquered pinchbeck specimens these expert in the arts of belial mainlyfitter to be markers at some exceedingly expensive billiardtable than sacred chiefpriests of men greeks of the lower empire with a varnish of parliamentary rhetoric and i suppose this other great gift toughness of characterproof that they have persevered in their masters service poor wretches their industry is mobworship placeworship parliamentary intrigue and the multiplex art of tonguefence flung into that bad element there they swim for decades long throttling and wrestling one another according to their strengthand the toughest or luckiest gets to land and becomes premier a more entirely unbeautiful class of premiers was never raked out of the ooze and set on high places by any ingenuity of man dame dubarrys petticoat was a better seinenet for fishing out premiers than that let all nations whom necessity is driving towards that method take warning in time  alas there is in a manner but one nation that can still take warning in england alone of european countries the state yet survives and might help itself by better methods in england heroic wisdom is not yet dead and quite replaced by attorneyism the honest beaver faculty yet abounds with us the heroic manful faculty shows itself also to the observant eye not dead but dangerously sleeping i said there were many kings in england if these can yet be rallied into strenuous activity and set to govern england in downing street and elsewhere which their function always isthen england can be saved from anarchies and universal suffrages and that apotheosis of attorneyism blackest of terrestrial curses may be spared us if these cannot the other issue in such forms as may be appropriate to us is inevitable what escape is there england must conform to the eternal laws of life or england too must die  england with the largest mass of real living interests ever intrusted to a nation and with a mass of extinct imaginary and quite dead interests piled upon it to the very heavens and encumbering it from shore to shoredoes reel and stagger ominously in these years urged by the divine silences and the eternal laws to take practical hold of its living interests and manage them and clutching blindly into its venerable extinct and imaginary interests as if that were still the way to do it england must contrive to manage its living interests and quit its dead ones and their methods or else depart from its place in this world surely england is called as no nation ever was to summon out its kings and set them to that high workhuge inorganic england nigh choked under the exuviae of a thousand years and blindly sprawling amid chartisms ballotboxes prevenient graces and bishops nightmares must as the preliminary and commencement of organization learn to breathe againget lungs for herself again as we defined it that is imperative upon her she too will die otherwise and cough her last upon the streets some dayhow can she continue living to enfranchise whatsoever of wisdom is born in england and set that to the sacred task of coercing and amending what of folly is born in england heavens blessing is purchasable by that by not that only heavens curse is purchasable the reform contemplated my liberal friends perceive is a truly radical one no ballotbox ever went so deep into the roots a radical most painful slow and difficult but most indispensable reform of reforms  how short and feeble an approximation to these high ulterior results the best reform of downing street presided over by the fittest statesman one can imagine to exist at present would be is too apparent to me a long time yet till we get our living interests put under due administration till we get our dead interests handsomely dismissed a long time yet till by extensive change of habit and ways of thinking and acting we get living lungs for ourselves nevertheless by reform of downing street we do begin to breathe we do start in the way towards that and all high results nor is there visible to me any other way blessed enough were the way once entered on could we in our evil days but see the noble enterprise begun and fairly in progress   what the new downing street can grow to and will and must if england is to have a downing street beyond a few years longer it is far from me in my remote watchtower to say with precision a downing street inhabited by the gifted of the intellects of england directing all its energies upon the real and living interests of england and silently but incessantly in the alembics of the place burning up the extinct imaginary interests of england that we may see gods sky a little plainer overhead and have all of us a great accession of heroic wisdom to dispose of such a downing streetto draw the plan of it will require architects many successive architects and builders will be needed there let not editors and remote unprofessional persons interfere too muchchange in the present edifice however radical change all men can discern to be inevitable and even if there shall not worse swiftly follow to be imminent outlines of the future edifice paint themselves against the sky to men that still have a sky and are above the miserable london fogs of the hour noble elements of new state architecture foreshadows of a new downing street for the new era that is come these with pious hope all men can see and it is good that all men with whatever faculty they have were earnestly looking thitherwardtrying to get above the fogs that they might look thitherward   among practical men the idea prevails that government can do nothing but keep the peace they say all higher tasks are unsafe for it impossible for itand in fine not necessary for it or for us on this footing a very feeble downing street might serve the turni am well aware that government for a long time past has taken in hand no other public task and has professed to have no other but that of keeping the peace this public task and the private one of ascertaining whether dick or jack was to do it have amply filled the capabilities of government for several generations now hard tasks both it would appear in accomplishing the first for example have not heavenborn chancellors of the exchequer had to shear us very bare and to leave an overplus of debt or of fleeces shorn before they are grown justly esteemed among the wonders of the world not a firstrate keeping of the peace this we begin to surmise at least it seems strange to us  for we and the overwhelming majority of all our acquaintances in this parish and nation and the adjacent parishes and nations are profoundly conscious to ourselves of being by nature peaceable persons following our necessary industries without wish interest or faintest intention to cut the skin of any mortal to break feloniously into his industrial premises or do any injustice to him at all because indeed independent of government there is a thing called conscience and we dare not so that it cannot but appear to us the peace under dexterous management might be very much more easily kept your lordship nay we almost think if well let alone it would in a measure keep itself among such a set of persons and how it happens that when a poor hardworking creature of us has laboriously earned sixpence the government comes in and as some compute says i will thank you for threepence of that as per account for getting you peace to spend the other threepence our amazement begins to be considerableand i think results will follow from it by and by not the most dexterous keeping of the peace your lordship unless it be more difficult to do than appears  our domestic peace we cannot but perceive as good as keeps itself here and there a select equitable person appointed by the public for that end clad in ermine and backed by certain companies of blue police is amply adequate without immoderate outlay in money or otherwise to keep down the few exceptional individuals of the scoundrel kind who we observe by the nature of them are always weak and inconsiderable and as to foreign peace really all europe now especially with so many railroads public journals printed books pennypost bills of exchange and continual intercourse and mutual dependence is more and more becoming so to speak one parish the parishioners of which being as we ourselves are in immense majority peaceable hardworking people could if they were moderately well guided have almost no disposition to quarrel their economic interests are one to buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest their faith any religious faith they have is one to annihilate shamsby all methods streetbarricades included why should they quarrel the czar of russia in the eastern parts of the parish may have other notions but he knows too well he must keep them to himself he if he meddled with the western parts and attempted anywhere to crush or disturb that sacred democratic faith of theirs is aware there would rise from a hundred and fifty million human throats such a hymn of the marseillaise as was never heard before and england france germany poland hungary and the nine kingdoms hurling themselves upon him in neverimagined fire of vengeance would swiftly reduce his russia and him to a strange situation wherefore he forbearsand being a person of some sense will long forbear in spite of editorial prophecy the czar of russia does not disturb our nights rest and with the other parts of the parish our dreams and our thoughts are of anything but of fighting or of the smallest need to fight  for keeping of the peace a thing highly desirable to us we strive to be grateful to your lordship intelligible to us also your lordships reluctance to get out of the old routine but we beg to say farther that peace by itself has no feet to stand upon and would not suit us even if it had keeping of the peace is the function of a policeman and but a small fraction of that of any government king or chief of men are not all men bound and the chief of men in the name of all to do properly this to see so far as human effort under pain of eternal reprobation can gods kingdom incessantly advancing here below and his will done on earth as it is in heaven on sundays your lordship knows this well forgot it not on weekdays i assure you it is forevermore a fact that is the immense divine and neverending task which is laid on every man and with unspeakable increase of emphasis on every government or commonwealth of men your lordship that is the basis upon which peace and all else depends that basis once well lost there is no peace capable of being keptthe only peace that could then be kept is that of the churchyard your lordship may depend on it whatever thing takes upon it the name of sovereign or government in an english nation such as this will have to get out of that old routine and set about keeping something very different from the peace in these days   truly it is high time that same beautiful notion of nogovernment should take itself away the world is daily rushing towards wreck while that lasts if your government is to be a constituted anarchy what issue can it have our one interest in such government is that it would be kind enough to cease and go its ways before the inevitable arrive the question who is to float atop nowhither upon the popular vertexes and act that sorry character carcass of the drowned ass upon the muddeluge is by no means an important one for almost anybodyhardly even for the drowned ass himself such drowned ass ought to ask himself if the function is a sublime one for him too though he looks sublime to the vulgar and floats atop a private situation down out of sight in his natural ooze would be a luckier one  crabbe speaking of constitutional philosophies faith in the ballotbox and such like has this indignant passage if any voice of deliverance or resuscitation reach us in this our low and all but lost estate sunk almost beyond plummets sounding in the mud of lethe and oblivious of all noble objects it will be an intimation that we must put away all this abominable nonsense and understand once more that constituted anarchy with however many ballotboxes caucuses and hustings beerbarrels is a continual offence to gods and men that to be governed by small men is not only a misfortune but it is a curse and a sin the effect and alas the cause also of all manner of curses and sins that to profess subjection to phantasms and pretend to accept guidance from fractional parts of tailors is what smelfungus in his rude dialect calls it a damned lie and nothing other a lie which by long use and wont we have grown accustomed to and do not the least feel to be a lie having spoken and done it continually everywhere for such a long time pastbut has nature grown to accept it as a veracity think you my friend have the parcae fallen asleep because you wanted to make money in the city nature at all moments knows well that it is a lie and that like all lies it is cursed and damned from the beginning  even so ye indigent millionnaires and miserable bankrupt populations rolling in goldwhose noteofhand will go to any length in threadneedle street and to whom in heavens bank the stern answer is no effects bankrupt i say and californias and eldorados will not save us and every time we speak such lie or do it or look it as we have been incessantly doing and many of us with clear consciousness for about a hundred and fifty years now nature marks down the exact penalty against us debtor to so much lying forfeiture of existing stock of worth to such extentapproach to general damnation by so much till now as we look round us over a convulsed anarchic europe and at home over an anarchy not yet convulsed but only heaving towards convulsion and to judge by the mosaic sweatingestablishments cannibal connaughts and other symptoms not far from convulsion now we seem to have pretty much exhausted our accumulated stock of worth and unless moneys worth and bullion at the bank will save us to be rubbing very close upon that ulterior bourn which i do not like to name again  on behalf of nearly twentyseven millions of my fellowcountrymen sunk deep in lethean sleep with mere owldreams of political economy and micecatching in this pacific thriceinfernal slushelement and also of certain select thousands and hundreds and units awakened or beginning to awaken from it and with horror in their hearts perceiving where they are i beg to protest and in the name of god to say with poor human ink desirous much that i had divine thunder to say it with awake arisebefore you sink to death eternal unnamable destruction and banishment to houndsditch and gehenna lies in store for all nations that in angry perversity or brutal torpor and owlish blindness neglect the eternal message of the gods and vote for the worse while the better is there like owls they say barabbas will do any orthodox hebrew of the hebrews and peaceable believer in mcroudy and the faith of leavealone will do the right honorable minimus is well enough he shall be our maximus under him it will be handy to catch mice and owldom shall continue a flourishing empire   one thing is undeniable and must be continually repeated till it get to be understood again of all constitutions forms of government and political methods among men the question to be asked is even this what kind of man do you set over us all questions are answered in the answer to this another thing is worth attending to no people or populace with never such ballotboxes can select such man for you only the man of worth can recognize worth in mento the commonplace man of no or of little worth you unless you wish to be misled need not apply on such an occasion those poor tenpound franchisers of yours they are not even in earnest the poor sniffing sniggering honorable gentlemen they send to parliament are as little so tenpound franchisers full of mere beer and balderdash honorable gentlemen come to parliament as to an almacks series of evening parties or big cockmain battle of all the cocks very amusing to witness and bet upon what can or could men in that predicament ever do for you nay if they were in lifeanddeath earnest what could it avail you in such a case i tell you a million blockheads looking authoritatively into one man of what you call genius or noble sense will make nothing but nonsense out of him and his qualities and his virtues and defects if they look till the end of time he understands them sees what they are but that they should understand him and see with rounded outline what his limits arethis which would mean that they are bigger than he is forever denied them their one good understanding of him is that they at last should loyally say we do not quite understand thee we perceive thee to be nobler and wiser and bigger than we and will loyally follow thee  the question therefore arises whether since reform of parliament and such like have done so little in that respect the problem might not be with some hope attacked in the direct manner suppose all our institutions and public methods of procedure to continue for the present as they are and suppose farther a reform premier and the english nation once awakening under him to a due sense of the infinite importance nay the vital necessity there is of getting able and abler menmight not some heroic wisdom and actual ability to do what must be done prove discoverable to said premier and so the indispensable heavensblessing descend to us from above since none has yet sprung from below from above we shall have to try it the other is exhausteda hopeless method that the utmost passion of the houseinmates ignorant of masonry and architecture cannot avail to cure the house of smoke not if they vote and agitate forever and bestir themselves to the length even of streetbarricades will the smoke in the least abate how can it their passion exercised in such ways till doomsday will avail them nothing let their passion rage steadily against the existing majordomos to this effect find us men skilled in housebuilding acquainted with the laws of atmospheric suction and capable to cure smoke something might come of it in the lucky circumstance of having one man of real intellect and courage to put at the head of the movement much would come of ita new downing street fit for the british nation and its bitter necessities in this now era would come and from that in answer to continuous sacred fidelity and valiant toil all good whatsoever would gradually come  of the continental nuisance called bureaucracyif this should alarm any readeri can see no risk or possibility in england democracy is hot enough here fierce enough it is perennial universal clearly invincible among us henceforth no danger it should let itself be flung in chains by sham secretaries of the pedant species and accept their vile age of pinchbeck for its golden age democracy clamors with its newspapers its parliaments and all its twentyseven million throats continually in this nation forevermore i remark too that the unconscious purport of all its clamors is even this find us men skilledmake a new downing street fit for the new era   of the foreign office in its reformed state we have not much to say abolition of imaginary work and replacement of it by real is on all hands understood to be very urgent there large needless expenditures of money immeasurable ditto of hypocrisy and grimace embassies protocols worlds of extinct traditions empty pedantries foul cobwebsbut we will by no means apply the live coal of our witty friend the foreign office will repent and not be driven to suicide a truer time will come for the continental nations too authorities based on truth and on the silent or spoken worship of human nobleness will again get themselves established there all shamauthorities and consequent realanarchies based on universal suffrage and the gospel according to george sand being put away and noble action heroic newdevelopments of human faculty and industry and blessed fruit as of paradise getting itself conquered from the waste battlefield of the chaotic elements will once more there as here begin to show themselves  when the continental nations have once got to the bottom of their augean stable and begun to have real enterprises based on the eternal facts again our foreign office may again have extensive concerns with them and at all times and even now there will remain the question to be sincerely put and wisely answered what essential concern has the british nation with them and their enterprises any concern at all except that of handsomely keeping apart from them if so what are the methods of best managing itat present as was said while red republic but clashes with foul bureaucracy and nations sunk in blind ignavia demand a universalsuffrage parliament to heal their wretchedness and wild anarchy and phallusworship struggle with shamkingship and extinct or galvanized catholicism and in the cave of the winds all manner of rotten waifs and wrecks are hurled against each otherour english interest in the controversy however huge said controversy grow is quite trifling we have only in a handsome manner to say to it tumble and rage along ye rotten waifs and wrecks clash and collide as seems fittest to you and smite each other into annihilation at your own good pleasure in that huge conflict dismal but unavoidable we thanks to our heroic ancestors having got so far ahead of you have now no interest at all our decided notion is the dead ought to bury their dead in such a case and so we have the honor to be with distinguished consideration your entirely devotedflimnap sec foreign departmenti really think flimnap till truer times come ought to treat much of his work in this way cautious to give offence to his neighbors resolute not to concern himself in any of their selfannihilating operations whatsoever   foreign wars are sometimes unavoidable we ourselves in the course of natural merchandising and laudable business have now and then got into ambiguous situations into quarrels which needed to be settled and without fighting would not settle sugar islands spice islands indias canadas these by the real decree of heaven were ours and nobody would or could believe it till it was tried by cannon law and so proved such cases happen in former times especially owing very much to want of intercourse and to the consequent mutual ignorance there did occur misunderstandings and therefrom many foreign wars some of them by no means unnecessary with china or some distant country too unintelligent of us and too unintelligible to us there still sometimes rises necessary occasion for a war nevertheless warsmisunderstandings that get to the length of arguing themselves out by sword and cannonhave in these late generations of improved intercourse been palpably becoming less and less necessary have in a manner become superfluous if we had a little wisdom and our foreign office on a good footing  of european wars i really hardly remember any since oliver cromwells last protestant or liberation war with popish antichristian spain some two hundred years ago to which i for my own part could have contributed my life with any heartiness or in fact would have subscribed money itself to any considerable amount dutch william a man of some heroism did indeed get into troubles with louis fourteenth and there rested still some shadow of protestant interest and question of national and individual independence over those wide controversies a little money and human enthusiasm was still due to dutch william illustrious chatham also not to speak of his manilla ransoms and the like did one thing assisted fritz of prussia a brave man and king almost the only sovereign king i have known since cromwells time like to be borne down by ignoble men and shamkings for this let illustrious chatham too have a little money and human enthusiasma little by no means much but what am i to say of heavenborn pitt the son of chatham england sent forth her fleets and armies her money into every country money as if the heavenborn chancellor had got a fortunatus purse as if this island had become a volcanic fountain of gold or new terrestrial sun capable of radiating mere guineas the result of all which what was it elderly men can remember the tarbarrels burnt for success and thriceimmortal victory in the business and yet what result had we the french revolution a fact decreed in the eternal councils could not be put down the result was that heavenborn pitt had actually been fighting as the old hebrews would have said against the lordthat the laws of nature were stronger than pitt of whom therefore there remains chiefly his unaccountable radiation of guineas for the gratitude of posterity thank you for nothingfor eight hundred millions less than nothing   our war offices admiralties and other fighting establishments are forcing themselves on everybodys attention at this time bull grumbles audibly the money you have cost me these fiveandthirty years during which you have stood elaborately ready to fight at any moment without at any moment being called to fight is surely an astonishing sum the national debt itself might have been half paid by that money which has all gone in pipeclay and blank cartridges yes mr bull the money can be counted in hundreds of millions which certainly is somethingbut the strenuously organized idleness and what mischief that amounts tohave you computed it a perpetual solecism and blasphemy of its sort set to march openly among us dressed in scarlet bull with a more and more sulky tone demands that such solecism be abated that these fighting establishments be as it were disbanded and set to do some work in the creation since fighting there is now none for them this demand is irrefragably just is growing urgent too and yet this demand cannot be complied withnot yet while the state grounds itself on unrealities and downing street continues what it is  the old romans made their soldiers work during intervals of war the new downing street too we may predict will have less and less tolerance for idleness on the part of soldiers or others nay the new downing street i foresee when once it has got its industrial regiments organized will make these mainly do its fighting what fighting there is and so save immense sums or indeed all citizens of the commonwealth as is the right and the interest of every free man in this world will have themselves trained to arms each citizen ready to defend his country with his own body and soulhe is not worthy to have a country otherwise in a state grounded on veracities that would be the rule downing street if it cannot bethink itself of returning to the veracities will have to vanish altogether  to fight with its neighbors never was and is now less than ever the real trade of england for far other objects was the english people created into this world sent down from the eternities to mark with its history certain spaces in the current of sublunary time essential too that the english people should discover what its real objects are and resolutely follow these resolutely refusing to follow other than these the state will have victory so far as it can do that so far as it cannot defeat  in the new downing street discerning what its real functions are and with sacred abhorrence putting away from it what its functions are not we can fancy changes enough in foreign office war office colonial office home office our warsoldiers industrial first of all doing nobler than roman works when fighting is not wanted of them seventyfours not hanging idly by their anchors in the tagus or off sapienza one of the saddest sights under the sun but busy every seventyfour of them carrying over streams of british industrials to the immeasurable britain that lies beyond the sea in every zone of the world a state grounding itself on the veracities not on the semblances and the injustices every citizen a soldier for it here would be new real secretaryships and ministries not for foreign war and diplomacy but for domestic peace and utility minister of works minister of justiceclearing his model prisons of their scoundrelism shipping his scoundrels wholly abroad under hard and just drillsergeants hundreds of such stand wistfully ready for you these thirty years in the ragandfamish club and elsewhere into fertile desert countries to make railwaysone big railway says the major footnote major carmichael smith see his pamphlets on this subject quite across america fit to employ all the ablebodied scoundrels and efficient halfpay officers in nature  lastlyor rather firstly and as the preliminary of all would there not be a minister of education minister charged to get this english people taught a little at his and our peril minister of education no longer dolefully embayed amid the wreck of moribund religions but clear ahead of all that steering free and piously fearless towards his divine goal under the eternal starso heaven and are these things forever impossible then not a whit tomorrow morning they might all begin to be and go on through blessed centuries realizing themselves if it were not thatalas if it were not that we are most of us insincere persons sham talkingmachines and hollow windy fools which it is not impossible that we should cease to be i hope   constitutions for the colonies are now on the anvil the discontented colonies are all to be cured of their miseries by constitutions whether that will cure their miseries or only operate as a godfreyscordial to stop their whimpering and in the end worsen all their miseries may be a sad doubt to us one thing strikes a remote spectator in these colonial questions the singular placidity with which the british statesman at this time backed by mcroudy and the british moneyed classes is prepared to surrender whatsoever interest britain as foundress of those establishments might pretend to have in the decision if you want to go from us go we by no means want you to stay you cost us money yearly which is scarce desperate quantities of trouble too why not go if you wish it such is the humor of the british statesman at this timemen clear for rebellion annexation as they call it walk openly abroad in our american colonies found newspapers hold platform palaverings from canada there comes duly by each mail a regular statistic of annexationism increasing fast in this quarter diminishing in thatmajestys chief governor seeming to take it as a perfectly open question majestys chief governor in fact seldom appearing on the scene at all except to receive the impact of a few rotten eggs on occasion and then duck in again to his private contemplations and yet one would think the majestys chief governor ought to have a kind of interest in the thing public liberty is carried to a great length in some portions of her majestys dominions but the question are we to continue subjects of her majesty or start rebelling against her so many as are for rebelling hold up your hands here is a public discussion of a very extraordinary nature to be going on under the nose of a governor of canada how the governor of canada being a british piece of flesh and blood and not a canadian lumberlog of mere pine and rosin can stand it is not very conceivable at first view he does it seemingly with the stoicism of a zeno it is a constitutional sight like few  and yet an instinct deeper than the gospel of mcroudy teaches all men that colonies are worth something to a country that if under the present colonial office they are a vexation to us and themselves some other colonial office can and must be contrived which shall render them a blessing and that the remedy will be to contrive such a colonial office or method of administration and by no means to cut the colonies loose colonies are not to be picked off the street every day not a colony of them but has been bought dear well purchased by the toil and blood of those we have the honor to be sons of and we cannot just afford to cut them away because mcroudy finds the present management of them cost money the present management will indeed require to be cut awaybut as for the colonies we purpose through heavens blessing to retain them a while yet shame on us for unworthy sons of brave fathers if we do not brave fathers by valiant blood and sweat purchased for us from the bounty of heaven rich possessions in all zones and we wretched imbeciles cannot do the function of administering them and because the accounts do not stand well in the ledger our remedy is not to take shame to ourselves and repent in sackcloth and ashes and amend our beggarly imbecilities and insincerities in that as in other departments of our business but to fling the business overboard and declare the business itself to be bad we are a hopeful set of heirs to a big fortune it does not suit our manton gunneries grouseshootings mousings in the city and like spirited young gentlemen we will give it up and let the attorneys take it  is there no value then in human things but what can write itself down in the cashledger all men know and even mcroudy in his inarticulate heart knows that to men and nations there are invaluable values which cannot be sold for money at all george robins is great but he is not onmipotent george robins cannot quite sell heaven and earth by auction excellent though he be at the business nay if mcroudy offered his own life for sale in threadneedle street would anybody buy it not i for one nobody bids pass on to the next lot answers robins and yet to mcroudy this unsalable lot is worth all the universenay i believe to us also it is worth something good monitions as to several things do lie in this professor of the dismal science and considerable sums even of money not to speak of other benefit will yet come out of his life and him for which nobody bids robins has his own field where he reigns triumphant but to that we will restrict him with iron limits and neither colonies nor the lives of professors nor other such invaluable objects shall come under his hammer  bad state of the ledger will demonstrate that your way of dealing with your colonies is absurd and urgently in want of reform but to demonstrate that the empire itself must be dismembered to bring the ledger straight oh never something else than the ledger must intervene to do that why does not england repudiate ireland and insist on the repeal instead of prohibiting it under deathpenalties ireland has never been a paying speculation yet nor is it like soon to be why does not middlesex repudiate surrey and chelsea kensington and each county and each parish and in the end each individual set up for himself and his cashbox repudiating the other and his because their mutual interests have got into an irritating course they must change the course seek till they discover a soothing one that is the remedy when limbs of the same body come to irritate one another because the paltry tatter of a garment reticulated for you out of thrums and listings in downing street ties foot and hand together in an intolerable manner will you relieve yourself by cutting off the hand or the foot you will cut off the paltry tatter of a pretended bodycoat i think and fling that to the nettles and imperatively require one that fits your size better  miserabler theory than that of money on the ledger being the primary rule for empires or for any higher entity than city owls and their micecatching cannot well be propounded and i would by no means advise felicissimus ill at ease on his hightrotting and now justly impatient sleswicker to let the poor horse in its desperation go in that direction for a momentary solace if by lumberlog governors by godfreys cordial constitutions or otherwise be contrived to cut off the colonies or any real right the big british empire has in her colonies both he and the british empire will bitterly repent it one day the sleswicker relieved in ledger for a moment will find that it is wounded in heart and honor forever and the turning of its wild forehoofs upon felicissimus as he lies in the ditch combed off is not a thing i like to think of britain whether it be known to felicissimus or not has other tasks appointed her in gods universe than the making of money and woe will betide her if she forget those other withal tasks colonial and domestic which are of an eternally divine nature and compared with which all money and all that is procurable by money are in strict arithmetic an imponderable quantity have been assigned this nation and they also at last are coming upon her again clamorous abstruse inevitable much to her bewilderment just now  this poor nation painfully dark about said tasks and the way of doing them means to keep its colonies nevertheless as things which somehow or other must have a value were it better seen into they are portions of the general earth where the children of britain now dwell where the gods have so far sanctioned their endeavor as to say that they have a right to dwell england will not readily admit that her own children are worth nothing but to be flung out of doors england looking on her colonies can say here are lands and seas spicelands cornlands timberlands overarched by zodiacs and stars clasped by manysounding seas wide spaces of the makers building fit for the cradle yet of mighty nations and their sciences and heroisms fertile continents still inhabited by wild beasts are mine into which all the distressed populations of europe might pour themselves and make at once an old world and a new world human by the eternal fiat of the gods this must yet one day be this by all the divine silences that rule this universe silent to fools eloquent and awful to the hearts of the wise is incessantly at this moment and at all moments commanded to begin to be unspeakable deliverance and new destiny of thousandfold expanded manfulness for all men dawns out of the future here to me has fallen the godlike task of initiating all that of me and of my colonies the abstruse future asks are you wise enough for so sublime a destiny are you too foolish   that you ask advice of whatever wisdom is to be had in the colony and even take note of what unwisdom is in it and record that too as an existing fact will certainly be very advantageous but i suspect the kind of parliament that will suit a colony is much of a secret just now mr wakefield a democratic man in all fibres of him and acquainted with colonial socialities as few are judges that the franchise for your colonial parliament should be decidedly select and advises a high moneyqualification as there is in all colonies a fluctuating migratory mass not destitute of money but very much so of loyalty permanency or civic availability whom it is extremely advantageous not to consult on what you are about attempting for the colony or mother country this i can well believeand also that a high moneyqualification in the present sad state of human affairs might be some help to you in selecting though whether even that would quite certainly bring wisdom the one thing indispensable is much a question with me it might help it might help and if by any means you could which you cannot exclude the fourth estate and indicate decisively that wise advice was the thing wanted here and parliamentary eloquence was not the thing wanted anywhere just nowthere might really some light of experience and human foresight and a truly valuable benefit be found for you in such assemblies  and there is one thing too apt to be forgotten which it much behooves us to remember in the colonies as everywhere else in this world the vital point is not who decides but what is decided on that measures tending really to the best advantage temporal and spiritual of the colony be adopted and strenuously put in execution there lies the grand interest of every good citizen british and colonial such measures whosoever have originated and prescribed them will gradually be sanctioned by all men and gods and clamors of every kind in reference to them may safely to a great extent be neglected as clamorous merely and sure to be transient colonial governor colonial parliament whoever or whatever does an injustice or resolves on an unwisdom he is the pernicious object however parliamentary he be  i have known things done in this or the other colony in the most parliamentary way before now which carried written on the brow of them sad symptoms of eternal reprobation not to be mistaken had you painted an inch thick in montreal for example at this moment standing amid the ruins of the elgin marbles as they call the burnt walls of the parliament house there what rational british soul but is forced to institute the mournfulest constitutional reflection some years ago the canadas probably not without materials for discontent and blown upon by skilful artists blazed up into crackling of musketry open flame of rebellion a thing smacking of the gallows in all countries that pretend to have any government which flame of rebellion had there been no loyal population to fling themselves upon it at peril of their life might have ended we know not how it ended speedily in the good way canada got a godfreyscordial constitution and for the moment all was varnished into some kind of feasibility again a most poor feasibility momentary not lasting nor like to be of profit to canada for this year the canadian most constitutional parliament such a congeries of persons as one can imagine decides that the aforesaid flame of rebellion shall not only be forgotten as per bargain but thatthe loyal population who flung their lives upon it and quenched it in the nick of time shall pay the rebels their damages of this i believe on sadly conclusive evidence there is no doubt whatever such when you wash off the constitutional pigments is the deathshead that discloses itself i can only say if all the parliaments in the world were to vote that such a thing was just i should feel painfully constrained to answer at my peril no by the eternal never and i would recommend any british governor who might come across that business there or here to overhaul it again what the meaning of a governor if he is not to overhaul and control such things may be i cannot conjecture a canadian lumberlog may as well be made governor he might have some castmetal hand or shouldercrank a thing easily contrivable in birmingham for signing his name to acts of the colonial parliament he would be a native of the country too with popularity on that score if on no otherhe is your man if you really want a log governor   i perceive therefore that besides choosing parliaments never so well the new colonial office will have another thing to do contrive to send out a new kind of governors to the colonies this will be the mainspring of the business without this the business will not go at all an experienced wise and valiant british man to represent the imperial interest he with such a speaking or silent collective wisdom as he can gather round him in the colony will evidently be the condition of all good between the mother country and it if you can find such a man your point is gained if you cannot lost by him and his collective wisdom all manner of true relations mutual interests and duties such as they do exist in fact between mother country and colony can be gradually developed into practical methods and results and all manner of true and noble successes and veracities in the way of governing be won choose well your governornot from this or that poor section of the aristocracy military naval or redtapist wherever there are born kings of men you had better seek them out and breed them to this work all sections of the british population will be open to you and on the whole you must succeed in finding a man fit and having found him i would farther recommend you to keep him some time it would be a great improvement to end this present nomadism of colonial governors give your governor due power and let him know withal that he is wedded to his enterprise and having once well learned it shall continue with it that it is not a canadian lumberlog you want there to tumble upon the vertexes and sign its name by a birmingham shouldercrank but a governor of men who you mean shall fairly gird himself to his enterprise and fail with it and conquer with it and as it were live and die with it he will have much to learn and having once learned it will stay and turn his knowledge to account  from this kind of governor were you once in the way of finding him with moderate certainty from him and his collective wisdom all good whatsoever might be anticipated and surely were the colonies once enfranchised from redtape and the poor mother country once enfranchised from it were our idle seventyfours all busy carrying out streams of british industrials and those scoundrel regiments all working under divine drillsergeants at the grand atlantic and pacific junction railwaypoor britain and her poor colonies might find that they had true relations to each other that the imperial mother and her constitutionally obedient daughters were not a redtape fiction provoking bitter mockery as at present but a blessed godsfact destined to fill half the world with its fruits one day   but undoubtedly our grand primary concern is the home office and its irish giant named of despair when the home office begins dealing with this irish giant which it is vitally urgent for us the home office should straightway do it will find its duties enlarged to a most unexpected extent and as it were altered from top to bottom a changed time now when the question is what to do with three millions of paupers come upon you for food since you have no work for them increasing at a frightful rate per day home office parliament king constitution will find that they have now if they will continue in this world long got a quite immense new question and continually recurring set of questions that huge question of the irish giant with his scotch and english giantprogeny advancing openmouthed upon us will as i calculate change from top to bottom not the home office only but all manner of offices and institutions whatsoever and gradually the structure of society itself i perceive it will make us a new society if we are to continue a society at all for the alternative is not stay where we are or change but change with new wise effort fit for the new time to true and wider nobler national life or change by indolent folding of the arms as we are now doing in horrible anarchies and convulsions to dissolution to national death or suspendedanimation suspendedanimation itself is a frightful possibility for britain this anarchy whither all europe has preceded us where all europe is now weltering would suit us as ill as any the question for the british nation is can we work our course pacifically on firm land into the new era or must it be for us too as for all the others through black abysses of anarchy hardly escaping if we do with all our struggles escape the jaws of eternal death  for pauperism though it now absorbs its high figure of millions annually is by no means a question of money only but of infinitely higher and greater than all conceivable money if our chancellor of the exchequer had a fortunatus purse and miraculous sacks of indian meal that would stand scooping from foreveri say even on these terms pauperism could not be endured and it would vitally concern all british citizens to abate pauperism and never rest till they had ended it again pauperism is the general leakage through every joint of the ship that it is rotten were all men doing their duty or even seriously trying to do it there would be no pauper were the pretended captains of the world at all in the habit of commanding were the pretended teachers of the world at all in the habit of teachingof admonishing said captains among others and with sacred zeal apprising them to what place such neglect was leadinghow could pauperism exist pauperism would lie far over the horizon we should be lamenting and denouncing quite inferior sins of men which were only tending afar off towards pauperism a true captaincy a true teachership either making all men and captains know and devoutly recognize the eternal law of things or else breaking its own heart and going about with sackcloth round its loins in testimony of continual sorrow and protest and prophecy of gods vengeance upon such a course of things either of these divine equipments would have saved us and it is because we have neither of them that we are come to such a pass  we may depend upon it where there is a pauper there is a sin to make one pauper there go many sins pauperism is our social sin grown manifest developed from the state of a spiritual ignobleness a practical impropriety and base oblivion of duty to an affair of the ledger here is not now an unheeded sin against god here is a concrete ugly bulk of beggary demanding that you should buy indian meal for it men of reflection have long looked with a horror for which there was no response in the idle public upon pauperism but the quantity of meal it demands has now awakened men of no reflection to consider it pauperism is the poisonous dripping from all the sins and putrid unveracities and godforgetting greedinesses and devilserving cants and jesuitisms that exist among us not one idle sham lounging about creation upon false pretences upon means which he has not earned upon theories which he does not practise but yields his share of pauperism somewhere or other his shamwork oozes down finds at last its issue as human pauperismin a human being that by those false pretences cannot live the idle workhouse now about to burst of overfilling what is it but the scandalous poisontank of drainage from the universal stygian quagmire of our affairs workhouse paupers immortal sons of adam rotted into that scandalous condition subterslavish demanding that you would make slaves of them as an unattainable blessing my friends i perceive the quagmire must be drained or we cannot live and farther i perceive this of pauperism is the corner where we must beginthe levels all pointing thitherward the possibilities lying all clearly there on that problem we shall find that innumerable things that all things whatsoever hang by courageous steadfast persistence in that i can foresee society itself regenerated in the course of long strenuous centuries i can see the state become what it is actually bound to be the keystone of a most real organization of laborand on this earth a world of some veracity and some heroism once more worth living in   the state in all european countries and in england first of all as i hope will discover that its functions are now and have long been very wide of what the state in old pedant downing streets has aimed at that the state is for the present not a reality but in great part a dramatic speciosity expending its strength in practices and objects fallen many of them quite obsolete that it must come a little nearer the true aim again or it cannot continue in this world the champion of england eased in iron or tin and able to mount his horse with little assistancethis champion and the thousandfold cousinry of phantasms he has nearly all dead now but still walking as ghosts must positively take himself away who can endure him and his solemn trumpetings and obsolete gesticulations in a time that is full of deadly realities coming openmouthed upon us at drury lane let him play his part him and his thousandfold cousinry and welcome so long as any public will pay a shilling to see him but on the solid earth under the extremely earnest stars we dare not palter with him or accept his tomfooleries any more ridiculous they seem to some horrible they seem to me all lies if one look whence they come and whither they go are horrible  alas it will be found i doubt that in england more than in any country our public life and our private our state and our religion and all that we do and speak and the most even of what we think is a tissue of halftruths and wholelies of hypocrisies conventionalisms wornout traditionary rags and cobwebs such a lifegarment of beggarly incredible and uncredited falsities as no honest souls of adams posterity were ever enveloped in before and we walk about in it with a stately gesture as if it were some priestly stole or imperial mantle not the foulest beggars gabardine that ever was no englishman dare believe the truth says one he stands for these two hundred years enveloped in lies of every kind from nadir to zenith an ocean of traditionary cant surrounds him as his lifeelement he really thinks the truth dangerous poor wretch you see him everywhere endeavoring to temper the truth by taking the falsity along with it and welding them together this he calls safe course moderate course and other fine names there balanced between god and the devil he thinks he can serve two masters and that things will go well with him  in the cottonspinning and similar departments our english friend knows well that truth or god will have nothing to do with the devil or falsehood but will ravel all the web to pieces if you introduce the devil or nonveracity in any form into it in this department therefore our english friend avoids falsehood but in the religious political social moral and all other spiritual departments he freely introduces falsehood nothing doubting and has long done so with a profuseness not elsewhere met with in the world the unhappy creature does he not know then that every lie is accursed and the parent of mere curses that he must think the truth much more speak it that above all things by the oldest law of heaven and earth which no man violates with impunity he must not and shall not wag the tongue of him except to utter his thought that there is not a grin or beautiful acceptable grimace he can execute upon his poor countenance but is either an express veracity the image of what passes within him or else is a bit of devilworship which he and the rest of us will have to pay for yet alas the grins he executes upon his poor mind which is all tortured into st vitus dances and ghastly merryandrewisms by the practice are the most extraordinary this sun ever saw  we have puseyisms blackandwhite surplice controversiesdo not officially and otherwise the select of the longest heads in england sit with intense application and iron gravity in open forum judging of prevenient grace not a head of them suspects that it can be improper so to sit or of the nature of treason against the power who gave an intellect to manthat it can be other than the duty of a good citizen to use his godgiven intellect in investigating prevenient grace supervenient moonshine or the color of the bishops nightmare if that happened to turn up i consider them far ahead of ciceros roman augurs with their chickenbowels behold these divine chickenbowels o senate and roman people the midriff has fallen eastward solemnly intimates one augur by proserpina and the triple hecate exclaims the other i say the midriff has fallen to the west and they look at one another with the seriousness of men prepared to die in their opinionthe authentic seriousness of men betting at tattersalls or about to receive judgment in chancery there is in the englishman something great beyond all roman greatness in whatever line you meet him even as a latterday augur he seeks his fellowpoor devil i believe it is his intense love of peace and hatred of breeding discussions which lead nowhither that has led him into this sad practice of amalgamating true and false  he has been at it these two hundred years and has now carried it to a terrible length he couldnt follow oliver cromwell in the puritan path heavenward so steep was it and beset with thornsand becoming uncertain withal he much preferred at that juncture to go heavenward with his charles second and merry nell gwynns and old decent formularies and good respectable aristocratic company for escort sore he tried by glorious restorations glorious revolutions and so forth to perfect this desirable amalgam hoped always it might be possibleis only just now if even now beginning to give up the hope and to see with wideeyed horror that it is not at heaven he is arriving but at the stygian marshes with their thirty thousand needlewomen cannibal connaughts rivers of lamentation continual wail of infants and the yellowburning gleam of a hellonearthbull my friend you must strip that astonishing pontiffstole imperial mantle or whatever you imagine it to be which i discern to be a garment of curses and poisoned nessusshirt now at last about to take fire upon you you must strip that off your poor body my friend and were it only in a souls suit of utilitarian buff and such belief as that a big loaf is better than a small one come forth into contact with your world under true professions again and not false you wretched man you ought to weep for half a century on discovering what lies you have believed and what every lie leads to and proceeds from o my friend no honest fellow in this planet was ever so served by his cooks before or has eaten such quantities and qualities of dirt as you have been made to do for these two centuries past arise my horribly maltreated yet still beloved bull steep yourself in running water for a long while my friend and begin forthwith in every conceivable direction physical and spiritual the longexpected scavenger age  many doctors have you had my poor friend but i perceive it is the watercure alone that will help you a complete course of scavengerism is the thing you need a new and veritable heartdivorce of england from the babylonish woman who is jesuitism and unveracity and dwells not at rome now but under your own nose and everywhere whom and her foul worship of phantasms and devils poor england had once divorced with a divine heroism not forgotten yet and well worth remembering now a  phantasms which have too long nestled thick there under those astonishing defenders of the faithdefenders of the hypocrisies the spiritual vampires and obscene nightmares under which england lies in syncopethis is what you need and if you cannot get it you must die my poor friend  like people like priest priest king home office all manner of establishments and offices among a people bear a striking resemblance to the people itself it is because bull has been eating so much dirt that his home offices have got into such a shockingly dirty conditionthe old pavements of them quite gone out of sight and out of memory and nothing but mountains of longaccumulated dung in which the poor cattle are sprawling and tumbling had his own life been pure had his own daily conduct been grounding itself on the clear pavements or actual beliefs and veracities would he have let his home offices come to such a pass not in downing street only but in all other thoroughfares and arenas and spiritual or physical departments of his existence running water and herculean scavengerism have become indispensable unless the poor man is to choke in his own exuviae and die the sorrowfulest death   if the state could once get back to the real sight of its essential function and with religious resolution begin doing that and putting away its multifarious imaginary functions and indignantly casting out these as mere dung and insalubrious horror and abomination which they are what a promise of reform were there the british home office surely this and its kindred offices exist if they will think of it that life and work may continue possible and may not become impossible for british men if honorable existence or existence on human terms at all have become impossible for millions of british men how can the home office or any other office long exist with thirty thousand needlewomen a connaught fallen into potential cannibalism and the idle workhouse everywhere bursting and declaring itself an inhumanity and stupid ruinous brutality not much longer to be tolerated among rational human creatures it is time the state were bethinking itself  so soon as the state attacks that tremendous cloaca of pauperism which will choke the world if it be not attacked the state will find its real functions very different indeed from what it had long supposed them the state is a reality and not a dramaturgy it exists here to render existence possible existence desirable and noble for the states subjects the state as it gets into the track of its real work will find that same expand into whole continents of new unexpected most blessed activity as its dramatic functions declared superfluous more and more fall inert and go rushing like huge torrents of extinct exuviae dung and rubbish down to the abyss forever o heaven to see a state that knew a little why it was there and on what ground in this year 1850 it could pretend to exist in so extremely earnest a world as ours is growing the british state if it will be the crown and keystone of our british social existence must get to recognize with a veracity very long unknown to it what the real objects and indispensable necessities of our social existence are good heavens it is not prevenient grace or the color of the bishops nightmare that is pinching us it is the impossibility to get along any farther for mountains of accumulated dung and falsity and horror the total closingup of noble aims from every manof any aim at all from many men except that of rotting out in idle workhouses an existence below that of beasts  suppose the state to have fairly started its industrial regiments of the new era which alas are yet only beginning to be talked ofwhat continents of new real work opened out for the home and all other public offices among us suppose the home office looking out as for life and salvation for proper men to command these regiments suppose the announcement were practically made to all british souls that the want of wants more indispensable than any jewel in the crown was that of men able to command men in ways of industrial and moral welldoing that the state would give its very life for such men that such men were the state that the quantity of them to be found in england lamentably small at present was the exact measure of englands worthwhat a new dawn of everlasting day for all british souls noble british soul to whom the gods have given faculty and heroism what men call genius here at last is a career for thee it will not be needful now to swear fealty to the incredible and traitorously cramp thyself into a cowardly canting playactor in gods universe or solemnly forswearing that into a mutinous rebel and waste bandit in thy generation here is an aim that is clear and credible a course fit for a man no need to become a tormenting and selftormenting mutineer banded with rebellious souls if thou wouldst live no need to rot in suicidal idleness or take to platform preaching and writing in radical newspapers to pull asunder the great falsity in which thou and all of us are choking the great falsity behold it has become in the very heart of it a great truth of truths and invites thee and all brave men to cooperate with it in transforming all the body and the joints into the noble likeness of that heart thriceblessed change the state aims once more with a true aim and has loadstars in the eternal heaven struggle faithfully for it noble is this struggle thou too according to thy faculty shalt reap in due time if thou faint not thou shalt have a wise command of men thou shalt be wisely commanded by menthe summary of all blessedness for a social creature here below the sore struggle never to be relaxed and not forgiven to any son of man is once more a noble one glory to the highest it is now once more a true and noble one wherein a man can afford to die our path is now again heavenward forward with steady pace with drawn weapons and unconquerable hearts in the name of god that made us all  wise obedience and wise command i foresee that the regimenting of pauper banditti into soldiers of industry is but the beginning of this blessed process which will extend to the topmost heights of our society and in the course of generations make us all once more a governed commonwealth and civitas dei if it please god wasteland industrials succeeding other kinds of industry as clothmaking shoemaking ploughmaking spademaking housebuildingin the end all kinds of industry whatsoever will be found capable of regimenting milloperatives all manner of free operatives as yet unregimented nomadic under private masters they seeing such example and its blessedness will say masters you must regiment us a little make our interests with you permanent a little instead of temporary and nomadic we will enlist with the state otherwise this will go on on the one hand while the stateoperation goes on on the other thus will all masters of workmen private captains of industry be forced to incessantly cooperate with the state and its public captains they regimenting in their way the state in its way with everwidening field till their fields meet so to speak and coalesce and there be no unregimented worker or such only as are fit to remain unregimented any moreo my friends i clearly perceive this horrible cloaca of pauperism wearing nearly bottomless now is the point where we must begin here in this plainly unendurable portion of the general quagmire the lowest point of all and hateful even to mcroudy must our main drain begin steadily prosecuting that tearing that along with herculean labor and divine fidelity we shall gradually drain the entire stygian swamp and make it all once more a fruitful field  for the state i perceive looking out with right sacred earnestness for persons able to command will straightway also come upon the question what kind of schools and seminaries and teaching and also preaching establishments have i for the training of young souls to take command and to yield obedience wise command wise obedience the capability of these two is the net measure of culture and human virtue in every man all good lies in the possession of these two capabilities all evil wretchedness and illsuccess in the want of these he is a good man that can command and obey he that cannot is a bad if my teachers and my preachers with their seminaries high schools and cathedrals do train men to these gifts the thing they are teaching and preaching must be true if they do not not true  the state once brought to its veracities by the thumbscrew in this manner what will it think of these same seminaries and cathedrals i foresee that our etons and oxfords with their nonsenseverses collegelogics and broken crumbs of mere speechwhich is not even english or teutonic speech but old grecian and italian speech dead and buried and much lying out of our way these two thousand years last pastwill be found a most astonishing seminary for the training of young english souls to take command in human industries and act a valiant part under the sun the state does not want vocables but manly wisdoms and virtues the state does it want parliamentary orators first of all and men capable of writing books what a ragfair of extinct monkeries highpiled here in the very shrine of our existence fit to smite the generations with atrophy and beggarly paralysisas we see it do the minister of education will not want for work i think in the new downing street  how it will go with soulsoverseers and what the new kind will be we do not prophesy just now clear it is however that the last finish of the states efforts in this operation of regimenting will be to get the true soulsoverseers set over mens souls to regiment as the consummate flower of all and constitute into some sacred corporation bearing authority and dignity in their generation the chosen of the wise of the spiritual and devoutminded the reverent who deserve reverence who are as the salt of the earththat not till this is done can the state consider its edifice to have reached the first story to be safe for a moment to be other than an arch without the keystones and supported hitherto on mere wood how will this be done ask not let the second or the third generation after this begin to askalas wise men do exist born duly into the world in every current generation but the getting of them regimented is the highest pitch of human polity and the feat of all feats in political engineeringimpossible for us in this poor age as the building of st pauls would be for canadian beavers acquainted only with the architecture of fishdams and with no trowel but their tail  literature the strange entity so calledthat indeed is here if literature continue to be the haven of expatriated spiritualisms and have its johnsons goethes and true archbishops of the world to show for itself as heretofore there may be hope in literature if literature dwindle as is probable into mere merryandrewism windy twaddle and feats of spiritual legerdemain analogous to ropedancing operadancing and streetfiddling with a hat carried round for halfpence or for guineas there will be no hope in literature what if our next set of soulsoverseers were to be silent ones very mainlyalas alas why gaze into the blessed continents and delectable mountains of a future based on truth while as yet we struggle far down nigh suffocated in a slough of lies uncertain whether or how we shall be able to climb at all   who will begin the long steep journey with us who of living statesmen will snatch the standard and say like a hero on the forlornhope for his country forward or is there none no one that can and dare and our lot too then is anarchy by barricade or ballotbox and social deathwe will not think so   whether sir robert peel will undertake the reform of downing street for us or any ministry or reform farther is not known he they say is getting old does himself recoil from it and shudder at it which is possible enough the clubs and coteries appear to have settled that he surely will not that this melancholy wriggling seesaw of redtape trojans and protectionist greeks must continue its course tillwhat can happen my friends if this go on continuing  and yet perhaps england has by no means so settled it quit the clubs and coteries you do not hear two rational men speak long together upon politics without pointing their inquiries towards this man a minister that will attack the augeas stable of downing street and begin producing a real management no longer an imaginary one of our affairs he or else in few years chartist parliament and the deluge come that seems the alternative as i read the omens there was no man in my time more authentically called to a post of difficulty of danger and of honor than this man the enterprise is ready for him if he is ready for it he has but to lift his finger in this enterprise and whatsoever is wise and manful in england will rally round him if the faculty and heart for it be in him he strangely and almost tragically if we look upon his history is to have leave to try it he now at the eleventh hour has the opportunity for such a feat in reform as has not in these late generations been attempted by all our reformers put together  as for protectionist jargon who in these earnest days would occupy many moments of his time with that a costermonger in this street says crabbe finding lately that his rope of onions which he hoped would have brought a shilling was to go for only sevenpence henceforth burst forth into lamentation execration and the most pathetic tears throwing up the window i perceived the other costermongers preparing impatiently to pack this one out of their company as a disgrace to it if he would not hold his peace and take the marketrate for his onions i looked better at this costermonger to my astonished imagination a starandgarter dawned upon the dim figure of the man and i perceived that here was no costermonger to be expelled with ignominy but a sublime goddessborn ducal individual whom i forbear to name at this moment what an omennay to my astonished imagination there dawned still fataler omens surely of all human trades ever heard of the trade of owning land in england ought not to bully us for drinkmoney just now  hansards debates continues crabbe farther on present many inconsistencies of speech lamentable unveracities uttered in parliament by one and indeed by all in which sad list sir robert peel stands for his share among others unveracities not a few were spoken in parliament in fact to one with a sense of what is called gods truth it seemed all one unveracity a talking from the teeth outward not as the convictions but as the expediencies and inward astucities directed and in the sense of gods truth i have heard no true word uttered in parliament at all most lamentable unveracities continually spoken in parliament by almost every one that had to open his mouth there but the largest veracity ever done in parliament in our time as we all know was of this mans doingand that you will find is a very considerable item in the calculation  yes and i believe england in her dumb way remembers that too and the traitor peel can very well afford to let innumerable ducal costermongers parliamentary adventurers and lineal representatives of the impenitent thief say all their say about him and do all their do with a virtual england at his back and an actual eternal sky above him there is not much in the total netamount of that when the master of the horse rides abroad many dogs in the village bark but he pursues his journey all the same     no v stumporator may 1 1850  it lies deep in our habits confirmed by all manner of educational and other arrangements for several centuries back to consider human talent as best of all evincing itself by the faculty of eloquent speech our earliest schoolmasters teach us as the one gift of culture they have the art of spelling and pronouncing the rules of correct speech rhetorics logics follow sublime mysteries of grammar whereby we may not only speak but write and onward to the last of our schoolmasters in the highest university it is still intrinsically grammar under various figures grammar to speak in various languages on various things but on all of them to speak and appropriately deliver ourselves by tongue or penthis is the sublime goal towards which all manner of beneficent preceptors and learned professors from the lowest hornbook upwards are continually urging and guiding us preceptor or professor looking over his miraculous seedplot seminary as he well calls it or crop of young human souls watches with attentive view one organ of his delightful little seedlings growing to be menthe tongue he hopes we shall all get to speak yet if it please heaven some of you shall be bookwriters eloquent reviewwriters and astonish mankind my young friends others in white neckcloths shall do sermons by blair and lindley murray nay by jeremy taylor and judicious hooker and be priests to guide men heavenward by skilfully brandished handkerchief and the torch of rhetoric for others there is parliament and the election beerbarrel and a course that leads men very high indeed these shall shake the senatehouse the morning newspapers shake the very spheres and by dexterous wagging of the tongue disenthrall mankind and lead our afflicted country and us on the way we are to go the way if not where noble deeds are done yet where noble words are spokenleading us if not to the real home of the gods at least to something which shall more or less deceptively resemble it  so fares it with the son of adam in these bewildered epochs so from the first opening of his eyes in this world to his last closing of them and departure hence speak speak oh speakif thou have any faculty speak it or thou diest and it is no faculty so in universities and all manner of dames and other schools of the very highest class as of the very lowest and society at large when we enter there confirms with all its brilliant reviewarticles successful publications intellectual teacircles literary gazettes parliamentary eloquences the grand lesson we had other lesson in fact we have none in these times if there be a human talent let it get into the tongue and make melody with that organ the talent that can say nothing for itself what is it nothing or a thing that can do mere drudgeries and at best make money by railways  all this is deeprooted in our habits in our social educational and other arrangements and all this when we look at it impartially is astonishing directly in the teeth of all this it may be asserted that speaking is by no means the chief faculty a human being can attain to that his excellence therein is by no means the best test of his general human excellence or availability in this world nay that unless we look well it is liable to become the very worst test ever devised for said availability the matter extends very far down to the very roots of the world whither the british reader cannot conveniently follow me just now but i will venture to assert the three following things and invite him to consider well what truth he can gradually find in them  first that excellent speech even speech really excellent is not and never was the chief test of human faculty or the measure of a mans ability for any true function whatsoever on the contrary that excellent silence needed always to accompany excellent speech and was and is a much rarer and more difficult gift  secondly that really excellent speechwhich i being possessed of the hebrew bible or book as well as of other books in my own and foreign languages and having occasionally heard a wise mans word among the crowd of unwise do almost unspeakably esteem as a human giftis terribly apt to get confounded with its counterfeit shamexcellent speech and furthermore that if really excellent human speech is among the best of human things then shamexcellent ditto deserves to be ranked with the very worst false speechcapable of becoming as some one has said the falsest and basest of all human thingsput the case one were listening to that as to the truest and noblest which little as we are conscious of it i take to be the sad lot of many excellent souls among us just now so many as admire parliamentary eloquence divine popular literature and such like are dreadfully liable to it just now and whole nations and generations seem as if getting themselves asphyxiaed constitutionally into their last sleep by means of it just now  for alas much as we worship speech on all hands here is a third assertion which a man may venture to make and invite considerate men to reflect upon that in these times and for several generations back there has been strictly considered no really excellent speech at all but shamexcellent merely that is to say false or quasifalse speech getting itself admired and worshipped instead of detested and suppressed a truly alarming predicament and not the less so if we find it a quite pleasant one for the time being and welcome the advent of asphyxia as we would that of comfortable natural sleepas in so many senses we are doing surly judges there have been who did not much admire the bible of modern literature or anything you could distil from it in contrast with the ancient bibles and found that in the matter of speaking our far best excellence where that could be obtained was excellent silence which means endurance and exertion and good work with lips closed and that our tolerablest speech was of the nature of honest commonplace introduced where indispensable which only set up for being brief and true and could not be mistaken for excellent  these are hard sayings for many a british reader unconscious of any damage nay joyfully conscious to himself of much profit from that side of his possessions surely on this side if on no other matters stood not ill with him the ingenuous arts had softened his manners the parliamentary eloquences supplied him with a succedaneum for government the popular literatures with the finer sensibilities of the heart surely on this windward side of things the british reader was not ill offunhappy british reader  in fact the spiritual detriment we unconsciously suffer in every province of our affairs from this our prostrate respect to power of speech is incalculable for indeed it is the natural consummation of an epoch such as ours given a general insincerity of mind for several generations you will certainly find the talker established in the place of honor and the doer hidden in the obscure crowd with activity lamed or working sorrowfully forward on paths unworthy of him all men are devoutly prostrate worshipping the eloquent talker and no man knows what a scandalous idol he is out of whom in the mildest manner like comfortable natural rest comes mere asphyxia and death everlasting probably there is not in nature a more distracted phantasm than your commonplace eloquent speaker as he is found on platforms in parliaments on kentucky stumps at taverndinners in windy empty insincere times like ours the excellent stumporator as our admiring yankee friends define him he who in any occurrent set of circumstances can start forth mount upon his stump his rostrum tribune place in parliament or other ready elevation and pour forth from him his appropriate excellent speech his interpretation of the said circumstances in such manner as poor windy mortals round him shall cry bravo tohe is not an artist i can much admire as matters go alas he is in general merely the windiest mortal of them all and is admired for being so into the bargain not a windy blockhead there who kept silent but is better off than this excellent stumporator better off for a great many reasons for this reason were there no other the silent one is not admired the silent suspects perhaps partly admits that he is a kind of blockhead from which salutary selfknowledge the excellent stumporator is debarred a mouthpiece of chaos to poor benighted mortals that lend ear to him as to a voice from cosmos this excellent stumporator fills me with amazement not empty these musical windutterances of his they are big with prophecy they announce too audibly to me that the end of many things is drawing nigh  let the british reader consider it a little he too is not a little interested in it nay he and the european reader in general but he chiefly in these days will require to consider it a great dealand to take important steps in consequence by and by if i mistake not and in the mean while sunk as he himself is in that bad element and like a jaundiced man struggling to discriminate yellow colorshe will have to meditate long before he in any measure get the immense meanings of the thing brought home to him and discern with astonishment alarm and almost terror and despair towards what fatal issues in our collective wisdom and elsewhere this notion of talent meaning eloquent speech so obstinately entertained this long while has been leading us whosoever shall look well into origins and issues will find this of eloquence and the part it now plays in our affairs to be one of the gravest phenomena and the excellent stumporator of these days to be not only a ridiculous but still more a highly tragical personage while the many listen to him the few are used to pass rapidly with some gust of scornful laughter some growl of impatient malediction but he deserves from this latter class a much more serious attention   in the old ages when universities and schools were first instituted this function of the schoolmaster to teach mere speaking was the natural one in those healthy times guided by silent instincts and the monition of nature men had from of old been used to teach themselves what it was essential to learn by the one sure method of learning anything practical apprenticeship to it this was the rule for all classes as it now is the rule unluckily for only one class the working man as yet sought only to know his craft and educated himself sufficiently by ploughing and hammering under the conditions given and in fit relation to the persons given a course of education then as now and ever really opulent in manful culture and instruction to him teaching him many solid virtues and most indubitably useful knowledges developing in him valuable faculties not a few both to do and to endureamong which the faculty of elaborate grammatical utterance seeing he had so little of extraordinary to utter or to learn from spoken or written utterances was not bargained for the grammar of nature which he learned from his mother being still amply sufficient for him this was as it still is the grand education of the working man  as for the priest though his trade was clearly of a reading and speaking nature he knew also in those veracious times that grammar if needful was by no means the one thing needful or the chief thing by far the chief thing needful and indeed the one thing then as now was that there should be in him the feeling and the practice of reverence to god and to men that in his lifes core there should dwell spoken or silent a ray of pious wisdom fit for illuminating dark human destiniesnot so much that he should possess the art of speech as that he should have something to speak and for that latter requisite the priest also trained himself by apprenticeship by actual attempt to practise by manifold longcontinued trial of a devout and painful nature such as his superiors prescribed to him this when once judged satisfactory procured him ordination and his grammarlearning in the good times of priesthood was very much of a parergon with him as indeed in all times it is intrinsically quite insignificant in comparison  the young noble again for whom grammar schoolmasters were first hired and high seminaries founded he too without these or above and over these had from immemorial time been used to learn his business by apprenticeship the young noble before the schoolmaster as after him went apprentice to some elder noble entered himself as page with some distinguished earl or duke and here serving upwards from step to step under wise monition learned his chivalries his practice of arms and of courtesies his baronial duties and manners and what it would beseem him to do and to be in the worldby practical attempt of his own and example of one whose life was a daily concrete pattern for him to such a one already filled with intellectual substance and possessing what we may call the practical goldbullion of human culture it was an obvious improvement that he should be taught to speak it out of him on occasion that he should carry a spiritual banknote producible on demand for what of goldbullion he had not so negotiable otherwise stored in the cellars of his mind a man with wisdom insight and heroic worth already acquired for him naturally demanded of the schoolmaster this one new faculty the faculty of uttering in fit words what he had a valuable superaddition of facultyand yet we are to remember it was scarcely a new faculty it was but the tangible sign of what other faculties the man had in the silent state and many a rugged inarticulate chief of men i can believe was most enviably educated who had not a book on his premises whose signature a true signmanual was the stamp of his iron hand duly inked and clapt upon the parchment and whose speech in parliament like the growl of lions did indeed convey his meaning but would have torn lindley murrays nerves to pieces to such a one the schoolmaster adjusted himself very naturally in that manner as a man wanted for teaching grammatical utterance the thing to utter being already there the thing to utter here was the grand point and perhaps this is the reason why among earnest nations as among the romans for example the craft of the schoolmaster was held in little regard for indeed as mere teacher of grammar of ciphering on the abacus and such like how did he differ much from the dancingmaster or fencingmaster or deserve much regardsuch was the rule in the ancient healthy times   can it be doubtful that this is still the rule of human education that the human creature needs first of all to be educated not that he may speak but that he may have something weighty and valuable to say if speech is the banknote of an inward capital of culture of insight and noble human worth then speech is precious and the art of speech shall be honored but if there is no inward capital if speech represent no real culture of the mind but an imaginary culture no bullion but the fatal and now almost hopeless deficit of such alas alas said banknote is then a forged one passing freely current in the market but bringing damages to the receiver to the payer and to all the world which are in sad truth infallible and of amount incalculable few think of it at present but the truth remains forever so in parliaments and other loud assemblages your eloquent talk disunited from nature and her facts is taken as wisdom and the correct image of said facts but nature well knows what it is nature will not have it as such and will reject your forged note one day with huge costs the foolish traders in the market pass freely nothing doubting and rejoice in the dexterous execution of the piece and so it circulates from hand to hand and from class to class gravitating ever downwards towards the practical class till at last it reaches some poor working hand who can pass it no farther but must take it to the bank to get bread with it and there the answer is unhappy caitiff this note is forged it does not mean performance and reality in parliaments and elsewhere for thy behoof it means fallacious semblance of performance and thou poor dupe art thrown into the stocks on offering it here  alas alas looking abroad over irish difficulties mosaic sweatingestablishments french barricades and an anarchic europe is it not as if all the populations of the world were rising or had risen into incendiary madnessunable longer to endure such an avalanche of forgeries and of penalties in consequence as had accumulated upon them the speaker is excellent the notes he does are beautiful beautifully fit for the market yes he is an excellent artist in his businessand the more excellent he is the more is my desire to lay him by the heels and fling him into the treadmill that i might save the poor sweating tailors french sansculottes and irish sanspotatoes from bearing the smart  for the smart must be borne some one must bear it as sure as god lives every word of man is either a note or a forged notehave these eternal skies forgotten to be in earnest think you because men go grinning like enchanted apes foolish souls this now as of old is the unalterable law of your existence if you know the truth and do it the universe itself seconds you bears you on to sure victory everywhereand observe to sure defeat everywhere if you do not do the truth and alas if you know only the eloquent fallacious semblance of the truth what chance is there of your ever doing it you will do something very different from it i thinkhe who well considers will find this same art of speech as we moderns have it to be a truly astonishing product of the ages and the longer he considers it the more astonishing and alarming i reckon it the saddest of all the curses that now lie heavy on us with horror and amazement one perceives that this muchcelebrated art so diligently practised in all corners of the world just now is the chief destroyer of whatever good is born to us softly swiftly shutting up all nascent good as if under exhausted glass receivers there to choke and die and the grand parent manufactory of evil to usas it were the last finishing and varnishing workshop of all the devils ware that circulates under the sun no devils sham is fit for the market till it have been polished and enamelled here this is the general assayinghouse for such where the artists examine and answer fit for the market not fit words will not express what mischiefs the misuse of words has done and is doing in these heavyladen generations  do you want a man not to practise what he believes then encourage him to keep often speaking it in words every time he speaks it the tendency to do it will grow less his empty speech of what he believes will be a weariness and an affliction to the wise man but do you wish his empty speech of what he believes to become farther an insincere speech of what he does not believe celebrate to him his gift of speech assure him that he shall rise in parliament by means of it and achieve great things without any performance that eloquent speech whether performed or not is admirable my friends eloquent unperformed speech in parliament or elsewhere is horrible the eloquent man that delivers in parliament or elsewhere a beautiful speech and will perform nothing of it but leaves it as if already performedwhat can you make of that man he has enrolled himself among the ignes fatui and children of the wind means to serve as beautifully illuminated chinese lantern in that corps henceforth i think the serviceable thing you could do to that man if permissible would be a severe one to clip off a bit of his eloquent tongue by way of penance and warning another bit if he again spoke without performing and so again till you had clipt the whole tongue away from himand were delivered you and he from at least one miserable mockery there eloquent friend see now in silence if there be any redeeming deed in thee of blasphemous windeloquence at least we shall have no more how many pretty men have gone this road escorted by the beautifulest marching music from all the public organs and have found at last that it endedwhere it is the broad road that leads direct to limbo and the kingdom of the inane gifted men and once valiant nations and as it were the whole world with one accord are marching thither in melodious triumph all the drums and hautboys giving out their cheerfulest caira it is the universal humor of the world just now my friends i am very sure you will arrive unless you halt   considered as the last finish of education or of human culture worth and acquirement the art of speech is noble and even divine it is like the kindling of a heavens light to show us what a glorious world exists and has perfected itself in a man but if no world exist in the man if nothing but continents of empty vapor of greedy selfconceits commonplace hearsays and indistinct loomings of a sordid chaos exist in him what will be the use of light to show us that better a thousand times that such a man do not speak but keep his empty vapor and his sordid chaos to himself hidden to the utmost from all beholders to look on that can be good for no human beholder to look away from that must be good and if by delusive semblances of rhetoric logic firstclass degrees and the aid of elocutionmasters and parliamentary reporters the poor proprietor of said chaos should be led to persuade himself and get others persuadedwhich it is the nature of his sad task to do and which in certain eras of the world it is fatally possible to dothat this is a cosmos which he owns that he being so perfect in tongueexercise and full of collegehonors is an educated man and pearl of great price in his generation that round him and his parliament emulously listening to him as round some divine apple of gold set in a picture of silver all the world should gather to adore what is likely to become of him and the gathering world an apple of sodom set in the clusters of gomorrah that little as he suspects it is the definition of the poor chaotically eloquent man with his emulous parliament and miserable adoring worldconsidered as the whole of education or human culture which it now is in our modern manners all apprenticeship except to mere handicraft having fallen obsolete and the educated man being with us emphatically and exclusively the man that can speak well with tongue or pen and astonish men by the quantities of speech he has heard tremendous reader walking encyclopaedia and such likethe art of speech is probably definable in that case as the short summary of all the black arts put together   but the schoolmaster is secondary an effect rather than a cause in this matter what the schoolmaster with his universities shall manage or attempt to teach will be ruled by what the society with its practical industries is continually demanding that men should learn we spoke once of vital lungs for society and in fact this question always rises as the alpha and omega of social questions what methods the society has of summoning aloft into the high places for its help and governance the wisdom that is born to it in all places and of course is born chiefly in the more populous or lower places for this if you will consider it expresses the ultimate available result and net sumtotal of all the efforts struggles and confused activities that go on in the society and determines whether they are true and wise efforts certain to be victorious or false and foolish certain to be futile and to fall captive and caitiff how do men rise in your society in all societies turkey included and i suppose dahomey included men do rise but the question of questions always is what kind of men men of noble gifts or men of ignoble it is the one or the other and a lifeanddeath inquiry which for in all places and all times little as you may heed it nature most silently but most inexorably demands that it be the one and not the other and you need not try to palm an ignoble sham upon her and call it noble for she is a judge and her penalties as quiet as she looks are terrible amounting to worldearthquakes to anarchy and death everlasting and admit of no appeal  surely england still flatters herself that she has lungs that she can still breathe a little or is it that the poor creature driven into mere blind industrialisms and as it were gone pearldiving this long while many fathoms deep and tearing up the oysterbeds so as never creature did before hardly knowsso busy in the belly of the oyster chaos where is no thought of breathingwhether she has lungs or not nations of a robust habit and fine deep chest can sometimes take in a deal of breath before diving and live long in the muddy deeps without new breath but they too come to need it at last and will die if they cannot get it  to the gifted soul that is born in england what is the career then that will carry him amid noble olympic dust up to the immortal gods for his countrys sake that it may not lose the service he was born capable of doing it for his own sake that his life be not choked and perverted and his light from heaven be not changed into lightning from the other placeit is essential that there be such a career the country that can offer no career in that case is a doomed country nay it is already a dead country it has secured the ban of heaven upon it will not have heavens light will have the other places lightning and may consider itself as appointed to expire in frightful coughings of street musketry or otherwise on a set day and to be in the eye of law dead in no country is there not some career inviting to it either the noble hero or the tough greek of the lower empire which of the two do your careers invite there is no question more important the kind of careers you offer in countries still living determines with perfect exactness the kind of the life that is in themwhether it is natural blessed life or galvanic accursed ditto and likewise what degree of strength is in the same  our english careers to born genius are twofold there is the silent or unlearned career of the industrialisms which are very many among us and there is the articulate or learned career of the three professions medicine law under which we may include politics and the church your born genius therefore will first have to ask himself whether he can hold his tongue or cannot true all human talent especially all deep talent is a talent to do and is intrinsically of silent nature inaudible like the sphere harmonies and eternal melodies of which it is an incarnated fraction all real talent i fancy would much rather if it listened only to natures monitions express itself in rhythmic facts than in melodious words which latter at best where they are good for anything are only a feeble echo and shadow or foreshadow of the former but talents differ much in this of power to be silent and circumstances of position opportunity and such like modify them still moreand natures monitions oftenest quite drowned in foreign hearsays are by no means the only ones listened to in decidingthe industrialisms are all of silent nature and some of them are heroic and eminently human others again we may call unheroic not eminently human beaverish rather but still honest some are even vulpine altogether inhuman and dishonest your born genius must make his choice  if a soul is born with divine intelligence and has its lips touched with hallowed fire in consecration for high enterprises under the sun this young soul will find the question asked of him by england every hour and moment canst thou turn thy human intelligence into the beaver sort and make honest contrivance and accumulation of capital by it if so do it and avoid the vulpine kind which i dont recommend honest triumphs in engineering and machinery await thee scrip awaits thee commercial successes kingship in the countingroom on the stockexchangethou shalt be the envy of surrounding flunkies and collect into a heap more gold than a drayhorse can drawgold so much gold answers the ingenuous soul with visions of the envy of surrounding flunkies dawning on him and in very many cases decides that he will contract himself into beaverism and with such a horsedraught of gold emblem of a neverimagined success in beaver heroism strike the surrounding flunkies yellow  this is our common course this is in some sort open to every creature what we call the beaver career perhaps more open in england taking in america too than it ever was in any country before and truly good consequences follow out of it who can be blind to them half of a most excellent and opulent result is realized to us in this way baleful only when it sets up as too often now for being the whole result a halfresult which will be blessed and heavenly so soon as the other half is hadnamely wisdom to guide the first half let us honor all honest human power of contrivance in its degree the beaver intellect so long as it steadfastly refuses to be vulpine and answers the tempter pointing out short routes to it with an honest no no is truly respectable to me and many a highflying speaker and singer whom i have known has appeared to me much less of a developed man than certain of my millowning agricultural commercial mechanical or otherwise industrial friends who have held their peace all their days and gone on in the silent state if a man can keep his intellect silent and make it even into honest beaverism several very manful moralities in danger of wreck on other courses may comport well with that and give it a genuine and partly human character and i will tell him in these days he may do far worse with himself and his intellect than change it into beaverism and make honest money with it if indeed he could become a heroic industrial and have a life eminently human but that is not easy at present probably some ninetynine out of every hundred of our gifted souls who have to seek a career for themselves go this beaver road whereby the first halfresult national wealth namely is plentifully realized and only the second half or wisdom to guide it is dreadfully behindhand  but now if the gifted soul be not of taciturn nature be of vivid impatient rapidly productive nature and aspire much to give itself sensible utterancei find that in this case the field it has in england is narrow to an extreme is perhaps narrower than ever offered itself for the like object in this world before parliament church law let the young vivid soul turn whither he will for a career he finds among variable conditions one condition invariable and extremely surprising that the proof of excellence is to be done by the tongue for heroism that will not speak but only act there is no account keptthe english nation does not need that silent kind then but only the talking kind most astonishing of all the organs a man has there is none held in account it would appear but the tongue he uses for talking premiership woolsack mitre and quasicrown all is attainable if you can talk with due ability everywhere your proofshot is to be a wellfired volley of talk contrive to talk well you will get to heaven the modern heaven of the english do not talk well only work well and heroically hold your peace you have no chance whatever to get thither with your utmost industry you may get to threadneedle street and accumulate more gold than a drayhorse can draw is not this a very wonderful arrangement  i have heard of races done by mortals tied in sacks of human competitors high aspirants climbing heavenward on the soaped pole seizing the soaped pig and clutching with cleft fist at full gallop the fated goose tied aloft by its footwhich feats do prove agility toughness and other useful faculties in man but this of dexterous talk is probably as strange a competition as any and the question rises whether certain of these other feats or perhaps an alternation of all of them relieved now and then by a bout of grinning through the collar might not be profitably substituted for the solitary prooffeat of talk now getting rather monotonous by its long continuance alas mr bull i do find it is all little other than a proof of toughness which is a quality i respect with more or less expenditure of falsity and astucity superadded which i entirely condemn toughness plus astucityperhaps a simple wooden mast set up in palaceyard well soaped and duly presided over might be the honester method such a method as this by trial of talk for filling your chief offices in church and state was perhaps never heard of in the solar system before you are quite used to it my poor friend and nearly dead by the consequences of it but in the other planets as in other epochs of your own planet it would have done had you proposed it the thing awakens incredulous amazement worldwide olympic laughter which ends in tempestuous hootings in tears and horror my friend if you can as heretofore this good while find nobody to take care of your affairs but the expertest talker it is all over with your affairs and you talk never yet could guide any mans or nations affairs nor will it yours except towards the limbus patrum where all talk except a very select kind of it lodges at last   medicine guarded too by preliminary impediments and frightful medusaheads of quackery which deter many generous souls from entering is of the halfarticulate professions and does not much invite the ardent kinds of ambition the intellect required for medicine might be wholly human and indeed should by all rules bethe profession of the human healer being radically a sacred one and connected with the highest priesthoods or rather being itself the outcome and acme of all priesthoods and divinest conquests of intellect here below as will appear one day when men take off their old monastic and ecclesiastic spectacles and look with eyes again in essence the physicians task is always heroic eminently human but in practice most unluckily at present we find it too become in good part beaverish yielding a moneyresult alone and what of it is not beaverishdoes not that too go mainly to ingenious talking publishing of yourself ingratiating of yourself a partly human exercise or waste of intellect and alas a partly vulpine dittomaking the once sacred gr iatros or human healer more impossible for us than ever  angry basilisks watch at the gates of law and church just now and strike a sad damp into the nobler of the young aspirants hard bonds are offered you to sign as it were a solemn engagement to constitute yourself an impostor before ever entering to declare your belief in incredibilitiesyour determination in short to take chaos for cosmos and satan for the lord of things if he come with money in his pockets and horsehair and bombazine decently wrapt about him fatal preliminaries which deter many an ingenuous young soul and send him back from the threshold and i hope will deter ever more but if you do enter the condition is well known talk who can talk best here his shall be the mouth of gold and the purse of gold and with my gr mitra once the headdress of unfortunate females i am told shall his sacred temples be begirt  ingenuous souls unless forced to it do now much shudder at the threshold of both these careers and not a few desperately turn back into the wilderness rather to front a very rude fortune and be devoured by wild beasts as is likeliest but as to parliament again and its eligibility if attainable there is yet no question anywhere the ingenuous soul if possessed of moneycapital enough is predestined by the parental and all manner of monitors to that career of talk and accepts it with alacrity and clearness of heart doubtful only whether he shall be able to make a speech courage my brave young fellow if you can climb a soaped pole of any kind you will certainly be able to make a speech all mortals have a tongue and carry on some jumble if not of thought yet of stuff which they could talk the weakest of animals has got a cry in it and can give voice before dying if you are tough enough bent upon it desperately enough i engage you shall make a speechbut whether that will be the way to heaven for you i do not engage  these then are our two careers for genius mute industrialism which can seldom become very human but remains beaverish mainly and the three professions named learnedthat is to say able to talk for the heroic or higher kinds of human intellect in the silent state there is not the smallest inquiry anywhere apparently a thing not wanted in this country at present what the supply may be i cannot inform mcroudy but the marketdemand he may himself see is nil these are our three professions that require human intellect in part or whole not able to do with mere beaverish and such a part does the gift of talk play in one and all of them whatsoever is not beaverish seems to go forth in the shape of talk to such length is human intellect wasted or suppressed in this world  if the young aspirant is not rich enough for parliament and is deterred by the basilisks or otherwise from entering on law or church and cannot altogether reduce his human intellect to the beaverish condition or satisfy himself with the prospect of making moneywhat becomes of him in such case which is naturally the case of very many and ever of more in such case there remains but one outlet for him and notably enough that too is a talking one the outlet of literature of trying to write books since owing to preliminary basilisks want of cash or superiority to cash he cannot mount aloft by eloquent talking let him try it by dexterous eloquent writing here happily having three fingers and capital to buy a quire of paper he can try it to all lengths and in spite of all mortals in this career there is happily no public impediment that can turn him back nothing but private starvationwhich is itself a finis or kind of goalcan pretend to hinder a british man from prosecuting literature to the very utmost and wringing the final secret from her a talent is in thee no talent is in thee to the british subject who fancies genius may be lodged in him this liberty remains and truly it is if well computed almost the only one he has  a crowded portal this of literature accordingly the haven of expatriated spiritualisms and alas also of expatriated vanities and prurient imbecilities here do the windy aspirations foiled activities foolish ambitions and frustrate human energies reduced to the vocable condition fly as to the one refuge left and the republic of letters increases in population at a faster rate than even the republic of america the strangest regiment in her majestys service this of the soldiers of literaturewould your lordship much like to march through coventry with them the immortal gods are there quite irrecognizable under these disguises and also the lowest broken valetsan extremely miscellaneous regiment in fact the regiment superficially viewed looks like an immeasurable motley flood of discharged playactors funambulists false prophets drunken balladsingers and marches not as a regiment but as a boundless canaillewithout drill uniform captaincy or billet with huge overproportion of drummers you would say a regiment gone wholly to the drum with hardly a good musket to be seen in itmore a canaille than a regiment canaille of all the loudsounding levities and general winnowings of chaos marching through the world in a most ominous manner proclaiming audibly if you have ears twelfth hour of the night ancient graves yawning pale clammy puseyisms screeching in their windingsheets owls busy in the city regions many goblins abroad awake ye living dream no more arise to judgment chaos and gehenna are broken loose the devil with his bedlams must be flung in chains again and the last of the days is about to dawn such is literature to the reflective soul at this moment  but what now concerns us most is the circumstance that here too the demand is vocables still vocables in all appointed courses of activity and paved careers for human genius and in this unpaved unappointed broadest career of literature broad way that leadeth to destruction for so many the one duty laid upon you is still talk talk talk well with pen or tongue and it shall be well with you do not talk well it shall be ill with you to wag the tongue with dexterous acceptability there is for human worth and faculty in our england of the nineteenth century that one method of emergence and no other silence you would say means annihilation for the englishman of the nineteenth century the worth that has not spoken itself is not or is potentially only and as if it were not vox is the god of this universe if you have human intellect it avails nothing unless you either make it into beaverism or talk with it make it into beaverism and gather money or else make talk with it and gather what you can such is everywhere the demand for talk among us to which of course the supply is proportionate  from dinners up to woolsacks and divine mitres here in england much may be gathered by talk without talk of the human sort nothing is society become wholly a bag of wind then ballasted by guineas are our interests in it as a sounding brass and a tinkling cymbalin army or navy when unhappily we have war on hand there is almost against our will some kind of demand for certain of the silent talents but in peace that too passes into mere demand of the ostentations of the pipeclays and the blank cartridges andexcept that naval men are occasionally on long voyages forced to hold their tongue and converse with the dumb elements and illimitable oceans that moan and rave there without you and within you which is a great advantage to the naval manour poor united services have to make conversational windbags and ostentational paperlanterns of themselves or do worse even as the others   my friends must i assert then what surely all men know though all men seem to have forgotten it that in the learned professions as in the unlearned and in human things throughout in every place and in every time the true function of intellect is not that of talking but of understanding and discerning with a view to performing an intellect may easily talk too much and perform too little gradually if it get into the noxious habit of talk there will less and less performance come of it talk being so delightfully handy in comparison with work and at last there will no work or thought of work be got from it at all talk except as the preparation for work is worth almost nothingsometimes it is worth infinitely less than nothing and becomes little conscious of playing such a fatal part the general summary of pretentious nothingnesses and the chief of all the curses the posterity of adam are liable to in this sublunary world would you discover the atropos of human virtue the sure destroyer by painless extinction of human veracities performances and capabilities to perform or to be veraciousit is this you have it here  unwise talk is matchless in unwisdom unwise work if it but persist is everywhere struggling towards correction and restoration to health for it is still in contact with nature and all nature incessantly contradicts it and will heal it or annihilate it not so with unwise talk which addresses itself regardless of veridical nature to the universal suffrages and can if it be dexterous find harbor there till all the suffrages are bankrupt and gone to houndsditch nature not interfering with her protest till then false speech definable as the acme of unwise speech is capable as we already said of becoming the falsest of all things falsest of all thingsand whither will the general deluge of that in parliament and synagogue in book and broadside carry you and your affairs my friend when once they are embarked on it as now   parliament parliamentum is by express appointment the talking apparatus yet not in parliament either is the essential function by any means talk not to speak your opinion well but to have a good and just opinion worth speakingfor every parliament as for every man this latter is the point contrive to have a true opinion you will get it told in some way better or worse and it will be a blessing to all creatures have a false opinion and tell it with the tongue of angels what can that profit the better you tell it the worse it will be  in parliament and out of parliament and everywhere in this universe your one salvation is that you can discern with just insight and follow with noble valor what the law of the case before you is what the appointment of the maker in regard to it has been get this out of one man you are saved fail to get this out of the most august parliament wrapt in the sheepskins of a thousand years you are lostyour parliament and you and all your sheepskins are lost beautiful talk is by no means the most pressing want in parliament we have had some reasonable modicum of talk in parliament what talk has done for us in parliament and is now doing the dullest of us at length begins to see  much has been said of parliaments breeding men to business of the training an official man gets in this school of argument and talk he is here inured to patience tolerance sees what is what in the nation and in the nations government attains official knowledge official courtesy and mannersin short is polished at all points into official articulation and here better than elsewhere qualifies himself to be a governor of men so it is saiddoubtless i think he will see and suffer much in parliament and inure himself to several thingshe will with what eyes he has gradually see parliament itself for one thing what a highsoaring helplessly floundering everbabbling yet inarticulate dark dumb entity it is certainly one of the strangest under the sun just now which doubtless if he have in view to get measures voted there one day will be an important acquisition for him but as to breeding himself for a doer of work much more for a king or chief of doers here in this element of talk as to that i confess the fatalest doubts or rather alas i have no doubt alas it is our fatalest misery just now not easily alterable and yet urgently requiring to be altered that no british man can attain to be a statesman or chief of workers till he has first proved himself a chief of talkers which mode of trial for a worker is it not precisely of all the trials you could set him upon the falsest and unfairest  nay i doubt much you are not likely ever to meet the fittest material for a statesman or chief of workers in such an element as that your potential chief of workers will he come there at all to try whether he can talk your poor tenpound franchisers and electoral world generally in love with eloquent talk are they the likeliest to discern what man it is that has worlds of silent work in him no or is such a man even if born in the due rank for it the likeliest to present himself and court their most sweet voices again no  the age that admires talk so much can have little discernment for inarticulate work or for anything that is deep and genuine nobody or hardly anybody having in himself an earnest sense for truth how can anybody recognize an inarticulate veracity or naturefact of any kind a human doer especially who is the most complex profound and inarticulate of all natures facts nobody can recognize him till once he is patented get some public stamp of authenticity and has been articulately proclaimed and asserted to be a doer to the worshipper of talk such a one is a sealed book an excellent human soul direct from heavenhow shall any excellence of man become recognizable to this unfortunate not except by announcing and placarding itself as excellentwhich i reckon it above other things will probably be in no great haste to do  wisdom the divine message which every soul of man brings into this world the divine prophecy of what the new man has got the new and peculiar capability to do is intrinsically of silent nature it cannot at once or completely at all be read off in words for it is written in abstruse facts of endowment position desire opportunity granted to the maninterprets itself in presentiments vague struggles passionate endeavors and is only legible in whole when his work is done not by the noble monitions of nature but by the ignoble is a man much tempted to publish the secret of his soul in words words if he have a secret will be forever inadequate to it words do but disturb the real answer of fact which could be given to it disturb obstruct and will in the end abolish and render impossible said answer no grand doer in this world can be a copious speaker about his doings william the silent spoke himself best in a country liberated oliver cromwell did not shine in rhetoric goethe when he had but a book in view found that he must say nothing even of that if it was to succeed with him  then as to politeness and breeding to business an official man must be bred to business of course he must and not for essence only but even for the manners of office he requires breeding besides his intrinsic faculty whatever that may be he must be cautious vigilant discreetabove all things he must be reticent patient polite certain of these qualities are by nature imposed upon men of station and they are trained from birth to some exercise of them this constitutes their one intrinsic qualification for officethis is their one advantage in the new downing street projected for this new era and it will not go for much in that institution one advantage or temporary advantage against which there are so many counterbalances it is the indispensable preliminary for office but by no means the complete outfita miserable outfit where there is nothing farther  will your lordship give me leave to say that practically the intrinsic qualities will presuppose these preliminaries too but by no means vice versa that on the whole if you have got the intrinsic qualities you have got everything and the preliminaries will prove attainable but that if you have got only the preliminaries you have yet got nothing a man of real dignity will not find it impossible to bear himself in a dignified manner a man of real understanding and insight will get to know as the fruit of his very first study what the laws of his situation are and will conform to these rough old samuel johnson blustering boreas and rugged arctic bear as he often was defined himself justly withal as a polite man a noble manful attitude of soul is his a clear true and loyal sense of what others are and what he himself is shines through the rugged coating of him comes out as grave deep rhythmus when his king honors him and he will not bandy compliments with his kingis traceable too in his indignant trampling down of the chesterfield patronages tailormade insolences and contradictions of sinners which may be called his revolutionary movements hard and peremptory by the law of them these could not be soft like his constitutional ones when men and kings took him for somewhat like the thing he was given a noble man i think your lordship may expect by and by a polite man no politer man was to be found in britain than the rustic robert burns high duchesses were captivated with the chivalrous ways of the man recognized that here was the true chivalry and divine nobleness of bearingas indeed they well might now when the peasant god and norse thor had come down among them again chivalry this if not as they do chivalry in drury lane or westend drawingrooms yet as they do it in valhalla and the general assembly of the gods  for indeed who invented chivalry politeness or anything that is noble and melodious and beautiful among us except precisely the like of johnson and of burns the select few who in the generations of this world were wise and valiant they in spite of all the tremendous majority of blockheads and slothful bellyworshippers and noisy ugly persons have devised whatsoever is noble in the manners of man to man i expect they will learn to be polite your lordship when you give them a chancenor is it as a school of human culture for this or for any other grace or gift that parliament will be found firstrate or indispensable as experience in the river is indispensable to the ferryman so is knowledge of his parliament to the british peel or chathamso was knowledge of the oeildeboeuf to the french choiseul where and how said river whether parliament with wilkeses or oeildeboeuf with pompadours can be waded boated swum how the miscellaneous cargoes measures so called can be got across it according to their kinds and landed alive on the hither side as factswe have all of us our ferries in this world and must know the river and its ways or get drowned some day in that sense practice in parliament is indispensable to the british statesman but not in any other sense  a school too of manners and of several other things the parliament will doubtless be to the aspirant statesman a school better or worseas the oeildeboeuf likewise was and as all scenes where men work or live are sure to be especially where many men work together the very rubbing against one another will grind and polish off their angularities into roundness into politeness after a sort and the official man place him how you may will never want for schooling of extremely various kinds a firstrate school one cannot call this parliament for himi fear to say what rate at present in so far as it teaches him vigilance patience courage toughness of lungs or of soul and skill in any kind of swimming it is a good school in so far as it forces him to speak where nature orders silence and even lest all the world should learn his secret which often enough would kill his secret and little profit the world forces him to speak falsities vague ambiguities and the frothdialect usual in parliaments in these times it may be considered one of the worst schools ever devised by man and i think may almost challenge the oeildeboeuf to match it in badness  parliament will train your men to the manners required of a statesman but in a much less degree to the intrinsic functions of one to these latter it is capable of mistraining as nothing else can parliament will train you to talk and above all things to hear with patience unlimited quantities of foolish talk to tell a good story for yourself and to make it appear that you have done your work this especially in constitutional countries is somethingand yet in all countries constitutional ones too it is intrinsically nothing probably even less for it is not the function of any mortal in downing street or elsewhere here below to wag the tongue of him and make it appear that he has done work but to wag some quite other organs of him and to do work there is no danger of his works appearing by and by such an accomplishment even in constitutional countries i grieve to say may become much less than nothing have you at all computed how much less the human creature who has once given way to satisfying himself with appearances to seeking his salvation in appearances the moral life of such human creature is rapidly bleeding out of him depend upon it beelzebub satan or however you may name the too authentic genius of eternal death has got that human creature in his claws by and by you will have a dead parliamentary bagpipe and your living man fled away without return  such parliamentary bagpipes i myself have heard play tunes much to the satisfaction of the people every tune lies within their compass and their mind for they still call it mind is ready as a hurdygurdy on turning of the handle my lords this question now before the houseye heavens o ye divine silences was there in the womb of chaos then such a product liable to be evoked by human art as that same while the galleries were all applausive of heart and the fourth estate looked with eyes enlightened as if you had touched its lips with a staff dipped in honeyi have sat with reflections too ghastly to be uttered a poor human creature and learned friend once possessed of many fine gifts possessed of intellect veracity and manful conviction on a variety of objects has he now lost all thatconverted all that into a glistering phosphorescence which can show itself on the outside while within all is dead chaotic dark a painted sepulchre full of deadmens bones discernment knowledge intellect in the human sense of the words this man has now none his opinion you do not ask on any matter on the matter he has no opinion judgment or insight only on what may be said about the matter how it may be argued of what tune may be played upon it to enlighten the eyes of the fourth estate  such a soul though to the eye he still keeps tumbling about in the parliamentary element and makes motions and passes bills for aught i knoware we to define him as a living one or as a dead partridge the almanacmaker whose publications still regularly appear is known to be dead the dog that was drowned last summer and that floats up and down the thames with ebb and flood ever sinceis it not dead alas in the hot months you meet here and there such a floating dog and at length if you often use the river steamers get to know him by sight there he is again still astir there in his quasistygian element you dejectedly exclaim perhaps reading your morning newspaper at the moment and reflect with a painful oppression of nose and imagination on certain completed professors of parliamentary eloquence in modern times dead long since but not resting daily doing motions in that westminster region stilldaily from vauxhall to blackfriars and back again and cannot get away at all daily from newspaper or river steamer you may see him at some point of his fated course hovering in the eddies stranded in the ooze or rapidly progressing with flood or ebb and daily the odor of him is getting more intolerable daily the condition of him appeals more tragically to gods and men   nature admits no lie most men profess to be aware of this but few in any measure lay it to heart except in the departments of mere material manipulation it seems to be taken practically as if this grand truth were merely a polite flourish of rhetoric what is a lie the question is worth asking once and away by the practical english mind  a voluntary spoken divergence from the fact as it stands as it has occurred and will proceed to develop itself this clearly if adopted by any man will so far forth mislead him in all practical dealing with the fact till he cast that statement out of him and reject it as an unclean poisonous thing he can have no success in dealing with the fact if such spoken divergence from the truth be involuntary we lament it as a misfortune and are entitled at least the speaker of it is to lament it extremely as the most palpable of all misfortunes as the indubitablest losing of his way and turning aside from the goal instead of pressing towards it in the race set before him if the divergence is voluntarythere superadds itself to our sorrow a just indignation we call the voluntary spoken divergence a lie and justly abhor it as the essence of human treason and baseness the desertion of a man to the enemy of men against himself and his brethren a lost deserter who has gone over to the enemy called satan and cannot but be lost in the adventure such is every liar with the tongue and such in all nations is he at all epochs considered men pull his nose and kick him out of doors and by peremptory expressive methods signify that they can and will have no trade with him such is spoken divergence from the fact so fares it with the practiser of that sad art  but have we well considered a divergence in thought from what is the fact have we considered the man whose very thought is a lie to him and to us he too is a frightful man repeating about this universe on every hand what is not and driven to repeat it the sure herald of ruin to all that follow him that know with his knowledge and would you learn how to get a mendacious thought there is no surer recipe than carrying a loose tongue the lying thought you already either have it or will soon get it by that method he who lies with his very tongue he clearly enough has long ceased to think truly in his mind does he in any sense think all his thoughts and imaginations if they extend beyond mere beaverisms astucities and sensualisms are false incomplete perverse untrue even to himself he has become a false mirror of this universe not a small mirror only but a crooked bedimmed and utterly deranged one but all loose tongues too are akin to lying ones are insincere at the best and go rattling with little meaning the thought lying languid at a great distance behind them if thought there be behind them at all gradually there will be none or little how can the thought of such a man what he calls thought be other than false  alas the palpable liar with his tongue does at least know that he is lying and has or might have some faint vestige of remorse and chance of amendment but the impalpable liar whose tongue articulates mere accepted commonplaces cants and babblement which means only admire me call me an excellent stumporatorof him what hope is there his thought what thought he had lies dormant inspired only to invent vocables and plausibilities while the tongue goes so glib the thought is absent gone a woolgathering getting itself drugged with the applausive hear hearwhat will become of such a man his idle thought has run all to seed and grown false and the giver of falsities the inner light of his mind is gone out all his light is mere putridity and phosphorescence henceforth whosoever is in quest of ruin let him with assurance follow that man he or no one is on the right road to it  good heavens from the wisest thought of a man to the actual truth of a thing as it lies in nature there is one would suppose a sufficient interval consider itand what other intervals we introduce the faithfulest most glowing word of a man is but an imperfect image of the thought such as it is that dwells within him his best word will never but with error convey his thought to other minds and then between his poor thought and natures fact which is the thought of the eternal there may be supposed to lie some discrepancies some shortcomings speak your sincerest think your wisest there is still a great gulf between you and the fact and now do not speak your sincerest and what will inevitably follow out of that do not think your wisest but think only your plausiblest your showiest for parliamentary purposes where will you land with that guidancei invite the british parliament and all the parliamentary and other electors of great britain to reflect on this till they have well understood it and then to ask each of himself what probably the horoscopes of the british parliament at this epoch of worldhistory may be  fail by any sin or any misfortune to discover what the truth of the fact is you are lost so far as that fact goes if your thought do not image truly but do image falsely the fact you will vainly try to work upon the fact the fact will not obey you the fact will silently resist you and ever with silent invincibility will go on resisting you till you do get to image it truly instead of falsely no help for you whatever except in attaining to a true image of the fact needless to vote a false image true vote it revote it by overwhelming majorities by jubilant unanimities and universalities read it thrice or three hundred times pass acts of parliament upon it till the statutebook can hold no moreit helps not a whit the thing is not so the thing is otherwise than so and adams whole posterity voting daily on it till the world finish will not alter it a jot can the sublimest sanhedrim constitutional parliament or other collective wisdom of the world persuade fire not to burn sulphuric acid to be sweet milk or the moon to become green cheese the fact is much the reverseand even the constitutional british parliament abstains from such arduous attempts as these latter in the voting line and leaves the multiplicationtable the chemical mechanical and other qualities of material substances to take their own course being aware that voting and perorating and reporting in hansard will not in the least alter any of these which is indisputably wise of the british parliament  unfortunately the british parliament does not at present quite know that all manner of things and relations of things spiritual equally with material all manner of qualities entities existences whatsoever in this strange visible and invisible universe are equally inflexible of nature that they will one and all with precisely the same obstinacy continue to obey their own law not our law deaf as the adder to all charm of parliamentary eloquence and of voting never so often repeated silently but inflexibly and forevermore declining to change themselves even as sulphuric acid declines to become sweet milk though you vote so to the end of the world this it sometimes seems to me is not quite sufficiently laid hold of by the british and other parliaments just at present which surely is a great misfortune to said parliaments for it would appear the grand point after all constitutional improvements and such wagging of wigs in westminster as there has been is precisely what it was before any constitution was yet heard of or the first official wig had budded out of nothing namely to ascertain what the truth of your question in nature really is verily so in this time and place as in all past and in all future times and places today in st stephens where constitutional philanthropical and other great things lie in the mortarkit even as on the plain of shinar long ago where a certain tower likewise of a very philanthropic nature indeed one of the desirablest towers i ever heard of was to be builtbut couldnt my friends i do not laugh truly i am more inclined to weep  get by six hundred and fiftyeight votes or by no vote at all by the silent intimation of your own eyesight and understanding given you direct out of heaven and more sacred to you than anything earthly and than all things earthlya correct image of the fact in question as god and nature have made it that is the one thing needful with that it shall be well with you in whatsoever you have to do with said fact get by the sublimest constitutional methods belauded by all the world an incorrect image of the fact so shall it be other than well with you so shall you have laud from able editors and vociferous masses of mistaken human creatures and from the natures fact continuing quite silently the same as it was contradiction and that only what else will nature change or sulphuric acid become sweet milk for the noise of vociferous blockheads surely not nature i assure you has not the smallest intention of doing so  on the contrary nature keeps silently a most exact savingsbank and official register correct to the most evanescent item debtor and creditor in respect to one and all of us silently marks down creditor by such and such an unseen act of veracity and heroism debtor to such a loud blustery blunder twentyseven million strong or one unit strong and to all acts and words and thoughts executed in consequence of thatdebtor debtor debtor day after day rigorously as fate for this is fate that is writing and at the end of the account you will have it all to pay my friend there is the rub not the infinitesimalest fraction of a farthing but will be found marked there for you and against you and with the due rate of interest you will have to pay it neatly completely as sure as you are alive you will have to pay it even in money if you liveand poor slave do you think there is no payment but in money there is a payment which nature rigorously exacts of men and also of nations and this i think when her wrath is sternest in the shape of dooming you to possess money to possess it to have your bloated vanities fostered into monstrosity by it your foul passions blown into explosion by it your heart and perhaps your very stomach ruined with intoxication by it your poor life and all its manful activities stunned into frenzy and comatose sleep by itin one word as the old prophets said your soul forever lost by it your soul so that through the eternities you shall have no soul or manful trace of ever having had a soul but only for certain fleeting moments shall have had a moneybag and have given soul and heart and frightfuler still stomach itself in fatal exchange for the same you wretched mortal stumbling about in a gods temple and thinking it a brutal cookeryshop nature when her scorn of a slave is divinest and blazes like the blinding lightning against his slavehood often enough flings him a bag of money silently saying that away thy doom is that  for no man and for no body or biggest multitude of men has nature favor if they part company with her facts and her excellent stumporator eloquent parliamentary deaddog making motions passing bills reported in the morning newspapers and reputed the best speaker going from the universe of fact he has turned himself away he is gone into partnership with the universe of phantasm finds it profitablest to deal in forged notes while the foolish shopkeepers will accept them nature for such a man and for nations that follow such has her patibulary forks and prisons of death everlastingdost thou doubt it unhappy mortal nature otherwise were herself a chaos and no cosmos nature was not made by an impostor not she i think rife as they arein fact by money or otherwise to the uttermost fraction of a calculable and incalculable value we have each one of us to settle the exact balance in the abovesaid savingsbank or official register kept by nature creditor by the quantity of veracities we have done debtor by the quantity of falsities and errors there is not by any conceivable device the faintest hope of escape from that issue for one of us nor for all of us  this used to be a wellknown fact and daily still in certain edifices steeplehouses josshouses temples sacred or other everywhere spread over the world we hear some dim mumblement of an assertion that such is still what it was always and will forever be the fact but meseems it has terribly fallen out of memory nevertheless and from dan to beersheba one in vain looks out for a man that really in his heart believes it in his heart he believes as we perceive that scrip will yield dividends but that heaven too has an office of account and unerringly marks down against us or for us whatsoever thing we do or say or think and treasures up the same in regard to every creaturethis i do not so well perceive that he believes poor blockhead no he reckons that all payment is in money or approximately representable by money finds money go a strange course disbelieves the parson and his day of judgment discerns not that there is any judgment except in the small or big debt court and lives for the present on that strange footing in this universe the unhappy mortal what is the use of his civilizations and his useful knowledges if he have forgotten that beginning of human knowledge the earliest perception of the awakened human soul in this world the first dictate of heavens inspiration to all men i cannot account him a man any more but only a kind of human beaver who has acquired the art of ciphering he lives without rushing hourly towards suicide because his soul with all its noble aspirations and imaginations is sunk at the bottom of his stomach and lies torpid there unaspiring unimagining unconsidering as if it were the vital principle of a mere fourfooted beaver a soul of a man appointed for spinning cotton and making money or alas for merely shooting grouse and gathering rent to whom eternity and immortality and all human noblenesses and divine facts that did not tell upon the stockexchange were meaningless fables empty as the inarticulate wind he will recover out of that persuasion one day or be ground to powder i believe  to such a pass by our beaverisms and our mammonisms by canting of prevenient grace everywhere and so boarding and lodging our poor souls upon supervenient moonshine everywhere for centuries long by our sordid stupidities and our idle babblings through faith in the divine stumporator and constitutional palaver or august sanhedrim of oratorshave men and nations been reduced in this sad epoch i cannot call them happy nations i must call them nations like to perish nations that will either begin to recover or else soon die recovery is to be hopedyes since there is in nature an almighty beneficence and his voice divinely terrible can be heard in the worldwhirlwind now even as from of old and forevermore recovery or else destruction and annihilation is very certain and the crisis too comes rapidly on but by stumporator and constitutional palaver however perfected my hopes of recovery have long vanished not by them i should imagine but by something far the reverse of them shall we return to truth and god  i tell you the ignoble intellect cannot think the truth even within its own limits and when it seriously tries and of the ignoble intellect that does not seriously try and has even reached the ignobleness of seriously trying the reverse and of lying with its very tongue what are we to expect it is frightful to consider sincere wise speech is but an imperfect corollary and insignificant outer manifestation of sincere wise thought he whose very tongue utters falsities what has his heart long been doing the thought of his heart is not its wisest not even its wisest it is its foolishestand even of that we have a false and foolish copy and it is natures fact or the thought of the eternal which we want to arrive at in regard to the matterwhich if we do not arrive at we shall not save the matter we shall drive the matter into shipwreck  the practice of modern parliaments with reporters sitting among them and twentyseven millions mostly fools listening to them fills me with amazement in regard to no thing or fact as god and nature have made it can you get so much as the real thought of any honorable headeven so far as it the said honorable head still has capacity of thought what the honorable gentlemans wisest thought is or would have been had he led from birth a life of piety and earnest veracity and heroic virtue you and he himself poor deepsunk creature vainly conjecture as from immense dim distances far in the rear of what he is led to say and again far in the rear of what his thought issurely long infinitudes beyond all he could ever thinklies the thought of god almighty the image itself of the fact the thing you are in quest of and must find or do worse even his the honorable gentlemans actual bewildered falsified vague surmise or quasithought even this is not given you but only some falsified copy of this such as he fancies may suit the reporters and twentyseven millions mostly fools and upon that latter you are to actwith what success do you expect that is the thought you are to take for the thought of the eternal mindthat doubledistilled falsity of a blockheadism from one who is false even as a blockhead  do i make myself plain to mr peters understanding perhaps it will surprise him less that parliamentary eloquence excites more wonder than admiration in me that the fate of countries governed by that sublime alchemy does not appear the hopefulest just now not by that method i should apprehend will the heavens be scaled and the earth vanquished not by that but by another   a benevolent man once proposed to me but without pointing out the methods how this plan of reform for our benighted world to cut from one generation whether the current one or the next all the tongues away prohibiting literature too and appoint at least one generation to pass its life in silence there thou one blessed generation from the vain jargon of babble thou art beneficently freed whatsoever of truth traditionary or original thy own godgiven intellect shall point out to thee as true that thou wilt go and do in doing of it there will be a verdict for thee if a verdict of true thou wilt hold by it and ever again do it if of untrue thou wilt never try it more but be eternally delivered from it to do aught because the vain hearsays order thee and the big clamors of the sanhedrim of fools is not thy lotwhat worlds of misery are spared thee natures voice heard in thy own inner being and the sacred commandment of thy maker these shall be thy guidances thou happy tongueless generation what is good and beautiful thou shalt know not merely what is said to be so not to talk of thy doings and become the envy of surrounding flunkies but to taste of the fruit of thy doings themselves is thine what the eternal laws will sanction for thee do what the froth gospels and multitudinous longeared hearsays never so loudly bid all this is already chaff for theedrifting rapidly along thou knowest whitherward on the eternal winds  good heavens if such a plan were practicable how the chaff might be winnowed out of every man and out of all human things and ninetynine hundredths of our whole big universe spiritual and practical might blow itself away as mere torrents of chaff whole tradewinds of chaff many miles deep rushing continually with the voice of whirlwinds towards a certain fire which knows how to deal with it ninetynine hundredths blown away all the lies blown away and some skeleton of a spiritual and practical universe left standing for us which were true o heavens is it forever impossible then by a generation that had no tongue it really might be done but not so easily by one that had tongues platforms parliaments and fourthestates unfettered presses periodical and stationary literatures we are nearly all gone to tongue i think and our fate is very questionable   truly it is little known at present and ought forthwith to become better known what ruin to all nobleness and fruitfulness and blessedness in the genius of a poor mortal you generally bring about by ordering him to speak to do all things with a view to their being seen few good and fruitful things ever were done or could be done on those terms silence silence and be distant ye profane with your jargonings and superficial babblements when a man has anything to do eyeservicedost thou know what that is poor englandeyeservice is all the man can do in these sad circumstances grows to be all he has the idea of doing of his or any other mans ever doing or ever having done in any circumstances sad enough alas it is our saddest woe of alltoo sad for being spoken of at present while all or nearly all men consider it an imaginary sorrow on my part  let the young english soul in whatever logicshop and nonsenseverse establishment of an eton oxford edinburgh halle salamanca or other high finishingschool he may be getting his young idea taught how to speak and spout and print sermons and reviewarticles and thereby show himself and fond patrons that it is an idealay this solemnly to heart this is my deepest counsel to him the idea you have once spoken if it even were an idea is no longer yours it is gone from you so much life and virtue is gone and the vital circulations of your self and your destiny and activity are henceforth deprived of it if you could not get it spoken if you could still constrain it into silence so much the richer are you better keep your idea while you can let it still circulate in your blood and there fructify inarticulately inciting you to good activities giving to your whole spiritual life a ruddier health when the time does come for speaking it you will speak it all the more concisely the more expressively appropriately and if such a time should never come have you not already acted it and uttered it as no words can think of this my young friend for there is nothing truer nothing more forgotten in these shabby goldlaced days incontinence is half of all the sins of man and among the many kinds of that base vice i know none baser or at present half so fell and fatal as that same incontinence of tongue public speaking parliamentary eloquence it is a moloch before whom young souls are made to pass through the fire they enter weeping or rejoicing fond parents consecrating them to the redhot idol as to the highest god and they come out spiritually dead dead enough to live thenceforth a galvanic life of mere stumporatory screeching and gibbering words without wisdom without veracity without conviction more than skindeep a divine gift that it is a thing admired by the vulgar and rewarded with seats in the cabinet and other preciosities but to the wise it is a thing not admirable not adorable unmelodious rather and ghastly and bodeful as the speech of sheeted spectres in the streets at midnight  be not a public orator thou brave young british man thou that art now growing to be something not a stumporator if thou canst help it appeal not to the vulgar with its long ears and its seats in the cabinet not by spoken words to the vulgar hate the profane vulgar and bid it begone appeal by silent work by silent suffering if there be no work to the gods who have nobler than seats in the cabinet for thee talent for literature thou hast such a talent believe it not be slow to believe it to speak or to write nature did not peremptorily order thee but to work she did and know this there never was a talent even for real literature not to speak of talents lost and damned in doing sham literature but was primarily a talent for something infinitely better of the silent kind of literature in all ways be shy rather than otherwise at present there where thou art work work whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do itwith the hand of a man not of a phantasm be that thy unnoticed blessedness and exceeding great reward thy words let them be few and wellordered love silence rather than speech in these tragic days when for very speaking the voice of man has fallen inarticulate to man and hearts in this loud babbling sit dark and dumb towards one another wittyabove all oh be not witty none of us is bound to be witty under penalties to be wise and true we all are under the terriblest penalties  brave young friend dear to me and known too in a sense though never seen nor to be seen by meyou are what i am not in the happy case to learn to be something and to do something instead of eloquently talking about what has been and was done and may be the old are what they are and will not alter our hope is in you englands hope and the worlds is that there may once more be millions such instead of units as now macte i fausto pede and may future generations acquainted again with the silences and once more cognizant of what is noble and faithful and divine look back on us with pity and incredulous astonishment
