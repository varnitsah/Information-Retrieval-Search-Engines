street in front the outside door is opened and slammed       footsteps pound along the hall the door in the rear is pushed       open and nora and tom rush in breathlessly nora is a       bright vivacious redhaired girl of elevenpretty after an       elfish mischievous fashionlighthearted and robust        tom resembles nora in disposition and appearance a healthy       goodhumoured youngster with a shock of sandy hair he is a year       younger than nora they are followed into the room a moment       later by their brother billy who is evidently loftily       disgusted with their antics billy is a fourteenyearold       replica of his father whom he imitates even to the hoarse       domineering tone of voice  carmody grumpily ah here you are the lot of you shut that door after you whats the use in me spendin money for coal if all you do is to let the cold night in the room itself  nora hopping over to himteasingly me and tom had a race papa i beat him she sticks her tongue out

disappears unnoticed under the table  carmody its a great wonder you didnt forget itand me without a chew he bites off a piece and tucks it into his cheek  tom suddenly clutching at his leg with a yell ouch darn you he kicks frantically at something under the table but nora scrambles out at the other end grinning  carmody angrily shut your big mouth what is the matter with you at all  tom

her nora itll drive himself out of the house maybe bad cess to him and him stayin half the night nora waits to hear no more but darts back shutting the door behind her billy takes the chair in front of the table carmody sits down again with a groan the rheumatics are in my leg again shakes his head if eileens in bed long those bratsll have the house down  billy eileen aint sick very bad is she  carmody easily its a cold only she has then mournfully your poor mother died of the same billy looks awed ara well its gods will i suppose but where the moneyll come from i dunno with a disparaging glance at his son theyll not be raisin your wages soon ill be bound  billy surlily naw the old boss never gives no one a raise less he has to hes a tightwad for fair  carmody still scanning him with contempt five dollars a weekfor a strappin lad the like of you its shamed you should be to own up to it a divil of a lot of good it was for me to go against eileens wish and let you leave off your schoolin this year like you wanted thinkin the money youd earn at work would help with the house  billy aw goin to school didnt do me no good the teachers was all down on me i couldnt learn nothin there  carmody disgustedly nor any other place im thinkin youre that thick there is a noise from the stairs in the hall whisht its the doctor comin down from eileen whatll he say i wonder the door in the rear is opened and doctor gaynor enters he is a stout bald middleaged man forceful of speech who in the case of patients of the carmodys class dictates rather than advises carmody adopts a whining tone aw doctor and hows eileen now have you got her cured of the weakness  gaynor does not answer this but comes forward into the room holding out two slips of paperdictatorially here are two prescriptions thatll have to be filled immediately  carmody frowning you take them billy and run round to the drug store gaynor hands them to billy  billy give me the money then  carmody reaches down into his trousers pocket with a sigh how much will they come to doctor  gaynor about a dollar i guess  carmody protestingly a dollar sure its expensive medicines youre givin her for a bit of a cold he meets the doctors cold glance of contempt and he wiltsgrumblingly as he peels a dollar bill off a small roll and gives it to billy bring back the changeif there is any and none of your tricks for ill stop at the drug store myself tomorrow and ask the man how much it was  billy aw what do you think i am he takes the money and goes out  carmody grudgingly take a chair doctor and tell me whats wrong with eileen  gaynor seating himself by the tablegravely your daughter is very seriously ill  carmody irritably aw doctor didnt i know youd be sayin that anyway  gaynor ignoring this remarkcoldly your daughter has tuberculosis of the lungs  carmody with puzzled awe tooberclosis  gaynor consumption if that makes it plainer to you  carmody with dazed terrorafter a pause consumption eileen with sudden anger what lie is it youre tellin me  gaynor icily look here carmody im not here to stand for your insults  carmody bewilderingly dont be angry now at what i said sure im out of my wits entirely eileen to have the consumption ah doctor sure you must be mistaken  gaynor theres no chance for a mistake im sorry to say her right lung is badly affected  carmody desperately its a bad cold only maybe  gaynor curtly dont talk nonsense carmody groans gaynor continues authoritatively she will have to go to a sanatorium at once she ought to have been sent to one months ago the girls been keeping up on her nerve when she should have been in bed and its given the disease a chance to develop casts a look of indignant scorn at carmody who is sitting staring at the floor with an expression of angry stupor on his face its a wonder to me you didnt see the condition she was in and force her to take care of herself why the girls nothing but skin and bone  carmody with vague fury god blast it  gaynor no your kind never realises things till the crash comesusually when its too late she kept on doing her work i supposetaking care of her brothers and sisters washing cooking sweeping looking after your comfortworn outwhen she should have been in bedand he gets to his feet with a harsh laugh but whats the use of talking the damage is done weve got to set to work to repair it at once ill write tonight to dr stanton of the hill farm sanatorium and find out if he has a vacancy and if luck is with us we can send her there at once the sooner the better  carmody his face growing red with rage is it sendin eileen away to a hospital youd be exploding then youll not youll get that notion out of your head damn quick its all nonsense youre stuffin me with and lies makin things out to be the worst in the world ill not believe a word of eileen having the consumption at all its doctors notions to be always lookin for a sickness thatd kill you shell not move a step out of here and i say so and im her father  gaynor who has been staring at him with contemptcoldly angry you refuse to let your daughter go to a sanatorium  carmody i do  gaynor threateningly then ill have to report her case to the society for the prevention of tuberculosis of this county and tell them of your refusal to help her  carmody wavering a bit report all you like and be damned to you  gaynor ignoring the interruptionimpressively a majority of the most influential men of this city are behind the society do you know that grimly well find a way to move you carmody if you try to be stubborn  carmody thoroughly frightened but still protesting ara doctor you dont see the way of it at all if eileen goes to the hospital whos to be takin care of the others and mindin the house when im off to work  gaynor you can easily hire some woman  carmody at once furious again hire dyou think im a millionaire itself  gaynor contemptuously thats where the shoe pinches eh in a rage im not going to waste any more words on you carmody but im damn well going to see this thing through you might as well give in first as last  carmody wailing but wheres the money comin from  gaynor brutally thats your concern dont lie about your poverty youve a steady wellpaid job and plenty of money to throw away on drunken sprees ill bet the weekly fee at the hill farm is only seven dollars you can easily afford thatthe price of a few rounds of drinks  carmody seven dollars and ill have to pay a woman to come inand the four of the children eatin their heads off glory be to god ill not have a penny saved for me old ageand then its the poorhouse  gaynor curtly dont talk nonsense  carmody ah doctor its the truth im tellin you  gaynor well perhaps i can get the society to pay half for your daughterif youre really as hard up as you pretend theyre willing to do that where it seems necessary  carmody brightening ah doctor thank you  gaynor abruptly then its all settled  carmody grudginglytrying to make the best of it ill do my best for eileen if its needfuland youll not be tellin them people about it at all doctor  gaynor not unless you force me to  carmody and theyll pay the half surely  gaynor ill see what i can dofor your daughters sake not yours understand  carmody god bless you doctor grumblingly its the whole of it they ought to be payin im thinkin and them with bags of money tis them builds the hospitals and why should they be wantin the poor like me to support them  gaynor disgustedly bah abruptly ill telephone to doctor stanton tomorrow morning then ill know something definite when i come to see your daughter in the afternoon  carmody darkly youll be comin again tomorrow half to himself leave it to the likes of you to be drainin a man dry  gaynor has gone out to the hall in rear and does not hear this last remark there is a loud knock from the outside door the doctor comes back into the room carrying his hat and overcoat  gaynor theres someone knocking  carmody wholl it be ah its fred nicholls maybe in a low voice to gaynor who has started to put on his overcoat eileens young man doctor that shes engaged to marry as you might say  gaynor thoughtfully hmmyesshe spoke of him        as another knock sounds carmody hurries to the rear gaynor       after a moments indecision takes off his overcoat again and       sits down a moment later carmody reenters followed by fred       nicholls who has left his overcoat and hat in the hallway       nicholls is a young fellow of twentythree stockily built       fairhaired handsome in a commonplace conventional mould his       manner is obviously an attempt at suave gentility he has an       easy taking smile and a ready laugh but there is a petty       calculating expression in his small observing blue eyes his       wellfitting readymade clothes are carefully pressed his whole       getup suggests an attitude of manaboutsmalltown       complacency  carmody as they enter i had a mind to phone to your house but i wasnt wishful to disturb you knowin youd be comin to call tonight  nicholls with disappointed concern its nothing serious i hope  carmody grumblingly ah who knows heres the doctor youve not met him  nicholls politely looking at gaynor who inclines his head stiffly i havent had the pleasure of course ive heard  carmody its doctor gaynor this is fred nicholls doctor the two men shake hands with conventional greetings sit down fred thats a good lad and be talkin to the doctor a moment while i go upstairs and see how is eileen shes all alone up there  nicholls certainly mr carmody go aheadand tell her how sorry i am to learn shes under the weather  carmody i will so he goes out  gaynor after a pause in which he is studying nicholls do you happen to be any relative to the albert nicholls who is superintendent over at the downs manufacturing company  nicholls smiling hes sort of a near relativemy father  gaynor ah yes  nicholls with satisfaction i work for the downs company myselfbookkeeper  gaynor miss carmodythe sick girl upstairsshe had a position there also didnt she before her mother died  nicholls yes she had a job as stenographer for a time when she graduated from the business college coursei was already working at the downsand through my fathers influenceyou understand gaynor nods curtly she was getting on finely too and liked the work its too badher mothers death i meanforcing her to give it up and come home to take care of those kids  gaynor its a damn shame thats the main cause of her breakdown  nicholls frowning ive noticed shes been looking badly lately so thats the trouble well its all her fathers faultand her own too because whenever i raised a kick about his making a slave of her she always defended him with a quick glance at the doctorin a confidential tone between us carmodys as selfish as they make em if you want my opinion  gaynor with a growl hes a hog on two legs  nicholls with a gratified smile you bet with a patronising air i hope to get eileen away from all this as soon asthings pick up a little making haste to explain his connection with the dubious household eileen and i have gone around together for yearswent to grammar and high school togetherin different classes of course shes really a corkervery different from the rest of the family youve seenlike her mother shes really educated and knows a lotused to carry off all the prizes at school my folks like her awfully well of course theyd never stand forhim  gaynor youll excuse my curiosityive a good reason for itbut you and miss carmody are engaged arent you carmody said you were  nicholls embarrassed why yes in a waybut nothing definiteno official announcement or anything of that kind its all in the future we have to wait you know with a sentimental smile weve been sort of engaged for years you might say its always been sort of understood between us he laughs awkwardly  gaynor gravely then i can be frank with you id like to be because i may need your help i dont put much faith in any promise carmody makes besides youre bound to know anyway shed tell you  nicholls a look of apprehension coming over his face is itabout her sickness  gaynor yes  nicholls thenits serious  gaynor its pulmonary tuberculosisconsumption  nicholls stunned consumption good heavens after a dazed pauselamely are you sure doctor  gaynor positive nicholls stares at him with vaguely frightened eyes its had a good startthanks to her fathers blind selfishnessbut lets hope that can be overcome the important thing is to ship her off to a sanatorium immediately carmody wouldnt hear of it at first however i managed to bully him into consenting but i dont trust his word thats where you can be of help its up to you to convince him that its imperative she be sent away at oncefor the safety of those around her as well as her own  nicholls confusedly ill do my best doctor as if he couldnt yet believe his earsshuddering good heavens she never said a word aboutbeing so ill shes had a cold but doctordo you think this sanatorium will  gaynor with hearty hopefulness most certainly she has every chance the hill farm has a really surprising record of arrested casesas good as any place in the country of course shell never be able to live as carelessly as before even after the most favourable results shell have to take care of herself apologetically im telling you all this as being the one most intimately concerned i dont count carmody you are the one who will have to assume responsibility for her welfare when she returns to everyday life  nicholls answering as if he were merely talking to screen the thoughts in his mind yescertainly where is this sanatorium doctorvery far away  gaynor half an hour by train to the town the sanatorium is two miles out on the hillsa nice drive youll be able to see her whenever youve a day off its a pleasant trip  nicholls a look of horrified realisation has been creeping into his eyes you saideileen ought to be sent awayfor the sake of those around her  gaynor thats obvious tb is extremely contagious you must know that yet ill bet shes been fondling and kissing those brothers and sisters of hers regardless nicholls fidgets uneasily on his chair and look at this house sealed tight against the fresh air not a window open an inch fuming thats what were up against in the fight with tba total ignorance of the commonest methods of prevention  nicholls his eyes shiftily avoiding the doctors face then the kids might have gotten itby kissing eileen  gaynor it stands to reason thats a common means of communication  nicholls very much shaken yes i suppose it must be but thats terrible isnt it with sudden volubility evidently extremely anxious to wind up this conversation and conceal his thoughts from gaynor ill promise you doctor ill tell carmody straight whats what hell pay attention to me or ill know the reason why  gaynor getting to his feet and picking up his overcoat good boy youve probably saved me a disagreeable squabble i wont wait for carmody the sight of him makes me lose my temper tell him ill be back tomorrow with definite information about the sanatorium  nicholls helping him on with his overcoat anxious to have him go all right doctor  gaynor puts on his hat and do your best to cheer the patient up when you talk to her give her confidence in her ability to get well thats half the battle and shell believe it coming from you  nicholls hastily yes yes ill do all i can  gaynor turns to the door and shakes nicholls hand sympathetically and dont take it to heart too much yourself theres every hope remember that in six months shell come back to you her old self again  nicholls nervously its hard on a fellowso suddenlybut ill rememberand abruptly good night doctor  gaynor good night        he goes out the outer door is heard shutting behind him       nicholls closes the door rear and comes back and sits in the       chair in front of table he rests his chin on his hands and       stares before him a look of desperate frightened calculation       coming into his eyes carmody is heard clumping heavily down       the stairs a moment later he enters his expression is glum and       irritated  carmody coming forward to his chair by the stove has he gone away  nicholls turning on him with a look of repulsion yes he told me to tell you hed be back tomorrow with definite informationabout the sanatorium business  carmody darkly oho he did did he maybe ill surprise him im thinkin its lyin he is about eileens sickness and her lookin as fresh as a daisy with the high colour in her cheeks when i saw her now  nicholls impatiently thats silly mr carmody gaynor knows his business after a moments hesitation he told me all about eileens sickness  carmody resentfully did he now the auld monkey small thanks to him to be tellin our secrets to the town  nicholls exasperated i didnt want to learn your affairs he only told me because youd said i and eileen were engaged youre the one who was tellingsecrets  carmody irritated ara dont be talkin thats no secret at all with the whole town watchin eileen and you spoonin together from the time you was kids  nicholls vindictively well the whole town is liable to find out he checks himself  carmody too absorbed in his own troubles to notice this threat to hell with the town and all in it ive troubles enough of my own so he told you hed send eileen away to the hospital ive half a mind not to let himand let him try to make me with a frown but eileen herself says shes wantin to go now angrily its all that divils notion he put in her head that the childrend be catchin her sickness that makes her willin to go  nicholls with a superior air from what he told me i should say it was the only thing for eileen to do if she wants to get well quickly spitefully and id certainly not go against gaynor if i was you he told me hed make it hot for you if you did he will too you can bet on that hes that kind  carmody worriedly hes a divil but what can he dohim and his sasiety im her father  nicholls seeing carmodys uneasiness with revengeful satisfaction oh hell do what he says dont worry youll make a mistake if you think hes bluffing itd probably get in all the papers about you refusing every one would be down on you as a last jabspitefully you might even lose your job over it people would be so sore  carmody jumping to his feet ah divil take him let him send her where he wants then ill not be sayin a word  nicholls as an afterthought and honestly mr carmody i dont see how you can object for a secondafter hes told you its absolutely necessary for eileen to go away seeing carmodys shaken condition he finishes boldly youve some feeling for your own daughter havent you youd be a fine father if you hadnt  carmody apprehensively whisht she might hear you but youre right let her do what shes wishful to and get well soon  nicholls complacentlyfeeling his duty in the matter well done thats the right spirit i knew youd see it that way and you and ill do all we can to help her he gets to his feet well i guess ill have to go tell eileen  carmody youre not goin sure eileen is puttin on her clothes to come down and have a look at you shell be here in a jiffy sit down now and wait for her  nicholls suddenly panicstricken by the prospect of facing her nonoi cant stayi only came for a momentive got an appointmenthonestly besides it isnt right for her to be up shes too weak itll make her worse you should have told her        the door in the rear is opened and eileen enters she is       just over eighteen her wavy mass of dark hair is parted in the       middle and combed low on her forehead covering her ears to a       knot at the back of her head the oval of her face is spoiled by       a long rather heavy irish jaw contrasting with the delicacy of       her other features her eyes are large and blue confident in       their compelling candour and sweetness her lips full and red       halfopen over strong even teeth droop at the corners into       an expression of wistful sadness her clear complexion is       unnaturally striking in its contrasting colours rose and white       her figure is slight and undeveloped she wears a plain black       dress with a bit of white at the neck and wrists she stands       looking appealingly at nicholls who avoids her glance her       eyes have a startled stunned expression as if the doctors       verdict were still in her ears  eileen faintlyforcing a smile good evening fred her eyes search his face anxiously  nicholls confusedly hello eileen im so sorry to clumsily trying to cover up his confusion he goes over and leads her to a chair you must sit down youve got to take care of yourself you never ought to have got up tonight  eileen sits down i wanted to talk to you she raises her face with a pitiful smile nicholls hurriedly moves back to his own chair  nicholls almost brusquely i could have talked to you from the hall youre silly to take chances just now        eileens eyes show her hurt at his tone  carmody seeing his chancehastily youll be stayin a while now fred ill take a walk down the road im needin a drink to clear my wits he goes to the door in rear  eileen reproachfully you wont be long father and please dontyou know  carmody exasperated sure who wouldnt get drunk with all the sorrows of the world piled on him he stamps out a moment later the outside door bangs behind him eileen sighs nicholls walks up and down with his eyes on the floor  nicholls furious at carmody for having left him in this situation honestly eileen your father is the limit i dont see how you stand for him hes the most selfish  eileen gently sssh you mustnt fred hes not to blame he just doesnt understand nicholls snorts disdainfully dont lets not talk about him now we wont have many more evenings together for a long long time did father or the doctor tell you she falters  nicholls not looking at herglumly everything there was to tell i guess  eileen hastening to comfort him you mustnt worry fred please dont itd make it so much worse for me if i thought you did ill be all right ill do exactly what they tell me and in a few months ill be back so fat and healthy you wont know me  nicholls lamely oh theres no doubt of that no ones worrying about your not getting well quick  eileen it wont be long we can write

danger he even ordered me not to kiss them any more she bites her lip to restrain a sobthen coughs a soft husky cough nicholls shrinks away from her to the edge of his chair his eyes shifting

bedclothes can be seen to the right of this partition a     bookcase and a door leading to the hall past the patients rooms     farther right another door opening on the examining room in the     right wall rear a door to the office farther forward a row of     windows in front of the windows a long diningtable with chairs     on the left of the table towards the centre of the room a chimney

chairs are     placed here and there about the room near the windows etc a     gramophone stands near the left wall forward      it is nearing eight oclock of a cold evening about a week later      at the rise of the curtain stephen murray is discovered sitting     in a chair in front of the fireplace left murray is thirty     years olda tall slender rather unusuallooking fellow with a     pale face sunken under high cheek bones lined about the eyes and     mouth jaded and worn for one still so young his intelligent     large hazel eyes have a tired dispirited expression in repose but     can quicken instantly with a concealed mechanism of mocking     careless humour whenever his inner privacy is threatened his large     mouth aids this process of protection by a quick change from its     set apathy to a cheerful grin of cynical good nature he gives off     the impression of being somehow dissatisfied with himself but not     yet embittered enough by it to take it out on others his manner     as revealed by his speechnervous inquisitive alertseems more     an acquired quality than any part of his real nature he stoops a     trifle giving him a slightly roundshouldered appearance he is     dressed in a shabby dark suit baggy at the knees he is staring     into the fire dreaming an open book lying unheeded on the arm of     his chair the gramophone is whining out the last strains of     dvoraks humoresque in the doorway to the office miss gilpin     stands talking to miss howard the former is a slight     middleaged woman with black hair and a strong intelligent face     its expression of resolute efficiency softened and made kindly by     her warm sympathetic grey eyes miss howard is tall slender and     blondedecidedly pretty and provokingly conscious of it yet with     a certain air of seriousness underlying her apparent frivolity she     is twenty years old the elder woman is dressed in the allwhite of     a fullfledged nurse miss howard wears the greyblue uniform of     one still in training the record finishes murray sighs with     relief but makes no move to get up and stop the grinding needle     miss howard hurries across to the machine miss gilpin goes back     into the office  miss howard takes off the record glancing at murray with amused vexation its a wonder you wouldnt stop this machine grinding itself to bits mr murray  murray with a smile i was hoping the darn thing would bust miss howard sniffs murray grins at her teasingly it keeps you from talking to me thats the real music  miss howard comes over to his chair laughing its

waves his hand towards the partition looking out on the porch all those people in bed out there on the porch seem so sick its depressing i cant do anything for themandit makes me feel so helpless  miss howard well its the rules you know all the patients have to come here first until doctor stanton finds out whether theyre well enough to be sent out to the huts and cottages and remember youre a patient just like the ones in bed out thereeven if you are up and about  murray i know it but i dont feel as i werereally sick like them  miss howard wisely none of them do either  murray after a

 miss howard yes miss gilpin in an aside to murray as she leaves him its time for those horrid diets        she hurries back into the office murray stares into the       fire miss howard reappears from the office and goes out by the       door to the hall rear carriage wheels are heard from the drive       in front of the house on the left they stop after a pause there       is a sharp rap on the door and a bell rings insistently mens       muffled voices are heard in argument murray turns curiously in       his chair miss gilpin comes from the office and walks quickly       to the door

nicholls        miss gilpin shakes hands cordially with the two men who are       staring about the room in embarrassment carmody has very       evidently been drinking his voice is thick and his face       puffed and stupid nicholls manner is that of one who is       accomplishing a necessary but disagreeable duty with the best       grace possible but is frightfully eager to get it over and done       with carmodys condition embarrasses him acutely and when he       glances at him it is with hatred and angry disgust  miss gilpin indicating the chairs in front of the windows on the left forward wont you gentlemen sit down carmody grunts sullenly and plumps himself into the one nearest the door nicholls hesitates glancing down at the suitcase he carries miss gilpin turns to eileen and now well get you settled immediately your room is all ready for you if youll follow me she turns toward the door in rear centre  eileen let me take the suitcase now fred  miss gilpin as he is about to

gilpin smiling of course you didnt and now if youll come with me ill show you your room well have a little chat there and i can explain all the other important rules in a second the gentlemen can make

the fire nicholls sits       down beside him miss gilpin and eileen go out murray       switches his chair so that he can observe the two men out of the       corner of his eye while pretending to be

weary voice no fred remember you mustnt now  nicholls in an instant huff oh if thats the way you feel about        he strides out and slams the door viciously behind him eileen       walks slowly back towards the fireplace her face fixed in a       dead calm of despair as she sinks into one of the armchairs the       strain becomes too much she breaks down hiding her face in her       hands her frail shoulders heaving with the violence of her sobs       at this sound murray turns from the windows and comes over       near her chair  murray after watching her for a momentin an embarrassed tone of sympathy come on miss carmody thatll never do i know its hard at firstbutgetting yourself all worked up is bad for you youll run a temperature and then theyll keep you in bedwhich isnt pleasant take hold of yourself it isnt so bad up herereallyonce you get used to it the shame she feels at giving way in the presence of a stranger only adds to her loss of control and she sobs heartbrokenly murray walks up and down nervously visibly nonplussed and upset finally he hits upon something one of the nurses will be in any minute you dont want them to see you like this  eileen chokes back her sobs and finally raises her face and attempts a smile im sorryto make such a sight of myself i just couldnt help it  murray jocularly well they say a good cry does you a lot of good

and exclaims in exasperation at himself darn there i go again putting my foot in it with an irrepressible grin i ought to have my tongue operated onthats whats the matter with me he laughs and throws himself in a chair  eileen forced in spite of herself to smile with him youre candid at any rate mr murray  murray dont misunderstand me far be it from me to cast slurs at your fathers high spirits i said i envied him his jag and thats the truth the same candour compels me to confess that i was pickled to the gills myself when i arrived here fact i made love to all the nurses and generally disgraced myselfand had a wonderful time  eileen i suppose it does make you forget your troublesfor a while  murray waving this aside i didnt want to forgetnot for a second i wasnt drowning my sorrow

yes of course confidentially but its only a matter of time when ill be all right again i hope it wont be too soon i was dying for a resta good long rest with time to think about things im due to get

at him irresolutely then resumes her chair theyll give you your diet of milk and shoo you off to bed on that freezing porch soon enough dont worry ill see to it that you dont fracture any rules

embarrassed and why wouldnt it be ive no fear for my healtheventually just let me tell you what i was getting away from with a sudden laugh full of a weary bitterness do you know what it means to work from seven at night till three in the morning as a reporter on a morning newspaper in a town of twenty thousand peoplefor ten years no you dont you cant no one could who hadnt been through the mill but what it did to meit made me happyyes happyto get out heretb and all notwithstanding  eileen looking at him curiously but i always thought being a reporter was so interesting  murray with a cynical laugh interesting on a small town rag a month of it perhaps when youre a kid and new to the game but ten years think of it with only a raise of a couple of dollars every blue moon or so and a weekly spree on saturday night to vary the monotony he laughs again interesting eh getting the dope on the social of the queen esther circle in the basement of the methodist episcopal church unable to sleep through a meeting of the common council on account of the noisy oratory caused by john smiths application for a permit to build a house making a note that a tugboat towed two barges loaded with coal up the river that mrs perkins spent a weekend with relatives in hickville that john jones oh help why go on ten years of it im a broken man god how i used to pray that our congressman would commit suicide or the mayor murder his wifejust to be able to write a real story  eileen with a smile is it as bad as that but werent there other things in the townoutside your workthat were interesting  murray decidedly no never anything newand i knew everyone and every thing in town by heart years ago with sudden bitterness oh it was my own fault why didnt i get out of it well i didnt i was always going totomorrowand tomorrow never came i got in a rutand stayed put people seem to get that way somehowin that town its in the air all the boys i grew up withnearly all at leasttook root in the same

lawyerdied when i was nineteen just about to go to college he left nothing so i went to work on the paper instead and there ive been ever since ive two sisters respectably married and living in

here three months or fourwhen the gap you left has been comfortably filled youll see then  eileen angrily her lips trembling you must be crazy to say such things fighting back her tears oh i think its hatefulwhen you see how badly i feel  murray in acute confusion stammering look here miss carmody i didnt mean to listendont feel mad at me please my tongue ran away with me i was only talking im like that you mustnt take it seriously  eileen still resentful i dont see how you can talk you dontyou cant know about these thingswhen youve just said you had no family of your own really  murray eager to

our mother died sadly and i dont know how theyll ever get along while im away  murray cynically oh theyllhe checks what he was going to say and adds lamelyget along somehow  eileen with the same superior tone its easy for you to say that you dont know how children grow to depend on you for everything youre not a woman  murray with a grin are you then with a chuckle youre as old as the pyramids arent you i feel like a little boy wont you adopt me too  eileen flushing with a shy smile someone ought to quickly changing the subject do you know i cant get over what you said about hating your work so i should think it would be wonderfulto be able to write things  murray my job had nothing to do with writing to writereally writeyes thats something worth trying for thats what ive always meant to have a stab at ive run across ideas enough for storiesthat sounded good to me anyway with a forced laugh butlike everything elsei never got down to it i started one or twobuteither i thought

and id be willing to pay whatever miss gilpin enters from the rear and walks towards them  eileen quickly oh no id be glad to get the practice i wouldnt accept she coughs slightly  murray with a laugh maybe after youve read my stuff you wont type it at any price  miss gilpin miss carmody may i speak to you for a moment please        she takes eileen aside and talks to her in low tones of       admonition eileens face falls she nods a horrified       acquiescence miss gilpin leaves her and goes into the office       rear  murray as eileen comes back noticing her perturbation kindly well now

 auditorium of which the large square table that stands at centre     forward would seem to be the stage      from the diningroom comes the clatter of dishes the confused     murmur of many voices male and femaleall the mingled sounds of a     crowd of people at a meal      after the curtain rises doctor stanton enters from the hall     followed by a visitor mr sloan and the assistant physician     doctor simms doctor stanton is a handsome man of fortyfive or so     with a grave carelined studious face lightened by a kindly     humorous smile his grey eyes saddened by the suffering they have     witnessed have the sympathetic quality of real understanding the     look they give is full of companionship the couragerenewing     human companionship of a hope which is shared he speaks with a     slight southern accent soft and slurring doctor simms is a     tall angular young man with a long sallow face and a sheepish     selfconscious grin mr sloan is fifty short and stout well     dressedone of the successful business men whose endowments have     made the hill farm a possibility  stanton as they enter this is what you might see in the general assembly room mr sloanwhere the patients of both sexes are allowed to congregate together after meals for diets and in the evening  sloan looking around him couldnt be more pleasant i must saylight and airy he walks to where he can take a peep into the diningroom ah theyre all at breakfast i see  stanton smiling yes and with no lack of appetite let me tell you with a laugh of proud satisfaction theyd sure eat us out of house and home at one sitting if wed give them the opportunity to his assistant wouldnt they doctor  simms with his abashed grin you bet they would sir  sloan with a smile thats fine with a nod towards the diningroom the ones in there are the sure cures arent they  stanton a shadow coming over his face strictly speaking there are no sure cures in this disease mr sloan when we permit a patient to return to take up his or her activities in the world the patient is what we call an arrested case the disease is overcome quiescent the wound is healed over its then up to the patient to so take care of himself that this condition remains permanent it isnt hard for them to do this usually just ordinary bullheaded common senseadded to what theyve learned hereis enough for their safety and the precautions we teach them to take dont diminish their social usefulness in the slightest either as i can prove by our statistics of former patients with a smile its rather early in the morning for statistics though  sloan with a wave of the hand oh you neednt your reputation in that respect doctor stanton inclines his head in acknowledgment sloan jerks his thumb towards the diningroom but the ones in there are getting well arent they  stanton to all appearances yes you dont dare swear to it though sometimes just when a case looks most favourably theres a sudden unforeseen breakdown and they have to be sent back to bed or if its very serious back to the infirmary again these are the exceptions however not the rule you can bank on most of those eaters being out in the world and usefully employed within six months  sloan you couldnt say more than that abruptly butthe unfortunate onesdo you have many deaths  stanton with a frown no were under a very hard almost cruel imperative which prevents that if at the end of six months a case shows no response to treatment continues to go down hillif in a word it seems hopelesswe send them away to one of the state farms if they have no private means apologetically you see this sanatorium is overcrowded and has a long waiting list most of the time of others who demand their chance for life we have to make places for them we have no time to waste on incurables there are other places for themand sometimes too a change is beneficial and they pick up in new surroundings you never can tell but were bound by the rule it may seem cruelbut its as near justice to all concerned as we can come  sloan soberly i see his eyes fall on the pianola in surprise aha piano  stanton replying to the others thought yes some patients play and sing with a smile if youd call the noise they make by those terms theyd dance too if we permitted it theres only one big taboohome sweet home we forbid thatfor obvious reasons  sloan i see with a final look around did i understand you to say this is the only place where the sexes are permitted to mingle  stanton yes sir  sloan with a smile not much chance for a love affair then  stanton seriously we do our best to prevent them we even have a strict rule which allows us to step in and put a stop to any intimacy which grows beyond the casual people up here mr sloan are expected to put aside all ideas except the onegetting well  sloan somewhat embarrassed a damn good rule too i should say under the circumstances  stanton with a laugh yes were strictly anticupid sir from top to bottom turning to the door to the hall and now if you dont mind mr sloan im going to turn you loose to wander about the grounds on an unconducted tour today is my busy morningsaturday we weigh each patient immediately after breakfast  sloan every week  stanton every saturday you see we depend on fluctuations in weight to tell us a lot about the patients condition if they gain or stay at normal alls usually well if they lose week after week without any reason we can definitely point to we keep careful watch its a sign that somethings wrong were forewarned by it and on our guard  sloan with a smile well im certainly learning things he turns to the door and you just shoo me off wherever you please and go on with the good work ill be glad of a ramble in the open on such a glorious morning  stanton after the weighing is over sir ill be free to        his words are lost as the three go out a moment later eileen       enters from the diningroom she has grown stouter her face has       more of a healthy outofdoor colour but there is still about       her the suggestion of being worn down by a burden too oppressive       for her courage she is dressed in blouse and dark skirt she       goes to the armchair left forward and sinks down on it she       is evidently in a state of nervous depression she twists her       fingers together in her lap her eyes stare sadly before her she       clenches her upper lip with her teeth to prevent its trembling       she has hardly regained control over herself when stephen murray       comes in hurriedly from the diningroom and seeing her at his       first glance walks quickly over to her chair he is the picture       of health his figure has filled out solidly his tanned face       beams with suppressed exultation  murray excitedly eileen i saw you leave your table ive something to tell you i didnt get a chance last night after the mail came youd gone to the cottage just listen eileenits too good to be truebut on that mailguess

and yet you say you dont love him really  eileen shaking her headhelplessly but i dolike fred weve been good friends so many years i dont want to hurt himhis pride  murray thats the same as answering no to my question then if you dont love him why dont you write and tell him to go tobreak it off eileen bows her head but doesnt reply irritated murray continues brutally are you afraid it would break his heart dont be a fool the only way you could do that would be to deprive him of his meals  eileen springing to her feetdistractedly please stop stephen youre cruel and youve been so kindthe only real friend ive had up here dont spoil it all now  murray remorsefully im sorry eileen i was only talking i wont say another word irritably still someone ought to say or do something to put a stop to  eileen with a broken laugh never mind everything will stopsoon now  murray suspiciously what do you mean  eileen with an attempt at a careless tone nothing if you cant see she turns to him with sudden intensity oh stephen if you only knew how wrong you are about everything youve said its all true but it isnt thatany of itany morethats oh i cant tell you  murray with great interest please do eileen

supposenever glancing towards the diningroom theyre all getting up lets not talk about it any morenow  murray stubbornly but youll tell me later eileen you must  eileen vaguely perhaps it depends        the patients about forty in number straggle in from the       diningroom by twos and threes chatting in low tones the men       and women with few exceptions separate into two groups the       women congregating in the left right angle of chairs the men       sitting or standing in the right right angle in appearance most       of the patients are tanned healthy and cheerfullooking the       great majority are under middle age their clothes are of the       cheap readymade variety they are all distinctly of the       wageearning class they might well be a crowd of cosmopolitan       factory workers gathered together after a summer vacation a       hollowchestedness and a tendency to round shoulders may be       detected as a common characteristic a general air of tension       marked by frequent bursts of laughter in too high a key seems to       pervade the throng murray and eileen as if to avoid contact       with the others come over to the right in front of the       diningroom door  murray in a low voice listen to them laugh did you ever noticeperhaps its my imaginationhow forced they act on saturday mornings before theyre weighed  eileen dully no  murray cant you tell me that secret now no onell hear  eileen vehemently no no how could i dont speak of it        a sudden silence falls on all the groups at once their eyes       by a common impulse turn quickly towards the door to the       hall  a woman nervouslyas if this moments silent pause oppressed her play something peters they aint coming yet        peters a stupidlooking young fellow with a sly twisted       smirk which gives him the appearance of perpetually winking his       eye detaches himself from a group on the right all join in with       urging exclamations go on peters go to it pedal up pete       give us a rag thats the boy peters etc  peters sure if i got time        he goes to the pianola and puts in a roll the mingled       conversation and laughter bursts forth again as he sits on the       bench and starts pedalling  murray disgustedly its sure good to think i wont have to listen to that old tinpan being banged much longer        the music interrupts hima quick rag the patients brighten       hum whistle sway their heads or tap their feet in time to the       tune doctor stanton and doctor simms appear in the       doorway from the hall all eyes are turned on them  stanton raising his voice they all seem to be here doctor we might as well start        mrs turner the matron comes in behind thema stout       motherly capablelooking woman with grey hair she hears       stantons remark  mrs turner and take temperatures after doctor  stanton yes mrs turner i think thats better today  mrs turner all right doctor        stanton and the assistant go out mrs turner advances a step       or so into the room and looks from one group of patients to the       other inclining her head and smiling benevolently all force       smiles and nod in recognition of her greeting peters at the       pianola lets the music slow down glancing questioningly at the       matron to see if she is going to order it stopped then       encouraged by her smile his feet pedal harder than ever  murray look at old mrs grundys eyes pinned on us shell accuse us of being too familiar again the old wench  eileen sssh youre wrong shes looking at me not at us  murray at you why  eileen i ran a temperature yesterday it must have been over a hundred last night  murray with consoling scepticism youre always looking for trouble eileen how do you know you ran a temp you didnt see the stick i suppose  eileen nobuti could tell i felt feverish and chilly it must have been way up  murray bosh if it was youd have been sent to bed  eileen thats why shes looking at me piteously oh i do hope i wont be sent back to bed i dont know what id do if i could only gain this morning if my temp has only gone down hopelessly but i feel i didnt sleep a winkthinking  murray roughly youll persuade yourself youve got leprosy in a second dont be silly its all imagination i tell you youll gain wait and see if you dont        eileen shakes her head a metallic rumble and jangle comes       from the hallway everyone turns in that direction with nervous       expectancy  mrs turner admonishingly mr peters  peters yes maam        he stops playing and rejoins the group of men on the right       in the midst of a silence broken only by hushed murmurs of       conversation doctor stanton appears in the hall doorway       he turns to help his assistant wheel in a fairbanks scale on       castors they place the scale against the wall immediately to the       rear of the doorway doctor simms adjusts it to a perfect       balance  doctor stanton takes a pencil from his pocket and opens the record book he has in his hand all ready doctor  doctor simms just a second sir        a chorus of coughs comes from the impatient crowd and       handkerchiefs are hurriedly produced to shield mouths  murray with a nervous smile well were all set heres hoping  eileen youll gain im sure you will you look so well  murray ohii wasnt thinking of myself im a sure thing i was betting on you ive simply got to gain today when so much depends on it  eileen yes i hope you she falters brokenly and turns away from him  doctor simms straightening up all ready doctor  stanton nods and glances at his bookwithout raising his voicedistinctly mrs abner        a middleaged woman comes and gets on the scale simms       adjusts it to her weight of the previous week which stanton       reads to him from the book in a low voice and weighs her  murray with a relieved sigh theyre off noticing eileens downcast head and air of dejection here buck up eileen old lady grundys watching youand its your turn in a second        eileen raises her head and forces a frightened smile mrs       abner gets down off the scale with a pleased grin she has       evidently gained she rejoins the group of women chattering       volubly in low tones her exultant gained half a pound can be       heard the other women smile their perfunctory congratulations       their eyes absentminded intent on their own worries stanton       writes down the weight in the book  stanton miss bailey a young girl goes to the scales  murray bailey looks bad doesnt she  eileen her lips trembling shes been losing too  murray well youre going to gain today remember now  eileen with a feeble smile ill try to obey your orders        miss bailey goes down off the scales her eyes are full of       despondency although she tries to make a brave face of it       forcing a laugh as she joins the women they stare at her with       pitying looks and murmur consoling phrases  eileen shes lost again oh i wish i didnt have to get weighed  stanton miss carmody        eileen starts nervously  murray as she leaves him remember now break the scales        she walks quickly to the scales trying to assume an air of       defiant indifference the balance stays down as she steps up       eileens face shows her despair at this simms weighs her and       gives the poundage in a low voice to stanton eileen steps down       mechanically then hesitates as if not knowing where to turn her       anguished eyes flitting from one group to another  murray savagely damn        doctor stanton writes the figures in his book glances sharply       at eileen and then nods significantly to mrs turner who is       standing beside him  stanton calling the next miss doeffler        another woman comes to be weighed  mrs turner miss carmody will you come here a moment please  eileen her face growing very pale yes mrs turner        the heads of the different groups bend together their eyes       follow eileen as they whisper mrs turner leads her down       front left behind them the weighing of the women continues       briskly the great majority have gained those who have not have       either remained stationary or lost a negligible fraction of a       pound so as the weighing proceeds the general air of smiling       satisfaction rises among the groups of women some of them their       ordeal over go out through the hall doorway by twos and threes       with suppressed laughter and chatter as they pass behind eileen       they glance at her with pitying curiosity doctor stantons       voice is heard at regular intervals calling the names in       alphabetical order mrs elbing miss finch miss grimes miss       haines miss hayes miss jutner miss linowski mrs marini mrs       mccoy miss mcelroy miss nelson mrs

he thinks the matron is not aware of ita note of sharp rebuke in her voice i think i can guess your secret my dear even if youre too stubborn to tell this setback is your own fault youve let other notions become more important to you than the idea of getting well and youve no excuse for it after i had to warn you a month ago i expected that silliness to stop instantly  eileen her face

far left corner of the room       eileen stands for a moment hesitatingthen starts to go to       murray but just at this moment peters comes forward and       speaks to murray  peters with his sly

left to wait their turn with the exception of murray who       remains by the diningroom door fidgeting impatiently anxious       for a word with eileen  mrs abner taking eileens arm coming over to

has gained his face lights up and he heaves a great       sigh of relief eileen seems to sense this outcome and her head       sinks her body sags weakly and seems to shrink to a smaller       size murray gets off the scales his face beaming with a       triumphant smile doctor stanton smiles and murmurs something       to him in a low voice murray nods brightly then turns back       to eileen

covering her face with her hands stifling her sobs  murray alarmed eileen whats the matter desperately stop it stantonll see you   the curtain falls     act two scene two       midnight of the same day a crossroad near the sanatorium the     main road comes down forward from the right a smaller road     leading down from the left joins it towards left centre      dense woods rise sheer from the grass and bramblegrown ditches at     the roadsides at the junction of the two roads there is a     signpost its arms pointing towards the right and the left rear a     pile of round stones is at the road corner left forward a full     moon riding high overhead throws the roads into white shadowless     relief and masses the woods into walls of compact blackness the     trees lean heavily together their branches motionless unstirred     by any trace of wind      as the curtain rises eileen is discovered standing in the     middle of the road front centre her face shows white and clear in     the bright moonlight as she stares with anxious expectancy up the     road to the left her body is fixed in an attitude of rigid     immobility as if she were afraid the slightest movement would break     the spell of silence and awaken the unknown she has shrunk     instinctively as far away as she can from the mysterious darkness     which rises at the roadsides like an imprisoning wall a sound of     hurried footfalls muffled by the dust comes from the road she is     watching she gives a startled gasp her eyes strain to identify     the oncomer uncertain trembling with fright she hesitates a     second then darts to the side of the road and crouches down in the     shadow      stephen murray comes down the road from the left he stops by the     signpost and peers about him he wears a cap the peak of which     casts his face into shadow finally he calls in a low voice  murray eileen  eileen coming out quickly from her hidingplacewith a glad little cry stephen at last she runs to him as if she were going to fling her arms about him but stops abashed he reaches out and takes her hands  murray at last it cant be twelve yet he leads her to the pile of stones on the left i havent

speak he looks about him at the trees up into the moonlit sky breathing in the fresh air with a healthy delight eileen remains with downcast head staring at the road its beautiful tonight isnt it

ive certainly told you all of them youre the only one he stops and abruptly changes the subject you said in your note that you had something important to tell me he sits down beside her crossing his legs is it about your interview with old mrs grundy this afternoon  eileen no that didnt amount to anything she seemed mad because i told her so little i think she guessed i only told her what i did so shed let me stay up maybeyour last dayand to keep her from thinking what she didabout us  murray quickly as if he wishes to avoid this subject what is it you wanted to tell me then  eileen sadly it doesnt seem so important now somehow i suppose it was silly of me to drag you out here just for that it cant mean anything to youmuch  murray encouragingly how do you know it cant  eileen slowly i only thoughtyou might like to know  murray interestedly know what what is it if i can help  eileen no after a moments hesitation i wrote to him this afternoon  murray him  eileen the letter youve been

eileen i felt guilty i shouldnt have knocked him behind his back without knowing him at all  eileen you said you could read him like a book from his letters i showed you  murray apologetically i know im a fool  eileen angrily what makes you so considerate of fred nicholls all of a sudden what you thought about him was right  murray vaguely i dont know one makes mistakes  eileen assertively well i know you neednt waste pity on him hell be only too glad to get my letter hes been anxious to be free of me ever since i was sent here only he thought it wouldnt be decent to break it off himself while i was sick he was afraid of what people would say about him when they found it out so hes just gradually stopped writing and coming for visits and waited for me to realise and if i didnt i know hed have broken it off himself the first day i got home ive kept persuading myself that in spite of the way hes acted he did love me as much as he could love anyone and that it would hurt him if i but now i know that he never loved me that he couldnt love anyone but himself oh i dont hate him for it he cant help being what he is and all people seem to belike that mostly im only going to remember that he and i grew up together and that he was kind to me then when he thought he liked meand forget all the rest with agitated impatience oh stephen you know all this ive said about him why dont you admit it youve read his letters  murray haltingly yes ill admit that was my opiniononly i wanted to be sure youd found out for yourself  eileen defiantly well i have you see that now dont you  murray yes and im glad youre free of him for your own sake i knew he wasnt the person with an attempt at a joking tone you must get one of the right sortnext time  eileen springing to her feet with a cry of pain stephen        he avoids her eyes which search his face pleadingly  murray mumbling he wasnt good enoughto lace your shoesnor anyone else either  eileen with a nervous laugh dont be silly after a pause during which she waits hungrily for some word from himwith a sigh of despairfaintly well ive told youall there is i might as well go back  murray not looking at herindistinctly yes you mustnt lose too much sleep ill come to your cottage in the morning to say goodbye theyll permit that i guess  eileen stands looking at him imploringly her face convulsed with anguish but he keeps his eyes fixed on the rocks at his feet finally she seems to give up and takes a few uncertain steps up the road towards the rightin an exhausted whisper good night stephen  murray his voice choked and husky good night eileen  eileen walks weakly up the road but as she passes the signpost she suddenly stops and turns to look again at murray who has not moved or lifted his eyes a great shuddering sob shatters her pentup emotions she runs back to murray her arms outstretched with a choking cry stephen  murray startled whirls to face her and finds her arms thrown around his neckin a terrified tone eileen  eileen brokenly i love you stephenyou thats what i wanted to tell        she gazes up into his eyes her face transfigured by the joy       and pain of this abject confession  murray wincing as

his fists clenched in impotent rage at himself and at fate he curses hoarsely christ   the curtain falls     act three       four months later an isolation room at the infirmary with a     sleeping porch at the right of it late afternoon of a sunday     towards the end of october the room extending twothirds of the     distance from left to right is for reasons of space economy     scantily furnished with the bare necessitiesa bureau with mirror     in the left corner reartwo straightbacked chairsa table with     a glass top in the centre the floor is varnished hardwood the     walls and furniture are painted white on the left forward a door     to the hall on the right rear a double glass door opening on the     porch farther front two windows the porch a screenedin     continuation of the room contains only a single iron bed painted     white and a small table placed beside the bed      the woods the leaves of the trees rich in their autumn colouring     rise close about this side of the infirmary their branches almost     touch the porch on the right in the rear of the porch they have     been cleared away from the building for a narrow space and through     this opening the distant hills can be seen with the tree tops     glowing in the sunlight      as the curtain rises eileen is discovered lying in the bed on     the porch propped up into a halfsitting position by pillows under     her back and head she seems to have grown much thinner her face     is pale and drawn with deep hollows under her cheekbones her     eyes are dull and lustreless she gazes straight before her into     the wood with the unseeing stare of apathetic indifference the     door from the hall in the room behind her is opened and miss     howard enters followed by bill carmody mrs brennan and     mary carmodys manner is unwontedly sober and subdued this air     of respectable sobriety is further enhanced by a black suit     glaringly new and stiffly pressed a new black derby hat and shoes     polished like a mirror his expression is full of a bitter if     suppressed resentment his gentility is evidently forced upon him     in spite of himself and correspondingly irksome mrs brennan is     a tall stout woman of fifty lusty and loudvoiced with a broad     snubnosed florid face a large mouth the upper lip darkened by a     suggestion of moustache and little round blue eyes hard and     restless with a continual fuming irritation she is got up     regardless in her ridiculous sundaybest mary appears tall and     skinnylegged in a starched outgrown frock the sweetness of her     face has disappeared giving way to a hangdog sullenness a     stubborn silence with sulky furtive glances of rebellion directed     at her stepmother  miss howard pointing to the porch shes out there on the porch  mrs brennan with dignity thank you maam  miss howard with a searching glance at the visitors as if to appraise their intentions eileens been very sick lately you

mary and remember to keep your mouth shut        they go out on the porch and stand just outside the door       waiting for eileen to notice them but the girl in bed       continues to stare into the woods oblivious to their presence  mrs brennan nudging carmody with her elbowin a harsh whisper she dont see us its a dream shes in with her eyes open glory be its bad shes lookin the look on her faced frighten you speak to her you        eileen stirs uneasily as if this whisper had disturbed her       unconsciously  carmody wetting his lips and clearing his throat huskily eileen  eileen startled turns and stares at them with frightened eyes after a pause she ventures uncertainly as if she were not sure hut what these figures might be creatures of her dream father her eyes shift to mrs brennans face and she shudders mrs brennan  mrs brennan quicklyin a voice meant to be kindly here we are all of us come to see you how is it youre feelin now eileen        while she is talking she advances to the bedside followed by       carmody and takes one of the sick girls hands in hers eileen       withdraws it as if stung and holds it out to her father mrs       brennans face flushes angrily and she draws back from the       bedside  carmody movedwith rough tenderness patting her hand ah eileen sure its a sight for sore eyes to see you again he bends down as if to kiss her but struck by a sudden fear hesitates straightens himself and shamed by the understanding in eileens eyes grows red and stammers confusedly how are you now sure its the picture of health youre lookin        eileen sighs and turns her eyes away from him with a resigned       sadness  mrs brennan what are you standin there for like a stick mary havent you a word to say to your sister  eileen twisting her head around and seeing mary for the first timewith a glad cry mary iwhy i didnt see you before come here        mary approaches gingerly with apprehensive side glances at       mrs brennan who watches her grimly eileens arms reach out       for her hungrily she grasps her about the waist and seems trying       to press the unwilling child to her breast  mary fidgeting nervouslysuddenly in a frightened whine let me go eileen releases her looks at her face dazedly for a second then falls back limply with a little moan and shuts her eyes mary who has stepped back a pace remains fixed there

satisfaction come here to me mary and dont be botherin your sister        mary avoids her stepmother but retreats to the far end of the       porch where she stands shrunk back against the wall her eyes       fixed on eileen with the same fascinated horror  carmody after an uncomfortable pause forcing himself to speak is the pain bad eileen  eileen dullywithout opening her eyes theres no pain there is another pausethen she murmurs indifferently there are chairs in the room you can bring out if you want to sit down  mrs brennan sharply weve not time to be sittin weve the train back to catch

with the closed eyes finally he croaks in a whining tone of fear is your last word a cruel one to me this day eileen        she remains silent his face darkens he turns and strides out       of the door mary darts after him with a frightened cry of       papa eileen covers her face with her hands and a shudder of       relief runs over her body  mrs brennan as carmody enters the roomin a mollified tone so youve come have you lets go then carmody stands looking at her in silence his expression full of gloomy rage she bursts out impatiently are you comin or are you goin back to her she grabs marys arm and pushes her towards the door to the hall are you comin or not im askin  carmody sombrelyas if to himself theres something wrong in the whole of thisthat i cant make out with sudden fury he brandishes his fists as though defying someone and growls threateningly and ill get drunk this nightdead rotten drunk he seems to detect disapproval in mrs brennans face for he shakes his fist at her and repeats like a solemn oath ill get drunk this night im sayin ill get drunk if my soul roasts for itand no one in the whole world is strong enough to stop me        mrs brennan turns from him with a disgusted shrug of her       shoulders and hustles mary out of the door carmody after a       seconds pause follows them eileen lies still looking out       into the woods with empty desolate eyes miss howard comes       into the room from the hall and goes to the porch carrying a       glass of milk in her hand  miss howard heres your diet eileen i forgot it until just now sundays are awful days arent they they get me all mixed up in my work with all these visitors around did you have a nice visit with your folks  eileen forcing a smile yes  miss howard you look worn out i hope they didnt worry you over home affairs  eileen no        she sips her milk and sets it back on the table with a shudder       of disgust  miss howard with a smile what a face youd think you were taking poison  eileen i hate it with deep passion i wish it was poison  miss howard jokingly oh come now that isnt a nice way to feel on the sabbath with a meaning smile ive some news thatll cheer you up i bet archly guess whos here on a visit  eileen startledin a frightened whisper who  miss howard mr murray eileen closes her eyes wincingly for a moment and a shadow of pain comes over her face he just came about the time your folks did i saw him for a moment not to speak to he was going to the main buildingto see doctor stanton i suppose beamingwith a certain curiosity what do you think of that for news  eileen trying to conceal her agitation and assume a casual tone he must have come to be examined  miss howard with a meaning laugh oh id hardly say that was his main reason he does look much thinner and very tired though i suppose hes been working too hard in businesslike tones well ive got to get back on the job she turns to the door calling back jokingly hell be in to see you of course so look your prettiest        she goes out and shuts the door to the porch eileen gives a       frightened gasp and struggles up in bed as if she wanted to call       the nurse to return then she lies back in a state of great       nervous excitement twisting her head with eager fearful glances       towards the door listening clasping and unclasping her thin       fingers on the white spread as miss howard walks across the       room to the hall door it is opened and stephen murray enters       a great change is visible in his face it is much thinner and the       former healthy tan has faded to a sallow pallor puffy shadows of       sleeplessness and dissipation are marked under his heavylidded       eyes he is dressed in a wellfitting expensive dark suit a       white shirt with a soft collar and brightcoloured tie  miss howard with pleased surprise holding out her hand hello mr murray  murray shaking her handwith a forced pleasantness how are you miss howard  miss howard fine as ever it certainly looks natural to see you around here againnot that i hope youre here to stay though with a smile i suppose youre on your way to eileen now well i wont keep you ive stacks of work to do she opens the hall door he starts for the porch oh i was forgettingcongratulations ive read those storiesall of us have theyre great were all so proud of you youre one of our graduates you know  murray indifferently ohthat stuff  miss howard gaily dont be so modest well see you later i hope  murray yes doctor stanton invited me to stay for supper and i may  miss howard fine be sure to        she goes out murray walks to porch door and steps out he       finds eileens eyes waiting for him as their eyes meet she       gasps involuntarily and he stops short in his tracks for a       moment they remain looking at each other in silence  eileen dropping her eyesfaintly stephen  murray much moved strides to her bedside and takes her hands awkwardly eileen then after a seconds pause in which he searches her face and is shocked by the change illness has madeanxiously how are you feeling eileen he grows confused by her gaze and his eyes shift from hers which search his face with wild yearning  eileen forcing a smile oh im all right eagerly but you stephen how are you excitedly oh its good to see you again her eyes continue fixed on his face pleadingly questioningly  murray haltingly and its sure great to see you again eileen he releases her hand and turns away and im fine and dandy i look a little done up i guess but thats only the result of too much new york        eileen sensing from his manner that whatever she has hoped for       from his visit is not to be sinks back on the pillows shutting       her eyes hopelessly and cannot control a sigh of pain  murray turning to her anxiously whats the matter eileen youre not in pain are you  eileen wearily no  murray you havent been feeling badly lately have you your letters suddenly stoppednot a line for the past three weeksand i  eileen bitterly i got tired of writing and never getting any answer stephen  murray shamefaced come eileen it wasnt as bad as that youd think i neverand i did write didnt i  eileen right after you left here you did stephen lately  murray im sorry eileen it wasnt that i didnt mean tobutin new york its so hard you start to do one thing and something else interrupts you you never seem to get any one thing done when it ought to be you can understand that cant you eileen  eileen sadly yes i understand everything now  murray offended what do you mean by everything you said that so strangely you mean you dont believe but she remains silent with her eyes shut he frowns and takes to pacing up and down beside the bed why have they got you stuck out here on this isolation porch eileen  eileen dully there was no room on the main porch i suppose  murray you never mentioned in any of your letters  eileen its not very cheerful to get letters full of sickness i wouldnt like to i know  murray hurt that isnt fair eileen you know i how long have you been back in the infirmary  eileen about a month  murray shocked a month but you were up and abouton exercise werent youbefore that  eileen no i had to stay in bed while i was at the cottage  murray you meanever since that time they sent you backthe day before i left  eileen yes  murray but i thought from the cheery tone of your letters that you were  eileen uneasily getting better i am stephen im strong enough to be up now but doctor stanton wants me to take a good long rest this time so that when i do get up again ill be sure she breaks off impatiently but dont lets talk about it im all right murray glances down at her face worriedly she changes the subject youve been over to see doctor stanton havent you  murray yes  eileen did he examine you  murray yes carelessly oh he found me ok im fine and dandy as i said before  eileen im glad stephen after a pause tell about yourselfwhat youve been doing youve written a lot lately havent you  murray frowning no i havent been able to get down to itsomehow theres so little time to yourself once you get to know people in new york the sale of the stories you typed put me on easy street as far as money goes so ive felt no need he laughs weakly i guess im one of those who have to get down to hard pan before they get the kick to drive them to hard work  eileen surprised was it hard work writing them up here you used to seem so happy just in doing them  murray i washappier than ive been before or afterwards cynically buti dont knowit was a new game to me then and i was chuck full of illusions about the glory of it he laughs halfheartedly now im hardly a bit more enthusiastic over it than i used to be over newspaper work its like everything else i guess when youve got it you find you dont want it  eileen looking at him wonderinglydisturbed but isnt just the writing itself worth while  murray as if suddenly ashamed of himselfquickly yes of course it is im talking like a fool im sore at everything because im dissatisfied with my own cussedness and lazinessand i want to pass the buck with a smile of cheerful confidence its only a fit ill come out of it all right and get down to brass tacks again  eileen with an encouraging smile thats the way you ought to feel itd be wrongive read the two stories that have come out so far over and over theyre fine i think every line in them sounds like you and at the same time sounds natural and like people and things you see every day everybody thinks theyre fine stephen  murray pleased but pretending cynicism then they must be rotten then with selfassurance well ive plenty more of those stories in my head every time i think of my home town there seems to be a new story in someone ive known there spiritedly oh ill pound them out some time when the spirit moves and ill make them so much better than what ive done so far you wont recognise them i feel its in me to do it smiling darn it do you know just talking about it makes me feel as if i could sit right down now and start in on one is it the fact ive worked here beforeor is it seeing you eileen gratefully i really believe its you i havent forgotten how you helped me before  eileen in a tone of pain dont stephen i didnt do anything  murray eagerly yes you did you made it possible i cant tell you what a help you were and since ive left the san ive looked forward to your letters to boost up my spirits when i felt down in the mouth over my own idiocy i used to reread them and they always were good medicine i cant tell you how grateful ive felt honestly  eileen faintly youre kind to say so stephenbut it was nothing really  murray and i cant tell you how ive missed those letters for the past three weeks they left a big hole in things i was worried about younot having heard a word with a smile so i came to look you up  eileen faintly forcing an answering smile well you see now im all right  murray concealing his doubt yes of course you are only id a darn sight rather see you up and about we could take a walk thenthrough the woods a wince of pain shadows eileens face she closes her eyes murray continues softly after a pause you havent forgotten that last nightout thereeileen  eileen her lips tremblingtrying to force a laugh please dont remind me of that stephen i was so silly and so sick too my temp was so high it must have made mecompletely crazyor id never dreamed of doing such a stupid thing my head must have been full of wheels because i dont remember anything i did or said hardly  murray his pride taken down a peg by thisin a hurt tone oh welli havent forgotten and i never will eileen then his face clears up as if a weight had been taken off his conscience welli rather thought you wouldnt take it seriouslyafterwards you were all up in the air that night and you never mentioned it in your letters  eileen pleadingly dont talk about it forget it ever happened it makes me feelwith a halfhysterical laughlike a fool  murray worried all right eileen i wont dont get worked up over nothing that isnt resting you know looking down at her closed eyessolicitously perhaps all my talking has tired you out do you feel done up why dont you try and take a nap now  eileen dully yes id like to sleep  murray clasps her hands gently ill leave you then ill drop back to say goodbye and stay awhile before i go i wont leave until the last train as she doesnt answer do you hear eileen  eileen weakly yes youll come backto say goodbye  murray yes ill be back sure        he presses her hand and after a kindly glance of sympathy down       at her face tiptoes to the door and goes into the room shutting       the door behind him when she hears the door shut eileen       struggles up in bed and stretches her arms after him with an       agonised sob stephen she hides her face in her hands and sobs       brokenly murray walks across to the hall door and is about to       go out when the door is opened and miss gilpin enters  miss gilpin hurriedly how do you do mr murray doctor stanton just told me you were here  murray as they shake handssmiling how are you miss gilpin  miss gilpin he said hed examined you and that you were ok im glad glancing at him keenly youve been talking to eileen  murray just left her this second she wanted to sleep for a while  miss gilpin wonderingly sleep then hurriedly its too bad i wish id known you were here sooner i wanted very much to talk to you before you saw eileen you see i knew youd pay us a visit some time with a worried smile i still think i ought to have a talk with you  murray certainly miss gilpin  miss gilpin takes a chair and places it near the hall door sit down she cant hear us here goodness knows this is hardly the place for confidences but there are visitors all over and itll have to do did you close the door tightly she mustnt hear me above all she goes to the porch door and peeps out for a moment then comes back to him with flashing eyes shes crying what have you been saying to her oh its too late i know the fools shouldnt have permitted you to see her before i what has happened out there tell me i must know  murray stammering happened nothing shes crying why miss gilpinyou know i wouldnt hurt her for worlds  miss gilpin more calmly intentionally i know you wouldnt but something has happened then briskly were talking at cross purposes since you dont seem inclined to confide in me ill have to in you you noticed how badly she looks didnt you  murray yes i did  miss gilpin gravely shes been going down hill steadilymeaninglyever since you left shes in a very serious state let me impress you with that weve all loved her and felt so sorry for her and admired her spirit sothats the only reason shes been allowed to stay here so long after her time weve kept hoping shed start to pick upin another dayin another week but now thats all over doctor stanton has given up hope of her improving here and her father is unwilling to pay for her elsewhere now he knows theres a cheaper placethe state farm so shes to be sent there in a day or so  murray springing to his feethorrified to the state farm  miss gilpin her time here is long past you know the ruleand she isnt getting better  murray appalled that means  miss gilpin forcibly death thats what it means for her  murray stunned good god i never dreamed  miss gilpin with others it might be different they might improve under changed surroundings in her case its certain shell die and it wouldnt do any good to keep her here either shed die here shell die anywhere shell die because lately shes given up hope she hasnt wanted to live any more shes let herself goand now its too late  murray too late you mean theres no chancenow miss gilpin nods murray is overwhelmedafter a pausestammering isnt thereanythingwe can do  miss gilpin sadly i dont know i should have talked to you before you you see shes seen you now she knows as he looks mystified she continues slowly i suppose you know that eileen loves you dont you  murray as if defending himself against an accusationwith confused alarm nomiss gilpin youre wrong honestly she may have felt something like thatoncebut that was long ago before i left the san shes forgotten all about it since i know she has miss gilpin smiles bitterly why she never even alluded to it in any of her lettersall these months  miss gilpin did you in yours  murray no of course not you dont understand whyjust nowshe said that part of it had all been so silly she felt shed acted like a fool and didnt ever want to be reminded of it  miss gilpin she saw that you didnt love herany more than you did in the days before you left oh i used to watch you then i sensed what was going on between you i would have stopped it then out of pity for her if i could have if i didnt know that any interference would only make matters worse and then i thought that it might be only a surface affairthat after you were gone it would end for her she sighsthen after a pause youll have to forgive me for speaking to you so boldly on a delicate subject but dont you see its for her sake i love eileen we all do averting her eyes from hisin a low voice i know how eileen feels mr murray oncea long time agoi suffered as she is sufferingfrom this same mistake but i had resources to fall back upon that eileen hasnt gota family who loved me and understoodfriendsso i pulled through but it spoiled my life for a long time looking at him again and forcing a smile so i feel that perhaps i have a right to speak for eileen who has no one else  murray huskilymuch moved say anything to me you like miss gilpin  miss gilpin after a pausesadly you dont love herdo you  murray noii dont believe ive ever thought much of loving anyonethat way  miss gilpin sadly oh its too late im afraid if we had only had this talk before you had seen her i meant to talk to you frankly and if i found out you didnt love eileenthere was always the forlorn hope that you mighti was going to tell you not to see her for her sakenot to let her face the truth for i am sure she continued to hope in spite of everything and always wouldto the endif she didnt see you i was going to implore you to stay away to write her letters that would encourage her hope and in that way she would never learn the truth i thought of writing you all thisbutits so delicate a matteri didnt have the courage with intense grief and now doctor stantons decision to send her away makes everything doubly hard when she knows thatshe will throw everything that holds her to lifeout of the window and think of ither dying there alone  murray very pale dont that shant happen i can at least save her from that i have money enoughill make moreto send her to any place you think  miss gilpin that is somethingbut it doesnt touch the source of her unhappiness if there were only some way to make her happy in the little time that is left to her she has suffered so much through you oh mr murray cant you tell her you love her  murray after a pauseslowly but shell never believe me im afraid now  miss gilpin eagerly but you must make her believe and you must ask her to marry you if youre engaged it will give you the right in her eyes to take her away you can take her to some private san theres a small place but a very good one at white lake its not too expensive and its a beautiful spot out of the world and you can live and work near by and shell be happy to the very last dont you think thats somethingthe best you havethe best you can give in return for her love for you  murray slowlydeeply moved yes then determinedly but i wont go into this thing by halves it isnt fair to her im going to marry heryes i mean it i owe her that if it will make her happy but to ask her without really meaning itknowing sheno i cant do that  miss gilpin with a sad smile im glad you feel that way it shouldnt be hard now for you to convince her but i know eileen she will never consentfor your sakeuntil she is well again and stop and think mr murray even if she did consent to marry you right now the shockthe excitementit would be suicide for her i would have to warn her against it myself and you wouldnt propose it if you knew the danger to her in her present condition she hasnt long to live at best ive talked with dr stanton i know god knows i would be the first one to hold out hope if there was any there isnt its merely a case of prolonging the short time left to her and making it happy you must bear that in mindas a fact  murray dully all right ill remember but its hell to realise he turns suddenly towards the porch door ill go out to her now while i feelthatyes i know i can make her believe me now  miss gilpin youll tell melater on  murray yes he opens the door to the porch and goes out miss gilpin stands for a moment looking after him worriedly then she sighs helplessly and goes out to the hall murray steps noiselessly out on the porch eileen is lying motionless with her eyes closed murray stands looking at her his face showing the emotional stress he is under a great pitying tenderness in his eyes then he seems to come to a revealing decision on what is best to do for he tiptoes to the bedside and bending down with a quick movement takes her in his arms and kisses her eileen  eileen startled at first resists automatically for a moment stephen then she succumbs and lies back in his arms with a happy sigh putting both hands to the sides of his face and staring up at him adoringly stephen dear  murray quickly questioning her before she can question him you were fibbingabout that nightwerent you you do love me dont you eileen  eileen breathlessly yesibut you stephenyou dont love me she makes a movement as if to escape from his embrace  murray genuinely movedwith tender reassurance why do you suppose i came up here if not to tell you i did but they warned memiss gilpinthat you were still weak and that i mustnt excite you in any way and ii didnt wantbut i had to come back and tell you in spite of them  eileen convincedwith a happy laugh and is that why you acted so strangeand cold

face momentarily are you sureyou want me stephen  murray a lump in his throathuskily yes i do want you eileen  eileen happily then i willafter im well again of course she kisses him  murray chokingly

reality  eileen terrified by the look in his eyes what is it stephen what  murray with a groanprotesting halfaloud in a strangled voice no no it cant be my god he clutches her hands and hides his face
