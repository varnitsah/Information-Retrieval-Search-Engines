name very frequently repeated in these pages the reader may take for a guide    it was the schooner farallone       r l sl o     note by mr lloyd osbourne   stevenson and i little knew when we began our collaboration that we were afterwards to raise such a hornets nest about our ears the critics resented such an unequal partnership and made it impossible for us to continue it it may be that they were right they wanted stevensons best and felt pretty sure they would not get it in our collaboration but when they ascribed all the good in our three books to stevenson and all the bad to me they went a little beyond the mark it is a pleasure to me to recall that the early part of both the wrecker and the ebbtide was almost entirely my own so also were the storm scenes of the norah creina so also the fight on the flying scud so also the inception of huishs scheme the revelation of it to his companions his landing on the atoll with the bottle of vitriol in his breast on the other hand the paris portion of the wrecker was all stevensons as well as the concluding chapters of both the south sea books  it is not possible to disentangle anything else that was wholly mine or histhe blending was too complete our method of work too crisscrossed and intimate for instance we would begin by outlining the story in a general way this done we marshalled it into chapters with a few explanatory words to each then it was for me to write the first draft of chapter i this i would read to him and if satisfactory it was laid to one side but were it not i would rewrite it embodying his criticisms each chapter in turn was fully discussed in advance before i put pen to paper and in this way though the actual first draft was in my own hand the form of the story continually took shape under stevensons eyes when my first draft of the entire book was finished he would rewrite it again from cover to cover  i can remember nothing more delightful than the days we thus passed together if our three books are in no wise great they preserve it seems to me something of the zest and exhilaration that went into their makingthe good humour the eagerness  we were both under the glamour of the islandsand that life so strange so picturesque so animated took us both by storm kings and beachcombers pearlfishers and princesses traders slavers and schoonercaptains castaways and runawayswhat a world it was and all this in a fairyland of palms and glassy bays and little lost settlements nestling at the foot of forest and mountain with kings to make brotherhood with us and a dubious white man or two in earrings and pyjamas no less insistent to extend to us the courtesies of the beach  it was amid such people and amid such scenes that the ebbtide and the wrecker were written       lloyd osbourne     part i  the trio     the ebbtide  chapter i  night on the beach   throughout the island world of the pacific scattered men of many european races and from almost every grade of society carry activity and disseminate disease some prosper some vegetate some have mounted the steps of thrones and owned islands and navies others again must marry for a livelihood a strapping merry chocolatecoloured dame supports them in sheer idleness and dressed like natives but still retaining some foreign element of gait or attitude still perhaps with some relic such as a single eyeglass of the officer and gentleman they sprawl in palmleaf verandahs and entertain an island audience with memoirs of the musichall and there are still others less pliable less capable less fortunate perhaps less base who continue even in these isles of plenty to lack bread  at the far end of the town of papeete three such men were seated on the beach under a puraotree  it was late long ago the band had broken up and marched musically home a motley troop of men and women merchant clerks and navy officers dancing in its wake arms about waist and crowned with garlands long ago darkness and silence had gone from house to house about the tiny pagan city only the streetlamps shone on making a glowworm halo in the umbrageous alleys or drawing a tremulous image on the waters of the port a sound of snoring ran among the piles of lumber by the government pier it was wafted ashore from the graceful clipperbottomed schooners where they lay moored close in like dinghies and their crews were stretched upon the deck under the open sky or huddled in a rude tent amidst the disorder of merchandise  but the men under the purao had no thought of sleep the same temperature in england would have passed without remark in summer but it was bitter cold for the south seas inanimate nature knew it and the bottle of cocoanut oil stood frozen in every birdcage house about the island and the men knew it and shivered they wore flimsy cotton clothes the same they had sweated in by day and run the gauntlet of the tropic showers and to complete their evil case they had no breakfast to mention less dinner and no supper at all  in the telling south sea phrase these three men were on the beach common calamity had brought them acquainted as the three most miserable englishspeaking creatures in tahiti and beyond their misery they knew next to nothing of each other not even their true names for each had made a long apprenticeship in going downward and each at some stage of the descent had been shamed into the adoption of an alias and yet not one of them had figured in a court of justice two were men of kindly virtues and one as he sat and shivered under the purao had a tattered virgil in his pocket  certainly if money could have been raised upon the book robert herrick would long ago have sacrificed that last possession but the demand for literature which is so marked a feature in some parts of the south seas extends not so far as the dead tongues and the virgil which he could not exchange against a meal had often consoled him in his hunger he would study it as he lay with tightened belt on the floor of the old calaboose seeking favourite passages and finding new ones only less beautiful because they lacked the consecration of remembrance or he would pause on random country walks sit on the pathside gazing over the sea on the mountains of eimeo and dip into the aeneid seeking sortes and if the oracle as is the way of oracles replied with no very certain nor encouraging voice visions of england at least would throng upon the exiles memory the busy schoolroom the green playingfields holidays at home and the perennial roar of london and the fireside and the white head of his father for it is the destiny of those grave restrained and classic writers with whom we make enforced and often painful acquaintanceship at school to pass into the blood and become native in the memory so that a phrase of virgil speaks not so much of mantua or augustus but of english places and the students own irrevocable youth  robert herrick was the son of an intelligent active and ambitious man small partner in a considerable london house hopes were conceived of the boy he was sent to a good school gained there an oxford scholarship and proceeded in course to the western university with all his talent and taste and he had much of both robert was deficient in consistency and intellectual manhood wandered in bypaths of study worked at music or at metaphysics when he should have been at greek and took at last a paltry degree almost at the same time the london house was disastrously wound up mr herrick must begin the world again as a clerk in a strange office and robert relinquish his ambitions and accept with gratitude a career that he detested and despised he had no head for figures no interest in affairs detested the constraint of hours and despised the aims and the success of merchants to grow rich was none of his ambitions rather to do well a worse or a more bold young man would have refused the destiny perhaps tried his future with his pen perhaps enlisted robert more prudent possibly more timid consented to embrace that way of life in which he could most readily assist his family but he did so with a mind divided fled the neighbourhood of former comrades and chose out of several positions placed at his disposal a clerkship in new york  his career thenceforth was one of unbroken shame he did not drink he was exactly honest he was never rude to his employers yet was everywhere discharged bringing no interest to his duties he brought no attention his day was a tissue of things neglected and things done amiss and from place to place and from town to town he carried the character of one thoroughly incompetent no man can bear the word applied to him without some flush of colour as indeed there is none other that so emphatically slams in a mans face the door of selfrespect and to herrick who was conscious of talents and acquirements who looked down upon those humble duties in which he was found wanting the pain was the more exquisite early in his fall he had ceased to be able to make remittances shortly after having nothing but failure to communicate he ceased writing home and about a year before this tale begins turned suddenly upon the streets of san francisco by a vulgar and infuriated german jew he had broken the last bonds of selfrespect and upon a sudden impulse changed his name and invested his last dollar in a passage on the mail brigantine the city of papeete with what expectation he had trimmed his flight for the south seas herrick perhaps scarcely knew doubtless there were fortunes to be made in pearl and copra doubtless others not more gifted than himself had climbed in the island world to be queens consorts and kings ministers but if herrick had gone there with any manful purpose he would have kept his fathers name the alias betrayed his moral bankruptcy he had struck his flag he entertained no hope to reinstate himself or help his straitened family and he came to the islands where he knew the climate to be soft bread cheap and manners easy a skulker from lifes battle and his own immediate duty failure he had said was his portion let it be a pleasant failure  it is fortunately not enough to say i will be base herrick continued in the islands his career of failure but in the new scene and under the new name he suffered no less sharply than before a place was got it was lost in the old style from the longsuffering of the keepers of restaurants he fell to more open charity upon the wayside as time went on goodnature became weary and after a repulse or two herrick became shy there were women enough who would have supported a far worse and a far uglier man herrick never met or never knew them or if he did both some manlier feeling would revolt and he preferred starvation drenched with rains broiling by day shivering by night a disused and ruinous prison for a bedroom his diet begged or pilfered out of rubbish heaps his associates two creatures equally outcast with himself he had drained for months the cup of penitence he had known what it was to be resigned what it was to break forth in a childish fury of rebellion against fate and what it was to sink into the coma of despair the time had changed him he told himself no longer tales of an easy and perhaps agreeable declension he read his nature otherwise he had proved himself incapable of rising and he now learned by experience that he could not stoop to fall something that was scarcely pride or strength that was perhaps only refinement withheld him from capitulation but he looked on upon his own misfortune with a growing rage and sometimes wondered at his patience  it was now the fourth month completed and still there was no change or sign of change the moon racing through a world of flying clouds of every size and shape and density some black as inkstains some delicate as lawn threw the marvel of her southern brightness over the same lovely and detested scene the island mountains crowned with the perennial island cloud the embowered city studded with rare lamps the masts in the harbour the smooth mirror of the lagoon and the mole of the barrier reef on which the breakers whitened the moon shone too with bullseye sweeps on his companions on the stalwart frame of the american who called himself brown and was known to be a mastermariner in some disgrace and on the dwarfish person the pale eyes and toothless smile of a vulgar and badhearted cockney clerk here was society for robert herrick the yankee skipper was a man at least he had sterling qualities of tenderness and resolution he was one whose hand you could take without a blush but there was no redeeming grace about the other who called himself sometimes hay and sometimes tomkins and laughed at the discrepancy who had been employed in every store in papeete for the creature was able in his way who had been discharged from each in turn for he was wholly vile who had alienated all his old employers so that they passed him in the street as if he were a dog and all his old comrades so that they shunned him as they would a creditor  not long before a ship from peru had brought an influenza and it now raged in the island and particularly in papeete from all round the purao arose and fell a dismal sound of men coughing and strangling as they coughed the sick natives with the islanders impatience of a touch of fever had crawled from their houses to be cool and squatting on the shore or on the beached canoes painfully expected the new day even as the crowing of cocks goes about the country in the night from farm to farm accesses of coughing arose and spread and died in the distance and sprang up again each miserable shiverer caught the suggestion from his neighbour was torn for some minutes by that cruel ecstasy and left spent and without voice or courage when it passed if a man had pity to spend papeete beach in that cold night and in that infected season was a place to spend it on and of all the sufferers perhaps the least deserving but surely the most pitiable was the london clerk he was used to another life to houses beds nursing and the dainties of the sickroom he lay here now in the cold open exposed to the gusting of the wind and with an empty belly he was besides infirm the disease shook him to the vitals and his companions watched his endurance with surprise a profound commiseration filled them and contended with and conquered their abhorrence the disgust attendant on so ugly a sickness magnified this dislike at the same time and with more than compensating strength shame for a sentiment so inhuman bound them the more straitly to his service and even the evil they knew of him swelled their solicitude for the thought of death is always the least supportable when it draws near to the merely sensual and selfish sometimes they held him up sometimes with mistaken helpfulness they beat him between the shoulders and when the poor wretch lay back ghastly and spent after a paroxysm of coughing they would sometimes peer into his face doubtfully exploring it for any mark of life there is no one but has some virtue that of the clerk was courage and he would make haste to reassure them in a pleasantry not always decent  im all right pals he gasped once this is the thing to strengthen the muscles of the larynx  well you take the cake cried the captain  o im good plucked enough pursued the sufferer with a broken utterance but it do seem bloomin hard to me that i should be the only party down with this form of vice and the only one to do the funny business i think one of you other parties might wake up tell a fellow something  the trouble is weve nothing to tell my son returned the captain  ill tell you if you like what i was thinking said herrick  tell us anything said the clerk i only want to be reminded that i aint dead  herrick took up his parable lying on his face and speaking slowly and scarce above his breath not like a man who has anything to say but like one talking against time  well i was thinking this he began i was thinking i lay on papeete beach one nightall moon and squalls and fellows coughingand i was cold and hungry and down in the mouth and was about ninety years of age and had spent two hundred and twenty of them on papeete beach and i was thinking i wished i had a ring to rub or had a fairy godmother or could raise beelzebub and i was trying to remember how you did it i knew you made a ring of skulls for i had seen that in the freischütz and that you took off your coat and turned up your sleeves for i had seen formes do that when he was playing kaspar and you could see by the way he went about it it was a business he had studied and that you ought to have something to kick up a smoke and a bad smell i daresay a cigar might do and that you ought to say the lords prayer backwards well i wondered if i could do that it seemed rather a feat you see and then i wondered if i would say it forward and i thought i did well no sooner had i got to world without end than i saw a man in a pariu and with a mat under his arm come along the beach from the town he was rather a hardfavoured old party and he limped and crippled and all the time he kept coughing at first i didnt cotton to his looks i thought and then i got sorry for the old soul because he coughed so hard i remembered that we had some of that cough mixture the american consul gave the captain for hay it never did hay a haporth of service but i thought it might do the old gentlemans business for him and stood up yorana says i yorana says he look here i said ive got some firstrate stuff in a bottle itll fix your cough savvy harry my1 and ill measure you a tablespoonful in the palm of my hand for all our plate is at the bankers so i thought the old party came up and the nearer he came the less i took to him but i had passed my word you see  wot is this bloomin drivel interrupted the clerk its like the rot there is in tracts  its a story i used to tell them to the kids at home said herrick if it bores you ill drop it  o cut along returned the sick man irritably its better than nothing  well continued herrick i had no sooner given him the cough mixture than he seemed to straighten up and change and i saw he wasnt a tahitian after all but some kind of arab and had a long beard on his chin one good turn deserves another says he i am a magician out of the arabian nights and this mat that i have under my arm is the original carpet of mohammed ben somebodyorother say the word and you can have a cruise upon the carpet you dont mean to say this is the travelling carpet i cried you bet i do said he youve been to america since last i read the arabian nights said i a little suspicious i should think so said he been everywhere a man with a carpet like this isnt going to moulder in a semidetached villa well that struck me as reasonable all right i said and do you mean to tell me i can get on that carpet and go straight to london england i said london england captain because he seemed to have been so long in your part of the world in the crack of a whip said he i figured up the time what is the difference between papeete and london captain  taking greenwich and point venus nine hours odd minutes and seconds replied the mariner  well thats about what i made it resumed herrick about nine hours calling this three in the morning i made out i would drop into london about noon and the idea tickled me immensely theres only one bother i said i havent a copper cent it would be a pity to go to london and not buy the morning standard o said he you dont realise the conveniences of this carpet you see this pocket youve only got to stick your hand in and you pull it out filled with sovereigns  doubleeagles wasnt it inquired the captain  that was what it was cried herrick i thought they seemed unusually big and i remember now i had to go to the moneychangers at charing cross and get english silver  o you went there said the clerk wot did you do bet you had a bands  well you see it was just as the old boy saidlike the cut of a whip said herrick the one minute i was here on the beach at three in the morning the next i was in front of the golden cross at midday at first i was dazzled and covered my eyes and there didnt seem the smallest change the roar of the strand and the roar of the reef were like the same hark to it now and you can hear the cabs and buses rolling and the streets resound and then at last i could look about and there was the old place and no mistake with the statues in the square and st martinsinthefields and the bobbies and the sparrows and the hacks and i cant tell you what i felt like i felt like crying i believe or dancing or jumping clean over the nelson column i was like a fellow caught up out of hell and flung down into the dandiest part of heaven then i spotted for a hansom with a spanking horse a shilling for yourself if youre there in twenty minutes said i to the jarvey he went a good pace though of course it was a trifle to the carpet and in nineteen minutes and a half i was at the door  what door asked the captain  o a house i know of returned herrick  bet it was a publichouse cried the clerkonly these were not his words and wy didnt you take the carpet there instead of trundling in a growler  i didnt want to startle a quiet street said the narrator bad form and besides it was a hansom  well and what did you do next inquired the captain  o i went in said herrick  the old folks asked the captain  thats about it said the other chewing a grass  well i think you are about the poorest and at a yarn cried the clerk crikey its like ministering children i can tell you there would be more beer and skittles about my little jaunt i would go and have a bands for luck then i would get a big ulster with astrakhan fur and take my cane and do the ladeda down piccadilly then i would go to a slapup restaurant and have green peas and a bottle of fizz and a chump chopo and i forgot id ave some devilled whitebait firstand green gooseberry tart and ot coffee and some of that form of vice in big bottles with a sealbenedictinethats the bloomin nyme then id drop into a theatre and pal on with some chappies and do the dancing rooms and bars and that and wouldnt go ome till morning till daylight doth appear and the next day id have watercresses am muffin and fresh butter wouldnt i just o my  the clerk was interrupted by a fresh attack of coughing  well now ill tell you what i would do said the captain i would have none of your fancy rigs with the man driving from the mizzen crosstrees but a plain foreandaft hack cab of the highest registered tonnage first of all i would bring up at the market and get a turkey and a suckingpig then id go to a winemerchants and get a dozen of champagne and a dozen of some sweet wine rich and sticky and strong something in the port or madeira line the best in the store then id bear up for a toystore and lay out twenty dollars in assorted toys for the pickaninnies and then to a confectioners and take in cakes and pies and fancy bread and that stuff with the plums in it and then to a newsagency and buy all the papers all the picture ones for the kids and all the story papers for the old girl about the earl discovering himself to annamariar and the escape of the lady maude from the private madhouse and then id tell the fellow to drive home  there ought to be some syrup for the kids suggested herrick they like syrup  yes syrup for the kids red syrup at that said the captain and those things they pull at and go pop and have measly poetry inside and then i tell you wed have a thanksgivingday and christmastree combined great scott but i would like to see the kids i guess they would light right out of the house when they saw daddy driving up my little adar  the captain stopped sharply  well keep it up said the clerk  the damned thing is i dont know if they aint starving cried the captain  they cant be worse off than we are and thats one comfort returned the clerk i defy the devil to make me worse off  it seemed as if the devil heard him the light of the moon had been some time cut off and they had talked in darkness now there was heard a roar which drew impetuously nearer the face of the lagoon was seen to whiten and before they had staggered to their feet a squall burst in rain upon the outcasts the rage and volume of that avalanche one must have lived in the tropics to conceive a man panted in its assault as he might pant under a showerbath and the world seemed whelmed in night and water  they fled groping for their usual shelterit might be almost called their homein the old calaboose came drenched into its empty chambers and lay down three sops of humanity on the cold coral floors and presently when the squall was overpast the others could hear in the darkness the chattering of the clerks teeth  i say you fellows he wailed for gods sake lie up and try to warm me im blymed if i dont think ill die else  so the three crept together into one wet mass and lay until day came shivering and dozing off and continually reawakened to wretchedness by the coughing of the clerk   footnote    1 come here     chapter ii  morning on the beachthe three letters   the clouds were all fled the beauty of the tropic day was spread upon papeete and the wall of breaking seas upon the reef and the palms upon the islet already trembled in the heat a french manofwar was going out homeward bound she lay in the middle distance of the port an antheap for activity in the night a schooner had come in and now lay far out hard by the passage and the yellow flag the emblem of pestilence flew on her from up the coast a long procession of canoes headed round the point and towards the market bright as a scarf with the manycoloured clothing of the natives and the piles of fruit but not even the beauty and the welcome warmth of the morning not even these naval movements so interesting to sailors and to idlers could engage the attention of the outcasts they were still cold at heart their mouths sour from the want of sleep their steps rambling from the lack of food and they strung like lame geese along the beach in a disheartened silence it was towards the town they moved towards the town whence smoke arose where happier folk were breakfasting and as they went their hungry eyes were upon all sides but they were only scouting for a meal  a small and dingy schooner lay snug against the quay with which it was connected by a plank on the forward deck under a spot of awning five kanakas who made up the crew were squatted round a basin of fried feis2 and drinking coffee from tin mugs  eight bells knock off for breakfast cried the captain with a miserable heartiness never tried this craft before positively my first appearance guess ill draw a bumper house  he came close up to where the plank rested on the grassy quay turned his back upon the schooner and began to whistle that lively air the irish washerwoman it caught the ears of the kanaka seamen like a preconcerted signal with one accord they looked up from their meal and crowded to the ships side fei in hand and munching as they looked even as a poor brown pyrenean bear dances in the streets of english towns under his masters baton even so but with how much more of spirit and precision the captain footed it in time to his own whistling and his long morning shadow capered beyond him on the grass the kanakas smiled on the performance herrick looked on heavyeyed hunger for the moment conquering all sense of shame and a little farther off but still hard by the clerk was torn by the seven devils of the influenza  the captain stopped suddenly appeared to perceive his audience for the first time and represented the part of a man surprised in his private hour of pleasure  hello said he  the kanakas clapped hands and called upon him to go on  no sir said the captain no eat no dance savvy  poor old man returned one of the crew him no eat  lord no said the captain likeum too much eat no got  all right me got said the sailor you tome here plenty toffee plenty fei nutha man him tome too  i guess well drop right in observed the captain and he and his companions hastened up the plank they were welcomed on board with the shaking of hands place was made for them round the basin a sticky demijohn of molasses was added to the feast in honour of company and an accordion brought from the forecastle and significantly laid by the performers side  ariana3 said he lightly touching the instrument as he spoke and he fell to on a long savoury fei made an end of it raised his mug of coffee and nodded across at the spokesman of the crew heres your health old man youre a credit to the south pacific said he  with the unsightly greed of hounds they glutted themselves with the hot food and coffee and even the clerk revived and the colour deepened in his eyes the kettle was drained the basin cleaned their entertainers who had waited on their wants throughout with the pleased hospitality of polynesians made haste to bring forward a dessert of island tobacco and rolls of pandanus leaf to serve as paper and presently all sat about the dishes puffing like indian sachems  when a man as breakfast every day he dont know what it is observed the clerk  the next point is dinner said herrick and then with a passionate utterance i wish to god i was a kanaka  theres one thing sure said the captain im about desperate id rather hang than rot here much longer and with the word he took the accordion and struck up home sweet home  o drop that cried herrick i cant stand that  no more can i said the captain ive got to play something though got to pay the shot my son and he struck up john browns body in a fine sweet baritone dandy jim of carolina came next rorin the bold swing low sweet chariot and the beautiful land followed the captain was paying his shot with usury as he had done many a time before many a meal had he bought with the same currency from the melodiousminded natives always as now to their delight  he was in the middle of fifteen dollars in the inside pocket singing with dogged energy for the task went sore against the grain when a sensation was suddenly to be observed among the crew  tapena tom harry my4 said the spokesman pointing  and the three beachcombers following his indication saw the figure of a man in pyjama trousers and a white jumper approaching briskly from the town  thats tapena tom is it said the captain pausing in his music i dont seem to place the brute  wed better cut said the clerk es no good  well said the musician deliberately one cant most generally always tell ill try it on i guess music has charms to soothe the savage tapena boys we might strike it rich it might amount to iced punch in the cabin  hiced punch o my said the clerk give him something ot captain way down the swannee river try that  no sir looks scots said the captain and he struck for his life into auld lang syne  captain tom continued to approach with the same businesslike alacrity no change was to be perceived in his bearded face as he came swinging up the plank he did not even turn his eyes on the performer    we twa hae paidled in the burn    frae morning tide till dine  went the song  captain tom had a parcel under his arm which he laid on the house roof and then turning suddenly to the strangers here you he bellowed be off out of that  the clerk and herrick stood not on the order of their going but fled incontinently by the plank the performer on the other hand flung down the instrument and rose to his full height slowly  whats that you say he said ive half a mind to give you a lesson in civility  you set up any more of your gab to me returned the scotsman and ill show ye the wrong side of a jyle ive heard tell of the three of ye yere not long for here i can tell ye that the government has their eyes upon ye they make short work of damned beachcombers ill say that for the french  you wait till i catch you off your ship cried the captain and then turning to the crew goodbye you fellows he said youre gentlemen anyway the worst nigger among you would look better upon a quarterdeck than that filthy scotsman  captain tom scorned to reply he watched with a hard smile the departure of his guests and as soon as the last foot was off the plank turned to the hands to work cargo  the beachcombers beat their inglorious retreat along the shore herrick first his face dark with blood his knees trembling under him with the hysteria of rage presently under the same purao where they had shivered the night before he cast himself down and groaned aloud and ground his face into the sand  dont speak to me dont speak to me i cant stand it broke from him  the other two stood over him perplexed  wot cant he stand now said the clerk asnt he ad a meal im lickin my lips  herrick reared up his wild eyes and burning face i cant beg he screamed and again threw himself prone  this things got to come to an end said the captain with an intake of the breath  looks like signs of an end dont it sneered the clerk  hes not so far from it and dont you deceive yourself replied the captainwell he added in a livelier voice you fellows hang on here and ill go and interview my representative  whereupon he turned on his heel and set off at a swinging sailors walk towards papeete  it was some halfhour later when he returned the clerk was dozing with his back against the tree herrick still lay where he had flung himself nothing showed whether he slept or waked  see boys cried the captain with that artificial heartiness of his which was at times so painful heres a new idea and he produced notepaper stamped envelopes and pencils three of each we can all write home by the mail brigantine the consul says i can come over to his place and ink up the addresses  well thats a start too said the clerk i never thought of that  it was that yarning last night about going home that put me up to it said the captain  well and over said the clerk ill ave a shy and he retired a little distance to the shade of a canoe  the others remained under the purao now they would write a word or two now scribble it out now they would sit biting at the pencil end and staring seaward now their eyes would rest on the clerk where he sat propped on the canoe leering and coughing his pencil racing glibly on the paper  i cant do it said herrick suddenly i havent got the heart  see here said the captain speaking with unwonted gravity it may be hard to write and to write lies at that and god knows it is but its the square thing it dont cost anything to say youre well and happy and sorry you cant make a remittance this mail and if you dont ill tell you what i think it isi think its about the highwater mark of being a brute beast  its easy to talk said herrick you dont seem to have written much yourself i notice  what do you bring in me for broke from the captain his voice was indeed scarce raised above a whisper but emotion clanged in it what do you know about me if you had commanded the finest barque that ever sailed from portland if you had been drunk in your berth when she struck the breakers in fourteen island group and hadnt had the wit to stay there and drown but came on deck and given drunken orders and lost six livesi could understand your talking then there he said more quietly thats my yarn and now you know it its a pretty one for the father of a family five men and a woman murdered yes there was a woman on board and hadnt no business to be either guess i sent her to hell if there is such a place i never dared go home again and the wife and the little ones went to england to her fathers place i dont know whats come to them he added with a bitter shrug  thank you captain said herrick i never liked you better  they shook hands short and hard with eyes averted tenderness swelling in their bosoms  now boys to work again at lying said the captain  ill give my father up returned herrick with a writhen smile ill try my sweetheart instead for a change of evils  and here is what he wrote     emma i have scratched out the beginning to my father for i think i    can write more easily to you this is my last farewell to all the    last you will ever hear or see of an unworthy friend and son i have    failed in life i am quite broken down and disgraced i pass under a    false name you will have to tell my father that with all your    kindness it is my own fault i know had i chosen that i might have    done well and yet i swear to you i tried to choose i could not bear    that you should think i did not try for i loved you all you must    never doubt me in that you least of all i have always unceasingly    loved but what was my love worth and what was i worth i had not    the manhood of a common clerk i could not work to earn you i have    lost you now and for your sake i could be glad of it when you first    came to my fathers housedo you remember those days i want you    toyou saw the best of me then all that was good in me do you    remember the day i took your hand and would not let it goand the    day on battersea bridge when we were looking at a barge and i began    to tell you one of my silly stories and broke off to say i loved    you that was the beginning and now here is the end when you have    read this letter you will go round and kiss them all goodbye my    father and mother and the children one by one and poor uncle and    tell them all to forget me and forget me yourself turn the key in    the door let no thought of me return be done with the poor ghost    that pretended he was a man and stole your love scorn of myself    grinds in me as i write i should tell you i am well and happy and    want for nothing i do not exactly make money or i should send a    remittance but i am well cared for have friends live in a    beautiful place and climate such as we have dreamed of together and    no pity need be wasted on me in such places you understand it is    easy to live and live well but often hard to make sixpence in    money explain this to my father he will understand i have no more    to say only linger going out like an unwilling guest god in    heaven bless you think of me at the last here on a bright beach    the sky and sea immoderately blue and the great breakers roaring    outside on a barrier reef where a little isle sits green with palms    i am well and strong it is a more pleasant way to die than if you    were crowding about me on a sickbed and yet i am dying this is my    last kiss forgive forget the unworthy  so far he had written his paper was all filled when there returned a memory of evenings at the piano and that song the masterpiece of love in which so many have found the expression of their dearest thoughts einst o wunder he added more was not required he knew that in his loves heart the context would spring up escorted with fair images and harmony of how all through life her name should tremble in his ears her name be everywhere repeated in the sounds of nature and when death came and he lay dissolved her memory lingered and thrilled among his elements    once o wonder once from the ashes of my heart    arose a blossom  herrick and the captain finished their letters about the same time each was breathing deep and their eyes met and were averted as they closed the envelopes  sorry i write so big said the captain gruffly came all of a rush when it did come  same here said herrick i could have done with a ream when i got started but its long enough for all the good i had to say  they were still at the addresses when the clerk strolled up smirking and twirling his envelope like a man well pleased he looked over herricks shoulder  hullo he said you aint writing ome  i am though said herrick she lives with my fathero i see what you mean he added my real name is herrick no more haythey had both used the same aliasno more hay than yours i daresay  clean bowled in the middle stump laughed the clerk my names uish if you want to know everybody has a false nyme in the pacific lay you five to three the captain as  so i have too replied the captain and ive never told my own since the day i tore the titlepage out of my bowditch and flung the damned thing into the sea but ill tell it to you boys john davis is my name im davis of the sea ranger  dooce you are said huish and what was she a pirate or a slyver  she was the fastest barque out of portland maine replied the captain and for the way i lost her i might as well have bored a hole in her side with an auger  o you lost her did you said the clerk ope she was insured  no answer being returned to this sally huish still brimming over with vanity and conversation struck into another subject  ive a good mind to read you my letter said he ive a good fist with a pen when i choose and this is a prime lark she was a barmaid i ran across in northampton she was a spanking fine piece no end of style and we cottoned at first sight like parties in the play i suppose i spent the chynge of a fiver on that girl well i appened to remember her nyme so i wrote to her and told her ow i had got rich and married a queen in the hislands and lived in a blooming palace such a sight of crammers i must read you one bit about my opening the nigger parliament in a cocked at its really prime  the captain jumped to his feet thats what you did with the paper that i went and begged for you he roared  it was perhaps lucky for huishit was surely in the end unfortunate for allthat he was seized just then by one of his prostrating accesses of cough his comrades would have else deserted him so bitter was their resentment when the fit had passed the clerk reached out his hand picked up the letter which had fallen to the earth and tore it into fragments stamp and all  does that satisfy you he asked sullenly  well say no more about it replied davis   footnotes    2 fei is the hill banana    3 byandby    4 captain tom is coming     chapter iii  the old calaboosedestiny at the door   the old calaboose in which the waifs had so long harboured is a low rectangular enclosure of building at the corner of a shady western avenue and a little townward of the british consulate within was a grassy court littered with wreckage and the traces of vagrant occupation six or seven cells opened from the court the doors that had once been locked on mutinous whalermen rotting before them in the grass no mark remained of their old destination except the rusty bars upon the windows  the floor of one of the cells had been a little cleared a bucket the last remaining piece of furniture of the three caitiffs stood full of water by the door a half cocoanut shell beside it for a drinkingcup and on some ragged ends of mat huish sprawled asleep his mouth open his face deathly the glow of the tropic afternoon the green of sunbright foliage stared into that shady place through door and window and herrick pacing to and fro on the coral floor sometimes paused and laved his face and neck with tepid water from the bucket his long arrears of suffering the nights vigil the insults of the morning and the harrowing business of the letter had strung him to that point when pain is almost pleasure time shrinks to a mere point and death and life appear indifferent to and fro he paced like a caged brute his mind whirling through the universe of thought and memory his eyes as he went skimming the legends on the wall the crumbling whitewash was all full of them tahitian names and french and english and rude sketches of ships under sail and men at fisticuffs  it came to him of a sudden that he too must leave upon these walls the memorial of his passage he paused before a clean space took the pencil out and pondered vanity so hard to dislodge awoke in him we call it vanity at least perhaps unjustly rather it was the bare sense of his existence prompted him the sense of his life the one thing wonderful to which he scarce clung with a finger from his jarred nerves there came a strong sentiment of coming change whether good or ill he could not say change he knew no morechange with inscrutable veiled face approaching noiseless with the feeling came the vision of a concertroom the rich hues of instruments the silent audience and the loud voice of the symphony destiny knocking at the door he thought drew a stave on the plaster and wrote in the famous phrase from the fifth symphony so thought he they will know that i loved music and had classical tastes they he i suppose the unknown kindred spirit that shall come some day and read my memor querela ha he shall have latin too and he added terque quaterque beati queis ante ora patrum  he turned again to his uneasy pacing but now with an irrational and supporting sense of duty done he had dug his grave that morning now he had carved his epitaph the folds of the toga were composed why should he delay the insignificant trifle that remained to do he paused and looked long in the face of the sleeping huish drinking disenchantment and distaste of life he nauseated himself with that vile countenance could the thing continue what bound him now had he no rightsonly the obligation to go on without discharge or furlough bearing the unbearable ich trage unerträgliches the quotation rose in his mind he repeated the whole piece one of the most perfect of the most perfect of poets and a phrase struck him like a blow du stolzes herz du hast es ja gewollt where was the pride of his heart and he raged against himself as a man bites on a sore tooth in a heady sensuality of scorn i have no pride i have no heart no manhood he thought or why should i prolong a life more shameful than the gallows or why should i have fallen to it no pride no capacity no force not even a bandit and to be starving here with worse than bandittiwith this trivial hellhound his rage against his comrade rose and flooded him and he shook a trembling fist at the sleeper  a swift step was audible the captain appeared upon the threshold of the cell panting and flushed and with a foolish face of happiness in his arms he carried a loaf of bread and bottles of beer the pockets of his coat were bulging with cigars he rolled his treasures on the floor grasped herrick by both hands and crowed with laughter  broach the beer he shouted broach the beer and glory hallelujah  beer repeated huish struggling to his feet  beer it is cried davis beer and plenty of it any number of persons can use it like lyons toothtablet with perfect propriety and neatnesswhos to officiate  leave me alone for that said the clerk he knocked the necks off with a lump of coral and each drank in succession from the shell  have a weed said davis its all in the bill  what is up asked herrick  the captain fell suddenly grave im coming to that said he i want to speak with herrick here you hayor huish or whatever your name isyou take a weed and the other bottle and go and see how the wind is down by the purao ill call you when youre wanted  hey secrets that aint the ticket said huish  look here my son said the captain this is business and dont you make any mistake about it if youre going to make trouble you can have it your own way and stop right here only get the thing right if herrick and i go we take the beer savvy  o i dont want to shove my oar in returned huish ill cut right enough give me the swipes you can jaw till youre blue in the face for what i care i dont think its the friendly touch thats all and he shambled grumbling out of the cell into the staring sun  the captain watched him clear of the courtyard then turned to herrick  what is it asked herrick thickly  ill tell you said davis i want to consult you its a chance weve gotwhats that he cried pointing to the music on the wall  what said the other o that its music its a phrase of beethovens i was writing up it means destiny knocking at the door  does it said the captain rather low and he went near and studied the inscription and this french he asked pointing to the latin  o it just means i should have been luckier if i had died at home returned herrick impatiently what is this business  destiny knocking at the door repeated the captain and then looking over his shoulder well mr herrick thats about what it comes to he added  what do you mean explain yourself said herrick  but the captain was again staring at the music about how long ago since you wrote up this truck he asked  what does it matter exclaimed herrick i daresay half an hour  my god its strange cried davis theres some men would call that accidental not me that and he drew his thick finger under the musicthats what i call providence  you said we had a chance said herrick  yes sir said the captain wheeling suddenly face to face with his companion i did so if youre the man i take you for we have a chance  i dont know what you take me for was the reply you can scarce take me too low  shake hands mr herrick said the captain i know you youre a gentleman and a man of spirit i didnt want to speak before that bummer there youll see why but to you ill rip it right out i got a ship  a ship cried herrick what ship  that schooner we saw this morning off the passage  that schooner with the hospital flag  thats the hooker said davis shes the farallone hundred and sixty tons register out of frisco for sydney in california champagne captain mate and one hand all died of the smallpox same as they had round in the paumotus i guess captain and mate were the only white men all the hands kanakas seems a queer kind of outfit from a christian port three of them left and a cook didnt know where they were i cant think where they were either if you come to that wiseman must have been on the booze i guess to sail the course he did however there he was dead and here are the kanakas as good as lost they bummed around at sea like the babes in the wood and tumbled endon upon tahiti the consul here took charge he offered the berth to williams williams had never had the smallpox and backed down that was when i came in for the letterpaper i thought there was something up when the consul asked me to look in again but i never let on to you fellows sos youd not be disappointed consul tried mneil scared of smallpox he tried capirati that corsican and leblue or whatever his name is wouldnt lay a hand on it all too fond of their sweet lives last of all when there wasnt nobody else left to offer it to he offers it to me brown will you ship captain and take her to sydney says he let me choose my own mate and another white hand says i for i dont hold with this kanaka crew racket give us all two months advance to get our clothes and instruments out of pawn and ill take stock tonight fill up stores and get to sea tomorrow before dark thats what i said thats good enough says the consul and you can count yourself damned lucky brown says he and he said it pretty meaningfulappearing too however thats all one now ill ship huish before the mastof course ill let him berth aftand ill ship you mate at seventyfive dollars and two months advance  me mate why im a landsman cried herrick  guess youve got to learn said the captain you dont fancy im going to skip and leave you rotting on the beach perhaps im not that sort old man and youre handy anyway ive been shipmates with worse  god knows i cant refuse said herrick god knows i thank you from my heart  thats all right said the captain but it aint all he turned aside to light a cigar  what else is there asked the other with a pang of undefinable alarm  im coming to that said davis and then paused a little see here he began holding out his cigar between his finger and thumb suppose you figure up what thisll amount to you dont catch on well we get two months advance we cant get away from papeeteour creditors wouldnt let us gofor less itll take us along about two months to get to sydney and when we get there i just want to put it to you squarely what the better are we  were off the beach at least said herrick  i guess theres a beach at sydney returned the captain and ill tell you one thing mr herricki dont mean to try no sir sydney will never see me  speak out plain said herrick  plain dutch replied the captain im going to own that schooner its nothing new its done every year in the pacific stephens stole a schooner the other day didnt he hayes and pease stole vessels all the time and its the making of the crowd of us see hereyou think of that cargo champagne why its like as if it was put up on purpose in peru well sell that liquor off at the pierhead and the schooner after it if we can find a fool to buy her and then light out for the mines if youll back me up i stake my life i carry it through  captain said herrick with a quailing voice dont do it  im desperate returned davis ive got a chance i may never get another herrick say the word back me up i think weve starved together long enough for that  i cant do it im sorry i cant do it ive not fallen as low as that said herrick deadly pale  what did you say this morning said davis that you couldnt beg its the one thing or the other my son  ah but this is the gaol cried herrick dont tempt me its the gaol  did you hear what the skipper said on board that schooner pursued the captain well i tell you he talked straight the french have let us alone for a long time it cant last longer theyve got their eye on us and as sure as you live in three weeks youll be in gaol whatever you do i read it in the consuls face  you forget captain said the young man there is another way i can die and to say truth i think i should have died three years ago  the captain folded his arms and looked the other in the face yes said he yes you can cut your throat thats a frozen fact much good may it do you and where do i come in  the light of a strange excitement came in herricks face both of us said he both of us together its not possible you can enjoy this business come and he reached out a timid hand a few strokes in the lagoonand rest  i tell you herrick im most tempted to answer you the way the man does in the bible and say get thee behind me satan said the captain what you think i would go drown myself and i got children starving enjoy it no by god i do not enjoy it but its the row ive got to hoe and ill hoe it till i drop right here i have three of them you see two boys and the one girl adar the trouble is that you are not a parent yourself i tell you herrick i love you the man broke out i didnt take to you at first you were so anglified and tony but i love you now its a man that loves you stands here and wrestles with you i cant go to sea with the bummer alone its not possible go drown yourself and there goes my last chancethe last chance of a poor miserable beast earning a crust to feed his family i cant do nothing but sail ships and ive no papers and here i get a chance and you go back on me ah youve no family and thats where the trouble is  i have indeed said herrick  yes i know said the captain you think so but no mans got a family till hes got children its only the kids count theres something about the little shavers  i cant talk of them and if you thought a cent about this father that i hear you talk of or that sweetheart you were writing to this morning you would feel like me you would say what matter laws and god and that my folks are hard up i belong to them ill get them bread or by god ill get them wealth if i have to burn down london for it thats what you would say and ill tell you more your heart is saying so this living minute i can see it in your face youre thinking heres poor friendship for the man ive starved along of and as for the girl that i set up to be in love with heres a mighty limp kind of a love that wont carry me as far as most any man would go for a demijohn of whisky theres not much romance to that love anyway its not the kind they carry on about in songbooks but whats the good of my carrying on talking when its all in your inside as plain as print i put the question to you once for all are you going to desert me in my hour of needyou know if ive deserted youor will you give me your hand and try a fresh deal and go home as like as not a millionaire say no and god pity me say yes and ill make the little ones pray for you every night on their bended knees god bless mr herrick thats what theyll say one after the other the old girl sitting there holding stakes at the foot of the bed and the damned little innocents  he broke off i dont often rip out about the kids he said but when i do theres something fetches loose  captain said herrick faintly is there nothing else  ill prophesy if you like said the captain with renewed vigour refuse this because you think yourself too honest and before a months out youll be gaoled for a sneakthief i give you the word fair i can see it herrick if you cant youre breaking down dont think if you refuse this chance that youll go on doing the evangelical youre about through with your stock and before you know where you are youll be right out on the other side no its either this for you or else its caledonia i bet you never were there and saw those white shaved men in their dustclothes and straw hats prowling around in gangs in the lamplight at noumea they look like wolves and they look like preachers and they look like the sick huish is a daisy to the best of them well theres your company theyre waiting for you herrick and you got to go and thats a prophecy  and as the man stood and shook through his great stature he seemed indeed like one in whom the spirit of divination worked and might utter oracles herrick looked at him and looked away it seemed not decent to spy upon such agitation and the young mans courage sank  you talk of going home he objected we could never do that  we could said the other captain brown couldnt nor mr hay that shipped mate with him couldnt but whats that to do with captain davis or mr herrick you galoot  but hayes had these wild islands where he used to call came the next fainter objection  we have the wild islands of peru retorted davis they were wild enough for stephens no longer agone than just last year i guess theyll be wild enough for us  and the crew  all kanakas come i see youre right old man i see youll stand by and the captain once more offered his hand  have it your own way then said herrick ill do it a strange thing for my fathers son but ill do it ill stand by you man for good or evil  god bless you cried the captain and stood silent herrick he added with a smile i believe id have died in my tracks if youd said no  and herrick looking at the man half believed so also  and now well go break it to the bummer said davis  i wonder how hell take it said herrick  him jump at it was the reply     chapter iv  the yellow flag   the schooner farallone lay well out in the jaws of the pass where the terrified pilot had made haste to bring her to her moorings and escape seen from the beach through the thin line of shipping two objects stood conspicuous to seaward the little isle on the one hand with its palms and the guns and batteries raised forty years before in defence of queen pomares capital the outcast farallone upon the other banished to the threshold of the port rolling there to her scuppers and flaunting the plagueflag as she rolled a few seabirds screamed and cried about the ship and within easy range a manofwar guardboat hung off and on and glittered with the weapons of marines the exuberant daylight and the blinding heaven of the tropics picked out and framed the pictures  a neat boat manned by natives in uniform and steered by the doctor of the port put from shore towards three of the afternoon and pulled smartly for the schooner the foresheets were heaped with sacks of flour onions and potatoes perched among which was huish dressed as a foremast hand a heap of chests and cases impeded the action of the oarsmen and in the stern by the left hand of the doctor sat herrick dressed in a fresh rig of slops his brown beard trimmed to a point a pile of paper novels on his lap and nursing the while between his feet a chronometer for which they had exchanged that of the farallone long since run down and the rate lost  they passed the guardboat exchanging hails with the boatswains mate in charge and drew near at last to the forbidden ship not a cat stirred there was no speech of man and the sea being exceeding high outside and the reef close to where the schooner lay the clamour of the surf hung round her like the sound of battle  ohé la goëlette sang out the doctor with his best voice  instantly from the house where they had been stowing away stores first davis and then the ragamuffin swarthy crew made their appearance  hullo hay that you said the captain leaning on the rail tell the old man to lay her alongside as if she was eggs theres a hell of a run of sea here and his boats brittle  the movement of the schooner was at that time more than usually violent now she heaved her side as high as a deepsea steamers and showed the flashing of her copper now she swung swiftly towards the boat until her scuppers gurgled  i hope you have sealegs observed the doctor you will require them  indeed to board the farallone in that exposed position where she lay was an affair of some dexterity the less precious goods were hoisted roughly the chronometer after repeated failures was passed gently and successfully from hand to hand and there remained only the more difficult business of embarking huish even that piece of dead weight shipped ab at eighteen dollars and described by the captain to the consul as an invaluable man was at last hauled on board without mishap and the doctor with civil salutations took his leave  the three coadventurers looked at each other and davis heaved a breath of relief  now lets get this chronometer fixed said he and led the way into the house it was a fairly spacious place two staterooms and a goodsized pantry opened from the main cabin the bulkheads were painted white the floor laid with waxcloth no litter no sign of life remained for the effects of the dead men had been disinfected and conveyed on shore only on the table in a saucer some sulphur burned and the fumes set them coughing as they entered the captain peered into the starboard stateroom where the bedclothes still lay tumbled in the bunk the blanket flung back as they had flung it back from the disfigured corpse before its burial  now i told these niggers to tumble that truck overboard grumbled davis guess they were afraid to lay hands on it well theyve hosed the place out thats as much as can be expected i suppose huish lay on to these blankets  see you blooming well far enough first said huish drawing back  whats that snapped the captain ill tell you my young friend i think you make a mistake im captain here  fat lot i care returned the clerk  that so said davis then youll berth forward with the niggers walk right out of this cabin  o i dessay said huish see any green in my eye a larks a lark  well now ill explain this business and youll see once for all just precisely how much lark there is to it said davis im captain and im going to be it one thing of three first you take my orders here as cabin steward in which case you mess with us or second you refuse and i pack you forwardand you get as quick as the words said or third and last ill signal that manofwar and send you ashore under arrest for mutiny  and of course i wouldnt blow the gaff o no replied the jeering huish  and whos to believe you my son inquired the captain no sir there aint no larking about my captainising enough said up with these blankets  huish was no fool he knew when he was beaten and he was no coward either for he stepped to the bunk took the infected bedclothes fairly in his arms and carried them out of the house without a check or tremor  i was waiting for the chance said davis to herrick i neednt do the same with you because you understand it for yourself  are you going to berth here asked herrick following the captain into the stateroom where he began to adjust the chronometer in its place at the bedhead  not much replied he i guess ill berth on deck i dont know as im afraid but ive no immediate use for confluent smallpox  i dont know that im afraid either said herrick but the thought of these two men sticks in my throat that captain and mate dying here one opposite to the other its grim i wonder what they said last  wiseman and wishart said the captain probably mighty small potatoes thats a thing a fellow figures out for himself one way and the real business goes quite another perhaps wiseman said here old man fetch up the gin im feeling powerful rocky and perhaps wishart said o hell  well thats grim enough said herrick  and so it is said davisthere theres that chronometer fixed and now its about time to up anchor and clear out  he lit a cigar and stepped on deck  here you whats your name he cried to one of the hands a leanflanked cleanbuilt fellow from some far western island and of a darkness almost approaching to the african  sally day replied the man  devil it is said the captain didnt know we had ladies on boardwell sally oblige me by hauling down that rag there ill do the same for you another time he watched the yellow bunting as it was eased past the crosstrees and handed down on deck youll float no more on this ship he observed muster the people aft mr hay he added speaking unnecessarily loud ive a word to say to them  it was with a singular sensation that herrick prepared for the first time to address a crew he thanked his stars indeed that they were natives but even natives he reflected might be critics too quick for such a novice as himself they might perceive some lapse from that precise and cutanddry english which prevails on board a ship it was even possible they understood no other and he racked his brain and overhauled his reminiscences of sea romance for some appropriate words  here men tumble aft he said lively now all hands aft  they crowded in the alleyway like sheep  here they are sir said herrick  for some time the captain continued to face the stern then turned with ferocious suddenness on the crew and seemed to enjoy their shrinking  now he said twisting his cigar in his mouth and toying with the spokes of the wheel im captain brown i command this ship this is mr hay first officer the other white man is cabin steward but hell stand watch and do his trick my orders shall be obeyed smartly you savvy smartly there shall be no growling about the kaikai which will be above allowance youll put a handle to the mates name and tack on sir to every order i give you if youre smart and quick ill make this ship comfortable for all hands he took the cigar out of his mouth if youre not he added in a roaring voice ill make it a floating hellnow mr hay well pick watches if you please  all right said herrick  you will please use sir when you address me mr hay said the captain ill take the lady step to starboard sally and then he whispered in herricks ear take the old man  ill take you there said herrick  whats your name said the captain whats that you say o thats not english ill have none of your highway gibberish on my ship well call you old uncle ned because youve got no wool on the top of your head just the place where the wool ought to grow step to port uncle dont you hear mr hay has picked you then ill take the white man white man step to starboard now which of you two is the cook you then mr hay takes your friend in the blue dungaree step to port dungaree there we know who we all are dungaree uncle ned sally day white man and cook all ffvs i guess and now mr hay well up anchor if you please  for heavens sake tell me some of the words whispered herrick  an hour later the farallone was under all plain sail the rudder hard aport and the cheerfullyclanking windlass had brought the anchor home  all clear sir cried herrick from the bow  the captain met her with the wheel as she bounded like a stag from her repose trembling and bending to the puffs the guardboat gave a parting hail the wake whitened and ran out the farallone was under weigh  her berth had been close to the pass even as she forged ahead davis slewed her for the channel between the pierends of the reef the breakers sounding and whitening to either hand straight through the narrow band of blue she shot to seaward and the captains heart exulted as he felt her tremble underfoot and looking back over the taffrail beheld the roofs of papeete changing position on the shore and the island mountains rearing higher in the wake  but they were not yet done with the shore and the horror of the yellow flag about midway of the pass there was a cry and a scurry a man was seen to leap upon the rail and throwing his arms over his head to stoop and plunge into the sea  steady as she goes the captain cried relinquishing the wheel to huish  the next moment he was forward in the midst of the kanakas belayingpin in hand  anybody else for shore he cried and the savage trumpeting of his voice no less than the ready weapon in his hand struck fear in all stupidly they stared after their escaped companion whose black head was visible upon the water steering for the land and the schooner meanwhile slipped like a racer through the pass and met the long sea of the open ocean with a souse of spray  fool that i was not to have a pistol ready exclaimed davis well we go to sea shorthanded we cant help that you have a lame watch of it mr hay  i dont see how we are to get along said herrick  got to said the captain no more tahiti for me  both turned instinctively and looked astern the fair island was unfolding mountaintop on mountaintop eimeo on the port board lifted her splintered pinnacles and still the schooner raced to the open sea  think cried the captain with a gesture yesterday morning i danced for my breakfast like a poodle dog     chapter v  the cargo of champagne   the ships head was laid to clear eimeo to the north and the captain sat down in the cabin with a chart a ruler and an epitome  east a half nothe said he raising his face from his labours mr hay youll have to watch your dead reckoning i want every yard she makes on every hairsbreadth of a course im going to knock a hole right straight through the paumotus and thats always a near touch now if this south east trade ever blew out of the se which it dont we might hope to lie within half a point of our course say we lie within a point of it thatll just about weather fakarava yes sir thats what weve got to do if we tack for it brings us through this slush of little islands in the cleanest place see and he showed where his ruler intersected the widelying labyrinth of the dangerous archipelago i wish it was night and i could put her about right now were losing time and easting well well do our best and if we dont fetch peru well bring up to ecuador all one i guess depreciated dollars down and no questions asked a remarkable fine institootion the south american don  tahiti was already some way astern the diadem rising from among broken mountainseimeo was already close aboard and stood black and strange against the golden splendour of the westwhen the captain took his departure from the two islands and the patent log was set  some twenty minutes later sally day who was continually leaving the wheel to peer in at the cabin clock announced in a shrill cry fo bell and the cook was to be seen carrying the soup into the cabin  i guess ill sit down and have a pick with you said davis to herrick by the time ive done itll be dark and well clap the hooker on the wind for south america  in the cabin at one corner of the table immediately below the lamp and on the lee side of a bottle of champagne sat huish  whats this where did that come from asked the captain  its fizz and it came from the afterold if you want to know said huish and drained his mug  thisll never do exclaimed davis the merchant seamans horror of breaking into cargo showing incongruously forth on board that stolen ship there was never any good came of games like that  you byby said huish a fellow would think to ear him we were on the square and look ere youve put this job up ansomely for me avent you im to go on deck and steer while you two sit and guzzle and im to go by a nickname and got to call you sir and mister well you look here my bloke ill have fizz ad lib or it wont wash i tell you that and you know mighty well you aint got any manofwar to signal now  davis was staggered id give fifty dollars this had never happened he said weakly  well it as appened you see returned huish try some its devilish good  the rubicon was crossed without another struggle the captain filled a mug and drank  i wish it was beer he said with a sigh but theres no denying its the genuine stuff and cheap at the money now huish you clear out and take your wheel  the little wretch had gained a point and he was gay ay ay sir said he and left the others to their meal  peasoup exclaimed the captain blamed if i thought i should taste peasoup again  herrick sat inert and silent it was impossible after these months of hopeless want to smell the rough highspiced sea victuals without lust and his mouth watered with desire of the champagne it was no less impossible to have assisted at the scene between huish and the captain and not to perceive with sudden bluntness the gulf where he had fallen he was a thief among thieves he said it to himself he could not touch the soup if he had moved at all it must have been to leave the table throw himself overboard and drownan honest man  here said the captain you look sick old man have a drop of this  the champagne creamed and bubbled in the mug its bright colour its lively effervescence seized his eye it is too late to hesitate he thought his hand took the mug instinctively he drank with unquenchable pleasure and desire of more drained the vessel dry and set it down with sparkling eyes  there is something in life after all he cried i had forgot what it was like yes even this is worth while wine food dry clotheswhy theyre worth dying worth hanging for captain tell me one thing why arent all the poor folk footpads  give it up said the captain  they must be damned good cried herrick theres something here beyond me think of that calaboose suppose we were sent suddenly back he shuddered as stung by a convulsion and buried his face in his clutching hands  here whats wrong with you cried the captain there was no reply only herricks shoulders heaved so that the table was shaken take some more of this here drink this i order you to dont start crying when youre out of the wood  im not crying said herrick raising his face and showing his dry eyes its worse than crying its the horror of that grave that weve escaped from  come now you tackle your soup thatll fix you said davis kindly i told you you were all broken up you couldnt have stood out another week  thats the dreadful part of it cried herrick another week and id have murdered some one for a dollar god and i know that and im still living its some beastly dream  quietly quietly quietly does it my son take your peasoup food thats what you want said davis  the soup strengthened and quieted herricks nerves another glass of wine and a piece of pickled pork and fried banana completed what the soup began and he was able once more to look the captain in the face  i didnt know i was so much run down he said  well said davis you were as steady as a rock all day now youve had a little lunch youll be as steady as a rock again  yes was the reply im steady enough now but im a queer kind of a first officer  shucks cried the captain youve only got to mind the ships course and keep your slate to half a point a babby could do that let alone a college graduate like you there aint nothing to sailoring when you come to look it in the face and now well go and put her about bring the slate well have to start our dead reckoning right away  the distance run since the departure was read off the log by the binnacle light and entered on the slate  ready about said the captain give me the wheel white man and you stand by the mainsheet boom tackle mr hay please and then you can jump forward and attend head sails  ay ay sir responded herrick  all clear forward asked davis  all clear sir  hard alee cried the captain haul in your slack as she comes he called to huish haul in your slack put your back into it keep your feet out of the coils a sudden blow sent huish flat along the deck and the captain was in his place pick yourself up and keep the wheel hard over he roared you wooden fool you wanted to get killed i guess draw the jib he cried a moment later and then to huish give me the wheel again and see if you can coil that sheet  but huish stood and looked at davis with an evil countenance do you know you struck me said he  do you know i saved your life returned the other not deigning to look at him his eyes travelling instead between the compass and the sails where would you have been if that boom had swung out and you bundled in the slack no sir well have no more of you at the mainsheet seaport towns are full of mainsheetmen they hop upon one leg my son whats left of them and the rest are dead set your boom tackle mr hay struck you did i lucky for you i did  well said huish slowly i dessay there may be somethink in that ope there is he turned his back elaborately on the captain and entered the house where the speedy explosion of a champagne cork showed he was attending to his comfort  herrick came aft to the captain how is she doing now he asked  east and by nothe a half nothe said davis its about as good as i expected  whatll the hands think of it said herrick  o they dont think they aint paid to says the captain  there was something wrong was there not between you and herrick paused  thats a nasty little beast thats a biter replied the captain shaking his head but so long as you and me hang in it dont matter  herrick lay down in the weather alleyway the night was cloudless the movement of the ship cradled him he was oppressed besides by the first generous meal after so long a time of famine and he was recalled from deep sleep by the voice of davis singing out eight bells  he rose stupidly and staggered aft where the captain gave him the wheel  by the wind said the captain it comes a little puffy when you get a heavy puff steal all you can to windward but keep her a good full  he stepped towards the house paused and hailed the forecastle  got such a thing as a concertina forward said he bully for you uncle ned fetch it aft will you  the schooner steered very easy and herrick watching the moonwhitened sails was overpowered by drowsiness a sharp report from the cabin startled him a third bottle had been opened and herrick remembered the sea ranger and fourteen island group presently the notes of the accordion sounded and then the captains voice    o honey with our pockets full of money    we will trip trip trip we will trip it on the quay    and i will dance with kate and tom will dance with sall    when were all back from south amerikee  so it went to its quaint air and the watch below lingered and listened by the forward door and uncle ned was to be seen in the moonlight nodding time and herrick smiled at the wheel his anxieties a while forgotten song followed song another cork exploded there were voices raised as though the pair in the cabin were in disagreement and presently it seemed the breach was healed for it was now the voice of huish that struck up to the captains accompaniment    up in a balloon boys      up in a balloon    all among the little stars      and round about the moon  a wave of nausea overcame herrick at the wheel he wondered why the air the words which were yet written with a certain knack and the voice and accent of the singer should all jar his spirit like a file on a mans teeth he sickened at the thought of his two comrades drinking away their reason upon stolen wine quarrelling and hiccupping and waking up while the doors of a prison yawned for them in the near future shall i have sold my honour for nothing he thought and a heat of rage and resolution glowed in his bosomrage against his comradesresolution to carry through this business if it might be carried pluck profit out of shame since the shame at least was now inevitable and come home home from south americahow did the song gowith his pockets full of money    o honey with our pockets full of money    we will trip trip trip we will trip it on the quay  so the words ran in his head and the honey took on visible form the quay rose before him and he knew it for the lamplit embankment and he saw the lights of battersea bridge bestride the sullen river all through the remainder of his trick he stood entranced reviewing the past he had been always true to his love but not always sedulous to recall her in the growing calamity of his life she had swum more distant like the moon in mist the letter of farewell the dishonourable hope that had surprised and corrupted him in his distress the changed scene the sea the night and the musicall stirred him to the roots of manhood i will win her he thought and ground his teeth fair or foul what matters if i win her  fo bell matey i think um fo bellhe was suddenly recalled by these words in the voice of uncle ned  look in at the clock uncle said he he would not look himself from horror of the tipplers  him past matey repeated the hawaiian  so much the better for you uncle he replied and he gave up the wheel repeating the directions as he had received them  he took two steps forward and remembered his dead reckoning how has she been heading he thought and he flushed from head to foot he had not observed or had forgotten here was the old incompetence the slate must be filled up by guess never again he vowed to himself in silent fury never again it shall be no fault of mine if this miscarry and for the remainder of his watch he stood close by uncle ned and read the face of the compass as perhaps he had never read a letter from his sweetheart  all the time and spurring him to the more attention song loud talk fleering laughter and the occasional popping of a cork reached his ears from the interior of the house and when the port watch was relieved at midnight huish and the captain appeared upon the quarterdeck with flushed faces and uneven steps the former laden with bottles the latter with two tin mugs herrick silently passed them by they hailed him in thick voices he made no answer they cursed him for a churl he paid no heed although his belly quivered with disgust and rage he closedto the door of the house behind him and cast himself on a locker in the cabinnot to sleep he thoughtrather to think and to despair yet he had scarce turned twice on his uneasy bed before a drunken voice hailed him in the ear and he must go on deck again to stand the morning watch  the first evening set the model for those that were to follow two cases of champagne scarce lasted the fourandtwenty hours and almost the whole was drunk by huish and the captain huish seemed to thrive on the excess he was never sober yet never wholly tipsy the food and the sea air had soon healed him of his disease and he began to lay on flesh but with davis things went worse in the drooping unbuttoned figure that sprawled all day upon the lockers tippling and reading novels in the fool who made of the evening watch a public carouse on the quarterdeck it would have been hard to recognise the vigorous seaman of papeete roads he kept himself reasonably well in hand till he had taken the sun and yawned and blotted through his calculations but from the moment he rolled up the chart his hours were passed in slavish selfindulgence or in hoggish slumber every other branch of his duty was neglected except maintaining a stern discipline about the dinnertable again and again herrick would hear the cook called aft and see him running with fresh tins or carrying away again a meal that had been totally condemned and the more the captain became sunk in drunkenness the more delicate his palate showed itself once in the forenoon he had a bosuns chair rigged over the rail stripped to his trousers and went overboard with a pot of paint i dont like the way this schooners painted said he and ive taken a down upon her name but he tired of it in half an hour and the schooner went on her way with an incongruous patch of colour on the stern and the word farallone part obliterated and part looking through he refused to stand either the middle or morning watch it was fineweather sailing he said and asked with a laugh who ever heard of the old man standing watch himself to the dead reckoning which herrick still tried to keep he would pay not the least attention nor afford the least assistance  what do we want of dead reckoning he asked we get the sun all right dont we  we maynt get it always though objected herrick and you told me yourself you werent sure of the chronometer  o there aint no flies in the chronometer cried davis  oblige me so far captain said herrick stiffly i am anxious to keep this reckoning which is a part of my duty i do not know what to allow for current nor how to allow for it i am too inexperienced and i beg of you to help me  never discourage zealous officer said the captain unrolling the chart again for herrick had taken him over his days work and while he was still partly sober here it is look for yourself anything from west to west nothewest and anyways from five to twentyfive miles thats what the amralty chart says i guess you dont expect to get on ahead of your own britishers  i am trying to do my duty captain brown said herrick with a dark flush and i have the honour to inform you that i dont enjoy being trifled with  what in thunder do you want roared davis go and look at the blamed wake if youre trying to do your duty why dont you go and do it i guess its no business of mine to go and stick my head over the ships rump i guess its yours and ill tell you what it is my fine fellow ill trouble you not to come the dude over me youre insolent thats whats wrong with you dont you crowd me mr herrick esquire  herrick tore up his papers threw them on the floor and left the cabin  hes turned a bloomin swot aint he sneered huish  he thinks himself too good for his company thats what ails herrick esquire raged the captain he thinks i dont understand when he comes the heavy swell wont sit down with us wont he wont say a civil word ill serve the son of a gun as he deserves by god huish ill show him whether hes too good for john davis  easy with the names cap said huish who was always the more sober easy over the stones my boy  all right i will youre a good sort huish i didnt take to you at first but i guess youre right enough lets open another bottle said the captain and that day perhaps because he was excited by the quarrel he drank more recklessly and by four oclock was stretched insensible upon the locker  herrick and huish supped alone one after the other opposite his flushed and snorting body and if the sight killed herricks hunger the isolation weighed so heavily on the clerks spirit that he was scarce risen from table ere he was currying favour with his former comrade  herrick was at the wheel when he approached and huish leaned confidentially across the binnacle  i say old chappie he said you and me dont seem to be such pals somehow  herrick gave her a spoke or two in silence his eye as it skirted from the needle to the luff of the foresail passed the man by without speculation but huish was really dull a thing he could support with difficulty having no resources of his own the idea of a private talk with herrick at this stage of their relations held out particular inducements to a person of his character drink besides as it renders some men hypersensitive made huish callous and it would almost have required a blow to make him quit his purpose  pretty business aint it he continued dyvis on the lush must say i thought you gave it im a1 today he didnt like it a bit took on hawful after you were gone ere says i old on easy on the lush i says errick was right and you know it give im a chanst i says uish sezee dont you gimme no more of your jaw or ill knock your bloomin eyes out well wot can i do errick but i tell you i dont arf like it it looks to me like the sea rynger over again  still herrick was silent  do you ear me speak asked huish sharply youre pleasant aint you  stand away from that binnacle said herrick  the clerk looked at him long and straight and black his figure seemed to writhe like that of a snake about to strike then he turned on his heel went back to the cabin and opened a bottle of champagne when eight bells were cried he slept on the floor beside the captain on the locker and of the whole starboard watch only sally day appeared upon the summons the mate proposed to stand the watch with him and let uncle ned lie down it would make twelve hours on deck and probably sixteen but in this fairweather sailing he might safely sleep between his tricks of wheel leaving orders to be called on any sign of squalls so far he could trust the men between whom and himself a close relation had sprung up with uncle ned he held long nocturnal conversations and the old man told him his simple and hard story of exile suffering and injustice among cruel whites the cook when he found herrick messed alone produced for him unexpected and sometimes unpalatable dainties of which he forced himself to eat and one day when he was forward he was surprised to feel a caressing hand run down his shoulder and to hear the voice of sally day crooning in his ear you gootch man he turned and choking down a sob shook hands with the negrito they were kindly cheery childish souls upon the sunday each brought forth his separate biblefor they were all men of alien speech even to each other and sally day communicated with his mates in english only each read or madebelieve to read his chapter uncle ned with spectacles on his nose and they would all join together in the singing of missionary hymns it was thus a cutting reproof to compare the islanders and the whites aboard the farallone shame ran in herricks blood to remember what employment he was on and to see these poor soulsand even sally day the child of cannibals in all likelihood a cannibal himselfso faithful to what they knew of good the fact that he was held in grateful favour by these innocents served like blinders to his conscience and there were times when he was inclined with sally day to call himself a good man but the height of his favour was only now to appear with one voice the crew protested ere herrick knew what they were doing the cook was aroused and came a willing volunteer all hands clustered about their mate with expostulations and caresses and he was bidden to lie down and take his customary rest without alarm  he tell you tlue said uncle ned you sleep evely man hea he do all light evely man he like you too much  herrick struggled and gave way choked upon some trivial words of gratitude and walked to the side of the house against which he leaned struggling with emotion  uncle ned presently followed him and begged him to lie down  its no use uncle ned he replied i couldnt sleep im knocked over with all your goodness  ah no call me uncle ned no mo cried the old man no my name my name taveeta allesame taveeta king of islael wat for he call that hawaii i think no savvy nothingallesame wiseamana  it was the first time the name of the late captain had been mentioned and herrick grasped the occasion the reader shall be spared uncle neds unwieldy dialect and learn in less embarrassing english the sum of what he now communicated the ship had scarce cleared the golden gates before the captain and mate had entered on a career of drunkenness which was scarcely interrupted by their malady and only closed by death for days and weeks they had encountered neither land nor ship and seeing themselves lost on the huge deep with their insane conductors the natives had drunk deep of terror  at length they made a low island and went in and wiseman and wishart landed in the boat  there was a great village a very fine village and plenty kanakas in that place but all mighty serious and from every here and there in the back parts of the settlement taveeta heard the sounds of island lamentation i no savvy talk that island said he i savvy hear um cly i think hum too many people die here but upon wiseman and wishart the significance of that barbaric keening was lost full of bread and drink they rollicked along unconcerned embraced the girls who had scarce energy to repel them took up and joined with drunken voices in the deathwail and at last on what they took to be an invitation entered under the roof of a house in which was a considerable concourse of people sitting silent they stooped below the eaves flushed and laughing within a minute they came forth again with changed faces and silent tongues and as the press severed to make way for them taveeta was able to perceive in the deep shadow of the house the sick man raising from his mat a head already defeatured by disease the two tragic triflers fled without hesitation for their boat screaming on taveeta to make haste they came aboard with all speed of oars raised anchor and crowded sail upon the ship with blows and curses and were at sea againand again drunkbefore sunset a week after and the last of the two had been committed to the deep herrick asked taveeta where that island was and he replied that by what he gathered of folks talk as they went up together from the beach he supposed it must be one of the paumotus this was in itself probable enough for the dangerous archipelago had been swept that year from east to west by devastating smallpox but herrick thought it a strange course to lie from sydney then he remembered the drink  were they not surprised when they made the island he asked  wiseamana he say damn what this was the reply  o thats it then said herrick i dont believe they knew where they were  i think so too said uncle ned i think no savvy this one mo betta he added pointing to the house where the drunken captain slumbered takeasun alletime  the implied last touch completed herricks picture of the life and death of his two predecessors of their prolonged sordid sodden sensuality as they sailed they knew not whither on their last cruise he held but a twinkling and unsure belief in any future state the thought of one of punishment he derided yet for him as for all there dwelt a horror about the end of the brutish man sickness fell upon him at the image thus called up and when he compared it with the scene in which he himself was acting and considered the doom that seemed to brood upon the schooner a horror that was almost superstitious fell upon him and yet the strange thing was he did not falter he who had proved his incapacity in so many fields being now falsely placed amid duties which he did not understand without help and it might be said without countenance had hitherto surpassed expectation and even the shameful misconduct and shocking disclosures of that night seemed but to nerve and strengthen him he had sold his honour he vowed it should not be in vain it shall be no fault of mine if this miscarry he repeated and in his heart he wondered at himself living rage no doubt supported him no doubt also the sense of the last cast of the ships burned of all doors closed but one which is so strong a tonic to the merely weak and so deadly a depressent to the merely cowardly  for some time the voyage went otherwise well they weathered fakarava with one board and the wind holding well to the southward and blowing fresh they passed between ranaka and ratiu and ran some days northeast by easthalfeast under the lee of takume and honden neither of which they made in about 14° south and between 134° and 135° west it fell a dead calm with rather a heavy sea the captain refused to take in sail the helm was lashed no watch was set and the farallone rolled and banged for three days according to observation in almost the same place the fourth morning a little before day a breeze sprang up and rapidly freshened the captain had drunk hard the night before he was far from sober when he was roused and when he came on deck for the first time at halfpast eight it was plain he had already drunk deep again at breakfast herrick avoided his eye and resigned the deck with indignation to a man more than halfseasover  by the loud commands of the captain and the singing out of fellows at the ropes he could judge from the house that sail was being crowded on the ship relinquished his halfeaten breakfast and came on deck again to find the main and the jib topsails set and both watches and the cook turned out to hand the staysail the farallone lay already far over the sky was obscured with misty scud and from the windward an ominous squall came flying up broadening and blackening as it rose  fear thrilled in herricks vitals he saw death hard by and if not death sure ruin for if the farallone lived through the coming squall she must surely be dismasted with that their enterprise was at an end and they themselves bound prisoners to the very evidence of their crime the greatness of the peril and his own alarm sufficed to silence him pride wrath and shame raged without issue in his mind and he shut his teeth and folded his arms close  the captain sat in the boat to windward bellowing orders and insults his eyes glazed his face deeply congested a bottle set between his knees a glass in his hand half empty his back was to the squall and he was at first intent upon the setting of the sail when that was done and the great trapezium of canvas had begun to draw and to trail the leerail of the farallone level with the foam he laughed out an empty laugh drained his glass sprawled back among the lumber in the boat and fetched out a crumpled novel  herrick watched him and his indignation glowed redhot he glanced to windward where the squall already whitened the near sea and heralded its coming with a singular and dismal sound he glanced at the steersman and saw him clinging to the spokes with a face of a sickly blue he saw the crew were running to their stations without orders and it seemed as if something broke in his brain and the passion of anger so long restrained so long eaten in secret burst suddenly loose and shook him like a sail he stepped across to the captain and smote his hand heavily on the drunkards shoulder  you brute he said in a voice that tottered look behind you  whas that cried davis bounding in the boat and upsetting the champagne  you lost the sea ranger because you were a drunken sot said herrick now youre going to lose the farallone youre going to drown here the same way as you drowned others and be damned and your daughter shall walk the streets and your sons be thieves like their father  for the moment the words struck the captain white and foolish my god he cried looking at herrick as upon a ghost my god herrick  look behind you then reiterated the assailant  the wretched man already partly sobered did as he was told and in the same breath of time leaped to his feet down staysail he trumpeted the hands were thrilling for the order and the great sail came with a run and fell half overboard among the racing foam jib topsail halyards let the staysl be he said again  but before it was well uttered the squall shouted aloud and fell in a solid mass of wind and rain commingled on the farallone and she stooped under the blow and lay like a thing dead from the mind of herrick reason fled he clung in the weather rigging exulting he was done with life and he gloried in the release he gloried in the wild noises of the wind and the choking onslaught of the rain he gloried to die so and now amid this coil of the elements and meanwhile in the waist up to his knees in waterso low the schooner laythe captain was hacking at the foresheet with a pocketknife it was a question of seconds for the farallone drank deep of the encroaching seas but the hand of the captain had the advance the foresail boom tore apart the last strands of the sheet and crashed to leeward the farallone leaped up into the wind and righted and the peak and throat halyards which had long been let go began to run at the same instant  for some ten minutes more she careered under the impulse of the squall but the captain was now master of himself and of his ship and all danger at an end and then sudden as a trickchange upon the stage the squall blew by the wind dropped into light airs the sun beamed forth again upon the tattered schooner and the captain having secured the foresail boom and set a couple of hands to the pump walked aft sober a little pale and with the sodden end of a cigar still stuck between his teeth even as the squall had found it herrick followed him he could scarce recall the violence of his late emotions but he felt there was a scene to go through and he was anxious and even eager to go through with it  the captain turning at the houseend met him face to face and averted his eyes weve lost the two topsls and the staysl he gabbled good business we didnt lose any sticks i guess you think were all the better without the kites  thats not what im thinking said herrick in a voice strangely quiet that yet echoed confusion in the captains mind  i know that he cried holding up his hand i know what youre thinking no use to say it now im sober  i have to say it though returned herrick  hold on herrick youve said enough said davis youve said what i would take from no man breathing but yourself only i know its true  i have to tell you captain brown pursued herrick that i resign my position as mate you can put me in irons or shoot me as you please i will make no resistanceonly i decline in any way to help or to obey you and i suggest you should put mr huish in my place he will make a worthy first officer to your captain sir he smiled bowed and turned to walk forward  where are you going herrick cried the captain detaining him by the shoulder  to berth forward with the men sir replied herrick with the same hateful smile ive been long enough aft here with yougentlemen  youre wrong there said davis dont you be too quick with me there aint nothing wrong but the drinkits the old story man let me get sober once and then youll see he pleaded  excuse me i desire to see no more of you said herrick  the captain groaned aloud you know what you said about my children he broke out  by rote in case you wish me to say it to you again asked herrick  dont cried the captain clapping his hands to his ears dont make me kill a man i care for herrick if you see me put a glass to my lips again till were ashore i give you leave to put a bullet through me i beg you to do it youre the only man aboard whose carcase is worth losing do you think i dont know that do you think i ever went back on you i always knew you were in the right of itdrunk or sober i knew that what do you wantan oath man youre clever enough to see that this is sureenough earnest  do you mean there shall be no more drinking asked herrick neither by you nor huish that you wont go on stealing my profits and drinking my champagne that i gave my honour for and that youll attend to your duties and stand watch and watch and bear your proper share of the ships work instead of leaving it all on the shoulders of a landsman and making yourself the butt and scoff of native seamen is that what you mean if it is be so good as to say it categorically  you put these things in a way hard for a gentleman to swallow said the captain you wouldnt have me say i was ashamed of myself trust me this once ill do the square thing and theres my hand on it  well ill try it once said herrick fail me again  no more now interrupted davis no more old man enough said youve a riling tongue when your backs up herrick just be glad were friends again the same as what i am and go tender on the raws ill see as you dont repent it weve been mighty near death this daydont say whose fault it waspretty near hell too i guess were in a mighty bad line of life us two and ought to go easy with each other  he was maundering yet it seemed as if he were maundering with some design beating about the bush of some communication that he feared to make or perhaps only talking against time in terror of what herrick might say next but herrick had now spat his venom his was a kindly nature and content with his triumph he had now begun to pity with a few soothing words he sought to conclude the interview and proposed that they should change their clothes  not right yet said davis theres another thing i want to tell you first you know what you said about my children i want to tell you why it hit me so hard i kind of think youll feel bad about it too its about my little adar you hadnt ought to have quite said thatbut of course i know you didnt know sheshes dead you see  why davis cried herrick youve told me a dozen times she was alive clear your head man this must be the drink  no sir said davis shes dead died of a bowel complaint that was when i was away in the brig oregon she lies in portland maine adar only daughter of captain john davis and mariar his wife aged five i had a doll for her on board i never took the paper offn that doll herrick it went down the way it was with the sea ranger that day i was damned  the captains eyes were fixed on the horizon he talked with an extraordinary softness but a complete composure and herrick looked upon him with something that was almost terror  dont think im crazy neither resumed davis ive all the cold sense that i know what to do with but i guess a man thats unhappys like a child and this is a kind of a childs game of mine i never could act up to the plaincut truth you see so i pretend and i warn you square as soon as were through with this talk ill start in again with the pretending only you see she cant walk no streets added the captain couldnt even make out to live and get that doll  herrick laid a tremulous hand upon the captains shoulder  dont do that cried davis recoiling from the touch cant you see im all broken up the way it is come along then come along old man you can put your trust in me right through come along and get dry clothes  they entered the cabin and there was huish on his knees prizing open a case of champagne  vast there cried the captain no more of that no more drinking on this ship  turned teetotal ave you inquired huish im agreeable about time eh bloomin nearly lost another ship i fancy he took out a bottle and began calmly to burst the wire with the spike of a corkscrew  do you hear me speak cried davis  i suppose i do you speak loud enough said huish the trouble is that i dont care  herrick plucked the captains sleeve let him free now he said weve had all we want this morning  let him have it then said the captain its his last  by this time the wire was open the string was cut the head of gilded paper was torn away and huish waited mug in hand expecting the usual explosion it did not follow he eased the cork with his thumb still there was no result at last he took the screw and drew it it came out very easy and with scarce a sound  illo said huish eres a bad bottle  he poured some of the wine into the mug it was colourless and still he smelt and tasted it  wy wots this he said its water  if the voice of trumpets had suddenly sounded about the ship in the midst of the sea the three men in the house could scarcely have been more stunned than by this incident the mug passed round each sipped each smelt of it each stared at the bottle in its glory of gold paper as crusoe may have stared at the footprint and their minds were swift to fix upon a common apprehension the difference between a bottle of champagne and a bottle of water is not great between a shipload of one or of the other lay the whole scale from riches to ruin  a second bottle was broached there were two cases standing ready in a stateroom these two were brought out broken open and tested still with the same result the contents were still colourless and tasteless and dead as the rain in a beached fishingboat  crikey said huish  here lets sample the hold said the captain mopping his brow with a backhanded sweep and the three stalked out of the house grim and heavyfooted  all hands were turned out two kanakas were sent below another stationed at a purchase and davis axe in hand took his place beside the coamings  are you going to let the men know whispered herrick  damn the men said davis its beyond that weve got to know ourselves  three cases were sent on deck and sampled in turn from each bottle as the captain smashed it with the axe the champagne ran bubbling and creaming  go deeper cant you cried davis to the kanakas in the hold  the command gave the signal for a disastrous change case after case came up bottle after bottle was burst and bled mere water deeper yet and they came upon a layer where there was scarcely so much as the intention to deceive where the cases were no longer branded the bottles no longer wired or papered where the fraud was manifest and stared them in the face  heres about enough of this foolery said davis stow back the cases in the hold uncle and get the broken crockery overboard come with me he added to his coadventurers and led the way back into the cabin     chapter vi  the partners   each took a side of the fixed table it was the first time they had sat down at it together but now all sense of incongruity all memory of differences was quite swept away by the presence of the common ruin  gentlemen said the captain after a pause and with very much the air of a chairman opening a board meeting were sold  huish broke out in laughter well if this aint the ighest old rig he cried and dyvis ere who thought he had got up so bloomin early in the mornin weve stolen a cargo of spring water o my crikey and he squirmed with mirth  the captain managed to screw out a phantom smile  heres old man destiny again said he to herrick but this time i guess hes kicked the door right in  herrick only shook his head  o lord its rich laughed huish it would really be a scrumptious lark if it ad appened to somebody else and what are we to do next o my eye with this bloomin schooner too  thats the trouble said davis theres only one thing certain its no use carting this old glass and ballast to peru no sir were in a hole  o my and the merchant cried huish the man that made this shipment hell get the news by the mail brigantine and hell think of course were making straight for sydney  yes hell be a sick merchant said the captain one thing this explains the kanaka crew if youre going to lose a ship i would ask no better myself than a kanaka crew but theres one thing it dont explain it dont explain why she came down tahitiways  wy to lose her you byby said huish  a lot you know said the captain nobody wants to lose a schooner they want to lose her on her course you skeericks you seem to think underwriters havent got enough sense to come in out of the rain  well said herrick i can tell you i am afraid why she came so far to the eastward i had it of uncle ned it seems these two unhappy devils wiseman and wishart were drunk on the champagne from the beginningand died drunk at the end  the captain looked on the table  they lay in their two bunks or sat here in this damned house he pursued with rising agitation filling their skins with the accursed stuff till sickness took them as they sickened and the fever rose they drank the more they lay here howling and groaning drunk and dying all in one they didnt know where they were they didnt care they didnt even take the sun it seems  not take the sun cried the captain looking up sacred billy what a crowd  well it dont matter to joe said huish wot are wiseman and tother buffer to us  a good deal too said the captain were their heirs i guess  it is a great inheritance said herrick  well i dont know about that returned davis appears to me as if it might be worse taint worth what the cargo would have been of course at least not money down but ill tell you what it appears to figure up to appears to me as if it amounted to about the bottom dollar of the man in frisco  old on said huish give a fellow time ows this umpire  well my sons pursued the captain who seemed to have recovered his assurance wiseman and wishart were to be paid for casting away this old schooner and its cargo were going to cast away the schooner right enough and ill make it my private business to see that we get paid what were w and w to get thats moren i can tell but w and w went into this business themselves they were on the crook now were on the square we only stumbled into it and that merchant has just got to squeal and im the man to see that he squeals good no sir theres some stuffing to this farallone racket after all  go it cap cried huish yoicks forrard old ard theres your style for the money blow me if i dont prefer this to the hother  i do not understand said herrick i have to ask you to excuse me i do not understand  well now see here herrick said davis im going to have a word with you anyway upon a different matter and its good that huish should hear it too were done with this boozing business and we ask your pardon for it right here and now we have to thank you for all you did for us while we were making hogs of ourselves youll find me turnto all right in future and as for the wine which i grant we stole from you ill take stock and see you paid for it thats good enough i believe but what i want to point out to you is this the old game was a risky game the new games as safe as running a vienna bakery we just put this farallone before the wind and run till were well to looard of our port of departure and reasonably well up with some other place where they have an american consul down goes the farallone and goodbye to her a day or so in the boat the consul packs us home at uncle sams expense to frisco and if that merchant dont put the dollars down you come to me  but i thought began herrick and then broke out o lets get on to peru  well if youre going to peru for your health i wont say no replied the captain but for what other blame shadow of a reason you should want to go there gets me clear we dont want to go there with this cargo i dont know as old bottles is a lively article anywheres leastways ill go my bottom cent it aint peru it was always a doubt if we could sell the schooner i never rightly hoped to and now im sure she aint worth a hill of beans whats wrong with her i dont know i only know its something or she wouldnt be here with this truck in her inside then again if we lose her and land in peru where are we we cant declare the loss or how did we get to peru in that case the merchant cant touch the insurance most likely hell go bust and dont you think you see the three of us on the beach of callao  theres no extradition there said herrick  well my son and we want to be extraded said the captain whats our point we want to have a consul extrade us as far as san francisco and that merchants office door my idea is that samoa would be found an eligible business centre its dead before the wind the states have a consul there and frisco steamers call sos we could skip right back and interview the merchant  samoa said herrick it will take us for ever to get there  o with a fair wind said the captain  no trouble about the log eh asked huish  no sir said davis light airs and baffling winds squalls and calms dr five miles no obs pumps attended and fill in the barometer and thermometer off of last years trip never saw such a voyage says you to the consul thought i was going to run short he stopped in mid career say he began again and once more stopped beg your pardon herrick he added with undisguised humility but did you keep the run of the stores  had i been told to do so it should have been done as the rest was done to the best of my little ability said herrick as it was the cook helped himself to what he pleased  davis looked at the table  i drew it rather fine you see he said at last the great thing was to clear right out of papeete before the consul could think better of it tell you what i guess ill take stock  and he rose from the table and disappeared with a lamp in the lazarette  eres another screw loose observed huish  my man said herrick with a sudden gleam of animosity it is still your watch on deck and surely your wheel also  you come the eavy swell dont you ducky said huish stand away from that binnacle surely your weel my man yah  he lit a cigar ostentatiously and strolled into the waist with his hands in his pockets  in a surprisingly short time the captain reappeared he did not look at herrick but called huish back and sat down  well he began ive taken stockroughly he paused as if for somebody to help him out and none doing so both gazing on him instead with manifest anxiety he yet more heavily resumed well it wont fight we cant do it thats the bedrock im as sorry as what you can be and sorrier but the games up we cant look near samoa i dont know as we could get to peru  wotju mean asked huish brutally  i cant most tell myself replied the captain i drew it fine i said i did but whats been going on here gets me appears as if the devil had been around that cook must be the holiest kind of fraud only twelve days too seems like craziness ill own up square to one thing i seem to have figured too fine upon the flour but the restmy land ill never understand it theres been more waste on this twopenny ship than what there is to an atlantic liner he stole a glance at his companions nothing good was to be gleaned from their dark faces and he had recourse to rage you wait till i interview that cook he roared and smote the table with his fist ill interview the son of a gun sos hes never been spoken to before ill put a bead upon the  you will not lay a finger on the man said herrick the fault is yours and you know it if you turn a savage loose in your storeroom you know what to expect i will not allow the man to be molested  it is hard to say how davis might have taken this defiance but he was diverted to a fresh assailant  well drawled huish youre a plummy captain aint you youre a blooming captain dont you set up any of your chat to me john dyvis i know you now you aint any more use than a blooming dawl o you dont know dont you o it gets you do it o i dessay wy werent you owling for fresh tins every blessed day ow often ave i eard you send the ole bloomin dinner off and tell the man to chuck it in the swilltub and breakfast o my crikey breakfast for ten and you ollerin for more and now you cant most tell blow me if it aint enough to make a man write an insultin letter to gawd you dror it mild john dyvis dont andle me im dyngerous  davis sat like one bemused it might even have been doubted if he heard but the voice of the clerk rang about the cabin like that of a cormorant among the ledges of the cliff  that will do huish said herrick  o so you tyke his part do you you stuckup sneerin snob tyke it then come on the pair of you but as for john dyvis let him look out he struck me the first night aboard and i never took a blow yet but wot i gave as good let him knuckle down on his marrowbones and beg my pardon thats my last word  i stand by the captain said herrick that makes us two to one both good men and the crew will all follow me i hope i shall die very soon but i have not the least objection to killing you before i go i should prefer it so i should do it with no more remorse than winking take caretake careyou little cad  the animosity with which these words were uttered was so marked in itself and so remarkable in the man who uttered them that huish stared and even the humiliated davis reared up his head and gazed at his defender as for herrick the successive agitations and disappointments of the day had left him wholly reckless he was conscious of a pleasant glow an agreeable excitement his head seemed empty his eyeballs burned as he turned them his throat was dry as a biscuit the least dangerous man by nature except in so far as the weak are always dangerous at that moment he was ready to slay or to be slain with equal unconcern  here at least was the gage thrown down and battle offered he who should speak next would bring the matter to an issue there and then all knew it to be so and hung back and for many seconds by the cabin clock the trio sat motionless and silent  then came an interruption welcome as the flowers in may  land ho sang out a voice on deck land a weatha bow  land cried davis springing to his feet whats this there aint no land here  and as men may run from the chamber of a murdered corpse the three ran forth out of the house and left their quarrel behind them undecided  the sky shaded down at the sealevel to the white of opals the sea itself insolently inkily blue drew all about them the uncompromising wheel of the horizon search it as they pleased not even the practised eye of captain davis could descry the smallest interruption a few filmy clouds were slowly melting overhead and about the schooner as around the only point of interest a tropic bird white as a snowflake hung and circled and displayed as it turned the long vermilion feather of its tail save the sea and the heaven that was all  who sang out land asked davis if theres any boy playing funnydog with me ill teach him skylarking  but uncle ned contentedly pointed to a part of the horizon where a greenish filmy iridescence could be discerned floating like smoke on the pale heavens  davis applied his glass to it and then looked at the kanaka call that land said he well its more than i do  one time long ago said uncle ned i see anaa allesame that four five hours befo we come up capena he say sun go down sun go up again he say lagoon allesame milla  allesame what asked davis  milla sah said uncle ned  o ah mirror said davis i see reflection from the lagoon well you know it is just possible though its strange i never heard of it here lets look at the chart  they went back to the cabin and found the position of the schooner well to windward of the archipelago in the midst of a white field of paper  there you see for yourselves said davis  and yet i dont know said herrick i somehow think theres something in it ill tell you one thing too captain thats all right about the reflection i heard it in papeete  fetch up that findlay then said davis ill try it all ways an island wouldnt come amiss the way were fixed  the bulky volume was handed up to him brokenbacked as is the way with findlay and he turned to the place and began to run over the text muttering to himself and turning over the pages with a wetted finger  hullo he exclaimed hows this and he read aloud new island according to m delille this island which from private interests would remain unknown lies it is said in lat 12° 49 10 s long 133° 6 w in addition to the position above given commander matthews hms scorpion states that an island exists in lat 12° 0 s long 133° 16 w this must be the same if such an island exists which is very doubtful and totally disbelieved in by south sea traders  golly said huish  its rather in the conditional mood said herrick  its anything you please cried davis only there it is thats our place and dont you make any mistake  which from private interests would remain unknown read herrick over his shoulder what may that mean  it should mean pearls said davis a pearling island the government dont know about that sounds like real estate or suppose it dont mean anything suppose its just an island i guess we could fill up with fish and cocoanuts and native stuff and carry out the samoa scheme hand over fist how long did he say it was before they raised anaa five hours i think  four or five said herrick  davis stepped to the door what breeze had you that time you made anaa uncle ned said he  six or seven knots was the reply  thirty or thirtyfive miles said davis high time we were shortening sail then if it is an island we dont want to be butting our head against it in the dark and if it isnt an island we can get through it just as well by daylight ready about he roared  and the schooners head was laid for that elusive glimmer in the sky which began already to pale in lustre and diminish in size as the stain of breath vanishes from a window pane at the same time she was reefed close down     part ii  the quartette     chapter vii  the pearlfisher   about four in the morning as the captain and herrick sat together on the rail there arose from the midst of the night in front of them the voice of breakers each sprang to his feet and stared and listened the sound was continuous like the passing of a train no rise or fall could be distinguished minute by minute the ocean heaved with an equal potency against the invisible isle and as time passed and herrick waited in vain for any vicissitude in the volume of that roaring a sense of the eternal weighed upon his mind to the expert eye the isle itself was to be inferred from a certain string of blots along the starry heaven and the schooner was laid to and anxiously observed till daylight  there was little or no morning bank a brightening came in the east then a wash of some ineffable faint nameless hue between crimson and silver and then coals of fire these glimmered a while on the sealine and seemed to brighten and darken and spread out and still the night and the stars reigned undisturbed it was as though a spark should catch and glow and creep along the foot of some heavy and almost incombustible wallhanging and the room itself be scarce menaced yet a little after and the whole east glowed with gold and scarlet and the hollow of heaven was filled with the daylight  the islethe undiscovered the scarcebelieved innow lay before them and close aboard and herrick thought that never in his dreams had he beheld anything more strange and delicate the beach was excellently white the continuous barrier of trees inimitably green the land perhaps ten feet high the trees thirty more every here and there as the schooner coasted northward the wood was intermitted and he could see clear over the inconsiderable strip of land as a man looks over a wall to the lagoon withinand clear over that again to where the far side of the atoll prolonged its pencilling of trees against the morning sky he tortured himself to find analogies the isle was like the rim of a great vessel sunken in the waters it was like the embankment of an annular railway grown upon with wood so slender it seemed amidst the outrageous breakers so frail and pretty he would scarce have wondered to see it sink and disappear without a sound and the waves close smoothly over its descent  meanwhile the captain was in the four crosstrees glass in hand his eyes in every quarter spying for an entrance spying for signs of tenancy but the isle continued to unfold itself in joints and to run out in indeterminate capes and still there was neither house nor man nor the smoke of fire here a multitude of seabirds soared and twinkled and fished in the blue waters and there and for miles together the fringe of cocopalm and pandanus extended desolate and made desirable green bowers for nobody to visit and the silence of death was only broken by the throbbing of the sea  the airs were very light their speed was small the heat intense the decks were scorching underfoot the sun flamed overhead brazen out of a brazen sky the pitch bubbled in the seams and the brains in the brainpan and all the while the excitement of the three adventurers glowed about their bones like a fever they whispered and nodded and pointed and put mouth to ear with a singular instinct of secrecy approaching that island underhand like eavesdroppers and thieves and even davis from the crosstrees gave his orders mostly by gestures the hands shared in this mute strain like dogs without comprehending it and through the roar of so many miles of breakers it was a silent ship that approached an empty island  at last they drew near to the break in that interminable gangway a spur of coral sand stood forth on the one hand on the other a high and thick tuft of trees cut off the view between was the mouth of the huge laver twice a day the ocean crowded in that narrow entrance and was heaped between these frail walls twice a day with the return of the ebb the mighty surplusage of water must struggle to escape the hour in which the farallone came there was the hour of the flood the sea turned as with the instinct of the homing pigeon for the vast receptacle swept eddying through the gates was transmuted as it did so into a wonder of watery and silken hues and brimmed into the inland sea beyond the schooner looked up closehauled and was caught and carried away by the influx like a toy she skimmed she flew a momentary shadow touched her decks from the shoreside trees the bottom of the channel showed up for a moment and was in a moment gone the next she floated on the bosom of the lagoon and below in the transparent chamber of waters a myriad of manycoloured fishes were sporting a myriad pale flowers of coral diversified the floor  herrick stood transported in the gratified lust of his eye he forgot the past and the present forgot that he was menaced by a prison on the one hand and starvation on the other forgot that he was come to that island desperately foraging clutching at expedients a drove of fishes painted like the rainbow and billed like parrots hovered up in the shadow of the schooner and passed clear of it and glinted in the submarine sun they were beautiful like birds and their silent passage impressed him like a strain of song  meanwhile to the eye of davis in the crosstrees the lagoon continued to expand its empty waters and the long succession of the shoreside trees to be paid out like fishingline off a reel and still there was no mark of habitation the schooner immediately on entering had been kept away to the norard where the water seemed to be the most deep and she was now skimming past the tall grove of trees which stood on that side of the channel and denied further view of the whole of the low shores of the island only this bight remained to be revealed and suddenly the curtain was raised they began to open out a haven snugly elbowed there and beheld with an astonishment beyond words the roofs of men  the appearance thus instantaneously disclosed to those on the deck of the farallone was not that of a city rather of a substantial country farm with its attendant hamlet a long line of sheds and storehouses apart upon the one side a deepverandahd dwellinghouse on the other perhaps a dozen native huts a building with a belfry and some rude offer at architectural features that might be thought to mark it out for a chapel on the beach in front some heavy boats drawn up and a pile of timber running forth into the burning shallows of the lagoon from a flagstaff at the pierhead the red ensign of england was displayed behind about and over the same tall grove of palms which had masked the settlement in the beginning prolonged its roof of tumultuous green fans and turned and ruffled overhead and sang its silver song all day in the wind the place had the indescribable but unmistakable appearance of being in commission yet there breathed from it a sense of desertion that was almost poignant no human figure was to be observed going to and fro about the houses and there was no sound of human industry or enjoyment only on the top of the beach and hard by the flagstaff a woman of exorbitant stature and as white as snow was to be seen beckoning with uplifted arm the second glance identified her as a piece of naval sculpture the flgurehead of a ship that had long hovered and plunged into so many running billows and was now brought ashore to be the ensign and presiding genius of that empty town  the farallone made a soldiers breeze of it the wind besides was stronger inside than without under the lee of the land and the stolen schooner opened out successive objects with the swiftness of a panorama so that the adventurers stood speechless the flag spoke for itself it was no frayed and weathered trophy that had beaten itself to pieces on the post flying over desolation and to make assurance stronger there was to be descried in the deep shade of the verandah a glitter of crystal and the fluttering of white napery if the figurehead at the pierend with its perpetual gesture and its leprous whiteness reigned alone in that hamlet as it seemed to do it would not have reigned long mens hands had been busy mens feet stirring there within the circuit of the clock the farallones were sure of it their eyes dug in the deep shadow of the palms for some one hiding if intensity of looking might have prevailed they would have pierced the walls of houses and there came to them in these pregnant seconds a sense of being watched and played with and of a blow impending that was hardly bearable  the extreme point of palms they had just passed enclosed a creek which was thus hidden up to the last moment from the eyes of those on board and from this a boat put suddenly and briskly out and a voice hailed  schooner ahoy it cried stand in for the pier in two cables lengths youll have twenty fathoms water and good holdingground  the boat was manned with a couple of brown oarsmen in scanty kilts of blue the speaker who was steering wore white clothes the full dress of the tropics a wide hat shaded his face but it could be seen that he was of stalwart size and his voice sounded like a gentlemans so much could be made out it was plain besides that the farallone had been descried some time before at sea and the inhabitants were prepared for its reception  mechanically the orders were obeyed and the ship berthed and the three adventurers gathered aft beside the house and waited with galloping pulses and a perfect vacancy of mind the coming of the stranger who might mean so much to them they had no plan no story prepared there was no time to make one they were caught redhanded and must stand their chance yet this anxiety was chequered with hope the island being undeclared it was not possible the man could hold any office or be in a position to demand their papers and beyond that if there was any truth in findlay as it now seemed there should be he was the representative of the private reasons he must see their coming with a profound disappointment and perhaps hope whispered he would be willing and able to purchase their silence  the boat was by that time forging alongside and they were able at last to see what manner of man they had to do with he was a huge fellow six feet four in height and of a build proportionately strong but his sinews seemed to be dissolved in a listlessness that was more than languor it was only the eye that corrected this impression an eye of an unusual mingled brilliancy and softness sombre as coal and with lights that outshone the topaz an eye of unimpaired health and virility an eye that bid you beware of the mans devastating anger a complexion naturally dark had been tanned in the island to a hue hardly distinguishable from that of a tahitian only his manners and movements and the living force that dwelt in him like fire in flint betrayed the european he was dressed in white drill exquisitely made his scarf and tie were of tendercoloured silks on the thwart beside him there leaned a winchester rifle  is the doctor on board he cried as he came up dr symonds i mean you never heard of him nor yet of the trinity hall ah  he did not look surprised seemed rather to affect it in politeness but his eye rested on each of the three white men in succession with a sudden weight of curiosity that was almost savage ah then said he there is some small mistake no doubt and i must ask you to what i am indebted for this pleasure  he was by this time on the deck but he had the art to be quite unapproachable the friendliest vulgarian three parts drunk would have known better than take liberties and not one of the adventurers so much as offered to shake hands  well said davis i suppose you may call it an accident we had heard of your island and read that thing in the directory about the private reasons you see so when we saw the lagoon reflected in the sky we put her head for it at once and so here we are  ope we dont intrude said huish  the stranger looked at huish with an air of faint surprise and looked pointedly away again it was hard to be more offensive in dumb show  it may suit me your coming here he said my own schooner is overdue and i may put something in your way in the meantime are you open to a charter  well i guess so said davis it depends  my name is attwater continued the stranger you i presume are the captain  yes sir i am the captain of this ship captain brown was the reply  well see ere said huish better begin fair es skipper on deck right enough but not below below were all equal all got a lay in the adventure when it comes to business im as good as e and what i say is lets go into the ouse and have a lush and talk it over among pals weve some prime fizz he said and winked  the presence of the gentleman lighted up like a candle the vulgarity of the clerk and herrick instinctively as one shields himself from pain made haste to interrupt  my name is hay said he since introductions are going we shall be very glad if you will step inside  attwater leaned to him swiftly university man said he  yes merton said herrick and the next moment blushed scarlet at his indiscretion  i am of the other lot said attwater trinity hall cambridge i called my schooner after the old shop well this is a queer place and company for us to meet in mr hay he pursued with easy incivility to the others but do you bear out  i beg this gentlemans pardon i really did not catch his name  my name is uish sir returned the clerk and blushed in turn  ah said attwater and then turning again to herrick do you bear out mr whishs description of your vintage or was it only the unaffected poetry of his own nature bubbling up  herrick was embarrassed the silken brutality of their visitor made him blush that he should be accepted as an equal and the others thus pointedly ignored pleased him in spite of himself and then ran through his veins in a recoil of anger  i dont know he said its only california its good enough i believe  attwater seemed to make up his mind well then ill tell you what you three gentlemen come ashore this evening and bring a basket of wine with you ill try and find the food he said and by the by here is a question i should have asked you when i came on board have you had smallpox  personally no said herrick but the schooner had it  deaths from attwater  two said herrick  well it is a dreadful sickness said attwater  ad you any deaths asked huish ere on the island  twentynine said attwater twentynine deaths and thirtyone cases out of thirtythree souls upon the islandthats a strange way to calculate mr hay is it not souls i never say it but it startles me  o so thats why everythings deserted said huish  that is why mr whish said attwater that is why the house is empty and the graveyard full  twentynine out of thirtythree exclaimed herrick why when it came to buryingor did you bother burying  scarcely said attwater or there was one day at least when we gave up there were five of the dead that morning and thirteen of the dying and no one able to go about except the sexton and myself we held a council of war took the  empty bottles  into the lagoon and  buried them he looked over his shoulder back at the bright water well so youll come to dinner then shall we say halfpast six so good of you  his voice in uttering these conventional phrases fell at once into the false measure of society and herrick unconsciously followed the example  i am sure we shall be very glad he said at halfpast six thank you so very much    for my voice has been tuned to the note of the gun     that startles the deep when the combats begun  quoted attwater with a smile which instantly gave way to an air of funereal solemnity i shall particularly expect mr whish he continuedmr whish i trust you understand the invitation  i believe you my boy replied the genial huish  that is right then and quite understood is it not said attwater mr whish and captain brown at sixthirty without faultand you hay at four sharp  and he called his boat  during all this talk a load of thought or anxiety had weighed upon the captain there was no part for which nature had so liberally endowed him as that of the genial shipcaptain but today he was silent and abstracted those who knew him could see that he hearkened close to every syllable and seemed to ponder and try it in balances it would have been hard to say what look there was cold attentive and sinister as of a man maturing plans which still brooded over the unconscious guest it was here it was there it was nowhere it was now so little that herrick chid himself for an idle fancy and anon it was so gross and palpable that you could say every hair on the mans head talked mischief  he woke up now as with a start you were talking of a charter said he  was i said attwater well lets talk of it no more at present  your own schooner is overdue i understand continued the captain  you understand perfectly captain brown said attwater thirtythree days overdue at noon today  she comes and goes eh plies between here and  hinted the captain  exactly every four months three trips in the year said attwater  you go in her ever asked davis  no one stops here said attwater one has plenty to attend to  stop here do you cried davis say how long  how long o lord said attwater with perfect stern gravity but it does not seem so he added with a smile  no i daresay not said davis no i suppose not not with all your gods about you and in as snug a berth as this for it is a pretty snug berth said he with a sweeping look  the spot as you are good enough to indicate is not entirely intolerable was the reply  shell i suppose said davis  yes there was shell said attwater  this is a considerable big beast of a lagoon sir said the captain was there awas the fishingwould you call the fishing anyways good  i dont know that i would call it anyways anything said attwater if you put it to me direct  there were pearls too said davis  pearls too said attwater  well i give out laughed davis and his laughter rang cracked like a false piece if youre not going to tell youre not going to tell and theres an end to it  there can be no reason why i should affect the least degree of secrecy about my island returned attwater that came wholly to an end with your arrival and i am sure at any rate that gentlemen like you and mr whish i should have always been charmed to make perfectly at home the point on which we are now differingif you can call it a differenceis one of times and seasons i have some information which you think i might impart and i think not well well see tonight byby whish he stepped into his boat and shoved off all understood then said he the captain and mr whish at sixthirty and you hay at four precise you understand that hay mind i take no denial if youre not there by the time named there will be no banquet no song no supper mr whish  white birds whisked in the air above a shoal of particoloured fishes in the scarce denser medium below between like mahomets coffin the boat drew away briskly on the surface and its shadow followed it over the glittering floor of the lagoon attwater looked steadily back over his shoulders as he sat he did not once remove his eyes from the farallone and the group on her quarterdeck beside the house till his boat ground upon the pier thence with an agile pace he hurried ashore and they saw his white clothes shining in the chequered dusk of the grove until the house received him  the captain with a gesture and a speaking countenance called the adventurers into the cabin  well he said to herrick when they were seated theres one good job at least hes taken to you in earnest  why should that be a good job said herrick  o youll see how it pans out presently returned davis you go ashore and stand in with him thats all youll get lots of pointers you can find out what he has and what the charter is and whos the fourth manfor theres four of them and were only three  and suppose i do what next cried herrick answer me that  so i will robert herrick said the captain but first lets see all clear i guess you know he said with imperious solemnity i guess you know the bottom is out of this farallone speculation i guess you know its right out and if this old island hadnt been turned up right when it did i guess you know where you and i and huish would have been  yes i know that said herrick no matter whos to blame i know it and what next  no matter whos to blame you know it right enough said the captain and im obliged to you for the reminder now heres this attwater what do you think of him  i do not know said herrick i am attracted and repelled he was insufferably rude to you  and you huish said the captain  huish sat cleaning a favourite briarroot he scarce looked up from that engrossing task dont ast me what i think of him he said theres a day comin i pray gawd when i can tell it him myself  huish means the same as what i do said davis when that man came stepping around and saying look here im attwaterand you knew it was so by godi sized him right straight up hes the real article i said and i dont like it heres the real firstrate copperbottomed aristocrat aw dont know ye do i god damn ye did god make ye no that couldnt be nothing but genuine a mans got to be born to that and notice smart as champagne and hard as nails no kind of a fool no sir not a pound of him well whats he here upon this beastly island for i said hes not here collecting eggs hes a palace at home and powdered flunkeys and if he dont stay there you bet he knows the reason why follow  o yes i ear you said huish  hes been doing good business here then continued the captain for ten years hes been doing a great business its pearl and shell of course there couldnt be nothing else in such a place and no doubt the shell goes off regularly by this trinity hall and the money for it straight into the bank so thats no use to us but what else is there is there nothing else he would be likely to keep here is there nothing else he would be bound to keep here yes sir the pearls first because theyre too valuable to trust out of his hands second because pearls want a lot of handling and matching and the man who sells his pearls as they come in one here one there instead of hanging back and holding upwell that mans a fool and its not attwater  likely said huish thats wat it is not proved but likely  its proved said davis bluntly  suppose it was said herrick suppose that was all so and he had these pearlsa ten years collection of themsuppose he had theres my question  the captain drummed with his thick hands on the board in front of him he looked steadily in herricks face and herrick as steadily looked upon the table and the pattering fingers there was a gentle oscillation of the anchored ship and a big patch of sunlight travelled to and fro between the one and the other  hear me herrick burst out suddenly  no you better hear me first said davis hear me and understand me weve got no use for that fellow whatever you may have hes your kind hes not ours hes took to you and hes wiped his boots on me and huish save him if you can  save him repeated herrick  save him if youre able reiterated davis with a blow of his clenched fist go ashore and talk him smooth and if you get him and his pearls aboard ill spare him if you dont theres going to be a funeral is that so huish does that suit you  i aint a forgiving man said huish but im not the sort to spoil business neither bring the bloke on board and bring his pearls along with him and you can have it your own way maroon him where you likeim agreeable  well and if i cant cried herrick while the sweat streamed upon his face you talk to me as if i was god almighty to do this and that but if i cant  my son said the captain you better do your level best or youll see sights  o yes said huish o crikey yes he looked across at herrick with a toothless smile that was shocking in its savagery and his ear caught apparently by the trivial expression he had used broke into a piece of the chorus of a comic song which he must have heard twenty years before in london meaningless gibberish that in that hour and place seemed hateful as a blasphemy hikey pikey crikey fikey chillingawallaba dory  the captain suffered him to finish his face was unchanged  the way things are theres many a man that wouldnt let you go ashore he resumed but im not that kind i know youd never go back on me herrick or if you choose togo and do it and be damned he cried and rose abruptly from the table  he walked out of the house and as he reached the door turned and called huish suddenly and violently like the barking of a dog huish followed and herrick remained alone in the cabin  now see here whispered davis i know that man if you open your mouth to him again youll ruin all     chapter viii  better acquaintance   the boat was gone again and already halfway to the farallone before herrick turned and went unwillingly up the pier from the crown of the beach the figurehead confronted him with what seemed irony her helmeted head tossed back her formidable arm apparently hurling something whether shell or missile in the direction of the anchored schooner she seemed a defiant deity from the island coming forth to its threshold with a rush as of one about to fly and perpetuated in that dashing attitude herrick looked up at her where she towered above him head and shoulders with singular feelings of curiosity and romance and suffered his mind to travel to and fro in her lifehistory so long she had been the blind conductress of a ship among the waves so long she had stood here idle in the violent sun that yet did not avail to blister her and was even this the end of so many adventures he wondered or was more behind and he could have found it in his heart to regret that she was not a goddess nor yet he a pagan that he might have bowed down before her in that hour of difficulty  when he now went forward it was cool with the shadow of many wellgrown palms draughts of the dying breeze swung them together overhead and on all sides with a swiftness beyond dragonflies or swallows the spots of sunshine flitted and hovered and returned underfoot the sand was fairly solid and quite level and herricks steps fell there noiseless as in newfallen snow it bore the marks of having been once weeded like a garden alley at home but the pestilence had done its work and the weeds were returning the buildings of the settlement showed here and there through the stems of the colonnade fresh painted trim and dandy and all silent as the grave only here and there in the crypt there was a rustle and scurry and some crowing of poultry and from behind the house with the verandahs he saw smoke arise and heard the crackling of a fire  the stone houses were nearest him upon his right the first was locked in the second he could dimly perceive through a window a certain accumulation of pearlshell piled in the far end the third which stood gaping open on the afternoon seized on the mind of herrick with its multiplicity and disorder of romantic things therein were cables windlasses and blocks of every size and capacity cabinwindows and ladders rusty tanks a companion hutch a binnacle with its brass mountings and its compass idly pointing in the confusion and dusk of that shed to a forgotten pole ropes anchors harpoons a blubberdipper of copper green with years a steeringwheel a toolchest with the vessels name upon the top the asia a whole curiosityshop of seacurios gross and solid heavy to lift ill to break bound with brass and shod with iron two wrecks at the least must have contributed to this random heap of lumber and as herrick looked upon it it seemed to him as if the two ships companies were there on guard and he heard the tread of feet and whisperings and saw with the tail of his eye the commonplace ghosts of sailor men  this was not merely the work of an aroused imagination but had something sensible to go upon sounds of a stealthy approach were no doubt audible and while he still stood staring at the lumber the voice of his host sounded suddenly and with even more than the customary softness of enunciation from behind  junk it said only old junk and does mr hay find a parable  i find at least a strong impression replied herrick turning quickly lest he might be able to catch on the face of the speaker some commentary on the words  attwater stood in the doorway which he almost wholly filled his hands stretched above his head and grasping the architrave he smiled when their eyes met but the expression was inscrutable  yes a powerful impression you are like me nothing so affecting as ships said he the ruins of an empire would leave me frigid when a bit of an old rail that an old shellback leaned on in the middle watch would bring me up all standing but come lets see some more of the island its all sand and coral and palmtrees but theres a kind of a quaintness in the place  i find it heavenly said herrick breathing deep with head bared in the shadow  ah thats because youre new from sea said attwater i daresay too you can appreciate what one calls it its a lovely name it has a flavour it has a colour it has a ring and fall to it its like its authorits half christian remember your first view of the island and how its only woods and woods and water and suppose you had asked somebody for the name and he had answerednemorosa zacynthos  jam medio apparet fluctu exclaimed herrick ye gods yes how good  if it gets upon the chart the skippers will make nice work of it said attwater but here come and see the divingshed  he opened a door and herrick saw a large display of apparatus neatly ordered pumps and pipes and the leaded boots and the huge snouted helmets shining in rows along the wall ten complete outfits  the whole eastern half of my lagoon is shallow you must understand said attwater so we were able to get in the dress to great advantage it paid beyond belief and was a queer sight when they were at it and these marine monsterstapping the nearest of the helmetskept appearing and reappearing in the midst of the lagoon fond of parables he asked abruptly  o yes said herrick  well i saw these machines come up dripping and go down again and come up dripping and go down again and all the while the fellow inside as dry as toast said attwater and i thought we all wanted a dress to go down into the world in and come up scatheless what do you think the name was he inquired  selfconceit said herrick  ah but i mean seriously said attwater  call it selfrespect then corrected herrick with a laugh  and why not grace why not gods grace hay asked attwater why not the grace of your maker and redeemer he who died for you he who upholds you he whom you daily crucify afresh there is nothing herestriking on his bosomnothing theresmiting the walland nothing therestampingnothing but gods grace we walk upon it we breathe it we live and die by it it makes the nails and axles of the universe and a puppy in pyjamas prefers selfconceit the huge dark man stood over against herrick by the line of the divers helmets and seemed to swell and glow and the next moment the life had gone from himi beg your pardon said he i see you dont believe in god  not in your sense i am afraid said herrick  i never argue with young atheists or habitual drunkards said attwater flippantlylet us go across the island to the outer beach  it was but a little way the greatest width of that island scarce exceeding a furlong and they walked gently herrick was like one in a dream he had come there with a mind divided come prepared to study that ambiguous and sneering mask drag out the essential man from underneath and act accordingly decision being till then postponed iron cruelty an iron insensibility to the suffering of others the uncompromising pursuit of his own interests cold culture manners without humanity these he had looked for these he still thought he saw but to find the whole machine thus glow with the reverberation of religious zeal surprised him beyond words and he laboured in vain as he walked to piece together into any kind of whole his odds and ends of knowledgeto adjust again into any kind of focus with itself his picture of the man beside him  what brought you here to the south seas he asked presently  many things said attwater youth curiosity romance the love of the sea and it will surprise you to hear an interest in missions that has a good deal declined which will surprise you less they go the wrong way to work they are too parsonish too much of the old wife and even the old applewife clothes clothes are their idea but clothes are not christianity any more than they are the sun in heaven or could take the place of it they think a parsonage with roses and church bells and nice old women bobbing in the lanes are part and parcel of religion but religion is a savage thing like the universe it illuminates savage cold and bare but infinitely strong  and you found this island by an accident said herrick  as you did said attwater and since then i have had a business and a colony and a mission of my own i was a man of the world before i was a christian im a man of the world still and i made my mission pay no good ever came of coddling a man has to stand up in gods sight and work up to his weight avoirdupois then ill talk to him but not before i gave these beggars what they wanted a judge in israel the bearer of the sword and scourge i was making a new people here and behold the angel of the lord smote them and they were not  with the very uttering of the words which were accompanied by a gesture they came forth out of the porch of the palm wood by the margin of the sea and full in front of the sun which was near setting before them the surf broke slowly all around with an air of imperfect wooden things inspired with wicked activity the crabs trundled and scuttled into holes on the right whither attwater pointed and abruptly turned was the cemetery of the island a field of broken stones from the bigness of a childs hand to that of his head diversified by many mounds of the same material and walled by a rude rectangular enclosure nothing grew there but a shrub or two with some white flowers nothing but the number of the mounds and their disquieting shape indicated the presence of the dead    the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep  quoted attwater as he entered by the open gateway into that unholy close coral to coral pebbles to pebbles he said this has been the main scene of my activity in the south pacific some were good and some bad and the majority of course and always null here was a fellow now that used to frisk like a dog if you had called him he came like an arrow from a bow if you had not and he came unbidden you should have seen the deprecating eye and the little intricate dancing step well his trouble is over now he has lain down with kings and councillors the rest of his acts are they not written in the book of the chronicles that fellow was from penrhyn like all the penrhyn islanders he was ill to manage heady jealous violent the man with the nose he lies here quiet enough and so they all lie    and darkness was the burier of the dead  he stood in the strong glow of the sunset with bowed head his voice sounded now sweet and now bitter with the varying sense  you loved these people cried herrick strangely touched  i said attwater dear no dont think me a philanthropist i dislike men and hate women if i like the islanders at all it is because you see them here plucked of their lendings their dead birds and cocked hats their petticoats and coloured hose here was one i liked though and he set his foot upon a mound he was a fine savage fellow he had a dark soul yes i liked this one i am fanciful he added looking hard at herrick and i take fads i like you  herrick turned swiftly and looked far away to where the clouds were beginning to troop together and amass themselves round the obsequies of day no one can like me he said  you are wrong there said the other as a man usually is about himself you are attractive very attractive  it is not me said herrick no one can like me if you knew how i despised myselfand why his voice rang out in the quiet graveyard  i knew that you despised yourself said attwater i saw the blood come into your face today when you remembered oxford and i could have blushed for you myself to see a man a gentleman with these two vulgar wolves  herrick faced him with a thrill wolves he repeated  i said wolves and vulgar wolves said attwater do you know that today when i came on board i trembled  you concealed it well stammered herrick  a habit of mine said attwater but i was afraid for all that i was afraid of the two wolves he raised his hand slowly and now hay you poor lost puppy what do you do with the two wolves  what do i do i dont do anything said herrick there is nothing wrong all is aboveboard captain brown is a good soul he is a  he is the phantom voice of davis called in his ear theres going to be a funeral and the sweat burst forth and streamed on his brow he is a family man he resumed again swallowing he has children at home and a wife  and a very nice man said attwater and so is mr whish no doubt  i wont go so far as that said herrick i do not like huish and yet  he has his merits too  and in short take them for all in all as good a ships company as one would ask said attwater  o yes said herrick quite  so then we approach the other point of why you despise yourself said attwater  do we not all despise ourselves cried herrick do not you  oh i say i do but do i said attwater one thing i know at least i never gave a cry like yours hay it came from a bad conscience ah man that poor divingdress of selfconceit is sadly tattered today if ye will hear my voice today now while the sun sets and here in this buryingplace of brown innocents fall on your knees and cast your sins and sorrows on the redeemer hay  not hay interrupted the other strangling dont call me that i mean for gods sake cant you see im on the rack  i see it i know it i put and keep you there my fingers are on the screws said attwater please god i will bring a penitent this night before his throne come come to the mercyseat he waits to be gracious manwaits to be gracious  he spread out his arms like a crucifix his face shone with the brightness of a seraphs in his voice as it rose to the last word the tears seemed ready  herrick made a vigorous call upon himself attwater he said you push me beyond bearing what am i to do i do not believe it is living truth to you to me upon my conscience only folklore i do not believe there is any form of words under heaven by which i can lift the burthen from my shoulders i must stagger on to the end with the pack of my responsibility i cannot shift it do you suppose i would not if i thought i could i cannotcannotcannotand let that suffice  the rapture was all gone from attwaters countenance the dark apostle had disappeared and in his place there stood an easy sneering gentleman who took off his hat and bowed it was pertly done and the blood burned in herricks face  what do you mean by that he cried  well shall we go back to the house said attwater our guests will soon be due  herrick stood his ground a moment with clenched fists and teeth and as he so stood the fact of his errand there slowly swung clear in front of him like the moon out of clouds he had come to lure that man on board he was failing even if it could be said that he had tried he was sure to fail now and knew it and knew it was better so and what was to be next  with a groan he turned to follow his host who was standing with polite smile and instantly and somewhat obsequiously led the way in the now darkened colonnade of palms there they went in silence the earth gave up richly of her perfume the air tasted warm and aromatic in the nostrils and from a great way forward in the wood the brightness of lights and fire marked out the house of attwater  herrick meanwhile resolved and resisted an immense temptation to go up to touch him on the arm and breathe a word in his ear beware they are going to murder you there would be one life saved but what of the two others the three lives went up and down before him like buckets in a well or like the scales of balances it had come to a choice and one that must be speedy for certain invaluable minutes the wheels of life ran before him and he could still divert them with a touch to the one side or the other still choose who was to live and who was to die he considered the men attwater intrigued puzzled dazzled enchanted and revolted him alive he seemed but a doubtful good and the thought of him lying dead was so unwelcome that it pursued him like a vision with every circumstance of colour and sound incessantly he had before him the image of that great mass of man stricken down in varying attitudes and with varying wounds fallen prone fallen supine fallen on his side or clinging to a doorpost with the changing face and the relaxing fingers of the deathagony he heard the click of the trigger the thud of the ball the cry of the victim he saw the blood flow and this building up of circumstance was like a consecration of the man till he seemed to walk in sacrificial fillets next he considered davis with his thickfingered coarsegrained oatbread commonness of nature his indomitable valour and mirth in the old days of their starvation the endearing blend of his faults and virtues the sudden shining forth of a tenderness that lay too deep for tears his children ada and her bowel complaint and adas doll no death could not be suffered to approach that head even in fancy with a general heat and a bracing of his muscles it was borne in on herrick that adas father would find in him a son to the death and even huish showed a little in that sacredness by the tacit adoption of daily life they were become brothers there was an implied bond of loyalty in their cohabitation of the ship and their past miseries to which herrick must be a little true or wholly dishonoured horror of sudden death for horror of sudden death there was here no hesitation possible it must be attwater and no sooner was the thought formed which was a sentence than his whole mind of man ran in a panic to the other side and when he looked within himself he was aware only of turbulence and inarticulate outcry  in all this there was no thought of robert herrick he had complied with the ebbtide in mans affairs and the tide had carried him away he heard already the roaring of the maelstrom that must hurry him under and in his bedevilled and dishonoured soul there was no thought of self  for how long he walked silent by his companion herrick had no guess the clouds rolled suddenly away the orgasm was over he found himself placid with the placidity of despair there returned to him the power of commonplace speech and he heard with surprise his own voice say what a lovely evening  is it not said attwater yes the evenings here would be very pleasant if one had anything to do by day of course one can shoot  you shoot asked herrick  yes i am what you would call a fine shot said attwater it is faith i believe my balls will go true if i were to miss once it would spoil me for nine months  you never miss then said herrick  not unless i mean to said attwater but to miss nicely is the art there was an old king one knew in the western islands who used to empty a winchester all round a man and stir his hair or nick a rag out of his clothes with every ball except the last and that went plump between the eyes it was pretty practice  you could do that asked herrick with a sudden chill  o i can do anything returned the other you do not understand what must be must  they were now come near to the back part of the house one of the men was engaged about the cookingfire which burned with the clear fierce essential radiance of cocoanut shells a fragrance of strange meats was in the air all round in the verandahs lamps were lighted so that the place shone abroad in the dusk of the trees with many complicated patterns of shadow  come and wash your hands said attwater and led the way into a clean matted room with a cot bed a safe a shelf or two of books in a glazed case and an iron washingstand presently he cried in the native and there appeared for a moment in the doorway a plump and pretty young woman with a clean towel  hullo cried herrick who now saw for the first time the fourth survivor of the pestilence and was startled by the recollection of the captains orders  yes said attwater the whole colony lives about the house whats left of it we are all afraid of devils if you please and taniera and she sleep in the front parlour and the other boy on the verandah  she is pretty said herrick  too pretty said attwater that was why i had her married a man never knows when he may be inclined to be a fool about women so when we were left alone i had the pair of them to the chapel and performed the ceremony she made a lot of fuss i do not take at all the romantic view of marriage he explained  and that strikes you as a safeguard asked herrick with amazement  certainly i am a plain man and very literal whom god hath joined together are the words i fancy so one married them and respects the marriage said attwater  ah said herrick  you see i may look to make an excellent marriage when i go home began attwater confidentially i am rich this safe alonelaying his hand upon itwill be a moderate fortune when i have the time to place the pearls upon the market here are ten years accumulation from a lagoon where i have had as many as ten divers going all day long and i went further than people usually do in these waters for i rotted a lot of shell and did splendidly would you like to see them  this confirmation of the captains guess hit herrick hard and he contained himself with difficulty no thank you i think not said he i do not care for pearls i am very indifferent to all these  gewgaws suggested attwater and yet i believe you ought to cast an eye on my collection which is really unique and whicho it is the case with all of us and everything about ushangs by a hair today it groweth up and flourisheth tomorrow it is cut down and cast into the oven today it is here and together in this safe tomorrowtonightit may be scattered thou fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee  i do not understand you said herrick  not said attwater  you seem to speak in riddles said herrick unsteadily i do not understand what manner of man you are nor what you are driving at  attwater stood with his hands upon his hips and his head bent forward i am a fatalist he replied and just now if you insist on it an experimentalist talking of which by the by who painted out the schooners name he said with mocking softness because do you know one thinks it should be done again it can still be partly read and whatever is worth doing is surely worth doing well you think with me that is so nice well shall we step on the verandah i have a dry sherry that i would like your opinion of  herrick followed him forth to where under the light of the hanging lamps the table shone with napery and crystal followed him as the criminal goes with the hangman or the sheep with the butcher took the sherry mechanically drank it and spoke mechanical words of praise the object of his terror had become suddenly inverted till then he had seen attwater trussed and gagged a helpless victim and had longed to run in and save him he saw him now tower up mysterious and menacing the angel of the lords wrath armed with knowledge and threatening judgment he set down his glass again and was surprised to see it empty  you go always armed he said and the next moment could have plucked his tongue out  always said attwater i have been through a mutiny here that was one of my incidents of missionary life  and just then the sound of voices reached them and looking forth from the verandah they saw huish and the captain drawing near     chapter ix  the dinner party   they sat down to an island dinner remarkable for its variety and excellence turtlesoup and steak fish fowls a suckingpig a cocoanut salad and sprouting cocoanut roasted for dessert not a tin had been opened and save for the oil and vinegar in the salad and some green spears of onion which attwater cultivated and plucked with his own hand not even the condiments were european sherry hock and claret succeeded each other and the farallone champagne brought up the rear with the dessert  it was plain that like so many of the extremely religious in the days before teetotalism attwater had a dash of the epicure for such characters it is softening to eat well doubly so to have designed and had prepared an excellent meal for others and the manners of their host were agreeably mollified in consequence a cat of huge growth sat on his shoulder purring and occasionally with a deft paw capturing a morsel in the air to a cat he might be likened himself as he lolled at the head of his table dealing out attentions and innuendoes and using the velvet and the claw indifferently and both huish and the captain fell progressively under the charm of his hospitable freedom  over the third guest the incidents of the dinner may be said to have passed for long unheeded herrick accepted all that was offered him ate and drank without tasting and heard without comprehension his mind was singly occupied in contemplating the horror of the circumstances in which he sat what attwater knew what the captain designed from which side treachery was to be first expected these were the ground of his thoughts there were times when he longed to throw down the table and flee into the night and even that was debarred him to do anything to say anything to move at all were only to precipitate the barbarous tragedy and he sat spellbound eating with white lips two of his companions observed him narrowly attwater with raking sidelong glances that did not interrupt his talk the captain with a heavy and anxious consideration  well i must say this sherry is a really prime article said huish ow much does it stand you in if its a fair question  a hundred and twelve shillings in london and the freight to valparaiso and on again said attwater it strikes one as really not a bad fluid  a undred and twelve murmured the clerk relishing the wine and the figures in a common ecstasy o my  so glad you like it said attwater help yourself mr whish and keep the bottle by you  my friends name is huish and not whish sir said the captain with a flush  i beg your pardon i am sure huish and not whish certainly said attwater i was about to say that i have still eight dozen he added fixing the captain with his eye  eight dozen what said davis  sherry was the reply eight dozen excellent sherry why it seems almost worth it in itselfto a man fond of wine  the ambiguous words struck home to guilty consciences and huish and the captain sat up in their places and regarded him with a scare  worth what said davis  a hundred and twelve shillings replied attwater  the captain breathed hard for a moment he reached out far and wide to find any coherency in these remarks then with a great effort changed the subject  i allow we are about the first white men upon this island sir said he  attwater followed him at once and with entire gravity to the new ground myself and dr symonds excepted i should say the only ones he returned and yet who can tell in the course of the ages some one may have lived here and we sometimes think that some one must the cocopalms grow all round the island which is scarce like natures planting we found besides when we landed an unmistakable cairn upon the beach use unknown but probably erected in the hope of gratifying some mumbojumbo whose very name is forgotten by some thickwitted gentry whose very bones are lost then the island witness the directory has been twice reported and since my tenancy we have had two wrecks both derelict the rest is conjecture  dr symonds is your partner i guess said davis  a dear fellow symonds how he would regret it if he knew you had been here said attwater  es on the trinity all aint he asked huish  and if you could tell me where the trinity all was you would confer a favour mr whish was the reply  i suppose she has a native crew said davis  since the secret has been kept ten years one would suppose she had replied attwater  well now see ere said huish you have everythink about you in no end style and no mistake but i tell you it wouldnt do for me too much of the old rustic bridge by the mill too retired by alf give me the sound of bow bells  you must not think it was always so replied attwater this was once a busy shore although now hark you can hear the solitude i find it stimulating and talking of the sound of bells kindly follow a little experiment of mine in silence there was a silver bell at his right hand to call the servants he made them a sign to stand still struck the bell with force and leaned eagerly forward the note rose clear and strong it rang out clear and far into the night and over the deserted island it died into the distance until there only lingered in the porches of the ear a vibration that was sound no longer empty houses empty sea solitary beaches said attwater and yet god hears the bell and yet we sit in this verandah on a lighted stage with all heaven for spectators and you call that solitude  there followed a bar of silence during which the captain sat mesmerised  then attwater laughed softly these are the diversions of a lonely man he resumed and possibly not in good taste one tells oneself these little fairy tales for company if there should happen to be anything in folklore mr hay but here comes the claret one does not offer you lafitte captain because i believe it is all sold to the railroad diningcars in your great country but this brânemouton is of a good year and mr whish will give me news of it  thats a queer idea of yours cried the captain bursting with a sigh from the spell that had bound him so you mean to tell me now that you sit here evenings and ring up  well ring on the angels  by yourself  as a matter of historic fact and since you put it directly one does not said attwater why ring a bell when there flows out from oneself and everything about one a far more momentous silence the least beat of my heart and the least thought in my mind echoing into eternity for ever and for ever and for ever  o look ere said huish turn down the lights at once and the band of ope will oblige this aint a spiritual séance  no folklore about mr whishi beg your pardon captain huish not whish of course said attwater  as the boy was filling huishs glass the bottle escaped from his hand and was shattered and the wine spilt on the verandah floor instant grimness as of death appeared in the face of attwater he smote the bell imperiously and the two brown natives fell into the attitude of attention and stood mute and trembling there was just a moment of silence and hard looks then followed a few savage words in the native and upon a gesture of dismissal the service proceeded as before  none of the party had as yet observed upon the excellent bearing of the two men they were dark undersized and well set up stepped softly waited deftly brought on the wines and dishes at a look and their eyes attended studiously on their master  where do you get your labour from anyway asked davis  ah where not answered attwater  not much of a soft job i suppose said the captain  if you will tell me where getting labour is said attwater with a shrug and of course in our case as we could name no destination we had to go far and wide and do the best we could we have gone as far west as the kingsmills and as far south as rapaiti pity symonds isnt here he is full of yarns that was his part to collect them then began mine which was the educational  you mean to run them said davis  ay to run them said attwater  wait a bit said davis im out of my depth how was this do you mean to say you did it singlehanded  one did it singlehanded said attwater because there was nobody to help one  by god but you must be a holy terror cried the captain in a glow of admiration  one does ones best said attwater  well now said davis i have seen a lot of driving in my time and been counted a good driver myself i fought my way third mate round the cape horn with a push of packetrats that would have turned the devil out of hell and shut the door on him and i tell you this racket of mr attwaters takes the cake in a ship why there aint nothing to it youve got the law with you thats what does it but put me down on this blame beach alone with nothing but a whip and a mouthful of bad words and ask me to  no sir its not good enough i havent got the sand for that cried davis its the law behind he added its the law does it every time  the beak aint as black as hes sometimes pynted observed huish humorously  well one got the law after a fashion said attwater one had to be a number of things it was sometimes rather a bore  i should smile said davis rather lively i should think  i daresay we mean the same thing said attwater however one way or another one got it knocked into their heads that they must work and they did  until the lord took them  ope you made em jump said huish  when it was necessary mr whish i made them jump said attwater  you bet you did cried the captain he was a good deal flushed but not so much with wine as admiration and his eyes drank in the huge proportions of the other with delight you bet you did and you bet that i can see you doing it by god youre a man and you can say i said so  too good of you im sure said attwater  did youdid you ever have crime here asked herrick breaking his silence with a pungent voice  yes said attwater we did  and how did you handle that sir cried the eager captain  well you see it was a queer case replied attwater it was a case that would have puzzled solomon shall i tell it you yes  the captain rapturously accepted  well drawled attwater here is what it was i daresay you know two types of natives which may be called the obsequious and the sullen well one had them the types themselves detected in the fact and one had them together obsequiousness ran out of the first like wine out of a bottle sullenness congested in the second obsequiousness was all smiles he ran to catch your eye he loved to gabble and he had about a dozen words of beach english and an eighthofaninch veneer of christianity sullens was industrious a big downlooking bee when he was spoken to he answered with a black look and a shrug of one shoulder but the thing would be done i dont give him to you for a model of manners there was nothing showy about sullens but he was strong and steady and ungraciously obedient now sullens got into trouble no matter how the regulations of the place were broken and he was punished accordinglywithout effect so the next day and the next and the day after till i began to be weary of the business and sullens i am afraid particularly so there came a day when he was in fault again for theo perhaps the thirtieth time and he rolled a dull eye upon me with a spark in it and appeared to speak now the regulations of the place are formal upon one point we allow no explanations none are received none allowed to be offered so one stopped him instantly but made a note of the circumstance the next day he was gone from the settlement there could be nothing more annoying if the labour took to running away the fishery was wrecked there are sixty miles of this island you see all in length like the queens highway the idea of pursuit in such a place was a piece of singleminded childishness which one did not entertain two days later i made a discovery it came in upon me with a flash that sullens had been unjustly punished from beginning to end and the real culprit throughout had been obsequiousness the native who talks like the woman who hesitates is lost you set him talking and lying and he talks and lies and watches your face to see if he has pleased you till at last out comes the truth it came out of obsequiousness in the regular course i said nothing to him i dismissed him and late as it was for it was already night set off to look for sullens i had not far to go about two hundred yards up the island the moon showed him to me he was hanging in a cocopalmim not botanist enough to tell you howbut its the way in nine cases out of ten these natives commit suicide his tongue was out poor devil and the birds had got at him i spare you details he was an ugly sight i gave the business six good hours of thinking in this verandah my justice had been made a fool of i dont suppose that i was ever angrier next day i had the conch sounded and all hands out before sunrise one took ones gun and led the way with obsequiousness he was very talkative the beggar supposed that all was right now he had confessed in the old schoolboy phrase he was plainly sucking up to me full of protestations of goodwill and good behaviour to which one answered one really cant remember what presently the tree came in sight and the hanged man they all burst out lamenting for their comrade in the island way and obsequiousness was the loudest of the mourners he was quite genuine a noxious creature without any consciousness of guilt well presentlyto make a long story shortone told him to go up the tree he stared a bit looked at one with a trouble in his eye and had rather a sickly smile but went he was obedient to the last he had all the pretty virtues but the truth was not in him so soon as he was up he looked down and there was the rifle covering him and at that he gave a whimper like a dog you could hear a pin drop no more keening now there they all crouched upon the ground with bulging eyes there was he in the treetop the colour of lead and between was the dead man dancing a bit in the air he was obedient to the last recited his crime recommended his soul to god and then  attwater paused and herrick who had been listening attentively made a convulsive movement which upset his glass  and then said the breathless captain  shot said attwater they came to the ground together  herrick sprang to his feet with a shriek and an insensate gesture  it was a murder he screamed a coldhearted bloodyminded murder you monstrous being murderer and hypocritemurderer and hypocritemurderer and hypocrite he repeated and his tongue stumbled among the words  the captain was by him in a moment herrick he cried behave yourself here dont be a blame fool  herrick struggled in his embrace like a frantic child and suddenly bowing his face in his hands choked into a sob the first of many which now convulsed his body silently and now jerked from him indescribable and meaningless sounds  your friend appears overexcited remarked attwater sitting unmoved but all alert at table  it must be the wine replied the captain he aint no drinking man you see ii think ill take him away a walkll sober him up i guess  he led him without resistance out of the verandah and into the night in which they soon melted but still for some time as they drew away his comfortable voice was to be heard soothing and remonstrating and herrick answering at intervals with the mechanical noises of hysteria  es like a bloomin poultry yard observed huish helping himself to wine of which he spilled a good deal with gentlemanly ease a man should learn to beyave at table he added  rather bad form is it not said attwater well well we are left têteàtête a glass of wine with you mr whish     chapter x  the open door   the captain and herrick meanwhile turned their back upon the lights in attwaters verandah and took a direction towards the pier and the beach of the lagoon  the isle at this hour with its smooth floor of sand the pillared roof overhead and the prevalent illumination of the lamps wore an air of unreality like a deserted theatre or a public garden at midnight a man looked about him for the statues and tables not the least air of wind was stirring among the palms and the silence was emphasised by the continuous clamour of the surf from the seashore as it might be of traffic in the next street  still talking still soothing him the captain hurried his patient on brought him at last to the lagoon side and leading him down the beach laved his head and face with the tepid water the paroxysm gradually subsided the sobs became less convulsive and then ceased by an odd but not quite unnatural conjunction the captains soothing current of talk died away at the same time and by proportional steps and the pair remained sunk in silence the lagoon broke at their feet in petty wavelets and with a sound as delicate as a whisper stars of all degrees looked down on their own images in that vast mirror and the more angry colour of the farallones riding lamp burned in the middle distance for long they continued to gaze on the scene before them and hearken anxiously to the rustle and tinkle of that miniature surf or the more distant and loud reverberations from the outer coast for long speech was denied them and when the words came at last they came to both simultaneously  say herrick  the captain was beginning  but herrick turning swiftly towards his companion bent him down with the eager cry lets up anchor captain and to sea  where to my son said the captain up anchors easy saying but where to  to sea responded herrick the seas big enough to seaaway from this dreadful island and that o that sinister man  o well see about that said davis you brace up and well see about that youre all run down thats whats wrong with you youre all nerves like jemimar youve got to brace up good and be yourself again and then well talk  to sea reiterated herrick to sea tonightnowthis moment  it cant be my son replied the captain firmly no ship of mine puts to sea without provisions you can take that for settled  you dont seem to understand said herrick the whole thing is over i tell you there is nothing to do here when he knows all that man there with the cat knows all cant you take it in  all what asked the captain visibly discomposed why he received us like a perfect gentleman and treated us real handsome until you began with your fooleryand i must say i seen men shot for less and nobody sorry what more do you expect anyway  herrick rocked to and fro upon the sand shaking his head  guying us he said he was guying usonly guying us its all were good for  there was one queer thing to be sure admitted the captain with a misgiving of the voice that about the sherry damned if i caught on to that say herrick you didnt give me away  o give you away repeated herrick with weary querulous scorn what was there to give away were transparent weve got rascal branded on us detected rascaldetected rascal why before he came on board there was the name painted out and he saw the whole thing he made sure we would kill him there and then and stood guying you and huish on the chance he calls that being frightened next he had me ashore a fine time i had the two wolves he calls you and huish what is the puppy doing with the two wolves he asked he showed me his pearls he said they might be dispersed before morning and all hung by a hairand smiled as he said it such a smile o its no use i tell you he knows all he sees through all we only make him laugh with our pretenceshe looks at us and laughs like god  there was a silence davis stood with contorted brows gazing into the night  the pearls he said suddenly he showed them to you he has them  no he didnt show them i forgot only the safe they were in said herrick but youll never get them  ive two words to say to that said the captain  do you think he would have been so easy at table unless he was prepared cried herrick the servants were both armed he was armed himself he always is he told me you will never deceive his vigilance davis i know it its all up i tell you and keep telling you and proving it all up all up theres nothing for it theres nothing to be done all gone life honour love o my god my god why was i born  another pause followed upon this outburst  the captain put his hands to his brow  another thing he broke out why did he tell you all this seems like madness to me  herrick shook his head with gloomy iteration you wouldnt understand if i were to tell you said he  i guess i can understand any blame thing that you can tell me said the captain  well then hes a fatalist said herrick  whats that a fatalist said davis  o its a fellow that believes a lot of things said herrick believes that his bullets go true believes that all falls out as god chooses do as you like to prevent it and all that  why i guess i believe right so myself said davis  you do said herrick  you bet i do says davis  herrick shrugged his shoulders well you must be a fool said he and he leaned his head upon his knees  the captain stood biting his hands  theres one thing sure he said at last i must get huish out of that hes not fit to hold his end up with a man like you describe  and he turned to go away the words had been quite simple not so the tone and the other was quick to catch it  davis he cried no dont do it spare me and dont do itspare yourself and leave it alonefor gods sake for your childrens sake  his voice rose to a passionate shrillness another moment and he might be overheard by their not distant victim but davis turned on him with a savage oath and gesture and the miserable young man rolled over on his face on the sand and lay speechless and helpless  the captain meanwhile set out rapidly for attwaters house as he went he considered with himself eagerly his thoughts racing the man had understood he had mocked them from the beginning he would teach him to make a mockery of john davis herrick thought him a god give him a second to aim in and the god was overthrown he chuckled as he felt the butt of his revolver it should be done now as he went in from behind it was difficult to get there from across the table no the captain preferred to shoot standing so as you could be sure to get your hand upon your gun the best would be to summon huish and when attwater stood up and turnedah then would be the moment wrapped in this ardent prefiguration of events the captain posted towards the house with his head down  hands up halt cried the voice of attwater  and the captain before he knew what he was doing had obeyed the surprise was complete and irremediable coming on the top crest of his murderous intentions he had walked straight into an ambuscade and now stood with his hands impotently lifted staring at the verandah  the party was now broken up attwater leaned on a post and kept davis covered with a winchester one of the servants was hard by with a second at the port arms leaning a little forward roundeyed with eager expectancy in the open space at the head of the stair huish was partly supported by the other native his face wreathed in meaningless smiles his mind seemingly sunk in the contemplation of an unlighted cigar  well said attwater you seem to me to be a very twopenny pirate  the captain uttered a sound in his throat for which we have no name rage choked him  i am going to give you mr whishor the winesop that remains of him continued attwater he talks a great deal when he drinks captain davis of the sea ranger but i have quite done with himand return the article with thanks now he cried sharply another false movement like that and your family will have to deplore the loss of an invaluable parent keep strictly still davis  attwater said a word in the native his eye still undeviatingly fixed on the captain and the servant thrust huish smartly forward from the brink of the stair with an extraordinary simultaneous dispersion of his members that gentleman bounded forth into space struck the earth ricocheted and brought up with his arms about a palm his mind was quite a stranger to these events the expression of anguish that deformed his countenance at the moment of the leap was probably mechanical and he suffered these convulsions in silence clung to the tree like an infant and seemed by his dips to suppose himself engaged in the pastime of bobbing for apples a more finely sympathetic mind or a more observant eye might have remarked a little in front of him on the sand and still quite beyond reach the unlighted cigar  there is your whitechapel carrion said attwater and now you might very well ask me why i do not put a period to you at once as you deserve i will tell you why davis it is because i have nothing to do with the sea ranger and the people you drowned or the farallone and the champagne that you stole that is your account with god he keeps it and he will settle it when the clock strikes in my own case i have nothing to go on but suspicion and i do not kill on suspicion not even vermin like you but understand if ever i see any of you again it is another matter and you shall eat a bullet and now take yourself off march and as you value what you call your life keep your hands up as you go  the captain remained as he was his hands up his mouth open mesmerised with fury  march said attwater onetwothree  and davis turned and passed slowly away but even as he went he was meditating a prompt offensive return in the twinkling of an eye he had leaped behind a tree and was crouching there pistol in hand peering from either side of his place of ambush with bared teeth a serpent already poised to strike and already he was too late attwater and his servants had disappeared and only the lamps shone on the deserted table and the bright sand about the house and threw into the night in all directions the strong and tall shadows of the palms  davis ground his teeth where were they gone the cowards to what hole had they retreated beyond reach it was in vain he should try anything he single and with a secondhand revolver against three persons armed with winchesters and who did not show an ear out of any of the apertures of that lighted and silent house some of them might have already ducked below it from the rear and be drawing a bead upon him at that moment from the lowbrowed crypt the receptacle of empty bottles and broken crockery no there was nothing to be done but to bring away if it were still possible his shattered and demoralised forces  huish he said come along  s lose my ciga said huish reaching vaguely forward  the captain let out a rasping oath come right along here said he  s all righ sleep here th attyattwa go boar tmorr replied the festive one  if you dont come and come now by the living god ill shoot you cried the captain  it is not to be supposed that the sense of these words in any way penetrated to the mind of huish rather that in a fresh attempt upon the cigar he overbalanced himself and came flying erratically forward a course which brought him within reach of davis  now you walk straight said the captain clutching him or ill know why not  s lose my ciga replied huish  the captains contained fury blazed up for a moment he twisted huish round grasped him by the neck of the coat ran him in front of him to the pierend and flung him savagely forward on his face  look for your cigar then you swine said he and blew his boatcall till the pea in it ceased to rattle  an immediate activity responded on board the farallone faraway voices and soon the sound of oars floated along the surface of the lagoon and at the same time from nearer hand herrick aroused himself and strolled languidly up he bent over the insignificant figure of huish where it grovelled apparently insensible at the base of the figurehead  dead he asked  no hes not dead said davis  and attwater asked herrick  now you just shut your head replied davis you can do that i fancy and by god ill show you how ill stand no more of your drivel  they waited accordingly in silence till the boat bumped on the farthest piers then raised huish head and heels carried him down the gangway and flung him summarily in the bottom on the way out he was heard murmuring of the loss of his cigar and after he had been handed up the side like baggage and cast down in the alleyway to slumber his last audible expression was splenl fl attwa this the expert construed into splendid fellow attwater with so much innocence had this great spirit issued from the adventures of the evening  the captain went and walked in the waist with brief irate turns herrick leaned his arms on the taffrail the crew had all turned in the ship had a gentle cradling motion at times a block piped like a bird on shore through the colonnade of palm stems attwaters house was to be seen shining steadily with many lamps and there was nothing else visible whether in the heaven above or in the lagoon below but the stars and their reflections it might have been minutes or it might have been hours that herrick leaned there looking in the glorified water and drinking peace a bath of stars he was thinking when a hand was laid at last on his shoulder  herrick said the captain ive been walking off my trouble  a sharp jar passed through the young man but he neither answered nor so much as turned his head  i guess i spoke a little rough to you on shore pursued the captain the fact is i was real mad but now its over and you and me have to turn to and think  i will not think said herrick  here old man said davis kindly this wont fight you know youve got to brace up and help me get things straight youre not going back on a friend thats not like you herrick  o yes it is said herrick  come come said the captain and paused as if quite at a loss look here he cried you have a glass of champagne i wont touch it so thatll show you if im in earnest but its just the pickmeup for you itll put an edge on you at once  o you leave me alone said herrick and turned away  the captain caught him by the sleeve and he shook him off and turned on him for the moment like a demoniac  go to hell in your own way he cried  and he turned away again this time unchecked and stepped forward to where the boat rocked alongside and ground occasionally against the schooner he looked about him a corner of the house was interposed between the captain and himself all was well no eye must see him in that last act he slid silently into the boat thence silently into the starry water instinctively he swam a little it would be time enough to stop by and by  the shock of the immersion brightened his mind immediately the events of the ignoble day passed before him in a frieze of pictures and he thanked whatever gods there be for that open door of suicide in such a little while he would be done with it the random business at an end the prodigal son come home a very bright planet shone before him and drew a trenchant wake along the water he took that for his line and followed it  that was the last earthly thing that he should look upon that radiant speck which he had soon magnified into a city of laputa along whose terraces there walked men and women of awful and benignant features who viewed him with distant commiseration these imaginary spectators consoled him he told himself their talk one to another it was of himself and his sad destiny  from such flights of fancy he was aroused by the growing coldness of the water why should he delay here where he was now let him drop the curtain let him seek the ineffable refuge let him lie down with all races and generations of men in the house of sleep it was easy to say easy to do to stop swimming there was no mystery in that if he could do it could he and he could not he knew it instantly he was aware instantly of an opposition in his members unanimous and invincible clinging to life with a single and fixed resolve finger by finger sinew by sinew something that was at once he and not heat once within and without him the shutting of some miniature valve in his brain which a single manly thought should suffice to openand the grasp of an external fate ineluctable as gravity to any man there may come at times a consciousness that there blows through all the articulations of his body the wind of a spirit not wholly his that his mind rebels that another girds him and carries him whither he would not it came now to herrick with the authority of a revelation there was no escape possible the open door was closed in his recreant face he must go back into the world and amongst men without illusion he must stagger on to the end with the pack of his responsibility and his disgrace until a cold a blow a merciful chance ball or the more merciful hangman should dismiss him from his infamy there were men who could commit suicide there were men who could not and he was one who could not  for perhaps a minute there raged in his mind the coil of this discovery then cheerless certitude followed and with an incredible simplicity of submission to ascertained fact he turned round and struck out for shore there was a courage in this which he could not appreciate the ignobility of his cowardice wholly occupying him a strong current set against him like a wind in his face he contended with it heavily wearily without enthusiasm but with substantial advantage marking his progress the while without pleasure by the outline of the trees once he had a moment of hope he heard to the southward of him towards the centre of the lagoon the wallowing of some great fish doubtless a shark and paused for a little treading water might not this be the hangman he thought but the wallowing died away mere silence succeeded and herrick pushed on again for the shore raging as he went at his own nature ay he would wait for the shark but if he had heard him coming his smile was tragic he could have spat upon himself  about three in the morning chance and the set of the current and the bias of his own righthanded body so decided it between them that he came to shore upon the beach in front of attwaters there he sat down and looked forth into a world without any of the lights of hope the poor divingdress of selfconceit was sadly tattered with the fairy tale of suicide of a refuge always open to him he had hitherto beguiled and supported himself in the trials of life and behold that also was only a fairy tale that also was folklore with the consequences of his acts he saw himself implacably confronted for the duration of life stretched upon a cross and nailed there with the iron bolts of his own cowardice he had no tears he told himself no stories his disgust with himself was so complete that even the process of apologetic mythology had ceased he was like a man cast down from a pillar and every bone broken he lay there and admitted the facts and did not attempt to rise  dawn began to break over the far side of the atoll the sky brightened the clouds became dyed with gorgeous colours the shadows of the night lifted and suddenly herrick was aware that the lagoon and the trees wore again their daylight livery and he saw on board the farallone davis extinguishing the lantern and smoke rising from the galley  davis without doubt remarked and recognised the figure on the beach or perhaps hesitated to recognise it for after he had gazed a long while from under his hand he went into the house and fetched a glass it was very powerful herrick had often used it with an instinct of shame he hid his face in his hands  and what brings you here mr herrickhay or mr hayherrick asked the voice of attwater your back view from my present position is remarkably fine and i would continue to present it we can get on very nicely as we are and if you were to turn round do you know i think it would be awkward  herrick slowly rose to his feet his heart throbbed hard a hideous excitement shook him but he was master of himself slowly he turned and faced attwater and the muzzle of a pointed rifle why could i not do that last night he thought  well why dont you fire he said aloud in a voice that trembled  attwater slowly put his gun under his arm then his hands in his pockets  what brings you here he repeated  i dont know said herrick and then with a cry can you do anything with me  are you armed said attwater i ask for the forms sake  armed no said herrick o yes i am too  and he flung upon the beach a dripping pistol  you are wet said attwater  yes i am wet said herrick can you do anything with me  attwater read his face attentively  it would depend a good deal upon what you are said he  what i am a coward said herrick  there is very little to be done with that said attwater and yet the description hardly strikes one as exhaustive  o what does it matter cried herrick here i am i am broken crockery i am a burst drum the whole of my life is gone to water i have nothing left that i believe in except my living horror of myself why do i come to you i dont know you are cold cruel hateful and i hate you or i think i hate you but you are an honest man an honest gentleman i put myself helpless in your hands what must i do if i cant do anything be merciful and put a bullet through me its only a puppy with a broken leg  if i were you i would pick up that pistol come up to the house and put on some dry clothes said attwater  if you really mean it said herrick you know theywethey but you know all  i know quite enough said attwater come up to the house  and the captain from the deck of the farallone saw the two men pass together under the shadow of the grove     chapter xi  david and goliath   huish had bundled himself up from the glare of the dayhis face to the house his knees retracted the frail bones in the thin tropical raiment seemed scarce more considerable than a fowls and davis sitting on the rail with his arm about a stay contemplated him with gloom wondering what manner of counsel that insignificant figure should contain for since herrick had thrown him off and deserted to the enemy huish alone of mankind remained to him to be a helper and oracle  he considered their position with a sinking heart the ship was a stolen ship the stores whether from initial carelessness or ill administration during the voyage were insufficient to carry them to any port except back to papeete and there retribution waited in the shape of a gendarme a judge with a queershaped hat and the horror of distant noumea upon that side there was no glimmer of hope here at the island the dragon was roused attwater with his men and his winchesters watched and patrolled the house let him who dare approach it what else was then left but to sit there inactive pacing the decks until the trinity hall arrived and they were cast into irons or until the food came to an end and the pangs of famine succeeded for the trinity hall davis was prepared he would barricade the house and die there defending it like a rat in a crevice but for the other the cruise of the farallone into which he had plunged only a fortnight before with such golden expectations could this be the nightmare end of it the ship rotting at anchor the crew stumbling and dying in the scuppers it seemed as if any extreme of hazard were to be preferred to so grisly a certainty as if it would be better to upanchor after all put to sea at a venture and perhaps perish at the hands of cannibals on one of the more obscure paumotus his eye roved swiftly over sea and sky in quest of any promise of wind but the fountains of the trade were empty where it had run yesterday and for weeks before a roaring blue river charioting clouds silence now reigned and the whole height of the atmosphere stood balanced on the endless ribbon of island that stretched out to either hand of him its array of golden and green and silvery palms not the most volatile frond was to be seen stirring they drooped to their stable images in the lagoon like things carved of metal and already their long line began to reverberate heat there was no escape possible that day none probable on the morrow and still the stores were running out  then came over davis from deep down in the roots of his being or at least from far back among his memories of childhood and innocence a wave of superstition this run of illluck was something beyond natural the chances of the game were in themselves more various it seemed as if the devil must serve the pieces the devil he heard again the clear note of attwaters bell ringing abroad into the night and dying away how if god  briskly he averted his mind attwater that was the point attwater had food and a treasure of pearls escape made possible in the present riches in the future they must come to grips with attwater the man must die a smoky heat went over his face as he recalled the impotent figure he had made last night and the contemptuous speeches he must bear in silence rage shame and the love of life all pointed the one way and only invention halted how to reach him had he strength enough was there any help in that misbegotten packet of bones against the house  his eyes dwelled upon him with a strange avidity as though he would read into his soul and presently the sleeper moved stirred uneasily turned suddenly round and threw him a blinking look davis maintained the same dark stare and huish looked away again and sat up  lord ive an eadache on me said he i believe i was a bit swipey last night weres that crybyby errick  gone said the captain  ashore cried huish o i say id a gone too  would you said the captain  yes i would replied huish i like attwater es all right we got on like one oclock when you were gone and aint his sherry in it rather its like spiers and ponds amontillado i wish i ad a drain of it now he sighed  well youll never get no more of itthats one thing said davis gravely  ere wots wrong with you dyvis coppers ot well look at me i aint grumpy said huish im as plyful as a canarybird i am  yes said davis youre playful i own that and you were playful last night i believe and a damned fine performance you made of it  allo said huish ows this wot performance  well ill tell you said the captain getting slowly off the rail  and he did at full length with every wounding epithet and absurd detail repeated and emphasised he had his own vanity and huishs upon the grill and roasted them and as he spoke he inflicted and endured agonies of humiliation it was a plain mans masterpiece of the sardonic  what do you think of it said he when he had done and looked down at huish flushed and serious and yet jeering  ill tell you wot it is was the reply you and me cut a pretty dicky figure  thats so said davis a pretty measly figure by god and by god i want to see that man at my knees  ah said huish ow to get him there  thats it cried davis how to get hold of him theyre four to two though theres only one man among them to count and thats attwater get a bead on attwater and the others would cut and run and sing out like frightened poultryand old man herrick would come round with his hat for a share of the pearls no sir its how to get hold of attwater and we darent even go ashore he would shoot us in the boat like dogs  are you particular about having him dead or alive asked huish  i want to see him dead said the captain  ah well said huish then i believe ill do a bit of breakfast  and he turned into the house  the captain doggedly followed him  whats this he asked whats your idea anyway  o you let me alone will you said huish opening a bottle of champagne youll ear my idea soon enough wyte till i pour some cham on my ot coppers he drank a glass off and affected to listen ark said he ear it fizz like am frying i declyre ave a glass do and look sociable  no said the captain with emphasis no i will not theres business  you pys your money and you tykes your choice my little man returned huish seems rather a shyme to me to spoil your breakfast for wots really ancient istory  he finished three parts of a bottle of champagne and nibbled a corner of biscuit with extreme deliberation the captain sitting opposite and champing the bit like an impatient horse then huish leaned his arms on the table and looked davis in the face  wen youre ready said he  well now whats your idea said davis with a sigh  fair play said huish whats yours  the trouble is that ive got none replied davis and wandered for some time in aimless discussion of the difficulties of their path and useless explanations of his own fiasco  about done said huish  ill dry up right here replied davis  well then said huish you give me your and across the table and say gawd strike me dead if i dont back you up  his voice was hardly raised yet it thrilled the hearer his face seemed the epitome of cunning and the captain recoiled from it as from a blow  what for said he  luck said huish substantial guarantee demanded  and he continued to hold out his hand  i dont see the good of any such tomfoolery said the other  i do though returned huish gimme your and and say the words then youll ear my view of it dont and you dont  the captain went through the required form breathing short and gazing on the clerk with anguish what to fear he knew not yet he feared slavishly what was to fall from the pale lips  now if youll excuse me alf a second said huish ill go and fetch the byby  the baby said davis whats that  fragile with care this side up replied the clerk with a wink as he disappeared  he returned smiling to himself and carrying in his hand a silk handkerchief the long stupid wrinkles ran up daviss brow as he saw it what should it contain he could think of nothing more recondite than a revolver  huish resumed his seat  now said he are you man enough to take charge of errick and the niggers because ill take care of hattwater  how cried davis you cant  tut tut said the clerk you gimme time wots the first point the first point is that we cant get ashore and ill make you a present of that for a ard one but ow about a flag of truce would that do the trick dye think or would attwater simply blyze awy at us in the bloomin boat like dawgs  no said davis i dont believe he would  no more do i said huish i dont believe he would either and im sure i ope he wont so then you can call us ashore next point is to get near the managin direction and for that im going to ave you write a letter in wich you sy youre ashymed to meet his eye and that the bearer mr j l uish is empowered to represent you armed with wich seeminly simple expedient mr j l uish will proceed to business  he paused like one who had finished but still held davis with his eye  how said davis why  well you see youre big returned huish e knows you ave a gun in your pocket and anybody can see with alf an eye that you aint the man to esitate about usin it so its no go with you and never was youre out of the runnin dyvis but he wont be afryde of me im such a little un im unarmedno kid about thatand ill hold my ands up right enough he paused if i can manage to sneak up nearer to him as we talk he resumed you look out and back me up smart if i dont we go awy again and nothink to urt see  the captains face was contorted by the frenzied effort to comprehend  no i dont see he cried i cant see what do you mean  i mean to do for the beast cried huish in a burst of venomous triumph ill bring the ulkin bully to grass hes ad his larks out of me im goin to ave my lark out of im and a good lark too  what is it said the captain almost in a whisper  sure you want to know asked huish  davis rose and took a turn in the house  yes i want to know he said at last with an effort  wen your backs at the wall you do the best you can dont you began the clerk i sy that because i appen to know theres a prejudice against it its considered vulgar awfly vulgar he unrolled the handkerchief and showed a fourounce jar this eres vitriol this is said he  the captain stared upon him with a whitening face  this is the stuff he pursued holding it up thisll burn to the bone youll see it smoke upon im like ellfire one drop upon is bloomin heyesight and ill trouble you for attwater  no no by god exclaimed the captain  now see ere ducky said huish this is my beanfeast

the ole lot of them and tried to and ere i show you ow and because theres some medicine in a bottle you kick up this fuss  i suppose thats so said davis it dont seem someways reasonable only there it is  its the happlication of science i suppose sneered huish  i dont know what it is cried davis pacing the floor its there i draw the line at it i cant put a finger to no such piggishness its too damned hateful  and i suppose its all your fancy pynted it said huish wen you take a pistol and a bit o lead and copse a mans brains all over him no accountin for tystes  im not denying it said davis its something here inside of me its foolishness i daresay its dam foolishness i dont argue i just draw the line isnt there no other way  look for yourself said huish i aint wedded to this if you think i am i aint ambitious i dont make a point of playin the lead i offer to thats all and if you cant show me better by gawd im goin to  then the risk cried davis  if you ast me straight i should say it was a case of seven to one and no takers said huish but thats my lookout ducky and im gyme look at me dyvis there aint any shillyshally about me im gyme thats wot i am gyme all through  the captain looked at him huish sat there preening his sinister vanity glorying in his precedency in evil and the villainous courage and readiness of the creature shone out of him like a candle from a lantern dismay and a kind of respect seized hold on davis in his own despite until that moment he had seen the clerk always hanging back always listless uninterested and openly grumbling at a word of anything to do and now by the touch of an enchanters wand he beheld him sitting girt and resolved and his face radiant he had raised the devil he thought and asked who was to control him and his spirits quailed  look as long as you like huish was going on you dont see any green in my eye i aint afryde of attwater i aint afryde of you and i aint afryde of words you want to kill people thats wot you want but you want to do it in kid gloves and it cant be done that wy murder aint genteel it aint easy it aint safe and it tykes a man to do it eres the man  huish began the captain with energy and then stopped and remained staring at him with corrugated brows  well hout with it said huish ave you anythink else to put up is there any other chanst to try  the captain held his peace  there you are then said huish with a shrug  davis fell again to his pacing  o you may do sentrygo till youre blue in the mug you wont find anythink else said huish  there was a little silence the captain like a man launched on a swing flying dizzily among extremes of conjecture and refusal  but see he said suddenly pausing can you can the thing be done itit cant be easy  if i get within twenty foot of im itll be done so you look out said huish and his tone of certainty was absolute  how can you know that broke from the captain in a choked cry you beast i believe youve done it before  o thats private affyres returned huish i aint a talking man  a shock of repulsion struck and shook the captain a scream rose almost to his lips had he uttered it he might have cast himself at the same moment on the body of huish might have picked him up and flung him down and wiped the cabin with him in a frenzy of cruelty that seemed half moral but the moment passed and the abortive crisis left the man weaker the stakes were so highthe pearls on the one handstarvation and shame on the other ten years of pearls the imagination of davis translated them into a new glorified existence for himself and his family the seat of this new life must be in london there were deadly reasons against portland maine and the pictures that came to him were of english manners he saw his boys marching in the procession of a school with gowns on an usher marshalling them and reading as he walked in a great book he was installed in a villa semidetached the name rosemore on the gateposts in a chair on the gravel walk he seemed to sit smoking a cigar a blue ribbon in his buttonhole victor over himself and circumstances and the malignity of bankers he saw the parlour with red curtains and shells on the mantelpieceand with the fine inconsistency of visions mixed a grog at the mahogany table ere he turned in with that the farallone gave one of the aimless and nameless movements which even in an anchored ship and even in the most profound calm remind one of the mobility of fluids and he was back again under the cover of the house the fierce daylight besieging it all round and glaring in the chinks and the clerk in a rather airy attitude awaiting his decision  he began to walk again he aspired after the realisation of these dreams like a horse nickering for water the lust of them burned in his inside and the only obstacle was attwater who had insulted him from the first he gave herrick a full share of the pearls he insisted on it huish opposed him and he trod the opposition down and praised himself exceedingly he was not going to use vitriol himself was he huishs keeper it was a pity he had asked but after all  he saw the boys again in the school procession with the gowns he had thought to be so tony long since and at the same time the incomparable shame of the last evening blazed up in his mind  have it your own way he said hoarsely  o i knew you would walk up said huish now for the letter theres paper pens and ink sit down and ill dictyte  the captain took a seat and the pen looked a while helplessly at the paper then at huish the swing had gone the other way there was a blur upon his eyes its a dreadful business he said with a strong twitch of his shoulders  its rather a start no doubt said huish tyke a dip of ink thats it william john hattwater esq sir he dictated  how do you know his name is william john asked davis  saw it on a packingcase said huish got that  no said davis but theres another thing what are we to write  o my golly cried the exasperated huish wot kind of man do you call yourself im goin to tell you wot to write thats my pitch if youll just be so bloomin condescendin as to write it down william john attwater esq sir he reiterated and the captain at last beginning half mechanically to move his pen the dictation proceeded it is with feelings of shyme and artfelt contrition that i approach you after the yumiliatin events of last night our mr errick has left the ship and will have doubtless communicated to you the nature of our opes needless to sy these are no longer possible fate as declyred against us and we bow the ead well awyre as i am of the just suspicions with wich i am regarded i do not venture to solicit the fyvour of an interview for myself but in order to put an end to a situytion wich must be equally pyneful to all i ave deputed my friend and partner mr j l huish to ly before you my proposals and wich by their moderytion will i trust be found to merit your attention mr j l huish is entirely unarmed i swear to gawd and will old is ands over is ead from the moment he begins to approach you i am your fytheful servant john dyvis  huish read the letter with the innocent joy of amateurs chuckled gustfully to himself and reopened it more than once after it was folded to repeat the pleasure davis meanwhile sitting inert and heavily frowning  of a sudden he rose he seemed all abroad no he cried no it cant be its too much its damnation god would never forgive it  well and oo wants him to returned huish shrill with fury you were damned years ago for the sea rynger and said so yourself well then be damned for something else and old your tongue  the captain looked at him mistily no he pleaded no old man dont do it  ere now said huish ill give you my ultimytum go or sty were you are i dont mind im goin to see that man and chuck this vitriol in his eyes if you sty ill go alone the niggers will likely knock me on the ead and a fat lot youll be the better but theres one thing sure ill ear no more of your moonin mullygrubbin rot and tyke it stryte  the captain took it with a blink and a gulp memory with phantom voices repeated in his ears something similar something he had once said to herrickyears ago it seemed  now gimme over your pistol said huish i ave to see all clear six shots and mind you dont wyste them  the captain like a man in a nightmare laid down his revolver on the table and huish wiped the cartridges and oiled the works  it was close on noon there was no breath of wind and the heat was scarce bearable when the two men came on deck had the boat manned and passed down one after another into the sternsheets a white shirt at the end of an oar served as flag of truce and the men by direction and to give it the better chance to be observed pulled with extreme slowness the isle shook before them like a place incandescent on the face of the lagoon blinding copper suns no bigger than sixpences danced and stabbed them in the eyeballs there went up from sand and sea and even from the boat a glare of scathing brightness and as they could only peer abroad from between closed lashes the excess of light seemed to be changed into a sinister darkness comparable to that of a thundercloud before it bursts  the captain had come upon this errand for any one of a dozen reasons the last of which was desire for its success superstition rules all men semiignorant and gross natures like that of davis it rules utterly for murder he had been prepared but this horror of the medicine in the bottle went beyond him and he seemed to himself to be parting the last strands that united him to god the boat carried him on to reprobation to damnation and he suffered himself to be carried passively consenting silently bidding farewell to his better self and his hopes  huish sat by his side in towering spirits that were not wholly genuine perhaps as brave a man as ever lived brave as a weasel he must still reassure himself with the tones of his own voice he must play his part to exaggeration he must outherod herod insult all that was respectable and brave all that was formidable in a kind of desperate wager with himself  golly but its ot said he cruel ot i call it nice dy to get your gruel in i sy you know it must feel awfly peculiar to get bowled over on a dy like this id rather ave it on a cowld and frosty morning wouldnt you singing ere we go round the mulberry bush on a cowld and frosty mornin spoken give you my word i avent thought o that in ten year used to sing it at a hinfant school in ackney ackney wick it was singing this is the way the tyler does the tyler does spoken bloomin umbugow are you off now for the notion of a future styte do you cotton to the teafight views or the old redot bogey business  o dry up said the captain  no but i want to know said huish its within the spere of practical politics for you and me my boy we may both be bowled over one up tother down within the next ten minutes it would be rather a lark now if you only skipped across came up smilin tother side and a hangel met you with a b and s under his wing ullo youd sy come i tyke this kind  the captain groaned while huish was thus airing and exercising his bravado the man at his side was actually engaged in prayer prayer what for god knows but out of his inconsistent illogical and agitated spirit a stream of supplication was poured forth inarticulate as himself earnest as death and judgment  thou gawd seest me continued huish i remember i had that written in my bible i remember the bible too all about abinadab and partieswell gawd apostrophising the meridian youre goin to see a rum start presently i promise you that  the captain bounded  ill have no blasphemy he cried no blasphemy in my boat  all right cap said huish anythink to oblige any other topic you would like to sudgest the rynegyge the lightninrod shykespeare or the musical glasses eres conversation on tap put a penny in the slot and  ullo ere they are he cried now or never is e goin to shoot  and the little man straightened himself into an alert and dashing attitude and looked steadily at the enemy  but the captain rose half up in the boat with eyes protruding  whats that he cried  wots wot said huish  thoseblamed things said the captain  and indeed it was something strange herrick and attwater both armed with winchesters had appeared out of the grove behind the figurehead and to either hand of them the sun glistened upon two metallic objects locomotory like men and occupying in the economy of these creatures the places of headsonly the heads were faceless to davis between wind and water his mythology appeared to have come alive and tophet to be vomiting demons but huish was not mystified a moment  divers elmets you ninny cant you see he said  so they are said davis with a gasp and why o i see its for armour  wot did i tell you said huish dyvid and goliar all the wy and back  the two natives for they it was that were equipped in this unusual panoply of war spread out to right and left and at last lay down in the shade on the extreme flank of the position even now that the mystery was explained davis was hatefully preoccupied stared at the flame on their crests and forgot and then remembered with a smile the explanation  attwater withdrew again into the grove and herrick with his gun under his arm came down the pier alone  about halfway down he halted and hailed the boat  what do you want he cried  ill tell that to mr attwater replied huish stepping briskly on the ladder i dont tell it to you because you played the trucklin sneak heres a letter for him tyke it and give it and be anged to you  davis is this all right said herrick  davis raised his chin glanced swiftly at herrick and away again and held his peace the glance was charged with some deep emotion but whether of hatred or of fear it was beyond herrick to divine  well he said ill give the letter he drew a score with his foot on the boards of the gangway till i bring the answer dont move a step past this  and he returned to where attwater leaned against a tree and gave him the letter attwater glanced it through  what does that mean he asked passing it to herrick treachery  o i suppose so said herrick  well tell him to come on said attwater one isnt a fatalist for nothing tell him to come on and to look out  herrick returned to the figurehead halfway down the pier the clerk was waiting with davis by his side  you are to come along huish said herrick he bids you to look outno tricks  huish walked briskly up the pier and paused face to face with the young man  were is e said he and to herricks surprise the lowbred insignificant face before him flushed suddenly crimson and went white again  right forward said herrick pointing now your hands above your head  the clerk turned away from him and towards the figurehead as though he were about to address to it his devotions he was seen to heave a deep breath and raised his arms in common with many men of his unhappy physical endowments huishs hands were disproportionately long and broad and the palms in particular enormous a fourounce jar was nothing in that capacious fist the next moment he was plodding steadily forward on his mission  herrick at first followed then a noise in his rear startled him and he turned about to find davis already advanced as far as the figurehead he came crouching and openmouthed as the mesmerised may follow the mesmeriser all human considerations and even the care of his own life swallowed up in one abominable and burning curiosity  halt cried herrick covering him with his rifle davis what are you doing man you are not to come  davis instinctively paused and regarded him with a dreadful vacancy of eye  put your back to that figureheaddo you hear meand stand fast said herrick  the captain fetched a breath stepped back against the figurehead and instantly redirected his glances after huish  there was a hollow place of the sand in that part and as it were a glade among the cocopalms in which the direct noonday sun blazed intolerably at the far end in the shadow the tall figure of attwater was to be seen leaning on a tree towards him with his hands over his head and his steps smothered in the sand the clerk painfully waded the surrounding glare threw out and exaggerated the mans smallness it seemed no less perilous an enterprise this that he was gone upon than for a whelp to besiege a citadel  there mr whish that will do cried attwater from that distance and keeping your hands up like a good boy you can very well put me in possession of the skippers views  the interval betwixt them was perhaps forty feet and huish measured it with his eye and breathed a curse he was already distressed with labouring in the loose sand and his arms ached bitterly from their unnatural position in the palm of his right hand the jar was ready and his heart thrilled and his voice choked as he began to speak  mr hattwater said he i dont know if ever you ad a mother  i can set your mind at rest i had returned attwater and henceforth if i may venture to suggest it her name need not recur in our communications i should perhaps tell you that i am not amenable to the pathetic  i am sorry sir if i ave seemed to tresparse on your private feelins said the clerk cringing and stealing a step at least sir you will never pesuade me that you are not a perfec gentleman i know a gentleman when i see him and as such i ave no esitation in throwin myself on your merciful consideration it is ard lines no doubt its ard lines to have to hown yourself beat its ard lines to ave to come and beg to you for charity  when if things had only gone right the whole place was as good as your own suggested attwater i can understand the feeling  you are judging me mr attwater said the clerk and god knows how unjustly thou gawd seest me was the tex i ad in my bible wich my father wrote it in with is own and upon the flyleaft  i am sorry i have to beg your pardon once more said attwater but do you know you seem to me to be a trifle nearer which is entirely outside of our bargain and i would venture to suggest that you take onetwothreesteps back and stay there  the devil at this staggering disappointment looked out of huishs face and attwater was swift to suspect he frowned he stared on the little man and considered why should he be creeping nearer the next moment his gun was at his shoulder  kindly oblige me by opening your hands open your hands widelet me see the fingers spread you dogthrow down that thing youre holding he roared his rage and certitude increasing together  and then at almost the same moment the indomitable huish decided to throw and attwater pulled a trigger there was scarce the difference of a second between the two resolves but it was in favour of the man with the rifle and the jar had not yet left the clerks hand before the ball shattered both for the twinkling of an eye the wretch was in hells agonies bathed in liquid flames a screaming bedlamite and then a second and more merciful bullet stretched him dead  the whole thing was come and gone in a breath before herrick could turn about before davis could complete his cry of horror the clerk lay in the sand sprawling and convulsed  attwater ran to the body he stooped and viewed it he put his finger in the vitriol and his face whitened and hardened with anger  davis had not yet moved he stood astonished with his back to the figurehead his hands clutching it behind him his body inclined forward from the waist  attwater turned deliberately and covered him with his rifle  davis he cried in a voice like a trumpet i give you sixty seconds to make your peace with god  davis looked and his mind awoke he did not dream of selfdefence he did not reach for his pistol he drew himself up instead to face death with a quivering nostril  i guess ill not trouble the old man he said considering the job i was on i guess its better business to just shut my face  attwater fired there came a spasmodic movement of the victim and immediately above the middle of his forehead a black hole marred the whiteness of the figurehead a dreadful pause then again the report and the solid sound and jar of the bullet in the wood and this time the captain had felt the wind of it along his cheek a third shot and he was bleeding from one ear and along the levelled rifle attwater smiled like a red indian  the cruel game of which he was the puppet was now clear to davis three times he had drunk of death and he must look to drink of it seven times more before he was despatched he held up his hand  steady he cried ill take your sixty seconds  good said attwater  the captain shut his eyes tight like a child he held his hands up at last with a tragic and ridiculous gesture  my god for christs sake look after my two kids he said and then after a pause and a falter for christs sake amen  and he opened his eyes and looked down the rifle with a quivering mouth  but dont keep fooling me long he pleaded  thats all your prayer asked attwater with a singular ring in his voice  guess so said davis  so said attwater resting the butt of his rifle on the ground is that done is your peace made with heaven because it is with me go and sin no more sinful father and remember that whatever you do to others god shall visit it again a thousandfold upon your innocents  the wretched davis came staggering forward from his place against the figurehead fell upon his knees and waved his hands and fainted  when he came to himself again his head was on attwaters arm and close by stood one of the men in divers helmets holding a bucket of water from which his late executioner now laved his face the memory of that dreadful passage returned upon him in a clap again he saw huish lying dead again he seemed to himself to totter on the brink of an unplumbed eternity with trembling hands he seized hold of the man whom he had come to slay and his voice broke from him like that of a child among the nightmares of fever o isnt there no mercy o what must i do to be saved  ah thought attwater here is the true penitent     chapter xii  a tailpiece   on a very bright hot lusty stronglyblowing noon a fortnight after the events recorded and a month since the curtain rose upon this episode a man might have been spied praying on the sand by the lagoon beach a point of palmtrees isolated him from the settlement and from the place where he knelt the only work of mans hand that interrupted the expanse was the schooner farallone her berth quite changed and rocking at anchor some two miles to windward in the midst of the lagoon the noise of the trade ran very boisterous in all parts of the island the nearer palmtrees crashed and whistled in the gusts those farther off contributed a humming bass like the roar of cities and yet to any man less absorbed there must have risen at times over this turmoil of the winds the sharper note of the human voice from the settlement there all was activity attwater stripped to his trousers and lending a strong hand of help was directing and encouraging five kanakas from his lively voice and their more lively efforts it was to be gathered that some sudden and joyful emergency had set them in this bustle and the union jack floated once more on its staff but the suppliant on the beach unconscious of their voices prayed on with instancy and fervour and the sound of his voice rose and fell again and his countenance brightened and was deformed with changing moods of piety and terror  before his closed eyes the skiff had been for some time tacking towards the distant and deserted farallone and presently the figure of herrick might have been observed to board her to pass for a while into the house thence forward to the forecastle and at last to plunge into the main hatch in all these quarters his visit was followed by a coil of smoke and he had scarce entered his boat again and shoved off before flames broke forth upon the schooner they burned gaily kerosene had not been spared and the bellows of the trade incited the conflagration about halfway on the return voyage when herrick looked back he beheld the farallone wrapped to the topmasts in leaping arms of fire and the voluminous smoke pursuing him along the face of the lagoon in one hours time he computed the waters would have closed over the stolen ship  it so chanced that as his boat flew before the wind with much vivacity and his eyes were continually busy in the wake measuring the progress of the flames he found himself embayed to the northward of the point of palms and here became aware at the same time of the figure of davis immersed in his devotion an exclamation part of annoyance part of amusement broke from him and he touched the helm and ran the prow upon the beach not twenty feet from the unconscious devotee taking the painter in his hand he landed and drew near and stood over him and still the voluble and incoherent stream of prayer continued unabated it was not possible for him to overhear the suppliants petitions which he listened to some while in a very mingled mood of humour and pity and it was only when his own name began to occur and to be conjoined with epithets that he at last laid his hand on the captains shoulder  sorry to interrupt the exercise said he but i want you to look at the farallone  the captain scrambled to his feet and stood gasping and staring mr herrick dont startle a man like that he said i dont seem someways rightly myself since he broke off what did you say anyway o the farallone and he looked languidly out  yes said herrick there she burns and you may guess from that what the news is  the trinity hall i guess said the captain  the same said herrick sighted half an hour ago and coming up hand over fist  well it dont amount to a hill of beans said the captain with a sigh  o come thats rank ingratitude cries herrick  well replied the captain meditatively you maynt just see the way that i view it in but id most rather stay here upon this island i found peace here peace in believing yes i guess this island is about good enough for john davis  i never heard such nonsense cried herrick what with all turning out in your favour the way it does the farallone wiped out the crew disposed of a sure thing for your wife and family and you yourself attwaters spoiled darling and pet penitent  now mr herrick dont say that said the captain gently when you know he dont make no difference between us but o why not be one of us why not come to jesus right away and lets meet in yon beautiful land thats just the one thing wanted just say lord i believe help thou mine unbelief and hell fold you in his arms you see i know i been a sinner myself     weir of hermiston  a

end of a moorland parish far out of the sight of any house there stands a cairn among the heather and a little by east of it in the going down of the braeside a monument with some verses half defaced it was here that claverhouse shot with his own hand the praying weaver of balweary and the chisel of old mortality has clinked on that lonely gravestone public and domestic history have thus marked with a bloody finger this hollow among the hills and since the cameronian gave his life there two hundred years ago in a glorious folly and without comprehension or regret the silence of the moss has been broken once again by the report of firearms and the cry of the dying  the deils hags was the old name but the place is now called francies cairn for a while it was told that francie walked aggie hogg met him in the gloaming by the cairnside and he spoke to her with chattering teeth so that his words were lost he pursued rob todd if any one could have believed robbie for the space of half a mile with pitiful entreaties but the age is one of incredulity these superstitious decorations speedily fell off and the facts of the story itself like the bones of a giant buried there and half dug up survived naked and imperfect in the memory of the scattered neighbours to this day of winter nights when the sleet is on the window and the cattle are quiet in the byre there will be told again amid the silence of the young and the additions and corrections of the old the tale of the justiceclerk and of his son young hermiston that vanished from mens knowledge of the two kirsties and the four black brothers of the cauldstaneslap and of frank innes the young fool advocate that came into these moorland parts to find his destiny     chapter i  life and death of mrs weir   the lord

printed in the page of our scots histories not always to their credit one bit the dust at flodden one was hanged at his peel door by james the fifth another fell dead in a carouse with tom dalyell while a fourth and that was jeans own father died presiding at a hellfire club of which he was the founder there were many heads shaken in crossmichael at that judgment the more so as the man had a villainous reputation among high and low and both with the godly and the worldly at that very hour of his demise he had ten going pleas before the session eight of them oppressive and the same doom extended even to his agents his grieve that had been his right hand in many a lefthand business being cast from his horse one night and drowned in a peathag on the kyeskairs and his very doer although lawyers have long spoons surviving him not long and dying on a sudden in a bloody flux  in all these generations while a male rutherford was in the saddle with his lads or brawling in a changehouse there would be always a whitefaced wife immured at home in the old peel or the later mansionhouse it seemed this succession of martyrs bided long but took their vengeance in the end and that was in the person of the last descendant jean she bore the name of the rutherfords but she was the daughter of their trembling wives at the first she was not wholly without charm neighbours recalled in her as a child a strain of elfin wilfulness gentle little mutinies sad little gaieties even a morning gleam of beauty that was not to be fulfilled she withered in the growing and whether it was the sins of her sires or the sorrows of her mothers came to her maturity depressed and as it were defaced no blood of life in her no grasp or gaiety pious anxious tender tearful and incompetent  it was a wonder to many that she had marriedseeming so wholly of the stuff that makes old maids but chance cast her in the path of adam weir then the new lord advocate a recognised risen man the conqueror of many obstacles and thus late in the day beginning to think upon a wife he was one who looked rather to obedience than beauty yet it would seem he was struck with her at the first look whas she he said turning to his host and when he had been told ay says he she looks menseful she minds me and then after a pause which some have been daring enough to set down to sentimental recollections is she releegious he asked and was shortly after at his own request presented the acquaintance which it seems profane to call a courtship was pursued with mr weirs accustomed industry and was long a legend or rather a source of legends in the parliament house he was described coming rosy with much port into the drawingroom walking direct up to the lady and assailing her with pleasantries to which the embarrassed fair one responded in what seemed a kind of agony eh mr weir or o mr weir or keep me mr weir on the very eve of their engagement it was related that one had drawn near to the tender couple and had overheard the lady cry out with the tones of one who talked for the sake of talking keep me mr weir and what became of him and the profound accents of the suitor reply haangit mem haangit the motives upon either side were much debated mr weir must have supposed his bride to be somewhat suitable perhaps he belonged to that class of men who think a weak head the ornament of womenan opinion invariably punished in this life her descent and her estate were beyond question her wayfaring ancestors and her litigious father had done well by jean there was ready money and there were broad acres ready to fall wholly to the husband to lend dignity to his descendants and to himself a title when he should be called upon the bench on the side of jean there was perhaps some fascination of curiosity as to this unknown male animal that approached her with the roughness of a ploughman and the aplomb of an advocate being so trenchantly opposed to all she knew loved or understood he may well have seemed to her the extreme if scarcely the ideal of his sex and besides he was an ill man to refuse a little over forty at the period of his marriage he looked already older and to the force of manhood added the senatorial dignity of years it was perhaps with an unreverend awe but he was awful the bench the bar and the most experienced and reluctant witness bowed to his authorityand why not jeannie rutherford  the heresy about foolish women is always punished i have said and lord hermiston began to pay the penalty at once his house in george square was wretchedly illguided nothing answerable to the expense of maintenance but the cellar which was his own private care when things went wrong at dinner as they continually did my lord would look up the table at his wife i think these broth would be better to sweem in than to sup or else to the butler here mkillop awa wi this raadical gigottak it to the french man and bring me some puddocks it seems rather a sore kind of business that i should be all day in court haanging radicals and get nawthing to my denner of course this was but a manner of speaking and he had never hanged a man for being a radical in his life the law of which he was the faithful minister directing otherwise and of course these growls were in the nature of pleasantry but it was of a recondite sort and uttered as they were in his resounding voice and commented on by that expression which they called in the parliament house hermistons hanging facethey struck mere dismay into the wife she sat before him speechless and fluttering at each dish as at a fresh ordeal her eye hovered toward my lords countenance and fell again if he but ate in silence unspeakable relief was her portion if there were complaint the world was darkened she would seek out the cook who was always her sister in the lord o my dear this is the most dreidful thing that my lord can never be contented in his own house she would begin and weep and pray with the cook and then the cook would pray with mrs weir and the next days meal would never be a penny the betterand the next cook when she came would be worse if anything but just as pious it was often wondered that lord hermiston bore it as he did indeed he was a stoical old voluptuary contented with sound wine and plenty of it but there were moments when he overflowed perhaps half a dozen times in the history of his married lifehere tak it awa and bring me a piece of bread and kebbuck he had exclaimed with an appalling explosion of his voice and rare gestures none thought to dispute or to make excuses the service was arrested mrs weir sat at the head of the table whimpering without disguise and his lordship opposite munched his bread and cheese in ostentatious disregard once only mrs weir had ventured to appeal he was passing her chair on his way into the study  o edom she wailed in a voice tragic with tears and reaching out to him both hands in one of which she held a sopping pockethandkerchief  he paused and looked upon her with a face of wrath into which there stole as he looked a twinkle of humour  noansense he said you and your noansense what do i want with a christian faimly i want christian broth get me a lass that can plainboil a potato if she was a whüre off the streets and with these words which echoed in her tender ears like blasphemy he had passed on to his study and shut the door behind him  such was the housewifery in george square it was better at hermiston where kirstie elliott the sister of a neighbouring bonnetlaird and an eighteenth cousin of the ladys bore the charge of all and kept a trim house and a good country table kirstie was a woman in a thousand clean capable notable once a moorland helen and still comely as a blood horse and healthy as the hill wind high in flesh and voice and colour she ran the house with her whole intemperate soul in a bustle not without buffets scarce more pious than decency in those days required she was the cause of many an anxious thought and many a tearful prayer to mrs weir housekeeper and mistress renewed the parts of martha and mary and though with a pricking conscience mary reposed on marthas strength as on a rock even lord hermiston held kirstie in a particular regard there were few with whom he unbent so gladly few whom he favoured with so many pleasantries kirstie and me maun have our joke he would declare in high goodhumour as he buttered kirsties scones and she waited at table a man who had no need either of love or of popularity a keen reader of men and of events there was perhaps only one truth for which he was quite unprepared he would have been quite unprepared to learn that kirstie hated him he thought maid and master were well matched hard handy healthy broad scots folk without a hair of nonsense to the pair of them and the fact was that she made a goddess and an only child of the effete and tearful lady and even as she waited at table her hands would sometimes itch for my lords ears  thus at least when the family were at hermiston not only my lord but mrs weir too enjoyed a holiday free from the dreadful lookingfor of the miscarried dinner she would mind her seam read her piety books and take her walk which was my lords orders sometimes by herself sometimes with archie the only child of that scarce natural union the child was her next bond to life her frosted sentiment bloomed again she breathed deep of life she let loose her heart in that society the miracle of her motherhood was ever new to her the sight of the little man at her skirt intoxicated her with the sense of power and froze her with the consciousness of her responsibility she looked forward and seeing him in fancy grow up and play his diverse part on the worlds theatre caught in her breath and lifted up her courage with a lively effort it was only with the child that she forgot herself and was at moments natural yet it was only with the child that she had conceived and managed to pursue a scheme of conduct archie was to be a great man and a good a minister if possible a saint for certain she tried to engage his mind upon her favourite books rutherfords letters scougals grace abounding and the like it was a common practice of hers and strange to remember now that she would carry the child to the deils hags sit with him on the praying weavers stone and talk of the covenanters till their tears ran down her view of history was wholly artless a design in snow and ink upon the one side tender innocents with psalms upon their lips upon the other the persecutors booted bloodyminded flushed with wine a suffering christ a raging beelzebub persecutor was a word that knocked upon the womans heart it was her highest thought of wickedness and the mark of it was on her house her greatgreatgrandfather had drawn the sword against the lords anointed on the field of rullion green and breathed his last tradition said in the arms of the detestable dalyell nor could she blind herself to this that had they lived in those old days hermiston himself would have been numbered alongside of bloody mackenzie and the politic lauderdale and rothes in the band of gods immediate enemies the sense of this moved her to the more fervour she had a voice for that name of persecutor that thrilled in the childs marrow and when one day the mob hooted and hissed them all in my lords travelling carriage and cried down with the persecutor down with hanging hermiston and mamma covered her eyes and wept and papa let down the glass and looked out upon the rabble with his droll formidable face bitter and smiling as they said he sometimes looked when he gave sentence archie was for the moment too much amazed to be alarmed but he had scarce got his mother by herself before his shrill voice was raised demanding an explanation why had they called papa a persecutor  keep me my precious she exclaimed keep me my dear this is poleetical ye must never ask me anything poleetical erchie your faither is a great man my dear and its no for me or you to be judging him it would be telling us all if we behaved ourselves in our several stations the way your faither does in his high office and let me hear no more of any such disrespectful and undutiful questions no that you meant to be undutiful my lamb your mother kens thatshe kens it well dearie and so slid off to safer topics and left on the mind of the child an obscure but ineradicable sense of something wrong  mrs weirs philosophy of life was summed in one expressiontenderness in her view of the universe which was all lighted up with a glow out of the doors of hell good people must walk there in a kind of ecstasy of tenderness the beasts and plants had no souls they were here but for a day and let their day pass gently and as for the immortal men on what black downward path were many of them wending and to what a horror of an immortality are not two sparrows whosoever shall smite thee god sendeth his rain judge not that ye be not judgedthese texts made her body of divinity she put them on in the morning with her clothes and lay down to sleep with them at night they haunted her like a favourite air they clung about her like a favourite perfume their minister was a marrowy expounder of the law and my lord sat under him with relish but mrs weir respected him from far off heard him like the cannon of a beleaguered city usefully booming outside on the dogmatic ramparts and meanwhile within and out of shot dwelt in her private garden which she watered with grateful tears it seems strange to say of this colourless and ineffectual woman but she was a true enthusiast and might have made the sunshine and the glory of a cloister perhaps none but archie knew she could be eloquent perhaps none but he had seen herher colour raised her hands clasped or quiveringglow with gentle ardour there is a corner of the policy of hermiston where you come suddenly in view of the summit of black fell sometimes like the mere grass top of a hill sometimes and this is her own expression like a precious jewel in the heavens on such days upon the sudden view of it her hand would tighten on the childs fingers her voice rise like a song i to the hills she would repeat and o erchie arena these like the hills of naphtali and her tears would flow  upon an impressionable child the effect of this continual and pretty accompaniment to life was deep the womans quietism and piety passed on to his different nature undiminished but whereas in her it was a native sentiment in him it was only an implanted dogma nature and the childs pugnacity at times revolted a cad from the potterrow once struck him in the mouth he struck back the pair fought it out in the back stable lane towards the meadows and archie returned with a considerable decline in the number of his front teeth and unregenerately boasting of the losses of the foe it was a sore day for mrs weir she wept and prayed over the infant backslider until my lord was due from court and she must resume that air of tremulous composure with which she always greeted him the judge was that day in an observant mood and remarked upon the absent teeth  i am afraid erchie will have been fechting with some of thae blagyard lads said mrs weir  my lords voice rang out as it did seldom in the privacy of his own house ill have nonn of that sir he cried do you hear menonn of that no son of mine shall be speldering in the glaur with any dirty raibble  the anxious mother was grateful for so much support she had even feared the contrary and that night when she put the child to bednow my dear ye see she said i told you what your faither would think of it if he heard ye had fallen into this dreidful sin and let you and me pray to god that ye may be keepit from the like temptation or strenthened to resist it  the womanly falsity of this was thrown away ice and iron cannot be welded and the points of view of the justiceclerk and mrs weir were not less unassimilable the character and position of his father had long been a stumblingblock to archie and with every year of his age the difficulty grew more instant the man was mostly silent when he spoke at all it was to speak of the things of the world always in a worldly spirit often in language that the child had been schooled to think coarse and sometimes with words that he knew to be sins in themselves tenderness was the first duty and my lord was invariably harsh god was love the name of my lord to all who knew him was fear in the world as schematised for archie by his mother the place was marked for such a creature there were some whom it was good to pity and well though very likely useless to pray for they were named reprobates goats gods enemies brands for the burning and archie tallied every mark of identification and drew the inevitable private inference that the lord justiceclerk was the chief of sinners  the mothers honesty was scarce complete there was one influence she feared for the child and still secretly combated that was my lords and half unconsciously half in a wilful blindness she continued to undermine her husband with his son as long as archie remained silent she did so ruthlessly with a single eye to heaven and the childs salvation but the day came when archie spoke it was 1801 and archie was seven and beyond his years for curiosity and logic when he brought the case up openly if judging were sinful and forbidden how came papa to be a judge to have that sin for a trade to bear the name of it for a distinction  i cant see it said the little rabbi and wagged his head  mrs weir abounded in commonplace replies  no i canna see it reiterated archie and ill tell you what mamma i dont think you and mes justifeed in staying with him  the woman awoke to remorse she saw herself disloyal to her man her sovereign and breadwinner in whom with what she had of worldliness she took a certain subdued pride she expatiated in reply on my lords honour and greatness his useful services in this world of sorrow and wrong and the place in which he stood far above where babes and innocents could hope to see or criticise but she had builded too wellarchie had his answers pat were not babes and innocents the type of the kingdom of heaven were not honour and greatness the badges of the world and at any rate how about the mob that had once seethed about the carriage  its all very fine he concluded but in my opinion papa has no right to be it and it seems thats not the worst yet of it it seems hes called the hanging judgeit seems hes crooool ill tell you what it is mamma theres a tex borne in upon me it were better for that man if a milestone were bound upon his back and him flung into the deepestmost pairts of the sea  o my lamb ye must never say the like of that she cried yere to honour faither and mother dear that your days may be long in the land its atheists that cry out against himfrench atheists erchie ye would never surely even yourself down to be saying the same thing as french atheists it would break my heart to think that of you and o erchie here arena you setting up to judge and have ye no forgot gods plain commandthe first with promise dear mind you upon the beam and the mote  having thus carried the war into the enemys camp the terrified lady breathed again and no doubt it is easy thus to circumvent a child with catchwords but it may be questioned how far it is effectual an instinct in his breast detects the quibble and a voice condemns it he will instantly submit privately hold the same opinion for even in this simple and antique relation of the mother and the child hypocrisies are multiplied  when the court rose that year and the family returned to hermiston it was a common remark in all the country that the lady was sore failed she seemed to lose and seize again her touch with life now sitting inert in a sort of durable bewilderment anon waking to feverish and weak activity she dawdled about the lasses at their work looking stupidly on she fell to rummaging in old cabinets and presses and desisted when half through she would begin remarks with an air of animation and drop them without a struggle her common appearance was of one who has forgotten something and is trying to remember and when she overhauled one after another the worthless and touching mementoes of her youth she might have been seeking the clue to that lost thought during this period she gave many gifts to the neighbours and house lasses giving them with a manner of regret that embarrassed the recipients  the last night of all she was busy on some female work and toiled upon it with so manifest and painful a devotion that my lord who was not often curious inquired as to its nature  she blushed to the eyes o edom its for you she said its slippers ii hae never made ye any  ye daft auld wife returned his lordship a bonny figure i would be palmering about in bauchles  the next day at the hour of her walk kirstie interfered kirstie took this decay of her mistress very hard bore her a grudge quarrelled with and railed upon her the anxiety of a genuine love wearing the disguise of temper this day of all days she insisted disrespectfully with rustic fury that mrs weir should stay at home but no no she said its my lords orders and set forth as usual archie was visible in the acre bog engaged upon some childish enterprise the instrument of which was mire and she stood and looked at him a while like one about to call then thought otherwise sighed and shook her head and proceeded on her rounds alone the house lasses were at the burnside washing and saw her pass with her loose weary dowdy gait  shes a terrible feckless wife the mistress said the one  tut said the other the wummans seeck  weel i canna see nae differ in her returned the first a füshionless quean a feckless carline  the poor creature thus discussed rambled a while in the grounds without a purpose tides in her mind ebbed and flowed and carried her to and fro like seaweed she tried a path paused returned and tried another questing forgetting her quest the spirit of choice extinct in her bosom or devoid of sequency on a sudden it appeared as though she had remembered or had formed a resolution wheeled about returned with hurried steps and appeared in the diningroom where kirstie was at the cleaning like one charged with an important errand  kirstie she began and paused and then with conviction mr weir isna speeritually minded but he has been a good man to me  it was perhaps the first time since her husbands elevation that she had forgotten the handle to his name of which the tender inconsistent woman was not a little proud and when kirstie looked up at the speakers face she was aware of a change  godsake whats the maitter wi ye mem cried the housekeeper starting from the rug  i do not ken answered her mistress shaking her head but he is not speeritually minded my dear  here sit down with ye godsake what ails the wife cried kirstie and helped and forced her into my lords own chair by the cheek of the hearth  keep me whats this she gasped kirstie whats this im frichened  they were her last words  it was the lowering nightfall when my lord returned he had the sunset in his back all clouds and glory and before him by the wayside spied kirstie elliott waiting she was dissolved in tears and addressed him in the high false note of barbarous mourning such as still lingers modified among scots heather  the lord peety ye hermiston the lord prepare ye she keened out weary upon me that i should have to tell it  he reined in his horse and looked upon her with the hanging face  has the french landit cried he  man man she said is that a ye can think of the lord prepare ye the lord comfort and support ye  is onybody deid says his lordship its no erchie  bethankit no exclaimed the woman startled into a more natural tone na na its no sae bad as that its the mistress my lord she just fair flittit before my een she just gied a sab and was by wi it eh my bonny miss jeannie that i mind sae weel and forth again upon that pouring tide of lamentation in which women of her class excel and overabound  lord hermiston sat in the saddle beholding her then he seemed to recover command upon himself  weel its something of the suddenest said he but she was a dwaibly body from the first  and he rode home at a precipitate amble with kirstie at his horses heels  dressed as she was for her last walk they had laid the dead lady on her bed she was never interesting in life in death she was not impressive and as her husband stood before her with his hands crossed behind his powerful back that which he looked upon was the very image of the insignificant  her and me were never cut out for one another he remarked at last it was a daftlike marriage and then with a most unusual gentleness of tone puir bitch said he puir bitch then suddenly wheres erchie  kirstie had decoyed him to her room and given him a jeelypiece  ye have some kind of gumption too observed the judge and considered his housekeeper grimly when alls said he added i micht have done wauri micht have been marriet upon a skirling jezebel like you  theres naebody thinking of you hermiston cried the offended woman we think of her thats out of her sorrows and could she have done waur tell me that hermistontell me that before her claycauld corp  weel theres some of them gey an ill to please observed his lordship     chapter ii  father and son   my lord justiceclerk was known to many the man adam weir perhaps to none he had nothing to explain or to conceal he sufficed wholly and silently to himself and that part of our nature which goes out too often with false coin to acquire glory or love seemed in him to be omitted he did not try to be loved he did not care to be it is probable the very thought of it was a stranger to his mind he was an admired lawyer a highly unpopular judge and he looked down upon those who were his inferiors in either distinction who were lawyers of less grasp or judges not so much detested in all the rest of his days and doings not one trace of vanity appeared and he went on through life with a mechanical movement as of the unconscious that was almost august  he saw little of his son in the childish maladies with which the boy was troubled he would make daily inquiries and daily pay him a visit entering the sickroom with a facetious and appalling countenance letting off a few perfunctory jests and going again swiftly to the patients relief once a court holiday falling opportunely my lord had his carriage and drove the child himself to hermiston the customary place of convalescence it is conceivable he had been more than usually anxious for that journey always remained in archies memory as a thing apart his father having related to him from beginning to end and with much detail three authentic murder cases archie went the usual round of other edinburgh boys the high school and the college and hermiston looked on or rather looked away with scarce an affectation of interest in his progress daily indeed upon a signal after dinner he was brought in given nuts and a glass of port regarded sardonically sarcastically questioned well sir and what have you donn with your book today my lord might begin and set him posers in law latin to a child just stumbling into corderius papinian and paul proved quite invincible but papa had memory of no other he was not harsh to the little scholar having a vast fund of patience learned upon the bench and was at no pains whether to conceal or to express his disappointment well ye have a long jaunt before ye yet he might observe yawning and fall back on his own thoughts as like as not until the time came for separation and my lord would take the decanter and the glass and be off to the back chamber looking on the meadows where he toiled on his cases till the hours were small there was no fuller man on the bench his memory was marvellous though wholly legal if he had to advise extempore none did it better yet there was none who more earnestly prepared as he thus watched in the night or sat at table and forgot the presence of his son no doubt but he tasted deeply of recondite pleasures to be wholly devoted to some intellectual exercise is to have succeeded in life and perhaps only in law and the higher mathematics may this devotion be maintained suffice to itself without reaction and find continual rewards without excitement this atmosphere of his fathers sterling industry was the best of archies education assuredly it did not attract him assuredly it rather rebutted and depressed yet it was still present unobserved like the ticking of a clock an arid ideal a tasteless stimulant in the boys life  but hermiston was not all of one piece he was besides a mighty toper he could sit at wine until the day dawned and pass directly from the table to the bench with a steady hand and a clear head beyond the third bottle he showed the plebeian in a larger print the low gross accent the low foul mirth grew broader and commoner he became less formidable and infinitely more disgusting now the boy had inherited from jean rutherford a shivering delicacy unequally mated with potential violence in the playingfields and amongst his own companions he repaid a coarse expression with a blow at his fathers table when the time came for him to join these revels he turned pale and sickened in silence of all the guests whom he there encountered he had toleration for only one david keith carnegie lord glenalmond lord glenalmond was tall and emaciated with long features and long delicate hands he was often compared with the statue of forbes of culloden in the parliament house and his blue eye at more than sixty preserved some of the fire of youth his exquisite disparity with any of his fellowguests his appearance as of an artist and an aristocrat stranded in rude company riveted the boys attention and as curiosity and interest are the things in the world that are the most immediately and certainly rewarded lord glenalmond was attracted by the boy  and so this is your son hermiston he asked laying his hand on archies shoulder hes getting a big lad  hout said the gracious father just his mother over againdaurna say boo to a goose  but the stranger retained the boy talked to him drew him out found in him a taste for letters and a fine ardent modest youthful soul and encouraged him to be a visitor on sunday evenings in his bare cold lonely diningroom where he sat and read in the isolation of a bachelor grown old in refinement the beautiful gentleness and grace of the old judge and the delicacy of his person thoughts and language spoke to archies heart in its own tongue he conceived the ambition to be such another and when the day came for him to choose a profession it was in emulation of lord glenalmond not of lord hermiston that he chose the bar hermiston looked on at this friendship with some secret pride but openly with the intolerance of scorn he scarce lost an opportunity to put them down with a rough jape and to say truth it was not difficult for they were neither of them quick he had a word of contempt for the whole crowd of poets painters fiddlers and their admirers the bastard race of amateurs which was continually on his lips signor feedleeerie he would say o for goads sake no more of the signor  you and my father are great friends are you not asked archie once  there is no man that i more respect archie replied lord glenalmond he is two things of price he is a great lawyer and he is upright as the day  you and he are so different said the boy his eyes dwelling on those of his old friend like a lovers on his mistresss  indeed so replied the judge very different and so i fear are you and he yet i would like it very ill if my young friend were to misjudge his father he has all the roman virtues cato and brutus were such i think a sons heart might well be proud of such an ancestry of one  and i would sooner he were a plaided herd cried archie with sudden bitterness  and that is neither very wise nor i believe entirely true returned glenalmond before you are done you will find some of these expressions rise on you like a remorse they are merely literary and decorative they do not aptly express your thought nor is your thought clearly apprehended and no doubt your father if he were here would say signor feedleeerie  with the infinitely delicate sense of youth archie avoided the subject from that hour it was perhaps a pity had he but talkedtalked freelylet himself gush out in words the way youth loves to do and should there might have been no tale to write upon the weirs of hermiston but the shadow of a threat of ridicule sufficed in the slight tartness of these words he read a prohibition and it is likely that glenalmond meant it so  besides the veteran the boy was without confidant or friend serious and eager he came through school and college and moved among a crowd of the indifferent in the seclusion of his shyness he grew up handsome with an open speaking countenance with graceful youthful ways he was clever he took prizes he shone in the speculative society it should seem he must become the centre of a crowd of friends but something that was in part the delicacy of his mother in part the austerity of his father held him aloof from all it is a fact and a strange one that among his contemporaries hermistons son was thought to be a chip of the old block youre a friend of archie weirs said one to frank innes and innes replied with his usual flippancy and more than his usual insight i know weir but i never met archie no one had met archie a malady most incident to only sons he flew his private signal and none heeded it it seemed he was abroad in a world from which the very hope of intimacy was banished and he looked round about him on the concourse of his fellowstudents and forward to the trivial days and acquaintances that were to come without hope or interest  as time went on the tough and rough old sinner felt himself drawn to the son of his loins and sole continuator of his new family with softnesses of sentiment that he could hardly credit and was wholly impotent to express with a face voice and manner trained through forty years to terrify and repel rhadamanthus may be great but he will scarce be engaging it is a fact that he tried to propitiate archie but a fact that cannot be too lightly taken the attempt was so unconspicuously made the failure so stoically supported sympathy is not due to these steadfast iron natures if he failed to gain his sons friendship or even his sons toleration on he went up the great bare staircase of his duty uncheered and undepressed there might have been more pleasure in his relations with archie so much he may have recognised at moments but pleasure was a byproduct of the singular chemistry of life which only fools expected  an idea of archies attitude since we are all grown up and have forgotten the days of our youth it is more difficult to convey he made no attempt whatsoever to understand the man with whom he dined and breakfasted parsimony of pain glut of pleasure these are the two alternating ends of youth and archie was of the parsimonious the wind blew cold out of a certain quarterhe turned his back upon it stayed as little as was possible in his fathers presence and when there averted his eyes as much as was decent from his fathers face the lamp shone for many hundred days upon these two at tablemy lord ruddy gloomy and unreverend archie with a potential brightness that was always dimmed and veiled in that society and there were not perhaps in christendom two men more radically strangers the father with a grand simplicity either spoke of what interested himself or maintained an unaffected silence the son turned in his head for some topic that should be quite safe that would spare him fresh evidences either of my lords inherent grossness or of the innocence of his inhumanity treading gingerly the ways of intercourse like a lady gathering up her skirts in a bypath if he made a mistake and my lord began to abound in matter of offence archie drew himself up his brow grew dark his share of the talk expired but my lord would faithfully and cheerfully continue to pour out the worst of himself before his silent and offended son  well its a poor hert that never rejoices he would say at the conclusion of such a nightmare interview but i must get to my plewstilts and he would seclude himself as usual in the back room and archie go forth into the night and the city quivering with animosity and scorn     chapter iii  in the matter of the hanging of duncan jopp   it chanced in the year 1813 that archie strayed one day into the justiciary court the macer made room for the son of the presiding judge in the dock the centre of mens eyes there stood a wheycoloured misbegotten caitiff duncan jopp on trial for his life his story as it was raked out before him in that public scene was one of disgrace and vice and cowardice the very nakedness of crime and the creature heard and it seemed at times as though he understoodas if at times he forgot the horror of the place he stood in and remembered the shame of what had brought him there he kept his head bowed and his hands clutched upon the rail his hair dropped in his eyes and at times he flung it back and now he glanced about the audience in a sudden fellness of terror and now looked in the face of his judge and gulped there was pinned about his throat a piece of dingy flannel and this it was perhaps that turned the scale in archies mind between disgust and pity the creature stood in a vanishing point yet a little while and he was still a man and had eyes and apprehension yet a little longer and with a last sordid piece of pageantry he would cease to be and here in the meantime with a trait of human nature that caught at the beholders breath he was tending a sore throat  over against him my lord hermiston occupied the bench in the red robes of criminal jurisdiction his face framed in the white wig honest all through he did not affect the virtue of impartiality this was no case for refinement there was a man to be hanged he would have said and he was hanging him nor was it possible to see his lordship and acquit him of gusto in the task it was plain he gloried in the exercise of his trained faculties in the clear sight which pierced at once into the joint of fact in the rude unvarnished gibes with which he demolished every figment of defence he took his ease and jested unbending in that solemn place with some of the freedom of the tavern and the rag of man with the flannel round his neck was hunted gallowsward with jeers  duncan had a mistress scarce less forlorn and greatly older than himself who came up whimpering and curtseying to add the weight of her betrayal my lord gave her the oath in his most roaring voice and added an intolerant warning  mind what ye say now janet said he i have an ee upon ye im ill to jest with  presently after she was tremblingly embarked on her story and what made ye do this ye auld runt the court interposed do ye mean to tell me ye was the panels mistress  if you please ma loard whined the female  godsake ye made a bonny couple observed his lordship and there was something so formidable and ferocious in his scorn that not even the galleries thought to laugh  the summing up contained some jewels  these two peetiable creatures seem to have made up thegither its not for us to explain whythe panel who whatever else he may be appears to be equally ill setout in mind and boadyneither the panel nor yet the old wife appears to have had so much common sense as even to tell a lie when it was necessary and in the course of sentencing my lord had this obiter dictum i have been the means under god of haanging a great number but never just such a disjaskit rascal as yourself the words were strong in themselves the light and heat and detonation of their delivery and the savage pleasure of the speaker in his task made them tingle in the ears  when all was over archie came forth again into a changed world had there been the least redeeming greatness in the crime any obscurity any dubiety perhaps he might have understood but the culprit stood with his sore throat in the sweat of his mortal agony without defence or excuse a thing to cover up with blushes a being so much sunk beneath the zones of sympathy that pity might seem harmless and the judge had pursued him with a monstrous relishing gaiety horrible to be conceived a trait for nightmares it is one thing to spear a tiger another to crush a toad there are æsthetics even of the slaughterhouse and the loathsomeness of duncan jopp enveloped and infected the image of his judge  archie passed by his friends in the high street with incoherent words and gestures he saw holyrood in a dream remembrance of its romance awoke in him and faded he had a vision of the old radiant stories of queen mary and prince charlie of the hooded stag of the splendour and crime the velvet and bright iron of the past and dismissed them with a cry of pain he lay and moaned in the hunters bog and the heavens were dark above him and the grass of the field an offence this is my father he said i draw my life from him the flesh upon my bones is his the bread i am fed with is the wages of these horrors he recalled his mother and ground his forehead in the earth he thought of flight and where was he to flee to of other lives but was there any life worth living in this den of savage and jeering animals  the interval before the execution was like a violent dream he met his father he would not look at him he could not speak to him it seemed there was no living creature but must have been swift to recognise that imminent animosity but the hide of the justiceclerk remained impenetrable had my lord been talkative the truce could never have subsisted but he was by fortune in one of his humours of sour silence and under the very guns of his broadside archie nursed the enthusiasm of rebellion it seemed to him from the top of his nineteen years experience as if he were marked at birth to be the perpetrator of some signal action to set back fallen mercy to overthrow the usurping devil that sat horned and hoofed on her throne seductive jacobin figments which he had often refuted at the speculative swam up in his mind and startled him as with voices and he seemed to himself to walk accompanied by an almost tangible presence of new beliefs and duties  on the named morning he was at the place of execution he saw the fleering rabble the flinching wretch produced he looked on for a while at a certain parody of devotion which seemed to strip the wretch of his last claim to manhood then followed the brutal instant of extinction and the paltry dangling of the remains like a broken jumpingjack he had been prepared for something terrible not for this tragic meanness he stood a moment silent and theni denounce this goddefying murder he shouted and his father if he must have disclaimed the sentiment might have owned the stentorian voice with which it was uttered  frank innes dragged him from the spot the two handsome lads followed the same course of study and recreation and felt a certain mutual attraction founded mainly on good looks it had never gone deep frank was by nature a thin jeering creature not truly susceptible whether of feeling or inspiring friendship and the relation between the pair was altogether on the outside a thing of common knowledge and the pleasantries that spring from a common acquaintance the more credit to frank that he was appalled by archies outburst and at least conceived the design of keeping him in sight and if possible in hand for the day but archie who had just defiedwas it god or satanwould not listen to the word of a college companion  i will not go with you he said i do not desire your company sir i would be alone  here weir man dont be absurd said innes keeping a tight hold upon his sleeve i will not let you go until i know what you mean to do with yourself its no use brandishing that staff for indeed at that moment archie had made a suddenperhaps a warlikemovement this has been the most insane affair you know it has you know very well that im playing the good samaritan all i wish is to keep you quiet  if quietness is what you wish mr innes said archie and you will promise to leave me entirely to myself i will tell you so much that i am going to walk in the country and admire the beauties of nature  honour bright asked frank  i am not in the habit of lying mr innes retorted archie i have the honour of wishing you goodday  you wont forget the spec asked innes  the spec said archie o no i wont forget the spec  and the one young man carried his tortured spirit forth of the city and all the day long by one road and another in an endless pilgrimage of misery while the other hastened smilingly to spread the news of weirs access of insanity and to drum up for that night a full attendance at the speculative where further eccentric developments might certainly be looked for i doubt if innes had the least belief in his prediction i think it flowed rather from a wish to make the story as good and the scandal as great as possible not from any illwill to archiefrom the mere pleasure of beholding interested faces but for all that his words were prophetic archie did not forget the spec he put in an appearance there at the due time and before the evening was over had dealt a memorable shock to his companions it chanced he was the president of the night he sat in the same room where the society still meetsonly the portraits were not there the men who afterwards sat for them were then but beginning their careers the same lustre of many tapers shed its light over the meeting the same chair perhaps supported him that so many of us have sat in since at times he seemed to forget the business of the evening but even in these periods he sat with a great air of energy and determination at times he meddled bitterly and launched with defiance those fines which are the precious and rarely used artillery of the president he little thought as he did so how he resembled his father but his friends remarked upon it chuckling so far in his high place above his fellowstudents he seemed set beyond the possibility of any scandal but his mind was made uphe was determined to fulfil the sphere of his offence he signed to innes whom he had just fined and who had just impeached his ruling to succeed him in the chair stepped down from the platform and took his place by the chimneypiece the shine of many wax tapers from above illuminating his pale face the glow of the great red fire relieving from behind his slim figure he had to propose as an amendment to the next subject in the casebook whether capital punishment be consistent with gods will or mans policy  a breath of embarrassment of something like alarm passed round the room so daring did these words appear upon the lips of hermistons only son but the amendment was not seconded the previous question was promptly moved and unanimously voted and the momentary scandal smuggled by innes triumphed in the fulfilment of his prophecy he and archie were now become the heroes of the night but whereas every one crowded about innes when the meeting broke up but one of all his companions came to speak to archie  weir man that was an extraordinary raid of yours observed this courageous member taking him confidentially by the arm as they went out  i dont think it a raid said archie grimly more like a war i saw that poor brute hanged this morning and my gorge rises at it yet  huttut returned his companion and dropping his arm like something hot he sought the less tense society of others  archie found himself alone the last of the faithfulor was it only the boldest of the curioushad fled he watched the black huddle of his fellowstudents draw off down and up the street in whispering or boisterous gangs and the isolation of the moment weighed upon him like an omen and an emblem of his destiny in life bred up in unbroken fear himself among trembling servants and in a house which at the least ruffle in the masters voice shuddered into silence he saw himself on the brink of the red valley of war and measured the danger and length of it with awe he made a détour in the glimmer and shadow of the streets came into the back stable lane and watched for a long while the light burn steady in the judges room the longer he gazed upon that illuminated windowblind the more blank became the picture of the man who sat behind it endlessly turning over sheets of process pausing to sip a glass of port or rising and passing heavily about his booklined walls to verify some reference he could not combine the brutal judge and the industrious dispassionate student the connecting link escaped him from such a dual nature it was impossible he should predict behaviour and he asked himself if he had done well to plunge into a business of which the end could not be foreseen and presently after with a sickening decline of confidence if he had done loyally to strike his father for he had struck himdefied him twice over and before a cloud of witnessesstruck him a public buffet before crowds who had called him to judge his father in these precarious and high questions the office was usurped it might have become a stranger in a sonthere was no blinking itin a son it was disloyal and now between these two natures so antipathetic so hateful to each other there was depending an unpardonable affront and the providence of god alone might foresee the manner in which it would be resented by lord hermiston  these misgivings tortured him all night and arose with him in the winters morning they followed him from class to class they made him shrinkingly sensitive to every shade of manner in his companions they sounded in his ears through the current voice of the professor and he brought them home with him at night unabated and indeed increased the cause of this increase lay in a chance encounter with the celebrated dr gregory archie stood looking vaguely in the lighted window of a bookshop trying to nerve himself for the approaching ordeal my lord and he had met and parted in the morning as they had now done for long with scarcely the ordinary civilities of life and it was plain to the son that nothing had yet reached the fathers ears indeed when he recalled the awful countenance of my lord a timid hope sprang up in him that perhaps there would be found no one bold enough to carry tales if this were so he asked himself would he begin again and he found no answer it was at this moment that a hand was laid upon his arm and a voice said in his ear my dear mr archie you had better come and see me  he started turned round and found himself face to face with dr gregory and why should i come to see you he asked with the defiance of the miserable  because you are looking exceedingly ill said the doctor and you very evidently want looking after my young friend good folk are scarce you know and it is not every one that would be quite so much missed as yourself it is not every one that hermiston would miss  and with a nod and a smile the doctor passed on  a moment after archie was in pursuit and had in turn but more roughly seized him by the arm  what do you mean what did you mean by saying that what makes you think that hermismy father would have missed me  the doctor turned about and looked him all over with a clinical eye a far more stupid man than dr gregory might have guessed the truth but ninetynine out of a hundred even if they had been equally inclined to kindness would have blundered by some touch of charitable exaggeration the doctor was better inspired he knew the father well in that white face of intelligence and suffering he divined something of the son and he told without apology or adornment the plain truth  when you had the measles mr archibald you had them gey and ill and i thought you were going to slip between my fingers he said well your father was anxious how did i know it says you simply because i am a trained observer the sign that i saw him make ten thousand would have missed and perhapsperhaps i say because hes a hard man to judge ofbut perhaps he never made another a strange thing to consider it was this one day i came to him hermiston said i theres a change he never said a word just glowered at me if yell pardon the phrase like a wild beast a change for the better said i and i distinctly heard him take his breath  the doctor left no opportunity for anticlimax nodding his cocked hat a piece of antiquity to which he clung and repeating distinctly with raised eyebrows he took his departure and left archie speechless in the street  the anecdote might be called infinitely little and yet its meaning for archie was immense i did not know the old man had so much blood in him he had never dreamed this sire of his this aboriginal antique this adamantine adam had even so much of a heart as to be moved in the least degree for anotherand that other himself who had insulted him with the generosity of youth archie was instantly under arms upon the other side had instantly created a new image of lord hermiston that of a man who was all iron without and all sensibility within the mind of the vile jester the tongue that had pursued duncan jopp with unmanly insults the unbeloved countenance that he had known and feared for so long were all forgotten and he hastened home impatient to confess his misdeeds impatient to throw himself on the mercy of this imaginary character  he was not to be long without a rude awakening it was in the gloaming when he drew near the doorstep of the lighted house and was aware of the figure of his father approaching from the opposite side little daylight lingered but on the door being opened the strong yellow shine of the lamp gushed out upon the landing and shone full on archie as he stood in the oldfashioned observance of respect to yield precedence the judge came without haste stepping stately and firm his chin raised his face as he entered the lamplight strongly illumined his mouth set hard there was never a wink of change in his expression without looking to the right or left he mounted the stair passed close to archie and entered the house instinctively the boy upon his first coming had made a movement to meet him instinctively he recoiled against the railing as the old man swept by him in a pomp of indignation words were needless he knew allperhaps more than alland the hour of judgment was at hand  it is possible that in this sudden revulsion of hope and before these symptoms of impending danger archie might have fled but not even that was left to him my lord after hanging up his cloak and hat turned round in the lighted entry and made him an imperative and silent gesture with his thumb and with the strange instinct of obedience archie followed him into the house  all dinnertime there reigned over the judges table a palpable silence and as soon as the solids were despatched he rose to his feet  mkillop tak the wine into my room said he and then to his son archie you and me has to have a talk  it was at this sickening moment that archies courage for the first and last time entirely deserted him i have an appointment said he  itll have to be broken then said hermiston and led the way into his study  the lamp was shaded the fire trimmed to a nicety the table covered deep with orderly documents the backs of lawbooks made a frame upon all sides that was only broken by the window and the doors  for a moment hermiston warmed his hands at the fire presenting his back to archie then suddenly disclosed on him the terrors of the hanging face  whats this i hear of ye he asked  there was no answer possible to archie  ill have to tell ye then pursued hermiston it seems yeve been skirling against the father that begot ye and one of his maijestys judges in this land and that in the public street and while an order of the court was being executit forbye which it would appear that yeve been airing your opeenions in a coallege debatin society he paused a moment and then with extraordinary bitterness added ye damned eediot  i had meant to tell you stammered archie i see you are well informed  muckle obleeged to ye said his lordship and took his usual seat and so you disapprove of caapital punishment he added  i am sorry sir i do said archie  i am sorry too said his lordship and now if you please we shall approach this business with a little more parteecularity i hear that at the hanging of duncan joppand man ye had a fine client therein the middle of all the riffraff of the ceety ye thought fit to cry out this is a damned murder and my gorge rises at the man that haangit him  no sir these were not my words cried archie  what were yer words then asked the judge  i believe i said i denounce it as a murder said the son i beg your pardona goddefying murder i have no wish to conceal the truth he added and looked his father for a moment in the face  god it would only need that of it next cried hermiston there was nothing about your gorge rising then  that was afterwards my lord as i was leaving the speculative i said i had been to see the miserable creature hanged and my gorge rose at it  did ye though said hermiston and i suppose ye knew who haangit him  i was present at the trial i ought to tell you that i ought to explain i ask your pardon beforehand for any expression that may seem undutiful the position in which i stand is wretched said the unhappy hero now fairly face to face with the business he had chosen i have been reading some of your cases i was present while jopp was tried it was a hideous business father it was a hideous thing grant he was vile why should you hunt him with a vileness equal to his own it was done with gleethat is the wordyou did it with glee and i looked on god help me with horror  youre a young gentleman that doesna approve of caapital punishment said hermiston weel im an auld man that does i was glad to get jopp haangit and what for would i pretend i wasna youre all for honesty it seems you couldnt even steik your mouth on the public street what for should i steik mines upon the bench the kings officer bearing the sword a dreid to evildoers as i was from the beginning and as i will be to the end mair than enough of it heedious i never gave twa thoughts to heediousness i have no call to be bonny im a man that gets through with my days business and let that suffice  the ring of sarcasm had died out of his voice as he went on the plain words became invested with some of the dignity of the justiceseat  it would be telling you if you could say as much the speaker resumed but ye cannot yeve been reading some of my cases ye say but it was not for the law in them it was to spy out your faithers nakedness a fine employment in a son youre splairging youre running at lairge in life like a wild nowt its impossible you should think any longer of coming to the bar youre not fit for it no splairger is and another thing son of mines or no son of mines you have flung fylement in public on one of the senators of the coallege of justice and i would make it my business to see that ye were never admitted there yourself there is a kind of a decency to be observit then comes the next of itwhat am i to do with ye next yell have to find some kind of a trade for ill never support ye in idleset what do ye fancy yell be fit for the pulpit na they could never get diveenity into that bloackhead him that the law of man whammles is no likely to do muckle better by the law of god what would ye make of hell wouldna your gorge rise at that na theres no room for splairgers under the fower quarters of john calvin what else is there speak up have ye got nothing of your own  father let me go to the peninsula said archie thats all im fit forto fight  all quo he returned the judge and it would be enough too if i thought it but ill never trust ye so near the french you thats so frenchifeed  you do me injustice there sir said archie i am loyal i will not boast but any interest i may have ever felt in the french  have ye been so loyal to me interrupted his father  there came no reply  i think not continued hermiston and i would send no man to be a servant to the king god bless him that has proved such a shauchling son to his own faither you can splairge here on edinburgh street and wheres the hairm it doesna play buff on me and if there were twenty thousand eediots like yourself sorrow a duncan jopp would hang the fewer but theres no splairging possible in a camp and if you were to go to it you would find out for yourself whether lord wellnton approves of caapital punishment or not you a sodger he cried with a sudden burst of scorn ye auld wife the sodgers would bray at ye like cuddies  as at the drawing of a curtain archie was aware of some illogicality in his position and stood abashed he had a strong impression besides of the essential valour of the old gentleman before him how conveyed it would be hard to say  well have ye no other proposeetion said my lord again  you have taken this so calmly sir that i cannot but stand ashamed began archie  im nearer voamiting though than you would fancy said my lord  the blood rose to archies brow  i beg your pardon i should have said that you had accepted my affront i admit it was an affront i did not think to apologise but i do i ask your pardon it will not be so again i pass you my word of honour i should have said that i admired your magnanimity withthisoffender archie concluded with a gulp  i have no other son ye see said hermiston a bonny one i have gotten but i must just do the best i can wi him and what am i to do if ye had been younger i would have wheepit ye for this rideeculous exhibeetion the way it is i have just to grin and bear but one thing is to be clearly understood as a faither i must grin and bear it but if i had been the lord advocate instead of the lord justiceclerk son or no son mr erchibald weir would have been in a jyle the night  archie was now dominated lord hermiston was coarse and cruel and yet the son was aware of a bloomless nobility an ungracious abnegation of the mans self in the mans office at every word this sense of the greatness of lord hermistons spirit struck more home and along with it that of his own impotence who had struckand perhaps basely struckat his own father and not reached so far as to have even nettled him  i place myself in your hands without reserve he said  thats the first sensible word ive had of ye the night said hermiston i can tell ye that would have been the end of it the one way or the other but its better ye should come there yourself than what i would have had to hirstle ye weel by my way of itand my way is the besttheres just the one thing its possible that ye might be with decency and thats a laird yell be out of hairms way at the least of it if ye have to rowt ye can rowt amang the kye and the maist feck of the caapital punishment yere like to come acrossll be guddling trouts now im for no idle lairdies every man has to work if its only at peddling ballants to work or to be wheeped or to be haangit if i set ye down at hermiston ill have to see you work that place the way it has never been workit yet ye must ken about the sheep like a herd ye must be my grieve there and ill see that i gain by ye is that understood  i will do my best said archie  well then ill send kirstie word the morn and ye can go yourself the day after said hermiston and just try to be less of an eediot he concluded with a freezing smile and turned immediately to the papers on his desk     chapter iv  opinions of the bench   late the same night after a disordered walk archie was admitted into lord glenalmonds diningroom where he sat with a book upon his knee beside three frugal coals of fire in his robes upon the bench glenalmond had a certain air of burliness plucked of these it was a maypole of a man that rose unsteadily from his chair to give his visitor welcome archie had suffered much in the last days he had suffered again that evening his face was white and drawn his eyes wild and dark but lord glenalmond greeted him without the least mark of surprise or curiosity  come in come in said he come in and take a seat carstairs to his servant make up the fire and then you can bring a bit of supper and again to archie with a very trivial accent i was half expecting you he added  no supper said archie it is impossible that i should eat  not impossible said the tall old man laying his hand upon his shoulder and if you will believe me necessary  you know what brings me said archie as soon as the servant had left the room  i have a guess i have a guess replied glenalmond we will talk of it presentlywhen carstairs has come and gone and you have had a piece of my good cheddar cheese and a pull at the porter tankard not before  it is impossible i should eat repeated archie  tut tut said lord glenalmond you have eaten nothing today and i venture to add nothing yesterday there is no case that may not be made worse this may be a very disagreeable business but if you were to fall sick and die it would be still more so and for all concernedfor all concerned  i see you must know all said archie where did you hear it  in the mart of scandal in the parliament house said glenalmond it runs riot below among the bar and the public but it sifts up to us upon the bench and rumour has some of her voices even in the divisions  carstairs returned at this moment and rapidly laid out a little supper during which lord glenalmond spoke at large and a little vaguely on indifferent subjects so that it might be rather said of him that he made a cheerful noise than that he contributed to human conversation and archie sat upon the other side not heeding him brooding over his wrongs and errors  but so soon as the servant was gone he broke forth again at once who told my father who dared to tell him could it have been you  no it was not me said the judge althoughto be quite frank with you after i had seen and warned youit might have been me i believe it was glenkindie  that shrimp cried archie  as you say that shrimp returned my lord although really it is scarce a fitting mode of expression for one of the senators of the college of justice we were hearing the parties in a long crucial case before the fifteenth creech was moving at some length for an infeftment when i saw glenkindie lean forward to hermiston with his hand over his mouth and make him a secret communication no one could have guessed its nature from your father from glenkindie yes his malice sparked out of him a little grossly but your father no a man of granite the next moment he pounced upon creech mr creech says he ill take a look of that sasine and for thirty minutes after said glenalmond with a smile messrs creech and co were fighting a pretty uphill battle which resulted i need hardly add in their total rout the case was dismissed no i doubt if ever i heard hermiston better inspired he was literally rejoicing in apicibus juris  archie was able to endure no longer he thrust his plate away and interrupted the deliberate and insignificant stream of talk here he said i have made a fool of myself if i have not made something worse do you judge between usjudge between a father and a son i can speak to you it is not like  i will tell you what i feel and what i mean to do and you shall be the judge he repeated  i decline jurisdiction said glenalmond with extreme seriousness but my dear boy if it will do you any good to talk and if it will interest you at all to hear what i may choose to say when i have heard you i am quite at your command let an old man say it for once and not need to blush i love you like a son  there came a sudden sharp sound in archies throat ay he cried and there it is love like a son and how do you think i love my father  quietly quietly says my lord  i will be very quiet replied archie and i will be baldly frank i do not love my father i wonder sometimes if i do not hate him theres my shame perhaps my sin at least and in the sight of god not my fault how was i to love him he has never spoken to me never smiled upon me i do not think he ever touched me you know the way he talks you do not talk so yet you can sit and hear him without shuddering and i cannot my soul is sick when he begins with it i could smite him in the mouth and all thats nothing i was at the trial of this jopp you were not there but you must have heard him often the mans notorious for it for beinglook at my position hes my father and this is how i have to speak of himnotorious for being a brute and cruel and a coward lord glenalmond i give you my word when i came out of that court i longed to diethe shame of it was beyond my strength but ii he rose from his seat and began to pace the room in a disorder well who am i a boy who have never been tried have never done anything except this twopenny impotent folly with my father but i tell you my lord and i know myself i am at least that kind of a manor that kind of a boy if you prefer itthat i could die in torments rather than that any one should suffer as that scoundrel suffered well and what have i done i see it now i have made a fool of myself as i said in the beginning and i have gone back and asked my fathers pardon and placed myself wholly in his handsand he has sent me to hermiston with a wretched smile for life i supposeand what can i say he strikes me as having done quite right and let me off better than i had deserved  my poor dear boy observed glenalmond my poor dear and if you will allow me to say so very foolish boy you are only discovering where you are to one of your temperament or of mine a painful discovery the world was not made for us it was made for ten hundred millions of men all different from each other and from us theres no royal road there we just have to sclamber and tumble dont think that i am at all disposed to be surprised dont suppose that i ever think of blaming you indeed i rather admire but there fall to be offered one or two observations on the case which occur to me and which if you will listen to them dispassionately may be the means of inducing you to view the matter more calmly first of all i cannot acquit you of a good deal of what is called intolerance you seem to have been very much offended because your father talks a little sculduddery after dinner which it is perfectly licit for him to do and which although i am not very fond of it myself appears to be entirely an affair of taste your father i scarcely like to remind you since it is so trite a commonplace is older than yourself at least he is major and sui juris and may please himself in the matter of his conversation and do you know i wonder if he might not have as good an answer against you and me we say we sometimes find him coarse but i suspect he might retort that he finds us always dull perhaps a relevant exception  he beamed on archie but no smile could be elicited  and now proceeded the judge for archibald on capital punishment this is a very plausible academic opinion of course i do not and i cannot hold it but thats not to say that many able and excellent persons have not done so in the past possibly in the past also i may have a little dipped myself in the same heresy my third client or possibly my fourth was the means of a return in my opinions i never saw the man i more believed in i would have put my hand in the fire i would have gone to the cross for him and when it came to trial he was gradually pictured before me by undeniable probation in the light of so gross so coldblooded and so blackhearted a villain that i had a mind to have cast my brief upon the table i was then boiling against the man with even a more tropical temperature than i had been boiling for him but i said to myself no you have taken up his case and because you have changed your mind it must not be suffered to let drop all that rich tide of eloquence that you prepared last night with so much enthusiasm is out of place and yet you must not desert him you must say something so i said something and i got him off it made my reputation but an experience of that kind is formative a man must not bring his passions to the baror to the bench he added  the story had slightly rekindled archies interest i could never deny he begani mean i can conceive that some men would be better dead but who are we to know all the springs of gods unfortunate creatures who are we to trust ourselves where it seems that god himself must think twice before he treads and to do it with delight yes with delight tigris ut aspera  perhaps not a pleasant spectacle said glenalmond and yet do you know i think somehow a great one  ive had a long talk with him tonight said archie  i was supposing so said glenalmond  and he struck mei cannot deny that he struck me as something very big pursued the son yes he is big he never spoke about himself only about me i suppose i admired him the dreadful part  suppose we did not talk about that interrupted glenalmond you know it very well it cannot in any way help that you should brood upon it and i sometimes wonder whether you and iwho are a pair of sentimentalistsare quite good judges of plain men  how do you mean asked archie  fair judges i mean replied glenalmond can we be just to them do we not ask too much there was a word of yours just now that impressed me a little when you asked me who we were to know all the springs of gods unfortunate creatures you applied that as i understood to capital cases only but does iti ask myselfdoes it not apply all through is it any less difficult to judge of a good man or of a halfgood man than of the worst criminal at the bar and may not each have relevant excuses  ah but we do not talk of punishing the good cried archie  no we do not talk of it said glenalmond but i think we do it your father for instance  you think i have punished him cried archie  lord glenalmond bowed his head  i think i have said archie and the worst is i think he feels it how much who can tell with such a being but i think he does  and i am sure of it said glenalmond  has he spoken to you then cried archie  o no replied the judge  i tell you honestly said archie i want to make it up to him i will go i have already pledged myself to go to hermiston that was to him and now i pledge myself to you in the sight of god that i will close my mouth on capital punishment and all other subjects where our views may clash forhow long shall i say when shall i have sense enoughten years is that well  it is well said my lord  as far as it goes said archie it is enough as regards myself it is to lay down enough of my conceit but as regards him whom i have publicly insulted what am i to do to him how do you pay attentions to aan alp like that  only in one way replied glenalmond only by obedience punctual prompt and scrupulous  and i promise that he shall have it answered archie i offer you my hand in pledge of it  and i take your hand as a solemnity replied the judge god bless you my dear and enable you to keep your promise god guide you in the true way and spare your days and preserve to you your honest heart at that he kissed the young man upon the forehead in a gracious distant antiquated way and instantly launched with a marked change of voice into another subject and now let us replenish the tankard and i believe if you will try my cheddar again you would find you had a better appetite the court has spoken and the case is dismissed  no there is one thing i must say cried archie i must say it in justice to himself i knowi believe faithfully slavishly after our talkhe will never ask me anything unjust i am proud to feel it that we have that much in common i am proud to say it to you  the judge with shining eyes raised his tankard and i think perhaps that we might permit ourselves a toast said he i should like to propose the health of a man very different from me and very much my superiora man from whom i have often differed who has often in the trivial expression rubbed me the wrong way but whom i have never ceased to respect and i may add to be not a little afraid of shall i give you his name  the lord justiceclerk lord hermiston said archie almost with gaiety and the pair drank the toast deeply  it was not precisely easy to reestablish after these emotional passages the natural flow of conversation but the judge eked out what was wanting with kind looks produced his snuffbox which was very rarely seen to fill in a pause and at last despairing of any further social success was upon the point of getting down a book to read a favourite passage when there came a rather startling summons at the front door and carstairs ushered in my lord glenkindie hot from a midnight supper i am not aware that glenkindie was ever a beautiful object being short and grossbodied and with an expression of sensuality comparable to a bears at that moment coming in hissing from many potations with a flushed countenance and blurred eyes he was strikingly contrasted with the tall pale kingly figure of glenalmond a rush of confused thought came over archieof shame that this was one of his fathers elect friends of pride that at the least of it hermiston could carry his liquor and last of all of rage that he should have here under his eyes the man that had betrayed him and then that too passed away and he sat quiet biding his opportunity  the tipsy senator plunged at once into an explanation with glenalmond there was a point reserved yesterday he had been able to make neither head nor tail of it and seeing lights in the house he had just dropped in for a glass of porterand at this point he became aware of the third person archie saw the cods mouth and the blunt lips of glenkindie gape at him for a moment and the recognition twinkle in his eyes  whos this said he what is this possibly you don quickshot and how are ye and hows your father and whats all this we hear of you it seems youre a most extraordinary leveller by all tales no king no parliaments and your gorge rises at the macers worthy men hoot toot dear dear me your fathers son too most rideeculous  archie was on his feet flushing a little at the reappearance of his unhappy figure of speech but perfectly selfpossessed my lordand you lord glenalmond my dear friend he began this is a happy chance for me that i can make my confession and offer my apologies to two of you at once  ah but i dont know about that confession itll be judeecial my young friend cried the jocular glenkindie and im afraid to listen to ye think if ye were to make me a coanvert  if you would allow me my lord returned archie what i have to say is very serious to me and be pleased to be humorous after i am gone  remember ill hear nothing against the macers put in the incorrigible glenkindie  but archie continued as though he had not spoken i have played both yesterday and today a part for which i can only offer the excuse of youth i was so unwise as to go to an execution it seems i made a scene at the gallows not content with which i spoke the same night in a college society against capital punishment this is the extent of what i have done and in case you hear more alleged against me i protest my innocence i have expressed my regret already to my father who is so good as to pass my conduct overin a degree and upon the condition that i am to leave my law studies      chapter v  winter on the moors     1 at hermiston  the road to hermiston runs for a great part of the way up the valley of a stream a favourite with anglers and with midges full of falls and pools and shaded by willows and natural woods of birch here and there but at great distances a byway branches off and a gaunt farmhouse may be descried above in a fold of the hill but the more part of the time the road would be quite empty of passage and the hills of habitation hermiston parish is one of the least populous in scotland and by the time you came that length you would scarce be surprised at the inimitable smallness of the kirk a dwarfish ancient place seated for fifty and standing in a green by the burnside among twoscore gravestones the manse close by although no more than a cottage is surrounded by the brightness of a flowergarden and the straw roofs of bees and the whole colony kirk and manse garden and graveyard finds harbourage in a grove of rowans and is all the year round in a great silence broken only by the drone of the bees the tinkle of the burn and the bell on sundays a mile beyond the kirk the road leaves the valley by a precipitous ascent and brings you a little after to the place of hermiston where it comes to an end in the backyard before the coachhouse all beyond and about is the great field of the hills the plover the curlew and the lark cry there the wind blows as it blows in a ships rigging hard and cold and pure and the hilltops huddle one behind another like a herd of cattle into the sunset  the house was sixty years old unsightly comfortable a farmyard and a kitchengarden on the left with a fruit wall where little hard green pears came to their maturity about the end of october  the policy as who should say the park was of some extent but very ill reclaimed heather and moorfowl had crossed the boundary wall and spread and roosted within and it would have tasked a landscape gardener to say where policy ended and unpolicied nature began my lord had been led by the influence of mr sheriff scott into a considerable design of planting many acres were accordingly set out with fir and the little feathery besoms gave a false scale and lent a strange air of a toyshop to the moors a great rooty sweetness of bogs was in the air and at all seasons an infinite melancholy piping of hill birds standing so high and with so little shelter it was a cold exposed house splashed by showers drenched by continuous rains that made the gutters to spout beaten upon and buffeted by all the winds of heaven and the prospect would be often black with tempest and often white with the snows of winter but the house was wind and weather proof the hearths were kept bright and the rooms pleasant with live fires of peat and archie might sit of an evening and hear the squalls bugle on the moorland and watch the fire prosper in the earthy fuel and the smoke winding up the chimney and drink deep of the pleasures of shelter  solitary as the place was archie did not want neighbours every night if he chose he might go down to the manse and share a brewst of toddy with the ministera harebrained ancient gentleman long and light and still active though his knees were loosened with age and his voice broke continually in childish treblesand his lady wife a heavy comely dame without a word to say for herself beyond goodeven and goodday harumscarum clodpole young lairds of the neighbourhood paid him the compliment of a visit young hay of romanes rode down to call on his cropeared pony young pringle of drumanno came up on his bony grey hay remained on the hospitable field and must be carried to bed pringle got somehow to his saddle about 3 am and as archie stood with the lamp on the upper doorstep lurched uttered a senseless viewholloa and vanished out of the small circle of illumination like a wraith yet a minute or two longer the clatter of his breakneck flight was audible then it was cut off by the intervening steepness of the hill and again a great while after the renewed beating of phantom horsehoofs far in the valley of the hermiston showed that the horse at least if not his rider was still on the homeward way  there was a tuesday club at the crosskeys in crossmichael where the young bloods of the countryside congregated and drank deep on a percentage of the expense so that he was left gainer who should have drunk the most archie had no great mind to this diversion but he took it like a duty laid upon him went with a decent regularity did his manfullest with the liquor held up his head in the local jests and got home again and was able to put up his horse to the admiration of kirstie and the lass that helped her he dined at driffel supped at windielaws he went to the new years ball at huntsfield and was made welcome and thereafter rode to hounds with my lord muirfell upon whose name as that of a legitimate lord of parliament in a work so full of lords of session my pen should pause reverently yet the same fate attended him here as in edinburgh the habit of solitude tends to perpetuate itself and an austerity of which he was quite unconscious and a pride which seemed arrogance and perhaps was chiefly shyness discouraged and offended his new companions hay did not return more than twice pringle never at all and there came a time when archie even desisted from the tuesday club and became in all thingswhat he had had the name of almost from the firstthe recluse of hermiston highnosed miss pringle of drumanno and highstepping miss marshall of the mains were understood to have had a difference of opinion about him the day after the ballhe was none the wiser he could not suppose himself to be remarked by these entrancing ladies at the ball itself my lord muirfells daughter the lady flora spoke to him twice and the second time with a touch of appeal so that her colour rose and her voice trembled a little in his ear like a passing grace in music he stepped back with a heart on fire coldly and not ungracefully excused himself and a little after watched her dancing with young drumanno of the empty laugh and was harrowed at the sight and raged to himself that this was a world in which it was given to drumanno to please and to himself only to stand aside and envy he seemed excluded as of right from the favour of such societyseemed to extinguish mirth wherever he came and was quick to feel the wound and desist and retire into solitude if he had but understood the figure he presented and the impression he made on these bright eyes and tender hearts if he had but guessed that the recluse of hermiston young graceful well spoken but always cold stirred the maidens of the county with the charm of byronism when byronism was new it may be questioned whether his destiny might not even yet have been modified it may be questioned and i think it should be doubted it was in his horoscope to be parsimonious of pain to himself or of the chance of pain even to the avoidance of any opportunity of pleasure to have a roman sense of duty an instinctive aristocracy of manners and taste to be the son of adam weir and jean rutherford     2 kirstie  kirstie was now over fifty and might have sat to a sculptor long of limb and still light of foot deepbreasted robustloined her golden hair not yet mingled with any trace of silver the years had but caressed and embellished her by the lines of a rich and vigorous maternity she seemed destined to be the bride of heroes and the mother of their children and behold by the iniquity of fate she had passed through her youth alone and drew near to the confines of age a childless woman the tender ambitions that she had received at birth had been by time and disappointment diverted into a certain barren zeal of industry and fury of interference she carried her thwarted ardours into housework she washed floors with her empty heart if she could not win the love of one with love she must dominate all by her temper hasty wordy and wrathful she had a drawn quarrel with most of her neighbours and with the others not much more than armed neutrality the grieves wife had been sneisty the sister of the gardener who kept house for him had shown herself upsitten and she wrote to lord hermiston about once a year demanding the discharge of the offenders and justifying the demand by much wealth of detail for it must not be supposed that the quarrel rested with the wife and did not take in the husband alsoor with the gardeners sister and did not speedily include the gardener himself as the upshot of all this petty quarrelling and intemperate speech she was practically excluded like a lightkeeper on his tower from the comforts of human association except with her own indoor drudge who being but a lassie and entirely at her mercy must submit to the shifty weather of the mistresss moods without complaint and be willing to take buffets or caresses according to the temper of the hour to kirstie thus situate and in the indian summer of her heart which was slow to submit to age the gods sent this equivocal good thing of archies presence she had known him in the cradle and paddled him when he misbehaved and yet as she had not so much as set eyes on him since he was eleven and had his last serious illness the tall slender refined and rather melancholy young gentleman of twenty came upon her with the shock of a new acquaintance he was young hermiston the laird himsel he had an air of distinctive superiority a cold straight glance of his black eyes that abashed the womans tantrums in the beginning and therefore the possibility of any quarrel was excluded he was new and therefore immediately aroused her curiosity he was reticent and kept it awake and lastly he was dark and she fair and he was male and she female the everlasting fountains of interest  her feeling partook of the loyalty of a clanswoman the heroworship of a maiden aunt and the idolatry due to a god no matter what he had asked of her ridiculous or tragic she would have done it and joyed to do it her passion for it was nothing less entirely filled her it was a rich physical pleasure to make his bed or light his lamp for him when he was absent to pull off his wet boots or wait on him at dinner when he returned a young man who should have so doted on the idea moral and physical of any woman might be properly described as being in love head and heels and would have behaved himself accordingly but kirstiethough her heart leaped at his coming footstepsthough when he patted her shoulder her face brightened for the dayhad not a hope or thought beyond the present moment and its perpetuation to the end of time till the end of time she would have had nothing altered but still continue delightedly to serve her idol and be repaid say twice in the month with a clap on the shoulder  i have said her heart leapedit is the accepted phrase but rather when she was alone in any chamber of the house and heard his foot passing on the corridors something in her bosom rose slowly until her breath was suspended and as slowly fell again with a deep sigh when the steps had passed and she was disappointed of her eyes desire this perpetual hunger and thirst of his presence kept her all day on the alert when he went forth at morning she would stand and follow him with admiring looks as it grew late and drew to the time of his return she would steal forth to a corner of the policy wall and be seen standing there sometimes by the hour together gazing with shaded eyes waiting the exquisite and barren pleasure of his view a mile off on the mountains when at night she had trimmed and gathered the fire turned down his bed and laid out his nightgearwhen there was no more to be done for the kings pleasure but to remember him fervently in her usually very tepid prayers and go to bed brooding upon his perfections his future career and what she should give him the next day for dinnerthere still remained before her one more opportunity she was still to take in the tray and say goodnight sometimes archie would glance up from his book with a preoccupied nod and a perfunctory salutation which was in truth a dismissal sometimesand by degrees more oftenthe volume would be laid aside he would meet her coming with a look of relief and the conversation would be engaged last out the supper and be prolonged till the small hours by the waning fire it was no wonder that archie was fond of company after his solitary days and kirstie upon her side exerted all the arts of her vigorous nature to ensnare his attention she would keep back some piece of news during dinner to be fired off with the entrance of the supper tray and form as it were the lever de rideau of the evenings entertainment once he had heard her tongue wag she made sure of the result from one subject to another she moved by insidious transitions fearing the least silence fearing almost to give him time for an answer lest it should slip into a hint of separation like so many people of her class she was a brave narrator her place was on the hearthrug and she made it a rostrum miming her stories as she told them fitting them with vital detail spinning them out with endless quo hes and quo shes her voice sinking into a whisper over the supernatural or the horrific until she would suddenly spring up in affected surprise and pointing to the clock mercy mr archie she would say whatten a time o night is this of it god forgive me for a daft wife so it befell by good management that she was not only the first to begin these nocturnal conversations but invariably the first to break them off so she managed to retire and not to be dismissed     3 a border family  such an unequal intimacy has never been uncommon in scotland where the clan spirit survives where the servant tends to spend her life in the same service a helpmeet at first then a tyrant and at last a pensioner where besides she is not necessarily destitute of the pride of birth but is perhaps like kirstie a connection of her masters and at least knows the legend of her own family and may count kinship with some illustrious dead for that is the mark of the scot of all classes that he stands in an attitude towards the past unthinkable to englishmen and remembers and cherishes the memory of his forebears good or bad and there burns alive in him a sense of identity with the dead even to the twentieth generation no more characteristic instance could be found than in the family of kirstie elliott they were all and kirstie the first of all ready and eager to pour forth the particulars of their genealogy embellished with every detail that memory had handed down or fancy fabricated and behold from every ramification of that tree there dangled a halter the elliotts themselves have had a chequered history but these elliotts deduced besides from three of the most unfortunate of the border clansthe nicksons the ellwalds and the crozers one ancestor after another might be seen appearing a moment out of the rain and the hill mist upon his furtive business speeding home perhaps with a paltry booty of lame horses and lean kine or squealing and dealing death in some moorland feud of the ferrets and the wild cats one after another closed his obscure adventures in midair triced up to the arm of the royal gibbet or the barons duletree for the rusty blunderbuss of scots criminal justice which usually hurt nobody but jurymen became a weapon of precision for the nicksons the ellwalds and the crozers the exhilaration of their exploits seemed to haunt the memories of their descendants alone and the shame to be forgotten pride glowed in their bosoms to publish their relationship to andrew ellwald of the laverockstanes called unchancy dand who was justifeed wi seeven mair of the same name at jeddart in the days of king james the sax in all this tissue of crime and misfortune the elliotts of cauldstaneslap had one boast which must appear legitimate the males were gallowsbirds born outlaws petty thieves and deadly brawlers but according to the same tradition the females were all chaste and faithful the power of ancestry on the character is not limited to the inheritance of cells if i buy ancestors by the gross from the benevolence of lyon king of arms my grandson if he is scottish will feel a quickening emulation of their deeds the men of the elliotts were proud lawless violent as of right cherishing and prolonging a tradition in like manner with the women and the woman essentially passionate and reckless who crouched on the rug in the shine of the peat fire telling these tales had cherished through life a wild integrity of virtue  her father gilbert had been deeply pious a savage disciplinarian in the antique style and withal a notorious smuggler i mind when i was a bairn getting mony a skelp and being shood to bed like poutry she would say that would be when the lads and their bit kegs were on the road weve had the riffraff of twothree counties in our kitchen monys the time betwix the twelve and the three and their lanterns would be standing in the forecourt ay a score o them at once but there was nae ungodly talk permitted at cauldstaneslap my faither was a consistent man in walk and conversation just let slip an aith and there was the door to ye he had that zeal for the lord it was a fair wonder to hear him pray but the faimly has aye had a gift that way this father was twice married once to a dark woman of the old ellwald stock by whom he had gilbert presently of cauldstaneslap and secondly to the mother of kirstie he was an auld man when he married her a fell auld man wi a muckle voiceyou could hear him rowting from the top o the kyeskairs she said but for her it appears she was a perfit wonder it was gentle blood she had mr archie for it was your ain the countryside gaed gyte about her and her gowden hair mines is no to be mentioned wi it and theres few weemen has mair hair than what i have or yet a bonnier colour often would i tell my dear miss jeanniethat was your mother dear she was cruel taen up about her hair it was unco tender ye seehoots miss jeannie i would say just fling your washes and your french dentifrishes in the back o the fire for thats the place for them and awa down to a burn side and wash yersel in cauld hill water and dry your bonny hair in the caller wind o the muirs the way that my mother aye washed hers and that i have aye made it a practice to have wishen minesjust you do what i tell ye my dear and yell give me news of it yell have hair and routh of hair a pigtail as thicks my arm i said and the bonniest colour like the clear gowden guineas so as the lads in kirkll no can keep their eyes off it weel it lasted out her time puir thing i cuttit a lock of it upon her corp that was lying there sae cauld ill show it ye some of thir days if yere good but as i was sayin my mither  on the death of the father there remained goldenhaired kirstie who took service with her distant kinsfolk the rutherfords and blackavised gilbert twenty years older who farmed the cauldstaneslap married and begot four sons between 1773 and 1784 and a daughter like a postscript in 97 the year of camperdown and cape st vincent it seemed it was a tradition in the family to wind up with a belated girl in 1804 at the age of sixty gilbert met an end that might be called heroic he was due home from market any time from eight at night till five in the morning and in any condition from the quarrelsome to the speechless for he maintained to that age the goodly customs of the scots farmer it was known on this occasion that he had a good bit of money to bring home the word had gone round loosely the laird had shown his guineas and if anybody had but noticed it there was an illlooking vagabond crew the scum of edinburgh that drew out of the market long ere it was dusk and took the hillroad by hermiston where it was not to be believed that they had lawful business one of the countryside one dickieson they took with them to be their guide and dear he paid for it of a sudden in the ford of the broken dykes this vermin clan fell on the laird six to one and him three parts asleep having drunk hard but it is ill to catch an elliott for a while in the night and the black water that was deep as to his saddlegirths he wrought with his staff like a smith at his stithy and great was the sound of oaths and blows with that the ambuscade was burst and he rode for home with a pistolball in him three knife wounds the loss of his front teeth a broken rib and bridle and a dying horse that was a race with death that the laird rode in the mirk night with his broken bridle and his head swimming he dug his spurs to the rowels in the horses side and the horse that was even worse off than himself the poor creature screamed out like a person as he went so that the hills echoed with it and the folks at cauldstaneslap got to their feet about the table and looked at each other with white faces the horse fell dead at the yard gate the laird won the length of the house and fell there on the threshold to the son that raised him he gave the bag of money hae said he all the way up the thieves had seemed to him to be at his heels but now the hallucination left himhe saw them again in the place of the ambuscadeand the thirst of vengeance seized on his dying mind raising himself and pointing with an imperious finger into the black night from which he had come he uttered the single command brocken dykes and fainted he had never been loved but he had been feared in honour at that sight at that word gasped out at them from a toothless and bleeding mouth the old elliott spirit awoke with a shout in the four sons wanting the hat continues my author kirstie whom i but haltingly follow for she told this tale like one inspired wanting guns for there wasna twa grains o pouder in the house wi nae mair weepons than their sticks into their hands the fower o them took the road only hob and that was the eldest hunkered at the doorsill where the blood had rin fyled his hand wi it and haddit it up to heeven in the way o the auld border aith hell shall have her ain again this nicht he raired and rode forth upon his earrand it was three miles to broken dykes down hill and a sore road kirstie had seen men from edinburgh dismounting there in plain day to lead their horses but the four brothers rode it as if auld hornie were behind and heaven in front come to the ford and there was dickieson by all tales he was not dead but breathed and reared upon his elbow and cried out to them for help it was at a graceless face that he asked mercy as soon as hob saw by the glint of the lantern the eyes shining and the whiteness of the teeth in the mans face damn you says he ye hae your teeth hae ye and rode his horse to and fro upon that human remnant beyond that dandie must dismount with the lantern to be their guide he was the youngest son scarce twenty at the time a nicht long they gaed in the wet heath and jennipers and whaur they gaed they neither knew nor cared but just followed the bluidstains and the footprints o their faithers murderers and a nicht dandie had his nose to the grund like a tyke and the ithers followed and spak naething neither black nor white there was nae noise to be heard but just the sough of the swalled burns and hob the dour yin risping his teeth as he gaed with the first glint of the morning they saw they were on the droveroad and at that the four stopped and had a dram to their breakfasts for they knew that dand must have guided them right and the rogues could be but little ahead hot foot for edinburgh by the way of the pentland hills by eight oclock they had word of thema shepherd had seen four men uncoly mishandled go by in the last hour thats yin a piece says clem and swung his cudgel five o them says hob gods death but the faither was a man and him drunk and then there befell them what my author termed a sair misbegowk for they were overtaken by a posse of mounted neighbours come to aid in the pursuit four sour faces looked on the reinforcement the deils broughten you said clem and they rode thenceforward in the rear of the party with hanging heads before ten they had found and secured the rogues and by three of the afternoon as they rode up the vennel with their prisoners they were aware of a concourse of people bearing in their midst something that dripped for the boady of the saxt pursued kirstie wi his head smashed like a hazelnit had been a that nicht in the chairge o hermiston water and it dunting in on the stanes and grunding it on the shallows and flinging the deid thing heelsowerhurdie at the fas o spango and in the first o the day tweed had got a hold o him and carried him off like a wind for it was uncoly swalled and raced wi him bobbing under braesides and was long playing with the creature in the drumlie lynns under the castle and at the hinder end of all cuist him up on the sterling of crossmichael brig sae there they were athegither at last for dickieson had been brought in on a cart long syne and folk could see what mainner o man my brither had been that had held his head again sax and saved the siller and him drunk thus died of honourable injuries and in the savour of fame gilbert elliott of the cauldstaneslap but his sons had scarce less glory out of the business their savage haste the skill with which dand had found and followed the trail the barbarity to the wounded dickieson which was like an open secret in the county and the doom which it was currently supposed they had intended for the others struck and stirred popular imagination some century earlier the last of the minstrels might have fashioned the last of the ballads out of that homeric fight and chase but the spirit was dead or had been reincarnated already in mr sheriff scott and the degenerate moorsmen must be content to tell the tale in prose and to make of the four black brothers a unit after the fashion of the twelve apostles or the three musketeers  robert gilbert clement and andrewin the proper border diminutives hob gib clem and dand elliottthese ballad heroes had much in common in particular their high sense of the family and the family honour but they went diverse ways and prospered and failed in different businesses according to kirstie they had a bees in their bonnets but hob hob the laird was indeed essentially a decent man an elder of the kirk nobody had heard an oath upon his lips save perhaps thrice or so at the sheepwashing since the chase of his fathers murderers the figure he had shown on that eventful night disappeared as if swallowed by a trap he who had ecstatically dipped his hand in the red blood he who had ridden down dickieson became from that moment on a stiff and rather graceless model of the rustic proprieties cannily profiting by the high war prices and yearly stowing away a little nestegg in the bank against calamity approved of and sometimes consulted by the greater lairds for the massive and placid sense of what he said when he could be induced to say anything and particularly valued by the minister mr torrance as a righthand man in the parish and a model to parents the transfiguration had been for the moment only some barbarossa some old adam of our ancestors sleeps in all of us till the fit circumstance shall call it into action and for as sober as he now seemed hob had given once for all the measure of the devil that haunted him he was married and by reason of the effulgence of that legendary night was adored by his wife he had a mob of little lusty barefoot children who marched in a caravan the long miles to school the stages of whose pilgrimage were marked by acts of spoliation and mischief and who were qualified in the countryside as fair pests but in the house if faither was in they were quiet as mice in short hob moved through life in a great peacethe reward of any one who shall have killed his man with any formidable and figurative circumstance in the midst of a country gagged and swaddled with civilisation  it was a current remark that the elliotts were guid and bad like sanguishes and certainly there was a curious distinction the men of business coming alternately with the dreamers the second brother gib was a weaver by trade had gone out early into the world to edinburgh and come home again with his wings singed there was an exaltation in his nature which had led him to embrace with enthusiasm the principles of the french revolution and had ended by bringing him under the hawse of my lord hermiston in that furious onslaught of his upon the liberals which sent muir and palmer into exile and dashed the party into chaff it was whispered that my lord in his great scorn for the movement and prevailed upon a little by a sense of neighbourliness had given gib a hint meeting him one day in the potterrow my lord had stopped in front of him gib ye eediot he had said whats this i hear of you poalitics poalitics poalitics weavers poalitics is the way of it i hear if ye arena athegither dozened with eediocy yell gang your ways back to cauldstaneslap and ca your loom and ca your loom man and gilbert had taken him at the word and returned with an expedition almost to be called flight to the house of his father the clearest of his inheritance was that family gift of prayer of which kirstie had boasted and the baffled politician now turned his attention to religious mattersor as others said to heresy and schism every sunday morning he was in crossmichael where he had gathered together one by one a sect of about a dozen persons who called themselves gods remnant of the true faithful or for short gods remnant to the profane they were known as gibs deils bailie sweedie a noted humorist in the town vowed that the proceedings always opened to the tune of the deil fly away with the exciseman and that the sacrament was dispensed in the form of hot whiskytoddy both wicked hits at the evangelist who had been suspected of smuggling in his youth and had been overtaken as the phrase went on the streets of crossmichael one fair day it was known that every sunday they prayed for a blessing on the arms of buonaparte for this gods remnant as they were skailing from the cottage that did duty for a temple had been repeatedly stoned by the bairns and gib himself hooted by a squadron of border volunteers in which his own brother dand rode in a uniform and with a drawn sword the remnant were believed besides to be antinomian in principle which might otherwise have been a serious charge but the way public opinion then blew it was quite swallowed up and forgotten in the scandal about buonaparte for the rest gilbert had set up his loom in an outhouse at cauldstaneslap where he laboured assiduously six days of the week his brothers appalled by his political opinions and willing to avoid dissension in the household spoke but little to him he less to them remaining absorbed in the study of the bible and almost constant prayer the gaunt weaver was drynurse at cauldstaneslap and the bairns loved him dearly except when he was carrying an infant in his arms he was rarely seen to smileas indeed there were few smilers in that family when his sisterinlaw rallied him and proposed that he should get a wife and bairns of his own since he was so fond of them i have no clearness of mind upon that point he would reply if nobody called him in to dinner he stayed out mrs hob a hard unsympathetic woman once tried the experiment he went without food all day but at dusk as the light began to fail him he came into the house of his own accord looking puzzled ive had a great gale of prayer upon my speerit said he i canna mind sae muckles what i had for denner the creed of gods remnant was justified in the life of its founder and yet i dinna ken said kirstie hes maybe no more stockfish than his neeghbours he rode wi the rest o them and had a good stamach to the work by a that i hear gods remnant the deils clavers there wasna muckle christianity in the way hob guided johnny dickieson at the least of it but guid kens is he a christian even he might be a mahommedan or a deevil or a fireworshipper for what i ken  the third brother had his name on a doorplate no less in the city of glasgow mr clement elliott as long as your arm in this case that spirit of innovation which had shown itself timidly in the case of hob by the admission of new manures and which had run to waste with gilbert in subversive politics and heretical religions bore useful fruit in many ingenious mechanical improvements in boyhood from his addiction to strange devices of sticks and string he had been counted the most eccentric of the family but that was all by now and he was a partner of his firm and looked to die a bailie he too had married and was rearing a plentiful family in the smoke and din of glasgow he was wealthy and could have bought out his brother the cocklaird six times over it was whispered and when he slipped away to cauldstaneslap for a wellearned holiday which he did as often as he was able he astonished the neighbours with his broadcloth his beaver hat and the ample plies of his neckcloth though an eminently solid man at bottom after the pattern of hob he had contracted a certain glasgow briskness and aplomb which set him off all the other elliotts were as lean as a rake but clement was laying on fat and he panted sorely when he must get into his boots dand said chuckling ay clem has the elements of a corporation a provost and corporation returned clem and his readiness was much admired  the fourth brother dand was a shepherd to his trade and by starts when he could bring his mind to it excelled in the business nobody could train a dog like dandie nobody through the peril of great storms in the winter time could do more gallantly but if his dexterity were exquisite his diligence was but fitful and he served his brother for bed and board and a trifle of pocketmoney when he asked for it he loved money well enough knew very well how to spend it and could make a shrewd bargain when he liked but he preferred a vague knowledge that he was well to windward to any counted coins in the pocket he felt himself richer so hob would expostulate im an amature herd dand would reply ill keep your sheep to you when im so minded but ill keep my liberty too thirs no man can coandescend on what im worth clem would expound to him the miraculous results of compound interest and recommend investments ay man dand would say and do you think if i took hobs siller that i wouldna drink it or wear it on the lassies and anyway my kingdom is no of this world either im a poet or else im nothing clem would remind him of old age ill die young like robbie burns he would say stoutly no question but he had a certain accomplishment in minor verse his hermiston burn with its pretty refrain    i love to gang thinking whaur ye gang linking         hermiston burn in the howe  his auld auld elliotts claycauld elliotts dour bauld elliotts of auld and his really fascinating piece about the praying weavers stone had gained him in the neighbourhood the reputation still possible in scotland of a local bard and though not printed himself he was recognised by others who were and who had become famous walter scott owed to dandie the text of the raid of wearie in the minstrelsy and made him welcome at his house and appreciated his talents such as they were with all his usual generosity the ettrick shepherd was his sworn crony they would meet drink to excess roar out their lyrics in each others faces and quarrel and make it up again till bedtime and besides these recognitions almost to be called official dandie was made welcome for the sake of his gift through the farmhouses of several contiguous dales and was thus exposed to manifold temptations which he rather sought than fled he had figured on the stool of repentance for once fulfilling to the letter the tradition of his hero and model his humorous verses to mr torrance on that occasionkenspeckle here my lane i standunfortunately too indelicate for further citation ran through the country like a fiery cross they were recited quoted paraphrased and laughed over as far away as dumfries on the one hand and dunbar on the other  these four brothers were united by a close bond the bond of that mutual admirationor rather mutual heroworshipwhich is so strong among the members of secluded families who have much ability and little culture even the extremes admired each other hob who had as much poetry as the tongs professed to find pleasure in dands verses clem who had no more religion than claverhouse nourished a heartfelt at least an openmouthed admiration of gibs prayers and dandie followed with relish the rise of clems fortunes indulgence followed hard on the heels of admiration the laird clem and dand who were tories and patriots of the hottest quality excused to themselves with a certain bashfulness the radical and revolutionary heresies of gib by another division of the family the laird clem and gib who were men exactly virtuous swallowed the dose of dands irregularities as a kind of clog or drawback in the mysterious providence of god affixed to bards and distinctly probative of poetical genius to appreciate the simplicity of their mutual admiration it was necessary to hear clem arrived upon one of his visits and dealing in a spirit of continuous irony with the affairs and personalities of that great city of glasgow where he lived and transacted business the various personages ministers of the church municipal officers mercantile bigwigs whom he had occasion to introduce were all alike denigrated all served but as reflectors to cast back a flattering sidelight on the house of cauldstaneslap the provost for whom clem by exception entertained a measure of respect he would liken to hob he minds me o the laird there he would say he has some of hobs grand whunstane sense and the same way with him of steiking his mouth when hes no very pleased and hob all unconscious would draw down his upper lip and produce as if for comparison the formidable grimace referred to the unsatisfactory incumbent of st enochs kirk was thus briefly dismissed if he had but twa fingers o gibs he would waken them up and gib honest man would look down and secretly smile clem was a spy whom they had sent out into the world of men he had come back with the good news that there was nobody to compare with the four black brothers no position that they would not adorn no official that it would not be well they should replace no interest of mankind secular or spiritual which would not immediately bloom under their supervision the excuse of their folly is in two words scarce the breadth of a hair divided them from the peasantry the measure of their sense is this that these symposia of rustic vanity were kept entirely within the family like some secret ancestral practice to the world their serious faces were never deformed by the suspicion of any simper of selfcontentment yet it was known they hae a guid pride o themsels was the word in the countryside  lastly in a border story there should be added their twonames hob was the laird roy ne puis prince ne daigne he was the laird of cauldstaneslapsay fifty acresipsissimus clement was mr elliott as upon his doorplate the earlier dafty having been discarded as no longer applicable and indeed only a reminder of misjudgment and the imbecility of the public and the youngest in honour of his perpetual wanderings was known by the sobriquet of randy dand  it will be understood that not all this information was communicated by the aunt who had too much of the family failing herself to appreciate it thoroughly in others but as time went on archie began to observe an omission in the family chronicle  is there not a girl too he asked  ay kirstie she was named for me or my grandmother at leastits the same thing returned the aunt and went on again about dand whom she secretly preferred by reason of his gallantries  but what is your niece like said archie at the next opportunity  her as blacks your hat but i dinna suppose she would maybe be what you would ca illlooked athegither na shes a kind of a handsome jauda kind o gipsy said the aunt who had two sets of scales for men and womenor perhaps it would be more fair to say that she had three and the third and the most loaded was for girls  how comes it that i never see her in church said archie  deed and i believe shes in glesgie with clem and his wife a heap good shes like to get of it i dinna say for men folk but where weemen folk are born there let them bide glory to god i was never farer from here than crossmichael  in the meanwhile it began to strike archie as strange that while she thus sang the praises of her kinsfolk and manifestly relished their virtues and i may say their vices like a thing creditable to herself there should appear not the least sign of cordiality between the house of hermiston and that of cauldstaneslap going to church of a sunday as the lady housekeeper stepped with her skirts kilted three tucks of her white petticoat showing below and her best india shawl upon her back if the day were fine in a pattern of radiant dyes she would sometimes overtake her relatives preceding her more leisurely in the same direction gib of course was absent by skreigh of day he had been gone to crossmichael and his fellowheretics but the rest of the family would be seen marching in open order hob and dand stiffnecked straightbacked sixfooters with severe dark faces and their plaids about their shoulders the convoy of children scattering in a state of high polish on the wayside and every now and again collected by the shrill summons of the mother and the mother herself by a suggestive circumstance which might have afforded matter of thought to a more experienced observer than archie wrapped in a shawl nearly identical with kirsties but a thought more gaudy and conspicuously newer at the sight kirstie grew more tallkirstie showed her classical profile nose in air and nostril spread the pure blood came in her cheek evenly in a delicate living pink  a braw day to ye mistress elliott said she and hostility and gentility were nicely mingled in her tones a fine day mem the lairds wife would reply with a miraculous curtsey spreading the while her plumagesetting off in other words and with arts unknown to the mere man the pattern of her india shawl behind her the whole cauldstaneslap contingent marched in closer order and with an indescribable air of being in the presence of the foe and while dandie saluted his aunt with a certain familiarity as of one who was well in court hob marched on in awful immobility there appeared upon the face of this attitude in the family the consequences of some dreadful feud presumably the two women had been principals in the original encounter and the laird had probably been drawn into the quarrel by the ears too late to be included in the present skindeep reconciliation  kirstie said archie one day what is this you have against your family  i dinna complean said kirstie with a flush i say naething  i see you do notnot even goodday to your own nephew said he  i hae naething to be ashamed of said she i can say the lords prayer with a good grace if hob was ill or in preeson or poverty i would see to him blithely but for curtchying and complimenting and colloguing thank ye kindly  archie had a bit of a smile he leaned back in his chair i think you and mrs robert are not very good friends says he slily when you have your india shawls on  she looked upon him in silence with a sparkling eye but an indecipherable expression and that was all that archie was ever destined to learn of the battle of the india shawls  do none of them ever come here to see you he inquired  mr archie said she i hope that i ken my place better it would be a queer thing i think if i was to clamjamfry up your faithers housethat i should say itwi a dirty blackavised clan no ane o them it was worth while to mar soap upon but just mysel na theyre all damnifeed wi the black ellwalds i have nae patience wi black folk then with a sudden consciousness of the case of archie no that it maitters for men sae muckle she made haste to add but theres naebody can deny that its unwomanly long hair is the ornament o woman ony way weve good warrandise for thatits in the bibleand wha can doubt that the apostle had some gowdenhaired lassie in his mindapostle and all for what was he but just a man like yersel     chapter vi  a leaf from christinas psalmbook   archie was sedulous at church sunday after sunday he sat down and stood up with that small company heard the voice of mr torrance leaping like an illplayed clarionet from key to key and had an opportunity to study his motheaten gown and the black thread mittens that he joined together in prayer and lifted up with a reverent solemnity in the act of benediction hermiston pew was a little square box dwarfish in proportion with the kirk itself and enclosing a table not much bigger than a footstool there sat archie an apparent prince the only undeniable gentleman and the only great heritor in the parish taking his ease in the only pew for no other in the kirk had doors thence he might command an undisturbed view of that congregation of solid plaided men strapping wives and daughters oppressed children and uneasy sheepdogs it was strange how archie missed the look of race except the dogs with their refined foxy faces and inimitably curling tails there was no one present with the least claim to gentility the cauldstaneslap party was scarcely an exception dandie perhaps as he amused himself making verses through the interminable burden of the service stood out a little by the glow in his eye and a certain superior animation of face and alertness of body but even dandie slouched like a rustic the rest of the congregation like so many sheep oppressed him with a sense of hobnailed routine day following dayof physical labour in the open air oatmeal porridge peas bannock the somnolent fireside in the evening and the nightlong nasal slumbers in a boxbed yet he knew many of them to be shrewd and humorous men of character notable women making a bustle in the world and radiating an influence from their lowbrowed doors he knew besides they were like other men below the crust of custom rapture found a way he had heard them beat the timbrel before bacchushad heard them shout and carouse over their whiskytoddy and not the most dutchbottomed and severe faces among them all not even the solemn elders themselves but were capable of singular gambols at the voice of love men drawing near to an end of lifes adventurous journeymaids thrilling with fear and curiosity on the threshold of entrancewomen who had borne and perhaps buried children who could remember the clinging of the small dead hands and the patter of the little feet now silenthe marvelled that among all those faces there should be no face of expectation none that was mobile none into which the rhythm and poetry of life had entered o for a live face he thought and at times he had a memory of lady flora and at times he would study the living gallery before him with despair and would see himself go on to waste his days in that joyless pastoral place and death come to him and his grave be dug under the rowans and the spirit of the earth laugh out in a thunderpeal at the huge fiasco  on this particular sunday there was no doubt but that the spring had come at last it was warm with a latent shiver in the air that made the warmth only the more welcome the shallows of the stream glittered and tinkled among bunches of primrose vagrant scents of the earth arrested archie by the way with moments of ethereal intoxication the grey quakerish dale was still only awakened in places and patches from the sobriety of its winter colouring and he wondered at its beauty an essential beauty of the old earth it seemed to him not resident in particulars but breathing to him from the whole he surprised himself by a sudden impulse to write poetryhe did so sometimes loose galloping octosyllabics in the vein of scottand when he had taken his place on a boulder near some fairy falls and shaded by a whip of a tree that was already radiant with new leaves it still more surprised him that he should find nothing to write his heart perhaps beat in time to some vast indwelling rhythm of the universe by the time he came to a corner of the valley and could see the kirk he had so lingered by the way that the first psalm was finishing the nasal psalmody full of turns and trills and graceless graces seemed the essential voice of the kirk itself upraised in thanksgiving everythings alive he said and again cries it aloud thank god everythings alive he lingered yet a while in the kirkyard a tuft of primroses was blooming hard by the leg of an old black table tombstone and he stopped to contemplate the random apologue they stood forth on the cold earth with a trenchancy of contrast and he was struck with a sense of incompleteness in the day the season and the beauty that surrounded himthe chill there was in the warmth the gross black clods about the opening primroses the damp earthy smell that was everywhere intermingled with the scents the voice of the aged torrance within rose in an ecstasy and he wondered if torrance also felt in his old bones the joyous influence of the spring morning torrance or the shadow of what once was torrance that must come so soon to lie outside here in the sun and rain with all his rheumatisms while a new minister stood in his room and thundered from his own familiar pulpit the pity of it and something of the chill of the grave shook him for a moment as he made haste to enter  he went up the aisle reverently and took his place in the pew with lowered eyes for he feared he had already offended the kind old gentleman in the pulpit and was sedulous to offend no further he could not follow the prayer not even the heads of it brightnesses of azure clouds of fragrance a tinkle of falling water and singing birds rose like exhalations from some deeper aboriginal memory that was not his but belonged to the flesh on his bones his body remembered and it seemed to him that his body was in no way gross but ethereal and perishable like a strain of music and he felt for it an exquisite tenderness as for a child an innocent full of beautiful instincts and destined to an early death and he felt for old torranceof the many supplications of the few daysa pity that was near to tears the prayer ended right over him was a tablet in the wall the only ornament in the roughly masoned chapelfor it was no more the tablet commemorated i was about to say the virtues but rather the existence of a former rutherford of hermiston and archie under that trophy of his long descent and local greatness leaned back in the pew and contemplated vacancy with the shadow of a smile between playful and sad that became him strangely dandies sister sitting by the side of clem in her new glasgow finery chose that moment to observe the young laird aware of the stir of his entrance the little formalist had kept her eyes fastened and her face prettily composed during the prayer it was not hypocrisy there was no one further from a hypocrite the girl had been taught to behave to look up to look down to look unconscious to look seriously impressed in church and in every conjuncture to look her best that was the game of female life and she played it frankly archie was the one person in church who was of interest who was somebody new reputed eccentric known to be young and a laird and still unseen by christina small wonder that as she stood there in her attitude of pretty decency her mind should run upon him if he spared a glance in her direction he should know she was a wellbehaved young lady who had been to glasgow in reason he must admire her clothes and it was possible that he should think her pretty at that her heart beat the least thing in the world and she proceeded by way of a corrective to call up and dismiss a series of fancied pictures of the young man who should now by rights be looking at her she settled on the plainest of thema pink short young man with a dish face and no figure at whose admiration she could afford to smile but for all that the consciousness of his gaze which was really fixed on torrance and his mittens kept her in something of a flutter till the word amen even then she was far too wellbred to gratify her curiosity with any impatience she resumed her seat languidlythis was a glasgow touchshe composed her dress rearranged her nosegay of primroses looked first in front then behind upon the other side and at last allowed her eyes to move without hurry in the direction of the hermiston pew for a moment they were riveted next she had plucked her gaze home again like a tame bird who should have meditated flight possibilities crowded on her she hung over the future and grew dizzy the image of this young man slim graceful dark with the inscrutable halfsmile attracted and repelled her like a chasm i wonder will i have met my fate she thought and her heart swelled  torrance was got some way into his first exposition positing a deep layer of texts as he went along laying the foundations of his discourse which was to deal with a nice point in divinity before archie suffered his eyes to wander they fell first of all on clem looking insupportably prosperous and patronising torrance with the favour of a modified attention as of one who was used to better things in glasgow though he had never before set eyes on him archie had no difficulty in identifying him and no hesitation in pronouncing him vulgar the worst of the family clem was leaning lazily forward when archie first saw him presently he leaned nonchalantly back and that deadly instrument the maiden was suddenly unmasked in profile though not quite in the front of the fashion had anybody cared certain artful glasgow mantuamakers and her own inherent taste had arrayed her to great advantage her accoutrement was indeed a cause of heartburning and almost of scandal in that infinitesimal kirk company mrs hob had said her say at cauldstaneslap daftlike she had pronounced it a jaiket thatll no meet whaurs the sense of a jaiket thatll no button upon you if it should come to be weet what do ye ca thir things demmy brokens dye say theyll be brokens wi a vengeance or ye can win back weel i have naething to do wi itits no good taste clem whose purse had thus metamorphosed his sister and who was not insensible to the advertisement had come to the rescue with a hoot woman what do you ken of good taste that has never been to the ceety and hob looking on the girl with pleased smiles as she timidly displayed her finery in the midst of the dark kitchen had thus ended the dispute the cutty looks weel he had said and its no very like rain wear them the day hizzie but its no a thing to make a practice o in the breasts of her rivals coming to the kirk very conscious of white underlinen and their faces splendid with much soap the sight of the toilet had raised a storm of varying emotion from the mere unenvious admiration that was expressed in a longdrawn eh to the angrier feeling that found vent in an emphatic set her up her frock was of strawcoloured jaconet muslin cut low at the bosom and short at the ankle so as to display her demibroquins of regency violet crossing with many straps upon a yellow cobweb stocking according to the pretty fashion in which our grandmothers did not hesitate to appear and our greataunts went forth armed for the pursuit and capture of our greatuncles the dress was drawn up so as to mould the contour of both breasts and in the nook between a cairngorm brooch maintained it here too surely in a very enviable position trembled the nosegay of primroses she wore on her shouldersor rather on her back and not her shoulders which it scarcely passeda french coat of sarsenet tied in front with margate braces and of the same colour with her violet shoes about her face clustered a disorder of dark ringlets a little garland of yellow french roses surmounted her brow and the whole was crowned by a village hat of chipped straw amongst all the rosy and all the weathered faces that surrounded her in church she glowed like an open flowergirl and raiment and the cairngorm that caught the daylight and returned it in a fiery flash and the threads of bronze and gold that played in her hair  archie was attracted by the bright thing like a child he looked at her again and yet again and their looks crossed the lip was lifted from her little teeth he saw the red blood work vividly under her tawny skin her eye which was great as a stags struck and held his gaze he knew who she must bekirstie she of the harsh diminutive his housekeepers niece the sister of the rustic prophet giband he found in her the answer to his wishes  christina felt the shock of their encountering glances and seemed to rise clothed in smiles into a region of the vague and bright but the gratification was not more exquisite than it was brief she looked away abruptly and immediately began to blame herself for that abruptness she knew what she should have done too lateturned slowly with her nose in the air and meantime his look was not removed but continued to play upon her like a battery of cannon constantly aimed and now seemed to isolate her alone with him and now seemed to uplift her as on a pillory before the congregation for archie continued to drink her in with his eyes even as a wayfarer comes to a wellhead on a mountain and stoops his face and drinks with thirst unassuageable in the cleft of her little breasts the fiery eye of the topaz and the pale florets of primrose fascinated him he saw the breasts heave and the flowers shake with the heaving and marvelled what should so much discompose the girl and christina was conscious of his gazesaw it perhaps with the dainty plaything of an ear that peeped among her ringlets she was conscious of changing colour conscious of her unsteady breath like a creature tracked run down surrounded she sought in a dozen ways to give herself a countenance she used her handkerchiefit was a really fine onethen she desisted in a panic he would only think i was too warm she took to reading in the metrical psalms and then remembered it was sermontime last she put a sugarbool in her mouth and the next moment repented of the step it was such a homelylike thing mr archie would never be eating sweeties in kirk and with a palpable effort she swallowed it whole and her colour flamed high at this signal of distress archie awoke to a sense of his illbehaviour what had he been doing he had been exquisitely rude in church to the niece of his housekeeper he had stared like a lackey and a libertine at a beautiful and modest girl it was possible it was even likely he would be presented to her after service in the kirkyard and then how was he to look and there was no excuse he had marked the tokens of her shame of her increasing indignation and he was such a fool that he had not understood them shame bowed him down and he looked resolutely at mr torrance who little supposed good worthy man as he continued to expound justification by faith what was his true business to play the part of derivative to a pair of children at the old game of falling in love  christina was greatly relieved at first it seemed to her that she was clothed again she looked back on what had passed all would have been right if she had not blushed a silly fool there was nothing to blush at if she had taken a sugarbool mrs mactaggart the elders wife in st enochs took them often and if he had looked at her what was more natural than that a young gentleman should look at the bestdressed girl in church and at the same time she knew far otherwise she knew there was nothing casual or ordinary in the look and valued herself on its memory like a decoration well it was a blessing he had found something else to look at and presently she began to have other thoughts it was necessary she fancied that she should put herself right by a repetition of the incident better managed if the wish was father to the thought she did not know or she would not recognise it it was simply as a manoeuvre of propriety as something called for to lessen the significance of what had gone before that she should a second time meet his eyes and this time without blushing and at the memory of the blush she blushed again and became one general blush burning from head to foot was ever anything so indelicate so forward done by a girl before and here she was making an exhibition of herself before the congregation about nothing she stole a glance upon her neighbours and behold they were steadily indifferent and clem had gone to sleep and still the one idea was becoming more and more potent with her that in common prudence she must look again before the service ended something of the same sort was going forward in the mind of archie as he struggled with the load of penitence so it chanced that in the flutter of the moment when the last psalm was given out and torrance was reading the verse and the leaves of every psalmbook in church were rustling under busy fingers two stealthy glances were sent out like antennæ among the pews and on the indifferent and absorbed occupants and drew timidly nearer to the straight line between archie and christina they met they lingered together for the least fraction of time and that was enough a charge as of electricity passed through christina and behold the leaf of her psalmbook was torn across  archie was outside by the gate of the graveyard conversing with hob and the minister and shaking hands all round with the scattering congregation when clem and christina were brought up to be presented the laird took off his hat and bowed to her with grace and respect christina made her glasgow curtsey to the laird and went on again up the road for hermiston and cauldstaneslap walking fast breathing hurriedly with a heightened colour and in this strange frame of mind that when she was alone she seemed in high happiness and when any one addressed her she resented it like a contradiction a part of the way she had the company of some neighbour girls and a loutish young man never had they seemed so insipid never had she made herself so disagreeable but these struck aside to their various destinations or were outwalked and left behind and when she had driven off with sharp words the proffered convoy of some of her nephews and nieces she was free to go on alone up hermiston brae walking on air dwelling intoxicated among clouds of happiness near to the summit she heard steps behind her a mans steps light and very rapid she knew the foot at once and walked the faster if its me hes wanting he can run for it she thought smiling  archie overtook her like a man whose mind was made up  miss kirstie he began  miss christina if you please mr weir she interrupted i canna bear the contraction  you forget it has a friendly sound for me your aunt is an old friend of mine and a very good one i hope we shall see much of you at hermiston  my aunt and my sisterinlaw doesna agree very well not that i have much ado with it but still when im stopping in the house if i was to be visiting my aunt it would not look consideratelike  i am sorry said archie  i thank you kindly mr weir she said i whiles think myself its a great peety  ah i am sure your voice would always be for peace he cried  i wouldna be too sure of that she said i have my days like other folk i suppose  do you know in our old kirk among our good old grey dames you made an effect like sunshine  ah but that would be my glasgow clothes  i did not think i was so much under the influence of pretty frocks  she smiled with a half look at him theres more than you she said but you see im only cinderella ill have to put all these things by in my trunk next sunday ill be as grey as the rest theyre glasgow clothes you see and it would never do to make a practice of it it would seem terrible conspicuous  by that they were come to the place where their ways severed the old grey moors were all about them in the midst a few sheep wandered and they could see on the one hand the straggling caravan scaling the braes in front of them for cauldstaneslap and on the other the contingent from hermiston bending off and beginning to disappear by detachments into the policy gate it was in these circumstances that they turned to say farewell and deliberately exchanged a glance as they shook hands all passed as it should genteelly and in christinas mind as she mounted the first steep ascent for cauldstaneslap a gratifying sense of triumph prevailed over the recollection of minor lapses and mistakes she had kilted her gown as she did usually at that rugged pass but when she spied archie still standing and gazing after her the skirts came down again as if by enchantment here was a piece of nicety for that upland parish where the matrons marched with their coats kilted in the rain and the lasses walked barefoot to kirk through the dust of summer and went bravely down by the burnside and sat on stones to make a public toilet before entering it was perhaps an air wafted from glasgow or perhaps it marked a stage of that dizziness of gratified vanity in which the instinctive act passed unperceived he was looking after she unloaded her bosom of a prodigious sigh that was all pleasure and betook herself to run when she had overtaken the stragglers of her family she caught up the niece whom she had so recently repulsed and kissed and slapped her and drove her away again and ran after her with pretty cries and laughter perhaps she thought the laird might still be looking but it chanced the little scene came under the view of eyes less favourable for she overtook mrs hob marching with clem and dand  youre shürely fey lass quoth dandie  think shame to yersel miss said the strident mrs hob is this the gait to guide yersel on the way hame frae kirk youre shürely no sponsible the day and anyway i would mind my guid claes  hoot said christina and went on before them head in air treading the rough track with the tread of a wild doe  she was in love with herself her destiny the air of the hills the benediction of the sun all the way home she continued under the intoxication of these skyscraping spirits at table she could talk freely of young hermiston gave her opinion of him offhand and with a loud voice that he was a handsome young gentleman real wellmannered and sensiblelike but it was a pity he looked doleful onlythe moment aftera memory of his eyes in church embarrassed her but for this inconsiderable check all through mealtime she had a good appetite and she kept them laughing at table until gib who had returned before them from crossmichael and his separative worship reproved the whole of them for their levity  singing in to herself as she went her mind still in the turmoil of a glad confusion she rose and tripped upstairs to a little loft lighted by four panes in the gable where she slept with one of her nieces the niece who followed her presuming on aunties high spirits was flounced out of the apartment with small ceremony and retired smarting and half tearful to bury her woes in the byre among the hay still humming christina divested herself of her finery and put her treasures one by one in her great green trunk the last of these was the psalmbook it was a fine piece the gift of mistress clem in distinct oldfaced type on paper that had begun to grow foxy in the warehousenot by serviceand she was used to wrap it in a handkerchief every sunday after its period of service was over and bury it endwise at the head of her trunk as she now took it in hand the book fell open where the leaf was torn and she stood and gazed upon that evidence of her bygone discomposure there returned again the vision of the two brown eyes staring at her intent and bright out of that dark corner of the kirk the whole appearance and attitude the smile the suggested gesture of young hermiston came before her in a flash at the sight of the torn page i was surely fey she said echoing the words of dandie and at the suggested doom her high spirits deserted her she flung herself prone upon the bed and lay there holding the psalmbook in her hands for hours for the more part in a mere stupor of unconsenting pleasure and unreasoning fear the fear was superstitious there came up again and again in her memory dandies illomened words and a hundred grisly and black tales out of the immediate neighbourhood read her a commentary on their force the pleasure was never realised you might say the joints of her body thought and remembered and were gladdened but her essential self in the immediate theatre of consciousness talked feverishly of something else like a nervous person at a fire the image that she most complacently dwelt on was that of miss christina in her character of the fair lass of cauldstaneslap carrying all before her in the strawcoloured frock the violet mantle and the yellow cobweb stockings archies image on the other hand when it presented itself was never welcomedfar less welcomed with any ardour and it was exposed at times to merciless criticism in the long vague dialogues she held in her mind often with imaginary often with unrealised interlocutors archie if he were referred to at all came in for savage handling he was described as looking like a stirk staring like a caulf a face like a ghaists do you call that manners she said or i soon put him in his place miss christina if you please mr weir says i and just flyped up my skirt tails with gabble like this she would entertain herself long whiles together and then her eye would perhaps fall on the torn leaf and the eyes of archie would appear again from the darkness of the wall and the voluble words deserted her and she would lie still and stupid and think upon nothing with devotion and be sometimes raised by a quiet sigh had a doctor of medicine come into that loft he would have diagnosed a healthy welldeveloped eminently vivacious lass lying on her face in a fit of the sulks not one who had just contracted or was just contracting a mortal sickness of the mind which should yet carry her towards death and despair had it been a doctor of psychology he might have been pardoned for divining in the girl a passion of childish vanity selflove in excelsis and no more it is to be understood that i have been painting chaos and describing the inarticulate every lineament that appears is too precise almost every word used too strong take a fingerpost in the mountains on a day of rolling mists i have but copied the names that appear upon the pointers the names of definite and famous cities far distant and now perhaps basking in sunshine but christina remained all these hours as it were at the foot of the post itself not moving and enveloped in mutable and blinding wreaths of haze  the day was growing late and the sunbeams long and level when she sat suddenly up and wrapped in its handkerchief and put by that psalmbook which had already played a part so decisive in the first chapter of her lovestory in the absence of the mesmerists eye we are told nowadays that the head of a bright nail may fill his place if it be steadfastly regarded so that torn page had riveted her attention on what might else have been but little and perhaps soon forgotten while the ominous words of dandieheard not heeded and still rememberedhad lent to her thoughts or rather to her mood a cast of solemnity and that idea of fatea pagan fate uncontrolled by any christian deity obscure lawless and augustmoving undissuadably in the affairs of christian men thus even that phenomenon of love at first sight which is so rare and seems so simple and violent like a disruption of lifes tissue may be decomposed into a sequence of accidents happily concurring  she put on a grey frock and a pink kerchief looked at herself a moment with approval in the small square of glass that served her for a toilet mirror and went softly downstairs through the sleeping house that resounded with the sound of afternoon snoring just outside the door dandie was sitting with a book in his hand not reading only honouring the sabbath by a sacred vacancy of mind she came near him and stood still  im for off up the muirs dandie she said  there was something unusually soft in her tones that made him look up she was pale her eyes dark and bright no trace remained of the levity of the morning  ay lass yell have yer ups and downs like me im thinkin he observed  what for do ye say that she asked  o for naething says dand only i think yere mair like me than the lave of them yeve mair of the poetic temper tho guid kens little enough of the poetic taalent its an ill gift at the best look at yoursel at denner you were all sunshine and flowers and laughter and now youre like the star

luck here gang awa wi ye to your muirs and let me be im in an hour of inspiraution ye upsetting tawpie  but she clung to her brothers neighbourhood she knew not why  will ye no gies a kiss dand she said i aye likit ye fine  he kissed her and considered her a moment he found something strange in her but he was a libertine through and through nourished equal contempt and suspicion of all womankind and paid his way among them habitually with idle compliments  gae wa wi ye said he yere a dentie baby and be content wi that  that was dandies way a kiss and a comfit to jennya bawbee and my blessing to jilland goodnight to the whole clan of ye my dears when anything approached the serious it became a matter for men he both thought and said women when they did not absorb were only children to be shood away merely in his character of connoisseur however dandle glanced carelessly after his sister as she crossed the meadow the brats no that bad he thought with surprise for though he had just been paying her compliments he had not really looked at her hey whats yon for the grey dress was cut with short sleeves and skirts and displayed her trim strong legs clad in pink stockings of the same shade as the kerchief she wore round her shoulders and that shimmered as she went this was not her way in undress he knew her ways and the ways of the whole sex in the countryside no one better when they did not go barefoot they wore stout rig and furrow woollen hose of an invisible blue mostly when they were not black outright and dandie at sight of this daintiness put two and two together it was a silk handkerchief then they would be silken hose they matchedthen the whole outfit was a present of clems a costly present and not something to be worn through bog and briar or on a late afternoon of sunday he whistled my denty may either your heids fair turned or theres some ongoings he observed and dismissed the subject  she went slowly at first but ever straighter and faster for the cauldstaneslap a pass among the hills to which the farm owed its name the slap opened like a doorway between two rounded hillocks and through this ran the short cut to hermiston immediately on the other side it went down through the deils hags a considerable marshy hollow of the hill tops full of springs and crouching junipers and pools where the black peatwater slumbered there was no view from here a man might have sat upon the praying weavers stone a halfcentury and seen none but the cauldstaneslap children twice in the twentyfour hours on their way to the school and back again an occasional shepherd the irruption of a clan of sheep or the birds who haunted about the springs drinking and shrilly piping so when she had once passed the slap kirstie was received into seclusion she looked back a last time at the farm it still lay deserted except for the figure of dandie who was now seen to be scribbling in his lap the hour of expected inspiration having come to him at last thence she passed rapidly through the morass and came to the farther end of it where a sluggish burn discharges and the path for hermiston accompanies it on the beginning of its downward way from this corner a wide view was opened to her of the whole stretch of braes upon the other side still sallow and in places rusty with the winter with the path marked boldly here and there by the burnside a tuft of birches andtwo miles off as the crow fliesfrom its enclosures and young plantations the windows of hermiston glittering in the western sun  here she sat down and waited and looked for a long time at these faraway bright panes of glass it amused her to have so extended a view she thought it amused her to see the house of hermistonto see folk and there was an indistinguishable human unit perhaps the gardener visibly sauntering on the gravel paths  by the time the sun was down and all the easterly braes lay plunged in clear shadow she was aware of another figure coming up the path at a most unequal rate of approach now half running now pausing and seeming to hesitate she watched him at first with a total suspension of thought she held her thought as a person holds his breathing then she consented to recognise him hell no be coming here he canna be its no possible and there began to grow upon her a subdued choking suspense he was coming his hesitations had quite ceased his step grew firm and swift no doubt remained and the question loomed up before her instant what was she to do it was all very well to say that her brother was a laird himself it was all very well to speak of casual intermarriages and to count cousinship like auntie kirstie the difference in their social station was trenchant propriety prudence all that she had ever learned all that she knew bade her flee but on the other hand the cup of life now offered to her was too enchanting for one moment she saw the question clearly and definitely made her choice she stood up and showed herself an instant in the gap relieved upon the sky line and the next fled trembling and sat down glowing with excitement on the weavers stone she shut her eyes seeking praying for composure her hand shook in her lap and her mind was full of incongruous and futile speeches what was there to make a work about she could take care of herself she supposed there was no harm in seeing the laird it was the best thing that could happen she would mark a proper distance to him once and for all gradually the wheels of her nature ceased to go round so madly and she sat in passive expectation a quiet solitary figure in the midst of the grey moss i have said she was no hypocrite but here i am at fault she never admitted to herself that she had come up the hill to look for archie and perhaps after all she did not know perhaps came as a stone falls for the steps of love in the young and especially in girls are instinctive and unconscious  in the meantime archie was drawing rapidly near and he at least was consciously seeking her neighbourhood the afternoon had turned to ashes in his mouth the memory of the girl had kept him from reading and drawn him as with cords and at last as the cool of the evening began to come on he had taken his hat and set forth with a smothered ejaculation by the moor path to cauldstaneslap he had no hope to find her he took the off chance without expectation of result and to relieve his uneasiness the greater was his surprise as he surmounted the slope and came into the hollow of the deils hags to see there like an answer to his wishes the little womanly figure in the grey dress and the pink kerchief sitting little and low and lost and acutely solitary in these desolate surroundings and on the weatherbeaten stone of the dead weaver those things that still smacked of winter were all rusty about her and those things that already relished of the spring had put forth the tender and lively colours of the season even in the unchanging face of the deathstone changes were to be remarked and in the channeled lettering the moss began to renew itself in jewels of green by an afterthought that was a stroke of art she had turned up over her head the back of the kerchief so that it now framed becomingly her vivacious and yet pensive face her feet were gathered under her on the one side and she leaned on her bare arm which showed out strong and round tapered to a slim wrist and shimmered in the fading light  young hermiston was struck with a certain chill he was reminded that he now dealt in serious matters of life and death this was a grown woman he was approaching endowed with her mysterious potencies and attractions the treasury of the continued race and he was neither better nor worse than the average of his sex and age he had a certain delicacy which had preserved him hitherto unspotted and which had either of them guessed it made him a more dangerous companion when his heart should be really stirred his throat was dry as he came near but the appealing sweetness of her smile stood between them like a guardian angel  for she turned to him and smiled though without rising there was a shade in this cavalier greeting that neither of them perceived neither he who simply thought it gracious and charming as herself nor yet she who did not observe quick as she was the difference between rising to meet the laird and remaining seated to receive the expected admirer  are ye stepping west hermiston said she giving him his territorial name after the fashion of the countryside  i was said he a little hoarsely but i think i will be about the end of my stroll now are you like me miss christina the house would not hold me i came here seeking air  he took his seat at the other end of the tombstone and studied her wondering what was she there was infinite import in the question alike for her and him  ay said she i couldna bear the roof either its a habit of mine to come up here about the gloaming when its quaiet and caller  it was a habit of my mothers also he said gravely the recollection half startled him as he expressed it he looked around i have scarce been here since its peaceful he said with a long breath  its no like glasgow she replied a weary place yon glasgow but what a day have i had for my hamecoming and what a bonny evening  indeed it was a wonderful day said archie i think i will remember it years and years until i come to die on days like thisi do not know if you feel as i dobut everything appears so brief and fragile and exquisite that i am afraid to touch life we are here for so short a time and all the old people before usrutherfords of hermiston elliotts of the cauldstaneslapthat were here but a while since riding about and keeping up a great noise in this quiet cornermaking love too and marryingwhy where are they now its deadly commonplace but after all the commonplaces are the great poetic truths  he was sounding her semiconsciously to see if she could understand him to learn if she were only an animal the colour of flowers or had a soul in her to keep her sweet she on her part her means well in hand watched womanlike for any opportunity to shine to abound in his humour whatever that might be the dramatic artist that lies dormant or only half awake in most human beings had in her sprung to his feet in a divine fury and chance had served her well she looked upon him with a subdued twilight look that became the hour of the day and the train of thought earnestness shone through her like stars in the purple west and from the great but controlled upheaval of her whole nature there passed into her voice and ran in her lightest words a thrill of emotion  have you mind of dands song she answered i think hell have been trying to say what you have been thinking  no i never heard it he said repeat it to me can you  its nothing wanting the tune said kirstie  then sing it me said he  on the lords day that would never do mr weir  i am afraid i am not so strict a keeper of the sabbath and there is no one in this place to hear us unless the poor old ancient under the stone  no that im thinking that really she said by my way of thinking its just as serious as a psalm will i sooth it to ye then  if you please said he and drawing near to her on the tombstone prepared to listen  she sat up as if to sing ill only can sooth it to ye she explained i wouldna like to sing out loud on the sabbath i think the birds would carry news of it to gilbert and she smiled its about the elliotts she continued and i think theres few bonnier bits in the bookpoets though dand has never got printed yet  and she began in the low clear tones of her half voice now sinking almost to a whisper now rising to a particular note which was her best and which archie learned to wait for with growing emotion      o they rade in the rain in the days that are gane        in the rain and the wind and the lave      they shoutit in the ha and they routit on the hill        but theyre a quaitit noo in the grave   auld auld elliotts claycauld elliotts dour bauld elliotts of auld  all the time she sang she looked steadfastly before her her knees straight her hands upon her knee head cast back and up the expression was admirable throughout for had she not learned it from the lips and under the criticism of the author when it was done she turned upon archie a face softly bright and eyes gently suffused and shining in the twilight and his heart rose and went out to her with boundless pity and sympathy his question was answered she was a human being tuned to a sense of the tragedy of life there were pathos and music and a great heart in the girl  he arose instinctively she also for she saw she had gained a point and scored the impression deeper and she had wit enough left to flee upon a victory they were but commonplaces that remained to be exchanged but the low moved voices in which they passed made them sacred in the memory in the falling greyness of the evening he watched her figure winding through the morass saw it turn a last time and wave a hand and then pass through the slap and it seemed to him as if something went along with her out of the deepest of his heart and something surely had come and come to dwell there he had retained from childhood a picture now half obliterated by the passage of time and the multitude of fresh impressions of his mother telling him with the fluttered earnestness of her voice and often with dropping tears the tale of the praying weaver on the very scene of his brief tragedy and long repose and now there was a companion piece and he beheld and he should behold for ever christina perched on the same tomb in the grey colours of the evening gracious dainty perfect as a flower and she also singing    of old unhappy far off things    and battles long ago  of their common ancestors now dead of their rude wars composed their weapons buried with them and of these strange changelings their descendants who lingered a little in their places and would soon be gone also and perhaps sung of by others at the gloaming hour by one of the unconscious arts of tenderness the two women were enshrined together in his memory tears in that hour of sensibility came into his eyes indifferently at the thought of either and the girl from being something merely bright and shapely was caught up into the zone of things serious as life and death and his dead mother so that in all ways and on either side fate played his game artfully with this poor pair of children the generations were prepared the pangs were made ready before the curtain rose on the dark drama  in the same moment of time that she disappeared from archie there opened before kirsties eyes the cuplike hollow in which the farm lay she saw some five hundred feet below her the house making itself bright with candles and this was a broad hint to her to hurry for they were only kindled on a sabbath night with a view to that family worship which rounded in the incomparable tedium of the day and brought on the relaxation of supper already she knew that robert must be withinsides at the head of the table waling the portions for it was robert in his quality of family priest and judge not the gifted gilbert who officiated she made good time accordingly down the steep ascent and came up to the door panting as the three younger brothers all roused at last from slumber stood together in the cool and the dark of the evening with a fry of nephews and nieces about them chatting and awaiting the expected signal she stood back she had no mind to direct attention to her late arrival or to her labouring breath  kirstie ye have shaved it this time my lass said clem whaur were ye  o just taking a dander by mysel said kirstie  and the talk continued on the subject of the american war without further reference to the truant who stood by them in the covert of the dusk thrilling with happiness and the sense of guilt  the signal was given and the brothers began to go in one after another amid the jostle and throng of hobs children  only dandie waiting till the last caught kirstie by the arm when did ye begin to dander in pink hosen mistress elliott he whispered slily  she looked down she was one blush i maun have forgotten to change them said she and went in to prayers in her turn with a troubled mind between anxiety as to whether dand should have observed her yellow stockings at church and should thus detect her in a palpable falsehood and shame that she had already made good his prophecy she remembered the words of it how it was to be when she had gotten a jo and that that would be for good and evil will i have gotten my jo now she thought with a secret rapture  and all through prayers where it was her principal business to conceal the pink stockings from the eyes of the indifferent mrs hoband all through supper as she made a feint of eating and sat at the table radiant and constrainedand again when she had left them and come into her chamber and was alone with her sleeping niece and could at last lay aside the armour of societythe same words sounded within her the same profound note of happiness of a world all changed and renewed of a day that had been passed in paradise and of a night that was to be heaven opened all night she seemed to be conveyed smoothly upon a shallow stream of sleep and waking and through the bowers of beulah all night she cherished to her heart that exquisite hope and if towards morning she forgot it a while in a more profound unconsciousness it was to catch again the rainbow thought with her first moment of awaking     chapter vii  enter mephistopheles   two days later a gig from crossmichael deposited frank innes at the doors of hermiston once in a way during the past winter archie in some acute phase of boredom had written him a letter it had contained something in the nature of an invitation or a reference to an invitationprecisely what neither of them now remembered when innes had received it there had been nothing further from his mind than to bury himself in the moors with archie but not even the most acute political heads are guided through the steps of life with unerring directness that would require a gift of prophecy which has been denied to man for instance who could have imagined that not a month after he had received the letter and turned it into mockery and put off answering it and in the end lost it misfortunes of a gloomy cast should begin to thicken over franks career his case may be briefly stated his father a small morayshire laird with a large family became recalcitrant and cut off the supplies he had fitted himself out with the beginnings of quite a good law library which upon some sudden losses on the turf he had been obliged to sell before they were paid for and his bookseller hearing some rumour of the event took out a warrant for his arrest innes had early word of it and was able to take precautions in this immediate welter of his affairs with an unpleasant charge hanging over him he had judged it the part of prudence to be off instantly had written a fervid letter to his father at inverauld and put himself in the coach for crossmichael any port in a storm he was manfully turning his back on the parliament house and its gay babble on porter and oysters the racecourse and the ring and manfully prepared until these clouds should have blown by to share a living grave with archie weir at hermiston  to do him justice he was no less surprised to be going than archie was to see him come and he carried off his wonder with an infinitely better grace  well here i am said he as he alighted pylades has come to orestes at last by the way did you get my answer no how very provoking well here i am to answer for myself and thats better still  i am very glad to see you of course said archie i make you heartily welcome of course but you surely have not come to stay with the courts still sitting is that not most unwise  damn the courts says frank what are the courts to friendship and a little fishing  and so it was agreed that he was to stay with no term to the visit but the term which he had privily set to it himselfthe day namely when his father should have come down with the dust and he should be able to pacify the bookseller on such vague conditions there began for these two young men who were not even friends a life of great familiarity and as the days drew on less and less intimacy they were together at mealtimes together o nights when the hour had come for whiskytoddy but it might have been noticed had there been any one to pay heed that they were rarely so much together by day archie had hermiston to attend to multifarious activities in the hills in which he did not require and had even refused franks escort he would be off sometimes in the morning and leave only a note on the breakfasttable to announce the fact and sometimes with no notice at all he would not return for dinner until the hour was long past innes groaned under these desertions it required all his philosophy to sit down to a solitary breakfast with composure and all his unaffected goodnature to be able to greet archie with friendliness on the more rare occasions when he came home late for dinner  i wonder what on earth he finds to do mrs elliott said he one morning after he had just read the hasty billet and sat down to table  i suppose it will be business sir replied the housekeeper drily measuring his distance off to him by an indicated curtsey  but i cant imagine what business he reiterated  i suppose it will be his business retorted the austere kirstie  he turned to her with that happy brightness that made the charm of his disposition and broke into a peal of healthy and natural laughter  well played mrs elliott he cried and the housekeepers face relaxed into the shadow of an iron smile well played indeed said he but you must not be making a stranger of me like that why archie and i were at the high school together and weve been to college together and we were going to the bar together whenyou know dear dear me what a pity that was a life spoiled a fine young fellow as good as buried here in the wilderness with rustics and all for what a frolic silly if you like but no more god how good your scones are mrs elliott  theyre no mines it was the lassie made them said kirstie and saving your presence theres little sense in taking the lords name in vain about idle vivers that you fill your kyte wi  i daresay youre perfectly right maam quoth the imperturbable frank but as i was saying this is a pitiable business this about poor archie and you and i might do worse than put our heads together like a couple of sensible people and bring it to an end let me tell you maam that archie is really quite a promising young man and in my opinion he would do well at the bar as for his father no one can deny his ability and i dont fancy any one would care to deny that he has the deils own temper  if youll excuse me mr innes i think the lass is crying on me said kirstie and flounced from the room  the damned crossgrained old broomstick ejaculated innes  in the meantime kirstie had escaped into the kitchen and before her vassal gave vent to her feelings  here ettercap yell have to wait on yon innes i canna hand myself in puir erchie id puir erchie him if i had my way and hermiston with the deils ain temper god let him take hermistons scones out of his mouth first theres no a hair on ayther o the weirs that hasna mair spunk and dirdum to it than what he has in his hale dwaibly body settin up his snash to me let him gang to the black toon where hes mebbe wantitbirling on a curriclewi pimatum on his heidmaking a mess o himsel wi nesty hizziesa fair disgrace it was impossible to hear without admiration kirsties graduated disgust as she brought forth one after another these somewhat baseless charges then she remembered her immediate purpose and turned again on her fascinated auditor do ye no hear me tawpie do ye no hear what im tellin ye will i have to shoo ye into him if i come to attend to ye mistress and the maid fled the kitchen which had become practically dangerous to attend on inness wants in the front parlour  tantaene irae has the reader perceived the reason since franks coming there were no more hours of gossip over the suppertray all his blandishments were in vain he had started handicapped on the race for mrs elliotts favour  but it was a strange thing how misfortune dogged him in his efforts to be genial i must guard the reader against accepting kirsties epithets as evidence she was more concerned for their vigour than for their accuracy dwaibly for instance nothing could be more calumnious frank was the very picture of good looks good humour and manly youth he had bright eyes with a sparkle and a dance to them curly hair a charming smile brilliant teeth an admirable carriage of the head the look of a gentleman the address of one accustomed to please at first sight and to improve the impression and with all these advantages he failed with every one about hermiston with the silent shepherd with the obsequious grieve with the groom who was also the ploughman with the gardener and the gardeners sistera pious downhearted woman with a shawl over her earshe failed equally and flatly they did not like him and they showed it the little maid indeed was an exception she admired him devoutly probably dreamed of him in her private hours but she was accustomed to play the part of silent auditor to kirsties tirades and silent recipient of kirsties buffets and she had learned not only to be a very capable girl of her years but a very secret and prudent one besides frank was thus conscious that he had one ally and sympathiser in the midst of that general union of disfavour that surrounded watched and waited on him in the house of hermiston but he had little comfort or society from that alliance and the demure little maid twelve on her last birthday preserved her own counsel and tripped on his service brisk dumbly responsive but inexorably unconversational for the others they were beyond hope and beyond endurance never had a young apollo been cast among such rustic barbarians but perhaps the cause of his illsuccess lay in one trait which was habitual and unconscious with him yet diagnostic of the man it was his practice to approach any one person at the expense of some one else he offered you an alliance against the some one else he flattered you by slighting him you were drawn into a small intrigue against him before you knew how wonderful are the virtues of this process generally but franks mistake was in the choice of the some one else he was not politic in that he listened to the voice of irritation archie had offended him at first by what he had felt to be rather a dry reception had offended him since by his frequent absences he was besides the one figure continually present in franks eye and it was to his immediate dependants that frank could offer the snare of his sympathy now the truth is that the weirs father and son were surrounded by a posse of strenuous loyalists of my lord they were vastly proud it was a distinction in itself to be one of the vassals of the hanging judge and his gross formidable joviality was far from unpopular in the neighbourhood of his home for archie they had one and all a sensitive affection and respect which recoiled from a word of belittlement  nor was frank more successful when he went farther afield to the four black brothers for instance he was antipathetic in the highest degree hob thought him too light gib too profane clem who saw him but for a day or two before he went to glasgow wanted to know what the fules business was and whether he meant to stay here all session time yons a drone he pronounced as for dand it will be enough to describe their first meeting when frank had been whipping a river and the rustic celebrity chanced to come along the path  im told youre quite a poet frank had said  wha tellt ye that mannie had been the unconciliating answer  o everybody says frank  god heres fame said the sardonic poet and he had passed on his way  come to think of it we have here perhaps a truer explanation of franks failures had he met mr sheriff scott he could have turned a neater compliment because mr scott would have been a friend worth making dand on the other hand he did not value sixpence and he showed it even while he tried to flatter condescension is an excellent thing but it is strange how onesided the pleasure of it is he who goes fishing among the scots peasantry with condescension for a bait will have an empty basket by evening  in proof of this theory frank made a great success of it at the crossmichael club to which archie took him immediately on his arrival his own last appearance on that scene of gaiety frank was made welcome there at once continued to go regularly and had attended a meeting as the members ever after loved to tell on the evening before his death young hay and young pringle appeared again there was another supper at windielaws another dinner at driffel and it resulted in frank being taken to the bosom of the county people as unreservedly as he had been repudiated by the country folk he occupied hermiston after the manner of an invader in a conquered capital he was perpetually issuing from it as from a base to toddy parties fishing parties and dinner parties to which archie was not invited or to which archie would not go it was now that the name of the recluse became general for the young man some say that innes invented it innes at least spread it abroad  hows all with your recluse today people would ask  o reclusing away innes would declare with his bright air of saying something witty and immediately interrupt the general laughter which he had provoked much more by his air than his words mind you its all very well laughing but im not very well pleased poor archie is a good fellow an excellent fellow a fellow i always liked i think it small of him to take his little disgrace so hard and shut himself up grant that it is a ridiculous story painfully ridiculous i keep telling him be a man live it down man but not he of course its just solitude and shame and all that but i confess im beginning to fear the result it would be all the pities in the world if a really promising fellow like weir was to end ill im seriously tempted to write to lord hermiston and put it plainly to him  i would if i were you some of his auditors would say shaking the head sitting bewildered and confused at this new view of the matter so deftly indicated by a single word a capital idea they would add and wonder at the aplomb and position of this young man who talked as a matter of course of writing to hermiston and correcting him upon his private affairs  and frank would proceed sweetly confidential ill give you an idea now hes actually sore about the way that im received and hes left out in the countyactually jealous and sore ive rallied him and ive reasoned with him told him that every one was most kindly inclined towards him told him even that i was received merely because i was his guest but its no use he will neither accept the invitations he gets nor stop brooding about the ones where hes left out what im afraid of is that the wounds ulcerating he had always one of those dark secret angry naturesa little underhand and plenty of bileyou know the sort he must have inherited it from the weirs whom i suspect to have been a worthy family of weavers somewhere whats the cant phrasesedentary occupation its precisely the kind of character to go wrong in a false position like what his fathers made for him or hes making for himself whichever you like to call it and for my part i think it a disgrace frank would say generously  presently the sorrow and anxiety of this disinterested friend took shape he began in private in conversations of two to talk vaguely of bad habits and low habits i must say im afraid hes going wrong altogether he would say ill tell you plainly and between ourselves i scarcely like to stay there any longer only man im positively afraid to leave him alone youll see i shall be blamed for it later on im staying at a great sacrifice im hindering my chances at the bar and i cant blind my eyes to it and what im afraid of is that im going to get kicked for it all round before alls done you see nobody believes in friendship nowadays  well innes his interlocutor would reply its very good of you i must say that if theres any blame going youll always be sure of my good word for one thing  well frank would continue candidly i dont say its pleasant he has a very rough way with him his fathers son you know i dont say hes rudeof course i couldnt be expected to stand thatbut he steers very near the wind no its not pleasant but i tell ye man in conscience i dont think it would be fair to leave him mind you i dont say theres anything actually wrong what i say is that i dont like the looks of it man and he would press the arm of his momentary confidant  in the early stages i am persuaded there was no malice he talked but for the pleasure of airing himself he was essentially glib as becomes the young advocate and essentially careless of the truth which is the mark of the young ass and so he talked at random there was no particular bias but that one which is indigenous and universal to flatter himself and to please and interest the present friend and by thus milling air out of his mouth he had presently built up a presentation of archie which was known and talked of in all corners of the county wherever there was a residential house and a walled garden wherever there was a dwarfish castle and a park wherever a quadruple cottage by the ruins of a peeltower showed an old family going down and wherever a handsome villa with a carriage approach and a shrubbery marked the coming up of a new oneprobably on the wheels of machineryarchie began to be regarded in the light of a dark perhaps a vicious mystery and the future developments of his career to be looked for with uneasiness and confidential whispering he had done something disgraceful my dear what was not precisely known and that good kind young man mr innes did his best to make light of it but there it was and mr innes was very anxious about him now he was really uneasy my dear he was positively wrecking his own prospects because he dared not leave him alone how wholly we all lie at the mercy of a single prater not needfully with any malign purpose and if a man but talks of himself in the right spirit refers to his virtuous actions by the way and never applies to them the name of virtue how easily his evidence is accepted in the court of public opinion  all this while however there was a more poisonous ferment at work between the two lads which came late indeed to the surface but had modified and magnified their dissensions from the first to an idle shallow easygoing customer like frank the smell of a mystery was attractive it gave his mind something to play with like a new toy to a child and it took him on the weak side for like many young men coming to the bar and before they have been tried and found wanting he flattered himself he was a fellow of unusual quickness and penetration they knew nothing of sherlock holmes in those days but there was a good deal said of talleyrand and if you could have caught frank off his guard he would have confessed with a smirk that if he resembled any one it was the marquis de talleyrandpérigord it was on the occasion of archies first absence that this interest took root it was vastly deepened when kirstie resented his curiosity at breakfast and that same afternoon there occurred another scene which clinched the business he was fishing swingleburn archie accompanying him when the latter looked at his watch  well goodbye said he i have something to do see you at dinner  dont be in such a hurry cries frank hold on till i get my rod up ill go with you im sick of flogging this ditch  and he began to reel up his line  archie stood speechless he took a long while to recover his wits under this direct attack but by the time he was ready with his answer and the angle was almost packed up he had become completely weir and the hanging face gloomed on his young shoulders he spoke with a laboured composure a laboured kindness even but a child could see that his mind was made up  i beg your pardon innes i dont want to be disagreeable but let us understand one another from the beginning when i want your company ill let you know  o cries frank you dont want my company dont you  apparently not just now replied archie i even indicated to you when i did if youll rememberand that was at dinner if we two fellows are to live together pleasantlyand i see no reason why we should notit can only be by respecting each others privacy if we begin intruding  o come ill take this at no mans hands is this the way you treat a guest and an old friend cried innes  just go home and think over what i said by yourself continued archie whether its reasonable or whether its really offensive or not and lets meet at dinner as though nothing had happened ill put it this way if you likethat i know my own character that im looking forward with great pleasure i assure you to a long visit from you and that im taking precautions at the first i see the thing that wethat i if you likemight fall out upon and i step in and obsto principiis i wager you five pounds youll end by seeing that i mean friendliness and i assure you francie i do he added relenting  bursting with anger but incapable of speech innes shouldered his rod made a gesture of farewell and strode off down the burnside archie watched him go without moving he was sorry but quite unashamed he hated to be inhospitable but in one thing he was his fathers son he had a strong sense that his house was his own and no man elses and to lie at a guests mercy was what he refused he hated to seem harsh but that was franks lookout if frank had been commonly discreet he would have been decently courteous and there was another consideration the secret he was protecting was not his own merely it was hers it belonged to that inexpressible she who was fast taking possession of his soul and whom he would soon have defended at the cost of burning cities by the time he had watched frank as far as the swingleburnfoot appearing and disappearing in the tarnished heather still stalking at a fierce gait but already dwindled in the distance into less than the smallness of lilliput he could afford to smile at the occurrence either frank would go and that would be a reliefor he would continue to stay and his host must continue to endure him and archie was now freeby devious paths behind hillocks and in the hollow of burnsto make for the trystingplace where kirstie cried about by the curlew and the plover waited and burned for his coming by the covenanters stone  innes went off downhill in a passion of resentment easy to be understood but which yielded progressively to the needs of his situation he cursed archie for a coldhearted unfriendly rude rude dog and himself still more passionately for a fool in having come to hermiston when he might have sought refuge in almost any other house in scotland but the step once taken was practically irretrievable he had no more ready money to go anywhere else he would have to borrow from archie the next clubnight and ill as he thought of his hosts manners he was sure of his practical generosity franks resemblance to talleyrand strikes me as imaginary but at least not talleyrand himself could have more obediently taken his lesson from the facts he met archie at dinner without resentment almost with cordiality you must take your friends as you find them he would have said archie couldnt help being his fathers son or his grandfathers the hypothetical weavers grandson the son of a hunks he was still a hunks at heart incapable of true generosity and consideration but he had other qualities with which frank could divert himself in the meanwhile and to enjoy which it was necessary that frank should keep his temper  so excellently was it controlled that he awoke next morning with his head full of a different though a cognate subject what was archies little game why did he shun franks company what was he keeping secret was he keeping tryst with somebody and was it a woman it would be a good joke and a fair revenge to discover to that task he set himself with a great deal of patience which might have surprised his friends for he had been always credited not with patience so much as brilliancy and little by little from one point to another he at last succeeded in piecing out the situation first he remarked that although archie set out in all the directions of the compass he always came home again from some point between the south and west from the study of a map and in consideration of the great expanse of untenanted moorland running in that direction towards the sources of the clyde he laid his finger on cauldstaneslap and two other neighbouring farms kingsmuirs and polintarf but it was difficult to advance farther with his rod for a pretext he vainly visited each of them in turn nothing was to be seen suspicious about this trinity of moorland settlements he would have tried to follow archie had it been the least possible but the nature of the land precluded the idea he did the next best ensconced himself in a quiet corner and pursued his movements with a telescope it was equally in vain and he soon wearied of his futile vigilance left the telescope at home and had almost given the matter up in despair when on the twentyseventh day of his visit he was suddenly confronted with the person whom he sought the first sunday kirstie had managed to stay away from kirk on some pretext of indisposition which was more truly modesty the pleasure of beholding archie seeming too sacred too vivid for that public place on the two following frank had himself been absent on some of his excursions among the neighbouring families it was not until the fourth accordingly that frank had occasion to set eyes on the enchantress with the first look all hesitation was over she came with the cauldstaneslap party then she lived at cauldstaneslap here was archies secret here was the woman and more than thatthough i have need here of every manageable attenuation of languagewith the first look he had already entered himself as rival it was a good deal in pique it was a little in revenge it was much in genuine admiration the devil may decide the proportions i cannot and it is very likely that frank could not  mighty attractive milkmaid he observed on the way home  who said archie  o the girl youre looking atarent you forward there on the road she came attended by the rustic bard presumably therefore belongs to his exalted family the single objection for the four black brothers are awkward customers if anything were to go wrong gib would gibber and clem would prove inclement and dand fly in danders and hob blow up in gobbets it would be a helliott of a business  very humorous i am sure said archie  well i am trying to be so said frank its none too easy in this place and with your solemn society my dear fellow but confess that the milkmaid has found favour in your eyes or resign all claim to be a man of taste  it is no matter returned archie  but the other continued to look at him steadily and quizzically and his colour slowly rose and deepened under the glance until not impudence itself could have denied that he was blushing and at this archie lost some of his control he changed his stick from one hand to the other ando for gods sake dont be an ass he cried  ass thats the retort delicate without doubt says frank beware of the homespun brothers dear if they come into the dance youll see whos an ass think now if they only applied say a quarter as much talent as i have applied to the question of what mr archie does with his evening hours and why he is so unaffectedly nasty when the subjects touched on  you are touching on it now interrupted archie with a wince  thank you that was all i wanted an articulate confession said frank  i beg to remind you began archie  but he was interrupted in turn my dear fellow dont its quite needless the subjects dead and buried  and frank began to talk hastily on other matters an art in which he was an adept for it was his gift to be fluent on anything or nothing but although archie had the grace or the timidity to suffer him to rattle on he was by no means done with the subject when he came home to dinner he was greeted with a sly demand how things were looking cauldstaneslap ways frank took his first glass of port out after dinner to the toast of kirstie and later in the evening he returned to the charge again  i say weir youll excuse me for returning again to this affair ive been thinking it over and i wish to beg you very seriously to be more careful its not a safe business not safe my boy said he  what said archie  well its your own fault if i must put a name on the thing but really as a friend i cannot stand by and see you rushing head down into these dangers my dear boy said he holding up a warning cigar consider what is to be the end of it  the end of whatarchie helpless with irritation persisted in this dangerous and ungracious guard  well the end of the milkmaid or to speak more by the card the end of miss christina elliott of the cauldstaneslap  i assure you archie broke out this is all a figment of your imagination there is nothing to be said against that young lady you have no right to introduce her name into the conversation  ill make a note of it said frank she shall henceforth be nameless nameless nameless gregarach i make a note besides of your valuable testimony to her character i only want to look at this thing as a man of the world admitted shes an angelbut my good fellow is she a lady  this was torture to archie i beg your pardon he said struggling to be composed but because you have wormed yourself into my confidence  o come cried frank your confidence it was rosy but unconsenting your confidence indeed now look this is what i must say weir for it concerns your safety and good character and therefore my honour as your friend you say i wormed myself into your confidence wormed is good but what have i done i have put two and two together just as the parish will be doing tomorrow and the whole of tweeddale in two weeks and the black brotherswell i wont put a date on that it will be a dark and stormy morning your secret in other words is poor polls and i want to ask of you as a friend whether you like the prospect there are two horns to your dilemma and i must say for myself i should look mighty ruefully on either do you see yourself explaining to the four black brothers or do you see yourself presenting the milkmaid to papa as the future lady of hermiston do you i tell you plainly i dont  archie rose i will hear no more of this he said in a trembling voice  but frank again held up his cigar tell me one thing first tell me if this is not a friends part that i am playing  i believe you think it so replied archie i can go as far as that i can do so much justice to your motives but i will hear no more of it i am going to bed  thats right weir said frank heartily go to bed and think over it and i say man dont forget your prayers i dont often do the moraldont go in for that sort of thingbut when i do theres one thing sure that i mean it  so archie marched off to bed and frank sat alone by the table for another hour or so smiling to himself richly there was nothing vindictive in his nature but if revenge came in his way it might as well be good and the thought of archies pillow reflections that night was indescribably sweet to him he felt a pleasant sense of power he looked down on archie as on a very little boy whose strings he pulledas on a horse whom he had backed and bridled by sheer power of intelligence and whom he might ride to glory or the grave at pleasure which was it to be he lingered long relishing the details of schemes that he was too idle to pursue poor cork upon a torrent he tasted that night the sweets of omnipotence and brooded like a deity over the strands of that intrigue which was to shatter him before the summer waned     chapter viii  a nocturnal visit   kirstie had many causes of distress more and more as we grow oldand yet more and more as we grow old and are women frozen by the fear of agewe come to rely on the voice as the single outlet of the soul only thus in the curtailment of our means can we relieve the straitened cry of the passion within us only thus in the bitter and sensitive shyness of advancing years can we maintain relations with those vivacious figures of the young that still show before us and tend daily to become no more than the moving wallpaper of life talk is the last link the last relation but with the end of the conversation when the voice stops and the bright face of the listener is turned away solitude falls again on the bruised heart kirstie had lost her cannie hour at een she could no more wander with archie a ghost if you will but a happy ghost in fields elysian and to her it was as if the whole world had fallen silent to him but an unremarkable change of amusements and she raged to know it the effervescency of her passionate and irritable nature rose within her at times to bursting point  this is the price paid by age for unseasonable ardours of feeling it must have been so for kirstie at any time when the occasion chanced but it so fell out that she was deprived of this delight in the hour when she had most need of it when she had most to say most to ask and when she trembled to recognise her sovereignty not merely in abeyance but annulled for with the clairvoyance of a genuine love she had pierced the mystery that had so long embarrassed frank she was conscious even before it was carried out even on that sunday night when it began of an invasion of her rights and a voice told her the invaders name since then by arts by accident by small things observed and by the general drift of archies humour she had passed beyond all possibility of doubt with a sense of justice that lord hermiston might have envied she had that day in church considered and admitted the attractions of the younger kirstie and with the profound humanity and sentimentality of her nature she had recognised the coming of fate not thus would she have chosen she had seen in imagination archie wedded to some tall powerful and rosy heroine of the golden locks made in her own image for whom she would have strewed the bridebed with delight and now she could have wept to see the ambition falsified but the gods had pronounced and her doom was otherwise  she lay tossing in bed that night besieged with feverish thoughts there were dangerous matters pending a battle was toward over the fate of which she hung in jealousy sympathy fear and alternate loyalty and disloyalty to either side now she was reincarnated in her niece and now in archie now she saw through the girls eyes the youth on his knees to her heard his persuasive instances with a deadly weakness and received his overmastering caresses anon with a revulsion her temper raged to see such utmost favours of fortune and love squandered on a brat of a girl one of her own house using her own namea deadly ingredientand that didna ken her ain mind an was as blacks your hat now she trembled lest her deity should plead in vain loving the idea of success for him like a triumph of nature anon with returning loyalty to her own family and sex she trembled for kirstie and the credit of the elliotts and again she had a vision of herself the day over for her oldworld tales and local gossip bidding farewell to her last link with life and brightness and love and behind and beyond she saw but the blank buttend where she must crawl to die had she then come to the lees she so great so beautiful with a heart as fresh as a girls and strong as womanhood it could not be and yet it was so and for a moment her bed was horrible to her as the sides of the grave and she looked forward over a waste of hours and saw herself go on to rage and tremble and be softened and rage again until the day came and the labours of the day must be renewed  suddenly she heard feet on the stairshis feet and soon after the sound of a windowsash flung open she sat up with her heart beating he had gone to his room alone and he had not gone to bed she might again have one of her night cracks and at the entrancing prospect a change came over her mind with the approach of this hope of pleasure all the baser metal became immediately obliterated from her thoughts she rose all woman and all the best of woman tender pitiful hating the wrong loyal to her own sexand all the weakest of that dear miscellany nourishing cherishing next her soft heart voicelessly flattering hopes that she would have died sooner than have acknowledged she tore off her nightcap and her hair fell about her shoulders in profusion undying coquetry awoke by the faint light of her nocturnal rush she stood before the lookingglass carried her shapely arms above her head and gathered up the treasures of her tresses she was never backward to admire herself that kind of modesty was a stranger to her nature and she paused struck with a pleased wonder at the sight ye daft auld wife she said answering a thought that was not and she blushed with the innocent consciousness of a child hastily she did up the massive and shining coils hastily donned a wrapper and with the rushlight in her hand stole into the hall below stairs she heard the clock ticking the deliberate seconds and frank jingling with the decanters in the diningroom aversion rose in her bitter and momentary nesty tippling puggy she thought and the next moment she had knocked guardedly at archies door and was bidden enter  archie had been looking out into the ancient blackness pierced here and there with a rayless star taking the sweet air of the moors and the night into his bosom deeply seeking perhaps finding peace after the manner of the unhappy he turned round as she came in and showed her a pale face against the windowframe  is that you kirstie he asked come in  its unco late my dear said kirstie affecting unwillingness  no no he answered not at all come in if you want a crack i am not sleepy god knows  she advanced took a chair by the toilettable and the candle and set the rushlight at her foot somethingit might be in the comparative disorder of her dress it might be the emotion that now welled in her bosomhad touched her with a wand of transformation and she seemed young with the youth of goddesses  mr erchie she began whats this thats come to ye  i am not aware of anything that has come said archie and blushed and repented bitterly that he had let her in  o my dear thatll no dae said kirstie its ill to blend the eyes of love o mr erchie tak a thocht ere its ower late ye shouldna be impatient o the braws o life theyll a come in their saison like the sun and the rain yere young yet yeve mony cantie years afore ye see and dinna wreck yersel at the outset like sae mony ithers hae

o the fearsome tempest cryin on the hills to cover ye  why kirstie youre very enigmatical tonightand very eloquent archie put in  and my dear mr erchie she continued with a change of voice ye maunna think that i canna sympathise wi ye ye maunna think that i havena been young mysel lang syne when i was a bit lassie no twenty yet she paused and sighed clean and caller wi a fit like the hinney bee she continued i was aye big and buirdly ye maun understand a bonny figure o a woman though i say it that suldnabuilt to rear bairnsbraw bairns they suld hae been and grand i would hae likit it but i

he was here i could take care o mysel and can yon puir lassie  kirstie her eyes shining with unshed tears stretched out her hand towards him appealingly the bright and the dull gold of her hair flashed and smouldered in the coils behind her comely head like the rays of an eternal youth the pure colour had risen in her face and archie was abashed alike by her beauty and her story he came towards her slowly from the window took up her hand in his and kissed it  kirstie he said hoarsely you have misjudged me sorely i have always thought of her i wouldna harm her for the universe my woman  eh lad and thats easy sayin cried kirstie but its nane sae easy doin man do ye no comprehend that its gods wull we should be blendit and glamoured and have nae command over our ain members at a time like that my bairn she cried still holding his hand think o the puir lass have pity upon her erchie and o be wise for twa think o the risk she rins i have seen ye and whats to prevent ithers i saw ye once in the hags in my ain howf and i was wae to see ye therein pairt for the omen for i think theres a weird on the placeand in pairt for pure nakit envy and bitterness o hairt its strange ye

in her eyes  i swear by my honour i have done her no wrong said archie i swear by my honour and the redemption of my soul that there shall none be done her i have heard of this before i have been foolish kirstie but not unkind and above all not base  theres my bairn said kirstie rising ill can trust ye noo ill can gang to my bed wi an easy hairt and then she saw in a flash how barren had been her triumph archie had promised to spare the girl and he would keep it but who had promised to spare archie what was to be the end of it over a maze of difficulties she glanced and saw at the end of every passage the flinty countenance of hermiston and a kind of horror fell upon her at what she had done she wore a tragic mask erchie the lord peety you dear and peety me i have buildit on this foundationlaying her hand heavily on his shoulderand buildit hie and pit my hairt in the buildin of it if the hale hypothec were to fa i think laddie i would dee excuse a daft wife that loves ye and

collieshangie o the wunds mind maister erchie dear that this lifes a disappointment and a mouthfu o mools is the appointed end  ay but kirstie my woman youre asking me ower much at last said archie profoundly moved and lapsing into the broad scots yere asking what nae man can grant ye what only the lord of heaven can grant ye if he see fit ay and can even he i can promise ye what i shall do and you can depend on that but how i shall feelmy woman that is long past thinking of  they were both standing by now opposite each other the face of archie wore the wretched semblance of a smile hers was convulsed for a moment  promise me ae thing she cried in a sharp voice promise me yell never do naething without telling me  no kirstie i canna promise ye that he replied i have promised enough god kens  may the blessing of god lift and rest upon ye dear she said  god bless ye my old friend said he     chapter ix  at the weavers stone   it was late in the afternoon when archie drew near by the hill path to the praying weavers stone the hags were in shadow but still through the gate of the slap the sun shot a last arrow which sped far and straight across the surface of the moss here and there touching and shining on a tussock and lighted at length on the gravestone and the small figure awaiting him there the emptiness and solitude of the great moors seemed to be concentred there and kirstie pointed out by that finger of sunshine for the only inhabitant his first sight of her was thus excruciatingly sad like a glimpse of a world from which all light comfort and society were on the point of vanishing and the next moment when she had turned her face to him and the quick smile had enlightened it the whole face of nature smiled upon him in her smile of welcome archies slow pace was quickened his legs hasted to her though his heart was hanging back the girl upon her side drew herself together slowly and stood up expectant she was all languor her face was gone white her arms ached for him her soul was on tiptoes but he deceived her pausing a few steps away not less white than herself and holding up his hand with a gesture of denial  no christina not today he said today i have to talk to you seriously sit ye down please there where you were please he repeated  the revulsion of feeling in christinas heart was violent to have longed and waited these weary hours for him rehearsing her endearmentsto have seen him at last cometo have been ready there breathless wholly passive his to do what he would withand suddenly to have found herself confronted with a greyfaced harsh schoolmasterit was too rude a shock she could have wept but pride withheld her she sat down on the stone from which she had arisen part with the instinct of obedience part as though she had been thrust there what was this why was she rejected had she ceased to please she stood here offering her wares and he would none of them and yet they were all his his to take and keep not his to refuse though in her quick petulant nature a moment ago on fire with hope thwarted love and wounded vanity wrought the schoolmaster that there is in all men to the despair of all girls and most women was now completely in possession of archie he had passed a night of sermons a day of reflection he had come wound up to do his duty and the set mouth which in him only betrayed the effort of his will to her seemed the expression of an averted heart it was the same with his constrained voice and embarrassed utterance and if soif it was all overthe pang of the thought took away from her the power of thinking  he stood before her some way off kirstie theres been too much of this weve seen too much of each other she looked up quickly and her eyes contracted theres no good ever comes of these secret meetings theyre not frank not honest truly and i ought to have seen it people have begun to talk and its not right of me do you see  i see somebody will have been talking to ye she said sullenly  they havemore than one of them replied archie  and whae were they she cried and what kind o love do ye ca that thats ready to gang round like a whirligig at folk talking do ye think they havena talked to me  have they indeed said archie with a quick breath that is what i feared who were they who has dare  archie was on the point of losing his temper  as a matter of fact not any one had talked to christina on the matter and she strenuously repeated her own first question in a panic of selfdefence  ah well what does it matter he said they were good folk that wished well to us and the great affair is that there are people talking my dear girl we have to be wise we must not wreck our lives at the outset they may be long and happy yet and we must see to it kirstie like gods rational creatures and not like fool children there is one thing we must see to before all youre worth waiting for kirstie worth waiting for a generation it would be enough rewardand here he remembered the schoolmaster again and very unwisely took to following wisdom the first thing that we must see to is that there shall be no scandal about for my fathers sake that would ruin all do ye no see that  kirstie was a little pleased there had been some show of warmth of sentiment in what archie had said last but the dull irritation still persisted in her bosom with the aboriginal instinct having suffered herself she wished to make archie suffer  and besides there had come out the word she had always feared to hear from his lips the name of his father it is not to be supposed that during so many days with a love avowed between them some reference had not been made to their conjoint future it had in fact been often touched upon and from the first had been the sore point kirstie had wilfully closed the eye of thought she would not argue even with herself gallant desperate little heart she had accepted the command of that supreme attraction like the call of fate and marched blindfold on her doom but archie with his masculine sense of responsibility must reason he must dwell on some future good when the present good was all in all to kirstie he must talkand talk lamely as necessity drove himof what was to be again and again he had touched on marriage again and again been driven back into indistinctness by a memory of lord hermiston and kirstie had been swift to understand and quick to choke down and smother the understanding swift to leap up in flame at a mention of that hope which spoke volumes to her vanity and her love that she might one day be mrs weir of hermiston swift also to recognise in his stumbling or throttled utterance the deathknell of these expectations and constant poor girl in her largeminded madness to go on and to reck nothing of the future but these unfinished references these blinks in which his heart spoke and his memory and reason rose up to silence it before the words were well uttered gave her unqualifiable agony she was raised up and dashed down again bleeding the recurrence of the subject forced her for however short a time to open her eyes on what she did not wish to see and it had invariably ended in another disappointment so now again at the mere wind of its coming at the mere mention of his fathers namewho might seem indeed to have accompanied them in their whole moorland courtship an awful figure in a wig with an ironical and bitter smile present to guilty consciousnessshe fled from it head down  ye havena told me yet she said who was it spoke  your aunt for one said archie  auntie kirstie she cried and what do i care for my auntie kirstie  she cares a great deal for her niece replied archie in kind reproof  troth and its the first ive heard of it retorted the girl  the question here is not who it is but what they say what they have noticed pursued the lucid schoolmaster that is what we have to think of in selfdefence  auntie kirstie indeed a bitter thrawn auld maid thats fomented trouble in the country before i was born and will be doing it still i daur say when im deid its in her nature its as natural for her as its for a sheep to eat  pardon me kirstie she was not the only one interposed archie i had two warnings two sermons last night both most kind and considerate had you been there i promise you you would have grat my dear and they opened my eyes i saw we were going a wrong way  who was the other one kirstie demanded  by this time archie was in the condition of a hunted beast he had come braced and resolute he was to trace out a line of conduct for the pair of them in a few cold convincing sentences he had now been there some time and he was still staggering round the outworks and undergoing what he felt to be a savage crossexamination  mr frank she cried what nex i would like to ken  he spoke most kindly and truly  what like did he say  i am not going to tell you you have nothing to do with that cried archie startled to find he had admitted so much  o i have naething to do with it she repeated springing to her feet abody at hermistons free to pass their opinions upon me but i have naething to do wi it was this at prayers like did ye ca the grieve into the consultation little wonder if abodys talking when ye make abody yer confidants but as you say mr weir most kindly most considerately most truly im surei have naething to do with it and i think ill better be going ill be wishing you good evening mr weir and she made him a stately curtsey shaking as she did so from head to foot with the barren ecstasy of temper  poor archie stood dumbfounded she had moved some steps away from him before he recovered the gift of articulate speech  kirstie he cried o kirstie woman  there was in his voice a ring of appeal a clang of mere astonishment that showed the schoolmaster was vanquished  she turned round on him what do ye kirstie me for she retorted what have ye to do wi me gang to your ain freends and deave them  he could only repeat the appealing kirstie  kirstie indeed cried the girl her eyes blazing in her white face my name is miss christina elliott i would have ye to ken and i daur ye to ca me out of it if i canna get love ill have respect mr weir im come of decent people and ill have respect what have i done that ye should lightly me what have i done what have i done o what have i done and her voice rose upon the third repetition i thochti thochti thocht i was sae happy and the first sob broke from her like the paroxysm of some mortal sickness  archie ran to her he took the poor child in his arms and she nestled to his breast as to a mothers and clasped him in hands that were strong like vices he felt her whole body shaken by the throes of distress and had pity upon her beyond speech pity and at the same time a bewildered fear of this explosive engine in his arms whose works he did not understand and yet had been tampering with there arose from before him the curtains of boyhood and he saw for the first time the ambiguous face of woman as she is in vain he looked back over the interview he saw not where he had offended it seemed unprovoked a wilful convulsion of brute nature     sir sidney colvins note   with the words last printed a wilful convulsion of brute nature the romance of weir of hermiston breaks off they were dictated i believe on the very morning of the writers sudden seizure and death weir of hermiston thus remains in the work of stevenson what edwin drood is in the work of dickens or denis duval in that of thackeray or rather it remains relatively more for if each of those fragments holds an honourable place among its authors writings among stevensons the fragment of weir holds at least to my mind certainly the highest  readers may be divided in opinion on the question whether they would or they would not wish to hear more of the intended course of the story and destinies of the characters to some silence may seem best and that the mind should be left to its own conjectures as to the sequel with the help of such indications as the text affords i confess that this is the view which has my sympathy but since others and those almost certainly a majority are anxious to be told all they can and since editors and publishers join in the request i can scarce do otherwise than comply the intended argument then so far as it was known at the time of the writers death to his stepdaughter and devoted amanuensis mrs strong was nearly as follows                                       archie persists in his good resolution of avoiding further conduct compromising to young kirsties good name taking advantage of the situation thus created and of the girls unhappiness and wounded vanity frank innes pursues his purpose of seduction and kirstie though still caring for archie in her heart allows herself to become franks victim old kirstie is the first to perceive something amiss with her and believing archie to be the culprit accuses him thus making him aware for the first time that mischief has happened he does not at once deny the charge but seeks out and questions young kirstie who confesses the truth to him and he still loving her promises to protect and defend her in her trouble he then has an interview with frank innes on the moor which ends in a quarrel and in archie killing frank beside the weavers stone meanwhile the four black brothers having become aware of their sisters betrayal are bent on vengeance against archie as her supposed seducer but their vengeance is forestalled by his arrest for the murder of frank he is tried before his own father the lord justiceclerk found guilty and condemned to death meanwhile the elder kirstie having discovered from the girl how matters really stand informs her nephews of the truth and they in a great revulsion of feeling in archies favour determine on an action after the ancient manner of their house they gather a following and after a great fight break the prison where archie lies confined and rescue him he and young kirstie thereafter escape to america but the ordeal of taking part in the trial of his own son has been too much for the lord justiceclerk who dies of the shock i do not know adds the amanuensis what becomes of old kirstie but that character grew and strengthened so in the writing that i am sure he had some dramatic destiny for her                                       the plan of every imaginative work is subject of course to change under the artists hand as he carries it out and not merely the character of the elder kirstie but other elements of the design no less might well have deviated from the lines originally traced it seems certain however that the next stage in the relations of archie and the younger kirstie would have been as above foreshadowed and this conception of the lovers unconventional chivalry and unshaken devotion to his mistress after her fault is very characteristic of the writers mind the vengeance to be taken on the seducer beside the weavers stone is prepared for in the first words of the introduction and in the spring of 1894 the author rehearsed in conversation with a visitor mr sidney lysaght a scene where the girl was to confess to her lover in prison that she was with child by the man he had killed the situation and fate of the judge confronting like a brutus but unable to survive the duty of sending his own son to the gallows seem clearly to have been destined to furnish the climax and essential tragedy of the tale  how this last circumstance was to have been brought about within the limits of legal usage and possibility seems hard to conjecture but it was a point to which the author had evidently given careful consideration mrs strong says simply that the lord justiceclerk like an old roman condemns his son to death but i am assured on the best legal authority of scotland that no judge however powerful either by character or office could have insisted on presiding at the trial of a near kinsman of his own the lord justiceclerk was head of the criminal justiciary of the country he might have insisted on his right of being present on the bench when his son was tried but he would never have been allowed to preside or to pass sentence now in a letter of stevensons to mr baxter of october 1892 i find him asking for materials in terms which seem to indicate that he knew this quite welli wish pitcairns criminal trials quam primum also an absolutely correct text of the scots judiciary oath also in case pitcairn does not come down late enough i wish as full a report as possible of a scots murder trial between 17901820 understand the fullest possible is there any book which would guide me to the following facts the justiceclerk tries some people capitally on circuit certain evidence cropping up the charge is transferred to the justiceclerks own son of course in the next trial the justiceclerk is excluded and the case is called before the lord justicegeneral where would this trial have to be i fear in edinburgh which would not suit my view could it be again at the circuit town the point was referred to a quondam fellowmember with stevenson of the edinburgh speculative society mr graham murray the present lord advocate for scotland whose reply was to the effect that there would be no difficulty in making the new trial take place at the circuit town that it would have to be held there in spring or autumn before two lords of justiciary and that the lord justicegeneral would have nothing to do with it this title being at the date in question only a nominal one held by a layman which is no longer the case on this stevenson writes graham murrays note re the venue was highly satisfactory and did me all the good in the world the terms of his inquiry imply clearly that he intended other persons before archie to have fallen under suspicion of the murder what other persons and alsodoubtless in order to make the rescue by the black brothers possiblethat he wanted archie to be imprisoned not in edinburgh but in the circuit town can it have been that lord hermistons part was to have been limited to presiding at the first trial where the persons wrongly suspected were to have been judged and to directing that the law should take its course when evidence incriminating his own son was unexpectedly brought forward  whether the final escape and union of archie and christina would have proved equally essential to the plot may perhaps to most readers seem questionable they may rather feel that a tragic destiny is foreshadowed from the beginning for all concerned and is inherent in the very conditions of the tale but on this point and other matters of general criticism connected with it i find an interesting discussion by the author himself in his correspondence writing to mr j m barrie under date november 1 1892 and criticising that authors famous story of the little minister stevenson says  your descriptions of your dealings with lord rintoul are frightfully unconscientious the little minister ought to have ended badly we all know it did and we are infinitely grateful to you for the grace and good feeling with which you have lied about it if you had told the truth i for one could never have forgiven you as you had conceived and written the earlier parts the truth about the end though indisputably true to fact would have been a lie or what is worse a discord in art if you are going to make a book end badly it must end badly from the beginning now your book began to end well you let yourself fall in love with and fondle and smile at your puppets once you had done that your honour was committed at the cost of truth to life you were bound to save them it is the blot on richard feverel for instance that it begins to end well and then tricks you and ends ill but in this case there is worse behind for the ill ending does not inherently issue from the plotthe story had in fact ended well after the great last interview between richard and lucyand the blind illogical bullet which smashes all has no more to do between the boards than a fly has to do with a room into whose open window it comes buzzing it might have so happened it needed not and unless needs must we have no right to pain our readers i have had a heavy case of conscience of the same kind about my braxfield story braxfieldonly his name is hermistonhas a son who is condemned to death plainly there is a fine tempting fitness about this and i meant he was to hang but on considering my minor characters i saw there were five people who wouldin a sense who mustbreak prison and attempt his rescue they are capable hardy folks too who might very well succeed why should they not then why should not young hermiston escape clear out of the country and be happy if he could with hisbut soft i will not betray my secret nor my heroine  to pass now from the question how the story would have ended to the question how it originated and grew in the writers mind the character of the hero weir of hermiston is avowedly suggested by the historical personality of robert macqueen lord braxfield this famous judge has been for generations the subject of a hundred edinburgh tales and anecdotes readers of stevensons essay on the raeburn exhibition in virginibus puerisque will remember how he is fascinated by raeburns portrait of braxfield even as lockhart had been fascinated by a different portrait of the same worthy sixty years before see peters letters to his kinsfolk nor did his interest in the character diminish in later life  again the case of a judge involved by the exigencies of his office in a strong conflict between public duty and private interest or affection was one which had always attracted and exercised stevensons imagination in the days when he and mr henley were collaborating with a view to the stage mr henley once proposed a plot founded on the story of mr justice harbottle in sheridan le fanus in a glass darkly in which the wicked judge goes headlong per fas et nefas to his object of getting the husband of his mistress hanged some time later stevenson and his wife together drafted a play called the hanging judge in this the title character is tempted for the first time in his life to tamper with the course of justice in order to shield his wife from persecution by a former husband who reappears after being supposed dead bulwers novel of paul clifford with its final situation of the worldlyminded judge sir william brandon learning that the highwayman whom he is in the act of sentencing is his own son and dying of the knowledge was also well known to stevenson and probably counted for something in the suggestion of the present story  once more the difficulties often attending the relation of father and son in actual life had pressed heavily on stevensons mind and conscience from the days of his youth when in obeying the law of his own nature he had been constrained to disappoint distress and for a time to be much misunderstood by a father whom he justly loved and admired with all his heart difficulties of this kind he had already handled in a lighter vein once or twice in fictionas for instance in the story of a lie the misadventures of john nicholson and the wreckerbefore he grappled with them in the acute and tragic phase in which they occur in the present story  these three elements then the interest of the historical personality of lord braxfield the problems and emotions arising from a violent conflict between duty and nature in a judge and the difficulties due to incompatibility and misunderstanding between father and son lie at the foundations of the present story to touch on minor matters it is perhaps worth notice as mr henley reminds me that the name of weir had from of old a special significance for stevensons imagination from the horrible and true tale of the burning in edinburgh of major weir the warlock and his sister another name that of the episodical personage of mr torrance the minister is borrowed direct from life as indeed are the whole figure and its surroundingskirkyard kirk and mansedown even to the black thread mittens witness the following passage from a letter of the early seventiesive been to church and am not depresseda great step it was at that beautiful church of glencorse in the pentlands three miles from his fathers country house at swanston it is a little cruciform place with a steep slate roof the small kirkyard is full of old gravestones one of a frenchman from dunkerque i suppose he died prisoner in the military prison hard by and one the most pathetic memorial i ever saw a poor schoolslate in a wooden frame with the inscription cut into it evidently by the fathers own hand in church old mr torrance preached over eighty and a relic of times forgotten with his black thread gloves and mild old face a side hint for a particular trait in the character of mrs weir we can trace in some family traditions concerning the writers own grandmother who is reported to have valued piety much more than efficiency in her domestic servants i know of no original for that new and admirable incarnation of the eternal feminine in the elder kirstie the little that stevenson says about her himself is in a letter written a few days before his death to mr gosse the allusions are to the various views and attitudes of people in regard to middle age and are suggested by mr gosses volume of poems in russet and silver it seems rather funny he writes that this matter should come up just now as i am at present engaged in treating a severe case of middle age in one of my stories the justiceclerk the case is that of a woman and i think i am doing her justice you will be interested i believe to see the difference in our treatments secreta vitae the title of one of mr gosses poems comes nearer to the case of my poor kirstie from the quality of the midnight scene between her and archie we may judge what we have lost in those later scenes where she was to have taxed him with the fault that was not histo have presently learned his innocence from the lips of his supposed victimto have then vindicated him to her kinsmen and fired them to the action of his rescue the scene of the prisonbreaking here planned by stevenson would have gained interest as will already have occurred to readers from comparison with the two famous precedents in scott the porteous mob and the breaking of portanferry gaol  the best account of stevensons methods of imaginative work is in the following sentences from a letter of his own to mr w craibe angus of glasgowi am still a slow study and sit for a long while silent on my eggs unconscious thought there is the only method macerate your subject let it boil slow then take the lid off and look inand there your stuff isgood or bad the several elements above noted having been left to work for many years in his mind it was in the autumn of 1892 that he was moved to take the lid off and look inunder the influence it would seem of a special and overmastering wave of that feeling for the romance of scottish scenery and character which was at all times so strong in him and which his exile did so much to intensify i quote again from his letter to mr barrie on november 1st in that yearit is a singular thing that i should live here in the south seas under conditions so new and so striking and yet my imagination so continually inhabit the cold old huddle of grey hills from which we come i have finished david balfour i have another book on the stocks the young chevalier which is to be part in france and part in scotland and to deal with prince charlie about the year 1749 and now what have i done but begun a third which is to be all moorland together and is to have for a centrepiece a figure that i think you will appreciatethat of the immortal braxfield braxfield himself is my grand premieror since you are so much involved in the british drama let me say my heavy lead  writing to me at the same date he makes the same announcement more briefly with a list of the characters and an indication of the scene and date of the story to mr baxter he writes a month later i have a novel on the stocks to be called the justiceclerk it is pretty scotch the grand premier is taken from braxfield o by the by send me cockburns memorials and some of the story is well queer the heroine is seduced by one man and finally disappears with the other man who shot him mind you i expect the justiceclerk to be my masterpiece my braxfield is already a thing of beauty and a joy for ever and so far as he has gone far my best character from the last extract it appears that he had already at this date drafted some of the earlier chapters of the book he also about the same time composed the dedication to his wife who found it pinned to her bedcurtains one morning on awaking it was always his habit to keep several books in progress at the same time turning from one to another as the fancy took him and finding relief in the change of labour and for many months after the date of this letter first illnessthen a voyage to aucklandthen work on the ebbtide on a new tale called st ives which was begun during an attack of influenza and on his projected book of family historyprevented his making any continuous progress with weir in august 1893 he says he has been recasting the beginning a year later still only the first four or five chapters had been drafted then in the last weeks of his life he attacked the task again in a sudden heat of inspiration and worked at it ardently and without interruption until the end came no wonder if during these weeks he was sometimes aware of a tension of the spirit difficult to sustain how can i keep this pitch he is reported to have said after finishing one of the chapters and all the world knows how that frail organism overtaxed so long in fact betrayed him in mid effort  with reference to the speech and manners of the hanging judge himself that they are not a whit exaggerated in comparison with what is recorded of his historic prototype lord braxfield is certain the locus classicus in regard to this personage is in lord cockburns memorials of his time strong built and dark with rough eyebrows powerful eyes threatening lips and a low growling voice he was like a formidable blacksmith his accent and dialect were exaggerated scotch his language like his thoughts short strong and conclusive illiterate and without any taste for any refined enjoyment strength of understanding which gave him power without cultivation only encouraged him to a more contemptuous disdain of all natures less coarse than his own it may be doubted if he was ever so much in his element as when tauntingly repelling the last despairing claim of a wretched culprit and sending him to botany bay or the gallows with an insulting jest yet this was not from cruelty for which he was too strong and too jovial but from cherished coarseness readers nevertheless who are at all acquainted with the social history of scotland will hardly have failed to make the observation that braxfields is an extreme case of eighteenthcentury manners as he himself was an eighteenthcentury personage he died in 1799 in his seventyeighth year and that for the date in which the story is cast 1814 such manners are somewhat of an anachronism during the generation contemporary with the french revolution and the napoleonic warsor to put it another way the generation that elapsed between the days when scott roamed the country as a high school and university student and those when he settled in the fulness of fame and prosperity at abbotsfordor again the allusions will appeal to readers of the admirable galt during the interval between the first and the last provostry of bailie pawkie in the borough of gudetown or between the earlier and final ministrations of mr balwhidder in the parish of dalmailingduring this period a great softening had taken place in scottish manners generally and in those of the bar and bench not least since the death of lord justiceclerk macqueen of braxfield says lockhart writing about 1817 the whole exterior of judicial deportment has been quite altered a similar criticism may probably hold good on the picture of border life contained in the chapter concerning the four black brothers of cauldstaneslap namely that it rather suggests the ways of an earlier generation nor have i any clue to the reasons which led stevenson to choose this particular date in the year preceding waterloo for a story which in regard to some of its features at least might seem more naturally placed some quarter or even half a century earlier  if the reader seeks further to know whether the scenery of hermiston can be identified with any one special place familiar to the writers early experience the answer i think must be in the negative rather it is distilled from a number of different haunts and associations among the moorlands of southern scotland in the dedication and in a letter to me he indicates the lammermuirs as the scene of his tragedy and mrs stevenson his mother told me that she thought he was inspired by recollections of a visit paid in boyhood to an uncle living at a remote farmhouse in that district called overshiels in the parish of stow but though he may have thought of the lammermuirs in the first instance we have already found him drawing his description of the kirk and manse from another haunt of his youth namely glencorse in the pentlands while passages in chapters v and viii point explicitly to a third district that is upper tweeddale with the country stretching thence towards the wells of clyde with this country also holiday rides and excursions from peebles had made him familiar as a boy and on the whole it is this which best answers the geographical indications of the story some of the placenames are clearly not meant to furnish literal indications the spango for instance is a water running i believe not into the tweed but into the nith crossmichael as the name of a town is borrowed from galloway but it may be taken to all intents and purposes as standing for peebles where i am told by sir george douglas there existed in the early years of the century a wellknown club of the same character as that described in the story lastly the name hermiston itself is taken from a farm on the water of ale between ettrick and teviotdale and close to the proper country of the elliotts  but it is with the general and essential that the artist deals and questions of strict historical perspective or local definition are beside the mark in considering his work nor will any reader expect or be grateful for comment in this place on matters which are more properly to the pointon the seizing and penetrating power of the authors ripened art as exhibited in the foregoing pages his vital
