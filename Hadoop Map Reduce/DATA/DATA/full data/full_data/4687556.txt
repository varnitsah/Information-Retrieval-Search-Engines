4687556	the lighthouse by rm ballantyne    chapter one  the rock  early on a summer morning about the beginning of the nineteenth century two fishermen of forfarshire wended their way to the shore launched their boat and put off to sea  one of the men was tall and illfavoured the other short and wellfavoured  both were squarebuilt powerful fellows like most men of the class to which they belonged  it was about that calm hour of the morning which precedes sunrise when most living creatures are still asleep and inanimate nature wears more than at other times the semblance of repose  the sea was like a sheet of undulating glass  a breeze had been expected but in defiance of expectation it had not come so the boatmen were obliged to use their oars  they used them well however insomuch that the land ere long appeared like a blue line on the horizon then became tremulous and indistinct and finally vanished in the mists of morning  the men pulled with a willas seamen pithily express itand in silence  only once during the first hour did the big illfavoured man venture a remark  referring to the absence of wind he said that it would be a the better for landin on the rock  this was said in the broadest vernacular dialect as indeed was everything that dropped from the fishermens lips  we take the liberty of modifying it a little believing that strict fidelity here would entail inevitable loss of sense to many of our readers  the remark such as it was called forth a rejoinder from the short comrade who stated his belief that they would be likely to find somethin there that day  they then relapsed into silence  under the regular stroke of the oars the boat advanced steadily straight out to sea  at first the mirror over which they skimmed was grey and the foam at the cutwater leadencoloured  by degrees they rowed as it were into a brighter region  the sea ahead lightened up became pale yellow then warmed into saffron and when the sun rose blazed into liquid gold  the words spoken by the boatmen though few were significant  the rock alluded to was the celebrated and much dreaded inch capemore familiarly known as the bell rockwhich being at that time unmarked by lighthouse or beacon of any kind was the terror of mariners who were making for the firths of forth and tay  the something that was expected to be found there may be guessed at when we say that one of the fiercest storms that ever swept our eastern shores had just exhausted itself after strewing the coast with wrecks  the breast of ocean though calm on the surface as has been said was still heaving with a mighty swell from the effects of the recent elemental conflict  dye see the breakers noo davy enquired the illfavoured man who pulled the aft oar  ay and hear them too said davy spink ceasing to row and looking over his shoulder towards the seaward horizon  yer een and lugs are better than mine then returned the illfavoured comrade who answered when among his friends to the name of big swankie otherwise and more correctly jock swankie  od  i believe yere right he added shading his heavy red brows with his heavier and redder hand that is the rock but a man wad need the een o an eagle to see onything in the face o sik a bleezin sun  pull awa davy well hae time to catch a bit cod or a haddy afore the rocks bare  influenced by these encouraging hopes the stout pair urged their boat in the direction of a thin line of snowwhite foam that lay apparently many miles away but which was in reality not very far distant  by degrees the white line expanded in size and became massive as though a huge breaker were rolling towards them ever and anon jets of foam flew high into the air from various parts of the mass like smoke from a cannons mouth  presently a low continuous roar became audible above the noise of the oars as the boat advanced the swells from the southeast could be seen towering upwards as they neared the foaming spot gradually changing their broadbacked form and coming on in majestic walls of green water which fell with indescribable grandeur into the seething caldron  no rocks were visible there was no apparent cause for this wild confusion in the midst of the otherwise calm sea but the fishermen knew that the bell rock was underneath the foam and that in less than an hour its jagged peaks would be left uncovered by the falling tide  as the swell of the sea came in from the eastward there was a belt of smooth water on the west side of the rock  here the fishermen cast anchor and baiting their handlines began to fish  at first they were unsuccessful but before half an hour had elapsed the cod began to nibble and big swankie ere long hauled up a fish of goodly size  davy spink followed suit and in a few minutes a dozen fish lay spluttering in the bottom of the boat  times up noo said swankie coiling away his line  stop stop heres a wallupper cried davy who was an excitable man we better fish a while langerbring the cleek swankie hes ower big tonoo lad cleek him thats itohooo  the prolonged groan with which davy brought his speech to a sudden termination was in consequence of the line breaking and the fish escaping just as swankie was about to strike the iron hook into its side  hech lad that was a guid ane said the disappointed man with a sigh but hes awa  ay observed swankie and we must awa too so up anchor lad  the rocks lookin oot o the sea and times precious  the anchor was speedily pulled up and they rowed towards the rock the ragged edges of which were now visible at intervals in the midst of the foam which they created  at low tide an irregular portion of the bell rock less than a hundred yards in length and fifty yards in breadth is uncovered and left exposed for two or three hours  it does not appear in the form of a single mass or islet but in a succession of serrated ledges of various heights between and amongst which the sea flows until the tide has fallen pretty low  at full ebb the rock appears like a dark islet covered with seaweed and studded with deep pools of water most of which are connected with the sea by narrow channels running between the ledges  the highest part of the rock does not rise more than seven feet above the level of the sea at the lowest tide  to enter one of the pools by means of the channels above referred to is generally a matter of difficulty and often of extreme danger as the swell of the sea even in calm weather bursts over these ledges with such violence as to render the channels at times impassable  the utmost caution therefore is necessary  our fishermen however were accustomed to land there occasionally in search of the remains of wrecks and knew their work well  they approached the rock on the leeside which was as has been said to the westward  to a spectator viewing them from any point but from the boat itself it would have appeared that the reckless men were sailing into the jaws of certain death for the breakers burst around them so confusedly in all directions that their instant destruction seemed inevitable  but davy spink looking over his shoulder as he sat at the bowoar saw a narrow lead of comparatively still water in the midst of the foam along which he guided the boat with consummate skill giving only a word or two of direction to swankie who instantly acted in accordance therewith  pull pull lad said davy  swankie pulled and the boat swept round with its bow to the east just in time to meet a billow which towering high above its fellows burst completely over the rocks and appeared to be about to sweep away all before it  for a moment the boat was as if embedded in snow then it sank once more into the lead among the floating tangle and the men pulled with might and main in order to escape the next wave  they were just in time  it burst over the same rocks with greater violence than its predecessor but the boat had gained the shelter of the next ledge and lay floating securely in the deep quiet pool within while the men rested on their oars and watched the chaos of the water rush harmlessly by  in another moment they had landed and secured the boat to a projecting rock  few words of conversation passed between these practical men  they had gone there on particular business  time and tide proverbially wait for no man but at the bell rock they wait a much briefer period than elsewhere  between low water and the time when it would be impossible to quit the rock without being capsized there was only a space of two or three hourssometimes more frequently lessso it behoved the men to economise time  rocks covered with wet seaweed and rugged in form are not easy to walk over a fact which was soon proved by swankie staggering violently once or twice and by spink falling flat on his back  neither paid attention to his comrades misfortunes in this way  each scrambled about actively searching with care among the crevices of the rocks and from time to time picking up articles which they thrust into their pockets or laid on their shoulders according as weight and dimensions required  in a short time they returned to their boat pretty well laden  weel lad what luck enquired spink as swankie and he metthe former with a grappling iron on his shoulder the latter staggering under the weight of a mass of metal  not much replied swankie nothin but heavy metal this mornin only a bit of a cookin stove an a cannon shotthats all  never mind try again  there must ha bin two or three wrecks on the rock this gale said davy as he and his friend threw their burdens into the boat and hastened to resume the search  at first spink was the more successful of the two  he returned to the boat with various articles more than once while his comrade continued his rambles unsuccessfully  at last however big swankie came to a gully or inlet where a large mass of the debris of a wreck was piled up in indescribable confusion in the midst of which lay the dead body of an old man  swankies first impulse was to shout to his companion but he checked himself and proceeded to examine the pockets of the dead man  raising the corpse with some difficulty he placed it on the ledge of rock  observing a ring on the little finger of the right hand he removed it and put it hastily in his pocket  then he drew a red morocco case from an inner breast pocket in the dead mans coat  to his surprise and delight he found that it contained a gold watch and several gold rings and brooches in some of which were beautiful stones swankie was no judge of jewellery but he could not avoid the conviction that these things must needs be valuable  he laid the case down on the rock beside him and eagerly searched the other pockets  in one he found a large claspknife and a pencilcase in another a leather purse which felt heavy as he drew it out  his eyes sparkled at the first glance he got of the contents for they were sovereigns  just as he made this discovery davy spink climbed over the ledge at his back and swankie hastily thrust the purse underneath the body of the dead man  hallo lad what have ye there  hey watches and ringscome were in luck this mornin  we exclaimed swankie somewhat sternly you didnt find that case  na lad but weve aye divided an i dinna see what for we should change our plan noo  weve nae paction to that effecthe case o kickshaws is mine retorted swankie  half ot suggested spink  weel weel cried the other with affected carelessness id scorn to be sae graspin  for the matter o that ye may hae it all to yersel but ill hae the next thing we git thats worth muckle a to mysel  so saying swankie stooped to continue his search of the body and in a moment or two drew out the purse with an exclamation of surprise  see im in luck davy  virtues aye rewarded they say  this is mine and i doot not therell be some siller intilt  goold cried davy with dilated eyes as his comrade emptied the contents into his large hand and counted over thirty sovereigns  ay lad ye can keep the whatdyecaums and ill keep the siller  ive seen that face before observed spink looking intently at the body  like enough said swankie with an air of indifference as he put the gold into his pocket  i think ive seed it mysel  it looks like auld jamie brand but i didna ken him weel  its just him said spink with a touch of sadness  ay ay thatll fa heavy on the auld woman  but come itll no do to stand haverin this way  lets see what else is on him  they found nothing more of any value but a piece of paper was discovered wrapped up in oilskin and carefully fastened with red tape in the vest pocket of the dead man  it contained writing and had been so securely wrapped up that it was only a little damped  davy spink who found it tried in vain to read the writing davys education had been neglected so he was fain to confess that he could not make it out  let me seet said swankie  what hae we here  the sloop is hard anan  fast maybe suggested spink  ay so tis  i canna make out the next word but heres something about the jewelcase  the man paused and gazed earnestly at the paper for a few minutes with a look of perplexity on his rugged visage  weel man what ist enquired davy  hoot  i canna mak it oot said the other testily as if annoyed at being unable to read it  he refolded the paper and thrust it into his bosom saying come were wastin time  lets get on wi our wark  toss for the jewels and the siller said spink suggestively  very weel replied the other producing a copper  heeds you win the siller tails i win the boxheeds it is so the kickshaws is mine weel im content he added as he handed the bag of gold to his comrade and received the jewelcase in exchange  in another hour the sea began to encroach on the rock and the fishermen having collected as much as time would permit of the wrecked materials returned to their boat  they had secured altogether above two hundredweight of old metal namely a large piece of a ships caboose a hinge a lock of a door a ships markingiron a soldiers bayonet a cannon ball a shoebuckle and a small anchor besides part of the cordage of the wreck and the money and jewels before mentioned  placing the heavier of these things in the bottom of the boat they pushed off  we better take the corp ashore said spink suddenly  what for  they may ask what was in the pockets objected swankie  let them ask rejoined the other with a grin  swankie made no reply but gave a stroke with his oar which sent the boat close up to the rocks  they both relanded in silence and lifting the dead body of the old man laid it in the sternsheets of the boat once more they pushed off  too much delay had been already made  the surf was breaking over the ledges in all directions and it was with the utmost difficulty that they succeeded in getting clear out into deep water  a breeze which had sprung up from the east tended to raise the sea a little but when they finally got away from the dangerous reef the breeze befriended them hoisting the foresail they quickly left the bell rock far behind them and in the course of a couple of hours sailed into the harbour of arbroath    chapter two  the lovers and the pressgang  about a mile to the eastward of the ancient town of arbroath the shore abruptly changes its character from a flat beach to a range of perhaps the wildest and most picturesque cliffs on the east coast of scotland  inland the country is rather flat but elevated several hundred feet above the level of the sea towards which it slopes gently until it reaches the shore where it terminates in abrupt perpendicular precipices varying from a hundred to two hundred feet in height  in many places the cliffs overhang the water and all along the coast they have been perforated and torn up by the waves so as to present singularly bold and picturesque outlines with caverns inlets and sequestered coves of every form and size  to the top of these cliffs in the afternoon of the day on which our tale opens a young girl wended her wayslowly as if she had no other object in view than a stroll and sadly as if her mind were more engaged with the thoughts within than with the magnificent prospect of land and sea without  the girl was    fair fair with golden hair  and apparently about twenty years of age  she sought out a quiet nook among the rocks at the top of the cliffs near to a circular chasm with the name of which at that time we are not acquainted but which was destined ere long to acquire a new name and celebrity from an incident which shall be related in another part of this story  curiously enough just about the same hour a young man was seen to wend his way to the same cliffs and from no reason whatever with which we happened to be acquainted sought out the same nook  we say he was seen advisedly for the maid with the golden hair saw him  any ordinary observer would have said that she had scarcely raised her eyes from the ground since sitting down on a niece of flowerstudded turf near the edge of the cliff and that she certainly had not turned her head in the direction of the town  yet she saw himhowever absurd the statement may appear we affirm it confidentlyand knew that he was coming  other eyes there were that also saw youtheyes that would have caused him some degree of annoyance had he known they were upon him eyes that he would have rejoiced to tinge with the colours black and blue  there were thirteen pair of them belonging to twelve men and a lieutenant of the navy  in those days the barbarous custom of impressment into the royal navy was in full operation  england was at war with france  men were wanted to fight our battles and when there was any difficulty in getting men pressgangs were sent out to force them into the service  the youth whom we now introduce to the reader was a sailor a strapping handsome one too not indeed remarkable for height being only a little above the averagefive feet ten inches or thereaboutsbut noted for great depth of chest breadth of shoulder and development of muscle conspicuous also for the quantity of close clustering lightbrown curls down his head and for the laughing glance of his darkblue eye not a hero of romance by any means  no he was very matter of fact and rather given to meditation than mischief  the officer in charge of the pressgang had set his heart on this youth so had another individual of whom more anon but the youth whose name was ruby brand happened to have an old mother who was at that time in very bad health and she had also set her heart poor body on the youth and entreated him to stay at home just for one halfyear  ruby willingly consented and from that time forward led the life of a dog in consequence of the pressgang  now as we have said he had been seen leaving the town by the lieutenant who summoned his men and went after himcautiously however in order to take him by surprise for ruby besides being strong and active as a lion was slippery as an eel  going straight as an arrow to the spot where she of the golden hair was seated the youth presented himself suddenly to her sat down beside her and exclaiming minnie put his arm round her waist  oh ruby dont said minnie blushing  now reader the dont and the blush had no reference to the arm round the waist but to the relative position of their noses mouths and chins a position which would have been highly improper and altogether unjustifiable but for the fact that ruby was minnies accepted lover  dont darling why not said ruby in surprise  youre so rough said minnie turning her head away  true dear i forgot to shave this morning  i dont mean that interrupted the girl quickly i mean rude and andis that a seagull  no sweetest of your sex its a butterfly but its all the same as my metaphysical uncle ogilvy would undertake to prove to you thus a butterfly is white and a gull is whitetherefore a gull is a butterfly  dont talk nonsense ruby  no more i will darling if you will listen to me while i talk sense  what is it said the girl looking earnestly and somewhat anxiously into her lovers face for she knew at once by his expression that he had some unpleasant communication to make  youre not going away  well nonot exactly you know i promised to stay with mother but the fact is that im so pestered and hunted down by that rascally pressgang that i dont know what to do  theyre sure to nab me at last too and then i shall have to go away whether i will or no so ive made up my mind as a last resource to ruby paused  well said minnie  well in fact to do what will take me away for a short time but ruby stopped short and turning his head on one side while a look of fierce anger overspread his face seemed to listen intently  minnie did not observe this action for a few seconds but wondering why he paused she looked up and in surprise exclaimedruby what do you  hush  minnie and dont look round said he in a low tone of intense anxiety yet remaining immovably in the position which he had assumed on first sitting down by the girls side although the swelled veins of his neck and his flushed forehead told of a fierce conflict of feeling within  its the pressgang after me again  i got a glance of one o them out of the tail of my eye creeping round the rocks  they think i havent seen them  darling minnieone kiss  take care of mother if i dont turn up soon  but how will you escape  hush dearest girl  i want to have as much of you as i can before i go  dont be afraid  theyre honest british tars after all and wont hurt you minnie  still seated at the girls side as if perfectly at his ease yet speaking in quick earnest tones and drawing her closely to him ruby waited until he heard a stealthy tread behind him  then he sprang up with the speed of thought uttered a laugh of defiance as the sailors rushed towards him and leaping wildly off the cliff fell a height of about fifty feet into the sea  minnie uttered a scream of horror and fell fainting into the arms of the bewildered lieutenant  down the cliffsquick he cant escape if you look alive  stay one of you and look after this girl  shell roll over the edge on recovering perhaps  it was easy to order the men down the cliffs but not so easy for them to obey for the rocks were almost perpendicular at the place and descended sheer into the water  surround the spot shouted the lieutenant  scatter yourselvesaway theres no beach here  the lieutenant was right  the men extended themselves along the top of the cliffs so as to prevent rubys escape in the event of his trying to ascend them and two sailors stationed themselves in ambush in the narrow pass at the spot where the cliffs terminate in the direction of the town  the leap taken by ruby was a bold one  few men could have ventured it indeed the youth himself would have hesitated had he not been driven almost to desperation  but he was a practised swimmer and diver and knew well the risk he ran  he struck the water with tremendous force and sent up a great mass of foam but he had entered it perpendicularly feet foremost and in a few seconds returned to the surface so close to the cliffs that they overhung him and thus effectually concealed him from his pursuers  swimming cautiously along for a short distance close to the rocks he came to the entrance of a cavern which was filled by the sea  the inner end of this cave opened into a small hollow or hole among the cliffs up the sides of which ruby knew that he could climb and thus reach the top unperceived but after gaining the summit there still lay before him the difficulty of eluding those who watched there  he felt however that nothing could be gained by delay so he struck at once into the cave swam to the inner end and landed  wringing the water out of his clothes he threw off his jacket and vest in order to be as unencumbered as possible and then began to climb cautiously  just above the spot where ruby ascended there chanced to be stationed a seaman named dalls  this man had lain down flat on his breast with his head close to the edge of the cliff so as to observe narrowly all that went on below but being a stout lethargic man he soon fell fast asleep  it was just at the spot where this man lay that ruby reached the summit  the ascent was very difficult  at each step the hunted youth had to reach his hand as high above his head as possible and grasp the edge of a rock or a mass of turf with great care before venturing on another step  had one of these points of rock or one of these tufts of grass given way he would infallibly have fallen down the precipice and been killed  accustomed to this style of climbing from infancy however he advanced without a sensation of fear  on reaching the top he peeped over and seeing that no one was near prepared for a rush  there was a mass of brown turf on the bank above him  he grasped it with all his force and swung himself over the edge of the cliff  in doing so he nearly scalped poor dalls whose hair was the turf which he had seized and who uttering a hideous yell leaped upon ruby and tried to overthrow him  but dalls had met his match  he received a blow on the nose that all but felled him and instantly after a blow on each eye that raised a very constellation of stars in his brain and laid him prone upon the grass  his yell however and the noise of the scuffle were heard by those of the pressgang who were nearest to the scene of conflict  they rushed to the rescue and reached the spot just as ruby leaped over his prostrate foe and fled towards arbroath  they followed with a cheer which warned the two men in ambush to be ready  ruby was lithe as a greyhound  he left his pursuers far behind him and dashed down the gorge leading from the cliffs to the low ground beyond  here he was met by the two sailors and by the lieutenant who had joined them  minnie was also there having been conducted thither by the said lieutenant who gallantly undertook to see her safe into the town in order to prevent any risk of her being insulted by his men  on hearing the shout of those who pursued ruby minnie hurried away intending to get free from the gang not feeling that the lieutenants protection was either desirable or necessary  when ruby reached the middle of the gorge which we have dignified with the name of pass and saw three men ready to dispute his passage he increased his speed  when he was almost up to them he turned aside and sprang nimbly up the almost perpendicular wall of earth on his right this act disconcerted the men who had prepared to receive his charge and seize him but ruby jumped down on the shoulders of the one nearest and crushed him to the ground with his weight  his clenched fist caught the lieutenant between the eyes and stretched him on his backthe third man wisely drew aside to let this human thunderbolt pass by  he did pass and as the impetuous and quite irresistible locomotive is brought to a sudden pause when the appropriate brakes are applied so was he brought to a sudden halt by minnie a hundred yards or so farther on  oh dont stop she cried eagerly and hastily thrusting him away theyll catch you  panting though he was vehemently ruby could not restrain a laugh  catch me no darling but dont be afraid of them  they wont hurt you minnie and they cant hurt meexcept in the way of cutting short our interview  ha here they come  goodbye dearest ill see you soon again  at that moment five or six of the men came rushing down the pass with a wild cheer  ruby made no haste to run  he stood in an easy attitude beside minnie leisurely kissed her little hand and gently smoothed down her golden hair  just as the foremost pursuer came within fifteen yards or so of them he said farewell my lassie i leave you in good hands and then waving his cap in the air with a cheer of more than halfjocular defiance he turned and fled towards arbroath as if one of the noreast gales in its wildest fury were sweeping him over the land    chapter three  our hero obliged to go to sea  when ruby brand reached the outskirts of arbroath he checked his speed and walked into his native town whistling gently and with his hands in his pockets as though he had just returned from an evening walk  he directed his steps to one of the streets near the harbour in which his mothers cottage was situated  mrs brand was a delicate little old womanso little and so old that people sometimes wondered how it was possible that she could be the mother of such a stalwart son  she was one of those kind gentle uncomplaining and unselfish beings who do not secure much popularity or admiration in this world but who secure obedient children also steadfast and loving friends  her favourite book was the bible her favourite hope in regard to earthly matters that men should give up fighting and drinking and live in peace her favourite theory that the study of truth was the object for which man was created and her favourite mealtea  ruby was her only child  minnie was the daughter of a distant relation and having been left an orphan she was adopted by her  mrs brands husband was a sailor  he commanded a small coasting sloop of which ruby had been the mate for several years  as we have said ruby had been prevailed on to remain at home for some months in order to please his mother whose delicacy of health was such that his refusal would have injured her seriously at least the doctor said so therefore ruby agreed to stay  the sloop penguin commanded by rubys father was on a voyage to newcastle at that time and was expected in arbroath every day  but it was fated never more to cast anchor in that port  the great storm to which reference has been made in a previous chapter caused many wrecks on the shores of britain  the penguin was one of the many  in those days telegraphs railroads and penny papers did not exist murders were committed then as now but little was said and less was known about them  wrecks occurred then as now but few except the persons immediately concerned heard of them  destructive fires terrible accidents and the familiar round of appalling catastrophes occurred then as now but their influence was limited and their occurrence soon forgotten  we would not be understood to mean that now as compared with then all is right and well that telegraphs and railways and daily papers are allpotent and perfect  by no means  we have still much to learn and to do in these improved times and especially there is wanting to a large extent among us a sympathetic telegraphy so to speak between the interior of our land and the seacoast which if it existed in full and vigorous play would go far to improve our condition and raise us in the esteem of christian nations  nevertheless as compared with now the state of things then was lamentably imperfect  the great storm came and went having swept thousands of souls into eternity and hundreds of thousands of pounds into nonentity  lifeboats had not been invented  harbours of refuge were almost unknown and although our coasts bristled with dangerous reefs and headlands lighthouses were few and far between  the consequence was that wrecks were numerous and so also were wreckersa class of men who in the absence of an efficient coastguard subsisted to a large extent on what they picked up from the wrecks that were cast in their way and who did not scruple sometimes to cause wrecks by showing false lights in order to decoy vessels to destruction  we do not say that all wreckers were guilty of such crimes but many of them were so and their style of life at the best had naturally a demoralising influence upon all of them  the famous bell rock lying twelve miles off the coast of forfarshire was a prolific source of destruction to shipping  not only did numbers of vessels get upon it but many others ran upon the neighbouring coasts in attempting to avoid it  rubys father knew the navigation well but in the confusion and darkness of the furious storm he miscalculated his position and ran upon the rock where as we have seen his body was afterwards found by the two fishermen  it was conveyed by them to the cottage of mrs brand and when ruby entered he found his mother on her knees by the bedside pressing the cold hand of his father to her breast and gazing with wild tearless eyes into the dead face  we will not dwell upon the sad scenes that followed  ruby was now under the necessity of leaving home because his mother being deprived of her husbands support naturally turned in distress to her son  but ruby had no employment and work could not be easily obtained at that time in the town so there was no other resource left him but to go to sea  this he did in a small coasting sloop belonging to an old friend who gave him part of his wages in advance to enable him to leave his mother a small provision at least for a short time  this however was not all that the widow had to depend on  minnie gray was expert with her needle and for some years past had contributed not a little to the comforts of the household into which she had been adopted  she now set herself to work with redoubled zeal and energy besides this mrs brand had a brother a retired skipper who obtained the complimentary title of captain from his friends  he was a poor man it is true as regarded money having barely sufficient for his own subsistence but he was rich in kindliness and sympathy so that he managed to make his small income perform wonders  on hearing of his brotherinlaws death captain ogilvy hastened to afford all the consolation in his power to his sorrowing sister  the captain was an eccentric old man of rugged aspect  he thought that there was not a worse comforter on the face of the earth than himself because when he saw others in distress his heart invariably got into his throat and absolutely prevented him from saying a single word  he tried to speak to his sister but all he could do was to take her hand and weep  this did the poor widow more good than any words could have done no matter how eloquently or fitly spoken  it unlocked the fountain of her own heart and the two wept together  when captain ogilvy accompanied ruby on board the sloop to see him off and shook hands as he was about to return to the shore he saidcheer up ruby never say die so long as theres a shot in the looker  thats the advice of an old salt an youll find it sound the more you ponder of it  wen a young feller sails away on the sea of life let him always go by chart and compass not forgettin to take soundins wen cruisin off a bad coast  keep a sharp lookout to windard an mind yer helmthats my advice to you lad as ye go    asailin down lifes troubled stream   all as if it wor a dream  the captain had a somewhat poetic fancy at least he was impressed with the belief that he had and was in the habit of enforcing his arguments by quotations from memory  when memory failed he supplemented with original composition  goodbye lad an providence go wi ye  goodbye uncle  i need not remind you to look after mother when im away  no nephy you neednt ill do it whether or not  and minnie poor thing shell need a word of advice and comfort now and then uncle  and she shall have it lad replied the captain with a tremendous wink which was unfortunately lost on the nephew in consequence of its being night and unusually dark advice and comfort on demand gratis for    woman in her hours of ease   is most uncommon hard to please  but she must be looked arter ye know and made of dye see so ruby boy farewell  halfanhour before midnight was the time chosen for the sailing of the sloop termagant in order that she might get away quietly and escape the pressgang  ruby and his uncle had taken the precaution to go down to the harbour just a few minutes before sailing and they kept as closely as possible to the darkest and leastfrequented streets while passing through the town  captain ogilvy returned by much the same route to his sisters cottage but did not attempt to conceal his movements  on the contrary knowing that the sloop must have got clear of the harbour by that time he went along the streets whistling cheerfully  he had been a noted not to say noisy whistler when a boy and the habit had not forsaken him in his old age  on turning sharp round a corner he ran against two men one of whom swore at him but the other cried  hallo messmate yer musical the night  hey captain ogilvy surely i seed you an ruby slinkin down the dark side o the marketgate half an oor ago  mayhap ye did an mayhap ye didnt retorted the captain as he walked on but as its none o your business to know ill not tell ye  ay ay  o but yere a cross auld chap  pleasant dreams tye  this kindly remark which was expressed by our friend davy spink was lost on the captain in consequence of his having resumed his musical recreation with redoubled energy as he went rolling back to the cottage to console mrs brand and to afford advice and comfort gratis to minnie gray    chapter four  the burglary  on the night in question big swankie and a likeminded companion who went among his comrades by the name of the badger had planned to commit a burglary in the town and it chanced that the former was about that business when captain ogilvy unexpectedly ran against him and davy spink  spink although a smuggler and by no means a particularly respectable man had not yet sunk so low in the scale of life as to be willing to commit burglary  swankie and the badger suspected this and although they required his assistance much they were afraid to ask him to join lest he should not only refuse but turn against them  in order to get over the difficulty swankie had arranged to suggest to him the robbery of a store containing gin which belonged to a smuggler and if he agreed to that to proceed further and suggest the more important matter in hand  but he found spink proof against the first attack  i tell ee ill hae naething to do wit said he when the proposal was made  but urged swankie hes a smuggler and a crossgrained hound besides  its no like robbin an honest man  an what are we but smugglers retorted spink an as to bein crossgrained youve naethin to boast o in that way  na na swankie ye may dot yersel ill hae nae hand int  ill no objec to tak a bit keg o auchmithie water smuggled spirits noo and then or to pick up what comes to me by the wund and sea but ill steal frae nae man  ay man but yeve turned awfu honest all of a suddent said the other with a sneer  i wonder the thretty sovereigns i gied ye the other day when we tossed for them and the case o kickshaws havena brunt yer pooches  davy spink looked a little confused  aweel said he its o nae use greetin ower spilt milk the things done and past noo and i canna help it  sae guidnight to ee  swankie seeing that it was useless to attempt to gain over his comrade and knowing that the badger was waiting impatiently for him near the appointed house hurried away without another word and davy spink strolled towards his home which was an extremely dirty little hut near the harbour  at the time of which we write the town of arbroath was neither so well lighted nor so well guarded as it now is  the two burglars found nothing to interfere with their deeds of darkness except a few bolts and bars which did not stand long before their expert hands nevertheless they met with a check from an unexpected quarter  the house they had resolved to break into was inhabited by a widow lady who was said to be wealthy and who was known to possess a considerable quantity of plate and jewels  she lived alone having only one old servant and a little girl to attend upon her  the house stood on a piece of ground not far from the ruins of the stately abbey which originated and gave celebrity to the ancient town of aberbrothoc  mrs stewarts house was full of eastern curiosities some of them of great value which had been sent to her by her son then a major in the east india companys service  now it chanced that major stewart had arrived from india that very day on leave of absence all unknown to the burglars who had they been aware of the fact would undoubtedly have postponed their visit to a more convenient season  as it was supposing they had to deal only with the old lady and her two servants they began their work between twelve and one that night with considerable confidence and in great hopes of a rich booty  a small garden surrounded the old house  it was guarded by a wall about eight feet high the top of which bristled with bottleglass  the old lady and her domestics regarded this terriblelooking defence with much satisfaction believing in their innocence that no human creature could succeed in getting over it  boys however were their only dread and fruit their only care when they looked complacently at the bottleglass on the wall and so far they were right in their feeling of security for boys found the labour risk and danger to be greater than the worth of the apples and pears  but it was otherwise with men  swankie and the badger threw a piece of thick matting on the wall the former bent down the latter stepped upon his back and thence upon the mat then he hauled his comrade up and both leaped into the garden  advancing stealthily to the door they tried it and found it locked the windows were all carefully bolted and the shutters barred  this they expected but thought it as well to try each possible point of entrance in the hope of finding an unguarded spot before having recourse to their tools  such a point was soon found in the shape of a small window opening into a sort of scullery at the back of the house it had been left open by accident  an entrance was easily effected by the badger who was a small man and who went through the house with the silence of a cat towards the front door  there were two lobbies an inner and an outer separated from each other by a glass door cautiously opening both doors the badger admitted his comrade and then they set to work  a lantern which could be uncovered or concealed in a moment enabled them to see their way  thats the dininroom door whispered the badger  hist haud yer jaw muttered swankie i ken that as weel as you  opening the door they entered and found the platechest under the sideboard  it was open and a grin of triumph crossed the sweet countenances of the friends as they exchanged glances and began to put silver forks and spoons by the dozen into a bag which they had brought for the purpose  when they had emptied the platechest they carried the bag into the garden and climbing over the wall deposited it outside  then they returned for more  now old mrs stewart was an invalid and was in the habit of taking a little weak wine and water before retiring to rest at night  it chanced that the bottle containing the port wine had been left on the sideboard a fact which was soon discovered by swankie who put the bottle to his mouth and took a long pull  what ist enquired the badger in a low tone  prime replied swankie handing over the bottle and wiping his mouth with the cuff of his coat  the badger put the bottle to his mouth but unfortunately for him part of the liquid went down the wrong throat  the result was that the poor man coughed once rather loudly  swankie frowning fiercely and shaking his fist looked at him in horror and well he might for the badger became first red and then purple in the face and seemed as if he were about to burst with his efforts to keep down the cough  it came however three times in spite of himnot violently but with sufficient noise to alarm them and cause them to listen for five minutes intently ere they ventured to go on with their work in the belief that no one had been disturbed  but major stewart had been awakened by the first cough  he was a soldier who had seen much service and who slept lightly  he raised himself in his bed and listened intently on hearing the first cough the second cough caused him to spring up and pull on his trousers the third cough found him halfway downstairs with a bootjack in his hand and when the burglars resumed work he was peeping at them through the halfopen door  both men were stooping over the platechest the badger with his back to the door swankie with his head towards it  the major raised the bootjack and took aim  at the same moment the door squeaked big swankie looked up hastily and in technical phraseology doused the glim  all was dark in an instant but the bootjack sped on its way notwithstanding  the burglars were accustomed to fighting however and dipped their heads  the bootjack whizzed past and smashed the pierglass on the mantelpiece to a thousand atoms  major stewart being expert in all the devices of warfare knew what to expect and drew aside  he was not a moment too soon for the dark lantern flew through the doorway hit the opposite wall and fell with a loud clatter on the stone floor of the lobby  the badger followed at once and received a random blow from the major that hurled him head over heels after the lantern  there was no mistaking the heavy tread and rush of big swankie as he made for the door  major stewart put out his foot and the burglar naturally tripped over it before he could rise the major had him by the throat  there was a long fierce struggle both being powerful men at last swankie was hurled completely through the glass door  in the fall he disengaged himself from the major and leaping up made for the garden wall over which he succeeded in clambering before the latter could seize him  thus both burglars escaped and major stewart returned to the house halfnakedhis shirt having been torn off his backand bleeding freely from cuts caused by the glass door  just as he reentered the house the old cook under the impression that the cat had got into the pantry and was smashing the crockery entered the lobby in her nightdress shrieked mercy on us on beholding the major and fainted dead away  major stewart was too much annoyed at having failed to capture the burglars to take any notice of her  he relocked the door and assuring his mother that it was only robbers and that they had been beaten off retired to his room washed and dressed his wounds and went to bed  meanwhile big swankie and the badger laden with silver made for the shore where they hid their treasure in a hole  ill tell ee a dodge said the badger  what may that be enquired swankie  you said ye saw ruby brand slinking down the marketgate and thats hes off to sea  ay and twa or three more folk saw him as weel as me  weel lets tak up a siller spoon or somethin an put it in the auld wifes garden an theyll think it was him that did it  no that bad said swankie with a chuckle  a silver fork and a pair of sugartongs bearing old mrs stewarts initials were accordingly selected for this purpose and placed in the little garden in the front of widow brands cottage  here they were found in the morning by captain ogilvy who examined them for at least halfanhour in a state of the utmost perplexity  while he was thus engaged one of the detectives of the town happened to pass apparently in some haste  hallo shipmate shouted the captain  well responded the detective  did ye ever see silver forks an sugartongs growin in a garden before  eh exclaimed the other entering the garden hastily let me see oho this may throw some light on the matter  did you find them here  ay on this very spot  hum  ruby went away last night i believe  he did  some time after midnight enquired the detective  likely enough said the captain but my chronometer aint quite so reglar since we left the sea it might ha bin moremayhap less  just so  you saw him off  ay but you seem more than ornar inquisitive today  did he carry a bundle interrupted the detective  ay no doubt  a large one  ay a goodish big un  do you know what was in it enquired the detective with a knowing look  i do for i packed it replied the captain his kit was in it  nothing more  nothin as i knows of  well ill take these with me just now said the officer placing the fork and sugartongs in his pocket  im afraid old man that your nephew has been up to mischief before he went away  a burglary was committed in the town last night and this is some of the plate  youll hear more about it before long i dare say  good day to ye  so saying the detective walked quickly away and left the captain in the centre of the garden staring vacantly before him in speechless amazement    chapter five  the bell rock invaded  a year passed away  nothing more was heard of ruby brand and the burglary was believed to be one of those mysteries which are destined never to be solved  about this time great attention was being given by government to the subject of lighthouses  the terrible number of wrecks that had taken place had made a deep impression on the public mind  the position and dangerous character of the bell rock in particular had been for a long time the subject of much discussion and various unsuccessful attempts had been made to erect a beacon of some sort thereon  there is a legend that in days of old one of the abbots of the neighbouring monastery of aberbrothoc erected a bell on the inchcape rock which was tolled in rough weather by the action of the waves on a float attached to the tongue and thus mariners were warned at night and in foggy weather of their approach to the rock the great danger of which consists in its being a sunken reef lying twelve miles from the nearest land and exactly in the course of vessels making for the firths of forth and tay  the legend further tells how that a danish pirate named ralph the rover in a mischievous mood cut the bell away and that years afterwards he obtained his appropriate reward by being wrecked on the bell rock when returning from a long cruise laden with booty  whether this be true or not is an open question but certain it is that no beacon of any kind was erected on this rock until the beginning of the nineteenth century after a great storm in 1799 had stirred the public mind and set springs in motion which from that time forward have never ceased to operate  many and disastrous were the shipwrecks that occurred during the storm referred to which continued with little intermission for three days great numbers of ships were driven from their moorings in the downs and yarmouth roads and these together with all vessels navigating the german ocean at that time were drifted upon the east coast of scotland  it may not perhaps be generally known that there are only three great inlets or estuaries to which the mariner steers when overtaken by easterly storms in the north seanamely the humber and the firths of forth and moray  the mouth of the thames is too much encumbered by sandbanks to be approached at night or during bad weather  the humber is also considerably obstructed in this way so that the roads of leith in the firth of forth and those of cromarty in the moray firth are the chief places of resort in easterly gales  but both of these had their special risks  on the one hand there was the danger of mistaking the dornoch firth for the moray as it lies only a short way to the north of the latter and in the case of the firth of forth there was the terrible bell rock  now during the storm of which we write the fear of those two dangers was so strong upon seamen that many vessels were lost in trying to avoid them and much hardship was sustained by mariners who preferred to seek shelter in higher latitudes  it was estimated that no fewer than seventy vessels were either stranded or lost during that single gale and many of the crews perished  at one wild part of the coast near peterhead called the bullers of buchan after the first night of the storm the wrecks of seven vessels were found in one cove without a single survivor of the crews to give an account of the disaster  the dangers of the deep are nothing compared with the dangers of the shore  if the hard rocks of our island could tell the tale of their experience and if we landsmen could properly appreciate it we should understand more clearly why it is that sailors love blue in other words deep water during stormy weather  in order to render the forth more accessible by removing the danger of the bell rock it was resolved by the commissioners of northern lights to build a lighthouse upon it  this resolve was a much bolder one than most people suppose for the rock on which the lighthouse was to be erected was a sunken reef visible only at low tide during two or three hours and quite inaccessible in bad weather  it was the nearest approach to building a house in the sea that had yet been attempted the famous eddystone stands on a rock which is never quite under water although nearly so for its crest rises a very little above the highest tides while the bell rock is eight or ten feet under water at high tides  it must be clear therefore to everyone that difficulties unusual in magnitude and peculiar in kind must have stood in the way of the daring engineer who should undertake the erection of a tower on a rock twelve miles out on the stormy sea and the foundation of which was covered with ten or twelve feet of water every tide a tower which would have to be built perfectly yet hastily a tower which should form a comfortable home fit for human beings to dwell in and yet strong enough to withstand the utmost fury of the waves not merely whirling round it as might be the case on some exposed promontory but rushing at it straight and fierce from the wild ocean in great blue solid billows that should burst in thunder on its sides and rush up in scarcely less solid spray to its lantern a hundred feet or more above its foundation  an engineer able and willing to undertake this great work was found in the person of the late robert stevenson of edinburgh whose perseverance and talent shall be commemorated by the grandest and most useful monument ever raised by man as long as the bell rock lighthouse shall tower above the sea  it is not our purpose to go into the details of all that was done in the construction of this lighthouse  our peculiar task shall be to relate those incidents connected with this work which have relation to the actors in our tale  we will not therefore detain the reader by telling him of all the preliminary difficulties that were encountered and overcome in this robinson crusoe sort of work how that a temporary floating lightship named the pharos was prepared and anchored in the vicinity of the rock in order to be a sort of depot and rendezvous and guide to the three smaller vessels employed in the work as well as a light to shipping generally and a buildingyard was established at arbroath where every single stone of the lighthouse was cut and nicely fitted before being conveyed to the rock  neither shall we tell of the difficulties that arose in the matter of getting blocks of granite large enough for such masonry and lime of a nature strong enough to withstand the action of the salt sea  all this and a great deal more of a deeply interesting nature must remain untold and be left entirely to the readers imagination  see note 1  suffice it to say that the work was fairly begun in the month of august 1807 that a strong beacon of timber was built which was so well constructed that it stood out all the storms that beat against it during the whole time of the building operations that close to this beacon the pit or foundation of the lighthouse was cut down deep into the solid rock that the men employed could work only between two and three hours at a time and had to pump the water out of this pit each tide before they could resume operations that the work could only be done in the summer months and when engaged in it the men dwelt either in the pharos floating light or in one of the attending vessels and were not allowed to go ashorethat is to the mainland about twelve miles distant that the work was hard but so novel and exciting that the artificers at last became quite enamoured of it and that ere long operations were going busily forward and the work was in a prosperous and satisfactory state of advancement  things were in this condition at the bell rock when one fine summer evening our friend and hero ruby brand returned after a long absence to his native town    note 1  it may be found however in minute detail in the large and interesting work entitled stevensons bell rock lighthouse    chapter six  the captain changes his quarters  it was fortunate for ruby that the skipper of the vessel ordered him to remain in charge while he went ashore because he would certainly have been recognised by numerous friends and his arrival would speedily have reached the ears of the officers of justice who seem to be a class of men specially gifted with the faculty of never forgetting  it was not until darkness had begun to settle down on the town that the skipper returned on board and gave him leave to go ashore  ruby did not return in the little coaster in which he had left his native place  that vessel had been wrecked not long after he joined her but the crew were saved and ruby succeeded in obtaining a berth as second mate of a large ship trading between hull and the baltic returning from one of his voyages with a pretty good sum of money in his pocket he resolved to visit his mother and give it to her  he therefore went aboard an arbroath schooner and offered to work his passage as an extra hand  remembering his former troubles in connexion with the pressgang he resolved to conceal his name from the captain and crew who chanced to be all strangers to him  it must not be supposed that mrs brand had not heard of ruby since he left her  on the contrary both she and minnie gray got letters as frequently as the postal arrangements of those days would admit of and from time to time they received remittances of money which enabled them to live in comparative comfort  it happened however that the last of these remittances had been lost so that mrs brand had to depend for subsistence on minnies exertions and on her brothers liberality  the brothers power was limited however and minnie had been ailing for some time past in consequence of her close application to work so that she could not earn as much as usual  hence it fell out that at this particular time the widow found herself in greater pecuniary difficulties than she had ever been in before  ruby was somewhat of an original  it is probable that every hero is he resolved to surprise his mother by pouring the money he had brought into her lap and for this purpose had while in hull converted all his savings into copper silver and gold  those precious metals he stowed separately into the pockets of his huge peajacket and thus heavily laden went ashore about dark as soon as the skipper returned  at this precise hour it happened that mrs brand minnie gray and captain ogilvy were seated at their supper in the kitchen of the cottage  two days previously the captain had called and said to mrs brand  i tell ee what it is sister im tired of livin a solitary bachelor life all by myself so im goin to make a change lass  mrs brand was for some moments speechless and minnie who was sewing near the window dropped her hands and work on her lap and looked up with inexpressible amazement in her sweet blue eyes  brother said mrs brand earnestly you dont mean to tell me that youre going to marry at your time of life  eh what  marry  the captain looked if possible more amazed than his sister for a second or two then his red face relaxed into a broad grin and he sat down on a chair and chuckled wiping the perspiration he seemed always more or less in a state of perspiration from his bald head the while  why no sister im not going to marry did i speak of marryin  no but you spoke of being tired of a bachelor life and wishing to change  ah you women said the captain shaking his headalways suspecting that we poor men are wantin to marry you  well praps you aint far wrong neither but im not goin to be spliced yetawhile lass marry indeed    shall i wastin in despair   die cause why a womans rare  oh  captain ogilvy thats not rightly quoted cried minnie with a merry laugh  aint it said the captain somewhat put out for he did not like to have his powers of memory doubted  no surely women are not rare said minnie  good ones are said the captain stoutly  well but thats not the right word  what is the right word then asked the captain with affected sternness for although by nature disinclined to admit that he could be wrong he had no objection to be put right by minnie  die because a womans f said minnie prompting him  f funny guessed the captain  no its not funny cried minnie laughing heartily  of course not assented the captain it could not be funny nohow because funny dont rhyme with despair besides lots o women aint funny a bit an if they was thats no reason why a man should die for em what is the word lass  what am i asked minnie with an arch smile as she passed her fingers through the clustering masses of her beautiful hair  an angel beyond all doubt said the gallant captain with a burst of sincerity which caused minnie to blush and then to laugh  youre incorrigible captain and you are so stupid that its of no use trying to teach you  mrs brandwho listened to this conversation with an expression of deep anxiety on her meek face for she could not get rid of her first idea that her brother was going to marryhere broke in with the question  when is it to be brother  when is what to be sister  thethe marriage  i tell you i aint agoin to marry repeated the captain though why a stout young feller like me just turned sixtyfour shouldnt marry is more than i can see  you know the old proverbs lassits never too late to marry never ventur never give in john anderson my jo john when we was firstfirst  married suggested minnie  just so responded the captain and everybody knows that he was an old man  but no im not goin to marry im only goin to give up my house sell off the furniture and come and live with you  live with me ejaculated mrs brand  ay an why not  whats the use o goin to the expense of two houses when onell do an when were both raither scrimp o the ready  youll just let me have the parlour  it never was a comfrable room to sit in so it dont matter much your givin it up its a good enough sleepin and smokin cabin an well all live together in the kitchen  ill throw the whole of my treemendous income into the general purse always exceptin a few odd coppers which ill retain to keep me agoin in baccy  well sail under the same flag an sit round the same fire an sup at the same table and sleep in the sameno not exactly that but under the same rooftree whichll be a more hoconomical way o doin business you know an so old girl as the song says    come an let us be happy together   for where theres a will theres a way   an we wont care a rap for the weather   so long as theres nothin to pay  would it not be better to say so long as theres something to pay suggested minnie  no lass it wouldnt retorted the captain  youre too fond of improvin things  im a stanch old tory i am  ill stick to the old flag till alls blue  none o your changes or improvements for me  this was a rather bold statement for a man to make who improved upon almost every line he ever quoted but the reader is no doubt acquainted with parallel instances of inconsistency in good men even in the present day  now sister continued captain ogilvy what dye think of my plan  i like it well brother replied mrs brand with a gentle smile will you come soon  tomorrow about eight bells answered the captain promptly  this was all that was said on the subject  the thing was as the captain said settled offhand and accordingly next morning he conveyed such of his worldly goods as he meant to retain possession of to his sisters cottagethe new ship as he styled it  he carried his traps on his own broad shoulders and the conveyance of them cost him three distinct trips  they consisted of a huge seachest an old telescope more than a yard long and cased in leather a quadrant a hammock with the bedding rolled up in it a tobaccobox the enormous old family bible in which the names of his father mother brothers and sisters were recorded and a brown teapot with half a lid  this latter had belonged to the captains mother and being fond of it as it reminded him of the old ooman he was wont to mix his grog in it and drink the same out of a teacup the handle of which was gone and the saucer of which was among the things of the past  notwithstanding his avowed adherence to tory principles captain ogilvy proceeded to make manifold radical changes and surprising improvements in the little parlour insomuch that when he had completed the task and led his sister carefully for she was very feeble to look at what he had done she became quite incapable of expressing herself in ordinary language positively refused to believe her eyes and never again entered that room but always spoke of what she had seen as a curious dream  no one was ever able to discover whether there was not a slight tinge of underlying jocularity in this remark of mrs brand for she was a strange and incomprehensible mixture of shrewdness and innocence but no one took much trouble to find out for she was so lovable that people accepted her just as she was contented to let any small amount of mystery that seemed to be in her to remain unquestioned  the parlour was one of those wellknown rooms which are occasionally met with in country cottages the inmates of which are not wealthy  it was reserved exclusively for the purpose of receiving visitors  the furniture though old threadbare and dilapidated was kept scrupulously clean and arranged symmetrically  there were a few books on the table which were always placed with mathematical exactitude and a set of chairs so placed as to give one mysteriously the impression that they were not meant to be sat upon  there was also a grate which never had a fire in it and was never without a paper ornament in it the pink and white aspect of which caused one involuntarily to shudder  but the great point which was meant to afford the highest gratification to the beholder was the chimneypiece  this spot was crowded to excess in every square inch of its area with ornaments chiefly of earthenware miscalled china and shells  there were great white shells with pink interiors and small brown shells with spotted backs  then there were china cups and saucers and china shepherds and shepherdesses represented in the act of contemplating the heavens serenely with their arms round each others waists  there were also china dogs and cats and a huge china cockatoo as a centrepiece but there was not a single spot the size of a sixpence on which the captain could place his pipe or his tobaccobox  well get these things cleared away said minnie with a laugh on observing the perplexed look with which the captain surveyed the chimneypiece while the changes above referred to were being made in the parlour we have no place ready to receive them just now but ill have them all put away tomorrow  thankee lass said the captain as he set down the seachest and seated himself thereon theyre pretty enough to look at dye see but theyre raither in the way just now as my second mate once said of the rocks when we were cruising off the coast of norway in search of a pilot  the ornaments were however removed sooner than anyone had anticipated the next trip that the captain made was for his hammock he always slept in one which was a long unwieldy bundle like a gigantic bolster  he carried it into the parlour on his shoulder and minnie followed him  where shall i sling it lass  here perhaps said minnie  the captain wheeled round as she spoke and the end of the hammock swept the mantelpiece of all its ornaments as completely as if the besom of destruction had passed over it  shiver my timbers gasped the captain awestruck by the hideous crash that followed  youve shivered the ornaments at any rate said minnie halflaughing and halfcrying  so i have but no matter  never say die so longs there a shot in the locker  theres as good fish in the sea as ever come out of it so bear a hand my girl and help me to sling up the hammock  the hammock was slung the pipe of peace was smoked and thus captain ogilvy was fairly installed in his sisters cottage  it may perhaps be necessary to remind the reader that all this is a long digression that the events just narrated occurred a few days before the return of ruby and that they have been recorded here in order to explain clearly the reason of the captains appearance at the supper table of his sister and the position which he occupied in the family  when ruby reached the gate of the small garden minnie had gone to the captains room to see that it was properly prepared for his reception and the captain himself was smoking his pipe close to the chimney so that the smoke should ascend it  the first glance through the window assured the youth that his mother was as letters had represented her much better in health than she used to be  she looked so quiet and peaceful and so fragile withal that ruby did not dare to surprise her by a sudden entrance as he had originally intended so he tapped gently at the window and drew back  the captain laid down his pipe and went to the door  what ruby he exclaimed in a hoarse whisper  hush uncle  how is minnie where is she  i think lad replied the captain in a tone of reproof that you might have enquired for your mother first  no need said ruby pointing to the window i see that she is there and well thanks be to god for thatbut minnie  shes well too boy and in the house  but come get inside  ill explain after  this promise to explain was given in consequence of the great anxiety he the captain displayed to drag ruby into the cottage  the youth did not require much pressing however  he no sooner heard that minnie was well than he sprang in and was quickly at his mothers feet  almost as quickly a fair vision appeared in the doorway of the inner room and was clasped in the young sailors arms with the most thorough disregard of appearances not to mention propriety  while this scene was enacting the worthy captain was engaged in active proceedings which at once amused and astonished his nephew and the nature and cause of which shall be revealed in the next chapter    chapter seven  ruby in difficulties  having thrust his nephew into the cottage captain ogilvys first proceeding was to close the outer shutter of the window and fasten it securely on the inside  then he locked bolted barred and chained the outer door after which he shut the kitchen door and in default of any other mode of securing it placed against it a heavy table as a barricade  having thus secured the premises in front he proceeded to fortify the rear and when this was accomplished to his satisfaction he returned to the kitchen sat down opposite the widow and wiped his shining pate  why uncle are we going to stand out a siege that you take so much pains to lock up  ruby sat down on the floor at his mothers feet as he spoke and minnie sat down on a low stool beside him  maybe we are lad replied the captain anyhow its always well to be ready    ready boys ready   well fight and well conquer again and again  come uncle explain yourself  explain myself nephy  i can neither explain myself nor anybody else dye know ruby that youre a burglar  am i uncle  well i confess that thats news  ay but its true though at least the law in arbroath says so and if it catches you itll hang you as sure as a gun  here captain ogilvy explained to his nephew the nature of the crime that was committed on the night of his departure the evidence of his guilt in the finding part of the plate in the garden coupled with his sudden disappearance and wound up by saying that he regarded him ruby as being in a reglar fix  but surely said ruby whose face became gradually graver as the case was unfolded to him surely it must be easy to prove to the satisfaction of everyone that i had nothing whatever to do with this affair  easy to prove it said the captain in an excited tone wasnt you seen just about the hour of the robbery going stealthily down the street by big swankie and davy spink both of whom will swear to it  yes but you were with me uncle  so i was and hard enough work i had to convince them that i had nothin to do with it myself but they saw that i couldnt jump a stone wall eight foot high to save my life much less break into a house and they got no further evidence to convict me so they let me off but itll go hard with you nephy for major stewart described the men and one o them was a big strong feller the description bein as like you as two peas only their faces was blackened and the lantern threw the light all one way so he didnt see them well  then the things found in our gardenand the villains will haul me up as a witness against you for didnt i find them myself  very perplexing what shall i do said ruby  clear out cried the captain emphatically  what fly like a real criminal just as i have returned home  never what say you minnie  stand your trial ruby  they cannotthey dare notcondemn the innocent  and you mother  im sure i dont know what to say replied mrs brand with a look of deep anxiety as she passed her fingers through her sons hair and kissed his brow  i have seen the innocent condemned and the guilty go free more than once in my life  nevertheless mother i will give myself up and take my chance  to fly would be to give them reason to believe me guilty  give yourself up exclaimed the captain youll do nothing of the sort  come lad remember im an old man and an uncle  ive got a plan in my head which i think will keep you out of harms way for a time  you see my old chronometer is but a poor onethe worse of the wear like its masterand ive never been able to make out the exact time that we went aboard the termagant the night you went away  now can you tell me what oclock it was  i can  xactly  yes exactly for it happened that i was a little later than i promised and the skipper pointed to his watch as i came up the side and jocularly shook his head at me  it was exactly eleven pm  sure and sartin o that enquired the captain earnestly  quite and his watch must have been right for the townclock rung the hour at the same time  is that skipper alive  yes  would he swear to that  i think he would  dye know where he is  i do  hes on a voyage to the west indies and wont be home for two months i believe  humph said the captain with a disappointed look  however it cant be helped but i see my way now to get you out o this fix  you know i suppose that theyre buildin a lighthouse on the bell rock just now well the workmen go off to it for a month at a time i believe if not longer and dont come ashore and its such a dangerous place and troublesome to get to that nobody almost ever goes out to it from this place except those who have to do with it  now lad youll go down to the workyard the first thing in the mornin before daylight and engage to go off to work at the bell rock  youll keep all snug and quiet and nobodyll be a bit the wiser  youll be earnin good wages and in the meantime ill set about gettin things in trim to put you all square  but i see many difficulties ahead objected ruby  of course ye do retorted the captain  did ye ever hear or see anything on this earth that hadnt rocks ahead o some sort  its our business to steer past em lad not to bout ship and steer away  but state yer difficulties  well in the first place im not a stonemason or a carpenter and i suppose masons and carpenters are the men most wanted there  not at all blacksmiths are wanted there said the captain and i know that you were trained to that work as a boy  true i can do somewhat with the hammer but mayhap they wont engage me  but they will engage you lad for they are hard up for an assistant blacksmith just now and i happen to be handandglove with some o the chief men of the yard wholl be happy to take anyone recommended by me  well uncle but suppose i do go off to the rock what chance have you of making things appear better than they are at present  ill explain that lad  in the first place major stewart is a gentleman outandout and will listen to the truth  he swears that the robbery took place at one oclock in the mornin for he looked at his watch and at the clock of the house and heard it ring in the town just as the thieves cleared off over the wall  now if i can get your old skipper to take a run here on his return from the west indies hell swear that you was sailin out to the north sea before twelve and thatll prove that you couldnt have had nothin to do with it dye see  it sounds well said ruby dubiously but do you think the lawyers will see things in the light you do  hang the lawyers dye think they will shut their eyes to the truth  perhaps they may in which case they will hang me and so prevent my taking your advice to hang them said ruby  well well but you agree to my plan asked the captain  shall i agree minnie it will separate me from you again for some time  yet it is necessary answered minnie sadly yes i think you should agree to go  very well then thats settled said ruby and now let us drop the subject because i have other things to speak of and if i must start before daylight my time with you will be short  come here a bit nephy i want to have a private word with ee in my cabin said the captain interrupting him and going into his own room ruby rose and followed  you havent any  the captain stopped stroked his bald head and looked perplexed  well uncle  well nephy you haventin short have ye got any money about you lad  money yes a little but why do you ask  well the fact is that your poor mother is hard up just now said the captain earnestly an ive given her the last penny i have o my own but shes quite  ruby interrupted his uncle at this point with a boisterous laugh  at the same time he flung open the door and dragged the old man with gentle violence back to the kitchen  come here uncle  but avast nephy i havent told ye all yet  oh dont bother me with such trifles just now cried ruby thrusting his uncle into a chair and resuming his own seat at his mothers side well speak of that at some other time meanwhile let me talk to mother  minnie dear he continued who keeps the cash here you or mother  well we keep it between us said minnie smiling your mother keeps it in her drawer and gives me the key when i want any and i keep an account of it  ah well mother i have a favour to ask of you before i go  well ruby  it is that you will take care of my cash for me  i have got a goodish lot of it and find it rather heavy to carry in my pocketsso hold your apron steady and ill give it to you  saying this he began to empty handful after handful of coppers into the old womans apron then remarking that that was all the browns he began to place handful after handful of shillings and sixpences on the top of the pile until the copper was hid by silver  the old lady as usual when surprised became speechless the captain smiled and minnie laughed but when ruby put his hand into another pocket and began to draw forth golden sovereigns and pour them into his mothers lap the captain became supremely amazed the old woman laughed andso strangely contradictory and unaccountable is human natureminnie began to cry  poor girl the tax upon her strength had been heavier than anyone knew heavier than she could bear and the sorrow of knowing as she had come to know that it was all in vain and that her utmost efforts had failed to keep the wolf from the door had almost broken her down  little wonder then that the sight of sudden and ample relief upset her altogether  but her tears being tears of joy were soon and easily driedall the more easily that it was ruby who undertook to dry them  mrs brand sat up late that night for there was much to tell and much to hear  after she had retired to rest the other three continued to hold converse together until grey dawn began to appear through the chinks in the windowshutters  then the two men rose and went out while minnie laid her pretty little head on the pillow beside mrs brand and sought and found repose    chapter eight  the scene changesruby is vulcanised  as captain ogilvy had predicted ruby was at once engaged as an assistant blacksmith on the bell rock  in fact they were only too glad to get such a powerful active young fellow into their service and he was shipped off with all speed in the sloop smeaton with a few others who were going to replace some men who had become ill and were obliged to leave  a light westerly breeze was blowing when they cast off the moorings of the sloop  goodbye ruby said the captain as he was about to step on the pier remember your promise lad to keep quiet and dont try to get ashore or to hold communication with anyone till you hear from me  all right uncle i wont forget and ill make my mind easy for i know that my case is left in good hands  three hours elapsed ere the smeaton drew near to the bell rock during this time ruby kept aloof from his fellowworkmen feeling disposed to indulge the sad thoughts which filled his mind  he sat down on the bulwarks close to the main shrouds and gazed back at the town as it became gradually less and less visible in the faint light of morning  then he began to ponder his unfortunate circumstances and tried to imagine how his uncle would set about clearing up his character and establishing his innocence but do what he would ruby could not keep his mind fixed for any length of time on any subject or line of thought because of a vision of sweetness which it is useless to attempt to describe and which was always accompanied by and surrounded with a golden halo  at last the youth gave up the attempt to fix his thoughts and allowed them to wander as they chose seeing that they were resolved to do so whether he would or no  the moment these thoughts had the reins flung on their necks and were allowed to go where they pleased they refused owing to some unaccountable species of perversity to wander at all but at once settled themselves comfortably down beside the vision with golden hair and remained there  this agreeable state of things was rudely broken in upon by the hoarse voice of the mate shouting  stand by to let go the anchor  then ruby sprang on the deck and shook himself like a great mastiff and resolved to devote himself heart and soul from that moment to the work in which he was about to engage  the scene that presented itself to our hero when he woke up from his dreams would have interested and excited a much less enthusiastic temperament than his  the breeze had died away altogether just as if having wafted the smeaton to her anchorage there were no further occasion for its services  the sea was therefore quite calm and as there had only been light westerly winds for some time past there was little or none of the swell that usually undulates the sea  one result of this was that being high water when the smeaton arrived there was no sign whatever of the presence of the famous bell rock  it lay sleeping nearly two fathoms below the sea like a grim giant in repose and not a ripple was there to tell of the presence of the mariners enemy  the sun was rising and its slanting beams fell on the hulls of the vessels engaged in the service which lay at anchor at a short distance from each other  these vessels as we have said were four in number including the smeaton  the others were the sir joseph banks a small schoonerrigged vessel the patriot a little sloop and the pharos lightship a large clumsylooking dutchbuilt ship fitted with three masts at the top of which were the lanterns  it was intended that this vessel should do duty as a lightship until the lighthouse should be completed  besides these there were two large boats used for landing stones and building materials on the rock  these vessels lay floating almost motionless on the calm sea and at first there was scarcely any noise aboard of them to indicate that they were tenanted by human beings but when the sound of the smeatons cable was heard there was a bustle aboard of each and soon faces were seen looking inquisitively over the sides of the ships  the smeatons boat was lowered after the anchor was let go and the new hands were transferred to the pharos which was destined to be their home for some time to come  just as they reached her the bell rang for breakfast and when ruby stepped upon the deck he found himself involved in all the bustle that ensues when men break off from work and make preparation for the morning meal  there were upwards of thirty artificers on board the lightship at this time  some of these as they hurried to and fro gave the new arrivals a hearty greeting and asked what news from the shore  others were apparently too much taken up with their own affairs to take notice of them  while ruby was observing the busy scene with absorbing interest and utterly forgetful of the fact that he was in any way connected with it an elderly gentleman whose kind countenance and hearty manner gave indication of a genial spirit within came up and accosted him  you are our assistant blacksmith i believe  yes sir i am replied ruby doffing his cap as if he felt instinctively that he was in the presence of someone of note  you have had considerable practice i suppose in your trade  a good deal sir but not much latterly for i have been at sea for some time  at sea  well that wont be against you here returned the gentleman with a meaning smile  it would be well if some of my men were a little more accustomed to the sea for they suffer much from seasickness  you can go below my man and get breakfast  youll find your future messmate busy at his i doubt not  here steward turning to one of the men who chanced to pass at the moment take ruby brandthat is your name i think  it is sir  take brand below and introduce him to james dove as his assistant  the steward escorted ruby down the ladder that conducted to those dark and littered depths of the ships hull that were assigned to the artificers as their place of abode  but amidst a good deal of unavoidable confusion rubys practised eye discerned order and arrangement everywhere  this is your messmate jamie dove said the steward pointing to a massive dark man whose outward appearance was in keeping with his position as the vulcan of such an undertaking as he was then engaged in youll find him not a bad feller if you only dont cross him  he added with a wink his only fault is that hes given to spoilin good victuals being raither floored by seasickness if it comes on to blow ever so little  hold your clapper lad said the smith who was at the moment busily engaged with a mess of salt pork and potatoes to match  whos your friend  no friend of mine though i hope hell be one soon answered the steward  mr stevenson told me to introduce him to you as your assistant  the smith looked up quickly and scanned our hero with some interest then extending his great hard hand across the table he said welcome messmate sit down ive only just begun  ruby grasped the hand with his own which if not so large was quite as powerful and shook the smiths right arm in a way that called forth from that roughlooking individual a smile of approbation  youve not had breakfast lad  no not yet said ruby sitting down opposite his comrade  an the smell here dont upset your stummick i hope  the smith said this rather anxiously  not in the least said ruby with a laugh and beginning to eat in a way that proved the truth of his words for the matter o that theres little smell and no motion just now  well there isnt much replied the smith but woes me youll get enough of it before long  all the new landsmen like you suffer horribly from seasickness when they first come off  but im not a landsman said ruby  not a landsman echoed the other  youre a blacksmith arent you  ay but not a landsman  i learned the trade as a boy and lad but ive been at sea for some time past  then you wont get sick when it blows  certainly not will you  the smith groaned and shook his head by which answer he evidently meant to assure his friend that he would most emphatically  but come its of no use groanin over what cant be helped  i get as sick as a dog every time the wind rises and the worst of it is i dont never seem to improve  howsever im all right when i get on the rock and thats the main thing  ruby and his friend now entered upon a long and earnest conversation as to their peculiar duties at the bell rock with which we will not trouble the reader  after breakfast they went on deck and here ruby had sufficient to occupy his attention and to amuse him for some hours  as the tide that day did not fall low enough to admit of landing on the rock till noon the men were allowed to spend the time as they pleased some therefore took to fishing others to reading while a few employed themselves in drying their clothes which had got wet the previous day and one or two entertained themselves and their comrades with the music of the violin and flute  all were busy with one thing or another until the rock began to show its black crest above the smooth sea  then a bell was rung to summon the artificers to land  this being the signal for ruby to commence work he joined his friend dove and assisted him to lower the bellows of the forge into the boat the men were soon in their places with their various tools and the boats pushed offmr stevenson the engineer of the building steering one boat and the master of the pharos who was also appointed to the post of landingmaster steering the other  they landed with ease on this occasion on the western side of the rock and then each man addressed himself to his special duty with energy the time during which they could work being short they had to make the most of it  now lad said the smith bring along the bellows and follow me mind yer footin for its slippery walkin on them tanglecovered rocks  ive seen some ugly falls here already  have any bones been broken yet enquired ruby as he shouldered the large pair of bellows and followed the smith cautiously over the rocks  not yet but theres been an awful lot o pipes smashed  if it goes on as it has been well have to take to metal ones  here we are ruby this is the forge and ill be bound you never worked at such a queer one before  hallo  bremner he shouted to one of the men  thats me answered bremner  bring your irons as soon as you like  im about ready for you  ay ay here they are said the man advancing with an armful of picks chisels and other tools which required sharpening  he slipped and fell as he spoke sending all the tools into the bottom of a pool of water but being used to such mishaps he arose joined in the laugh raised against him and soon fished up the tools  whats wrong asked ruby pausing in the work of fixing the bellows on observing that the smiths face grew pale and his general expression became one of horror  not seasick i hope  seasick gasped the smith slapping all his pockets hurriedly its worse than that ive forgot the matches  ruby looked perplexed but had no consolation to offer  thats like you cried bremner who being one of the principal masons had to attend chiefly to the digging out of the foundationpit of the building and knew that his tools could not be sharpened unless the forge fire could be lighted  suppose you hammer a nail redhot suggested one of the men who was disposed to make game of the smith  ill hammer your nose redhot replied dove with a most undovelike scowl i could swear that i put them matches in my pocket before i started  no you didnt said george forsyth one of the carpentersa tall loosejointed man who was chiefly noted for his dislike to getting into and out of boats and climbing up the sides of ships because of his lengthy and unwieldy figureno you didnt you turtledove you forgot to take them but i remembered to do it for you so there get up your fire and confess yourself indebted to me for life  im indebted to ee for fire said the smith grasping the matches eagerly  thankee lad youre a true briton  a tall un rather suggested bremner  wot never never never will be a slave sang another of the men  come laddies git up the fire  time an tide waits for naebody said john watt one of the quarriers  well want thae tools before lang  the men were proceeding with their work actively while those remarks were passing and ere long the smoke of the forge fire arose in the still air and the clang of the anvil was added to the other noises with which the busy spot resounded  the foundation of the bell rock lighthouse had been carefully selected by mr stevenson the exact spot being chosen not only with a view to elevation but to the serrated ridges of rock that might afford some protection to the building by breaking the force of the easterly seas before they should reach it but as the space available for the purpose of building was scarcely fifty yards in diameter there was not much choice in the matter  the foundationpit was fortytwo feet in diameter and sunk five feet into the solid rock  at the time when ruby landed it was being hewn out by a large party of the men  others were boring holes in the rock near to it for the purpose of fixing the great beams of a beacon while others were cutting away the seaweed from the rock and making preparations for the laying down of temporary rails to facilitate the conveying of the heavy stones from the boats to their ultimate destination  all were busy as bees  each man appeared to work as if for a wager or to find out how much he could do within a given space of time  to the men on the rock itself the aspect of the spot was sufficiently striking and peculiar but to those who viewed it from a boat at a short distance off it was singularly interesting for the whole scene of operations appeared like a small black spot scarcely above the level of the waves on which a crowd of living creatures were moving about with great and incessant activity while all around and beyond lay the mighty sea sleeping in the grand tranquillity of a calm summer day with nothing to bound it but the blue sky save to the northward where the distant cliffs of forfar rested like a faint cloud on the horizon  the sounds too which on the rock itself were harsh and loud and varied came over the water to the distant observer in a united tone which sounded almost as sweet as soft music  the smiths forge stood on a ledge of rock close to the foundationpit a little to the north of it  here vulcan dove had fixed a strong iron framework which formed the hearth  the four legs which supported it were let into holes bored from six to twelve inches into the rock according to the inequalities of the site  these were wedged first with wood and then with iron for as this part of the forge and the anvil was doomed to be drowned every tide or twice every day besides being exposed to the fury of all the storms that might chance to blow it behoved them to fix things down with unusual firmness  the block of timber for supporting the anvil was fixed in the same manner but the anvil itself was left to depend on its own weight and the small stud fitted into the bottom of it  the bellows however were too delicate to be left exposed to such forces as the stormy winds and waves they were therefore shipped and unshipped every tide and conveyed to and from the rock in the boats with the men  dove and ruby wrought together like heroes  they were both so powerful that the heavy implements they wielded seemed to possess no weight when in their strong hands and their bodies were so lithe and active as to give the impression of men rejoicing revelling in the enjoyment of their work  thats your sort hit him hard hes got no friends said dove turning a mass of redhot metal from side to side while ruby pounded it with a mighty hammer as if it were a piece of putty  fire and steel for ever observed ruby as he made the sparks fly right and left  hallo the tides rising  ho so it is cried the smith finishing off the piece of work with a small hammer while ruby rested on the one he had used and wiped the perspiration from his brow  it always serves me in this way lad continued the smith without pausing for a moment in his work  blow away ruby the sea is my greatest enemy  every day amost it washes me away from my work  in calm weather it creeps up my legs and the legs o the forge too till it gradually puts out the fire and in rough weather it sends up a wave sometimes that sweeps the whole concern black out at one shot  it will creep you out today evidently said ruby as the water began to come about his toes  never mind lad well have time to finish them picks this tide if we work fast  thus they toiled and moiled with their heads and shoulders in smoke and fire and their feet in water  gradually the tide rose  pump away ruby  keep the pot bilin my boy said the smith  the wind blowin you mean  i say dove do the other men like the work here  like it ay they like it well  at fist we were somewhat afraid o the landin in rough weather but weve got used to that now  the only bad thing about it is in the rolling o that horrible pharos  shes so bad in a gale that i sometimes think shell roll right over like a cask most of us get sick then but i dont think any of em are as bad as me  they seem to be gettin used to that too  i wish i could  another blow ruby  times up shouted one of the men  hold on just for a minute or two pleaded the smith who with his assistant was by this time standing nearly kneedeep in water  the sea had filled the pit some time before and driven the men out of it  these busied themselves in collecting the tools and seeing that nothing was left lying about while the men who were engaged on those parts of the rocks that were a few inches higher continued their labours until the water crept up to them  then they collected their tools and went to the boats which lay awaiting them at the western landingplace  now dove cried the landingmaster come along the crabs will be attacking your toes if you dont  its a shame to gie ruby the chance o a sair throat the very first day cried john watt  just half a minute more said the smith examining a pickaxe which he was getting up to that delicate point of heat which is requisite to give it proper temper  while he gazed earnestly into the glowing coals a gentle hissing sound was heard below the frame of the forge then a gurgle and the fire became suddenly dark and went out  i knowed it always the way cried dove with a look of disappointment  come lad up with the bellows now and dont forget the tongs  in a few minutes more the boats pushed off and returned to the pharos three and a half hours of good work having been accomplished before the tide drove them away  soon afterwards the sea overflowed the whole of the rock and obliterated the scene of those busy operations as completely as though it had never been    chapter nine  storms and troubles  a week of fine weather caused ruby brand to fall as deeply in love with the work at the bell rock as his comrades had done  there was an amount of vigour and excitement about it with a dash of romance which quite harmonised with his character  at first he had imagined it would be monotonous and dull but in experience he found it to be quite the reverse  although there was uniformity in the general character of the work there was constant variety in many of the details and the spot on which it was carried on was so circumscribed and so utterly cut off from all the world that the minds of those employed became concentrated on it in a way that aroused strong interest in every trifling object  there was not a ledge or a point of rock that rose ever so little above the general level that was not named after and intimately associated with some event or individual  every mass of seaweed became a familiar object  the various little pools and inlets many of them not larger than a diningroom table received highsounding and dignified names such as port stevenson port erskine taylors track neills pool etcetera  of course the fish that frequented the pools and the shellfish that covered the rock became subjects of much attention and in some cases of earnest study  robinson crusoe himself did not pry into the secrets of his islandhome with half the amount of assiduity that was displayed at this time by many of the men who built the bell rock lighthouse  the very fact that their time was limited acted as a spur so that on landing each tide they rushed hastily to the work and the amateur studies in natural history to which we have referred were prosecuted hurriedly during brief intervals of rest  afterwards when the beacon house was erected and the men dwelt upon the rock these studies if we may not call them amusements were continued more leisurely but with unabated ardour and furnished no small amount of comparatively thrilling incident at times  one fine morning just after the men had landed and before they had commenced work long forsyth as his comrades styled him went to a pool to gather a little dulse of which there was a great deal on the rock and which was found to be exceedingly grateful to the palates of those who were afflicted with seasickness  he stooped over the pool to pluck a morsel but paused on observing a beautiful fish about a foot long swimming in the clear water as quietly as if it knew the man to be a friend and were not in the least degree afraid of him  forsyth was an excitable man and also studious in his character  he at once became agitated and desirous of possessing that fish for it was extremely brilliant and variegated in colour  he looked round for something to throw at it but there was nothing within reach  he sighed for a hook and line but as sighs never yet produced hooks or lines he did not get one  just then the fish swam slowly to the side of the pool on which the man kneeled as if it actually desired more intimate acquaintance  forsyth lay flat down and reached out his hand toward it but it appeared to think this rather too familiar for it swam slowly beyond his reach and the man drew back  again it came to the side much nearer  once more forsyth lay down reaching over the pool as far as he could and insinuating his hand into the water  but the fish moved off a little  thus they coquetted with each other for some time until the mans comrades began to observe that he was after something  wots he adoin of said one  reachin over the pool i think replied another  ye dont mean hes sick cried a third  the smile with which this was received was changed into a roar of laughter as poor forsyths long legs were seen to tip up into the air and the whole man to disappear beneath the water  he had overbalanced himself in his frantic efforts to reach the fish and was now making its acquaintance in its native element  the pool although small in extent was so deep that forsyth long though he was did not find bottom  moreover he could not swim so that when he reached the surface he came up with his hands first and his ten fingers spread out helplessly next appeared his shaggy head with the eyes wide open and the mouth tight shut  the moment the latter was uncovered however he uttered a tremendous yell which was choked in the bud with a gurgle as he sank again  the men rushed to the rescue at once and the next time forsyth rose he was seized by the hair of the head and dragged out of the pool  it has not been recorded what became of the fish that caused such an alarming accident but we may reasonably conclude that it sought refuge in the ocean cavelets at the bottom of that miniature sea for long forsyth was so very large and created such a terrible disturbance therein that no fish exposed to the full violence of the storm could have survived it  wot a hobject exclaimed joe dumsby a short thickset little englishman who having been born and partly bred in london was rather addicted to what is styled chaffing  was you arter a mermaid shipmate  av coorse he was observed ned oconnor an irishman who was afflicted with the belief that he was rather a witty fellow av coorse he was an a merrymaid she must have bin to see a human spider like him kickin up such a dust in the say  hes like a drooned rotten observed john watt tak aff yer claes man an wring them dry  let the poor fellow be and get along with you cried peter logan the foreman of the works who came up at that moment  with a few parting remarks and cautions such asyoud better bring a dry suit to the rock next time lad take care the crabs dont make off with you boy and dont be gettin too fond o the girls in the sea etcetera the men scattered themselves over the rock and began their work in earnest while forsyth who took the chaffing in good part stripped himself and wrung the water out of his garments  episodes of this kind were not unfrequent and they usually furnished food for conversation at the time and for frequent allusion afterwards  but it was not all sunshine and play by any means  not long after ruby joined the fine weather broke up and a succession of stiff breezes with occasional storms more or lees violent set in landing on the rock became a matter of extreme difficulty and the short period of work was often curtailed to little more than an hour each tide  the rolling of the pharos lightship too became so great that seasickness prevailed to a large extent among the landsmen  one good arose out of this evil however  landing on the bell rock invariably cured the sickness for a time and the seasick men had such an intense longing to eat of the dulse that grew there that they were always ready and anxious to get into the boats when there was the slightest possibility of landing  getting into the boats by the way in a heavy sea when the lightship was rolling violently was no easy matter  when the fine weather first broke up it happened about midnight and the change commenced with a stiff breeze from the eastward  the sea rose at once and long before daybreak the pharos was rolling heavily in the swell and straining violently at the strong cable which held her to her moorings  about dawn mr stevenson came on deck  he could not sleep because he felt that on his shoulders rested not only the responsibility of carrying this gigantic work to a satisfactory conclusion but also to a large extent the responsibility of watching over and guarding the lives of the people employed in the service  shall we be able to land today mr wilson he said accosting the master of the pharos who has been already introduced as the landingmaster  i think so the barometer has not fallen much and even although the wind should increase a little we can effect a landing by the fair way at hopes wharf  very well i leave it entirely in your hands you understand the weather better than i do but remember that i do not wish my men to run unnecessary or foolish risk  it may be as well to mention here that a small but exceedingly strong tramway of irongrating had been fixed to the bell rock at an elevation varying from two to four feet above it and encircling the site of the building  this tramway or railroad was narrow not quite three feet in width and small trucks were fitted to it so that the heavy stones of the building might be easily run to the exact spot they were to occupy from this circular rail several branch lines extended to the different creeks where the boats deposited the stones  these lines although only a few yards in length were dignified with namesas kennedys reach logans reach watts reach and slights reach  the ends of them where they dipped into the sea were named hopes wharf duffs wharf raes wharf etcetera and these wharves had been fixed on different sides of the rock so that whatever wind should blow there would always be one of them on the leeside available for the carrying on of the work  hopes wharf was connected with port erskine a pool about twenty yards long by three or four wide and communicated with the side of the lighthouse by watts reach a distance of about thirty yards  about eight oclock that morning the bell rang for breakfast  such of the men as were not already up began to get out of their berths and hammocks  to ruby the scene that followed was very amusing  hitherto all had been calm and sunshine  the work although severe while they were engaged had been of short duration and the greater part of each day had been afterwards spent in light work or in amusement  the summons to meals had always been a joyful one and the appetites of the men were keenly set  now all this was changed  the ruddy faces of the men were become green blue yellow and purple according to temperament but few were fleshcoloured or red  when the bell rang there was a universal groan below and half a dozen ghostlike individuals raised themselves on their elbows and looked up with expressions of the deepest woe at the dim skylight  most of them speedily fell back again however partly owing to a heavy lurch of the vessel and partly owing to indescribable sensations within  blowin groaned one as if that single word comprehended the essence of all the miseries that seafaring man is heir to  o dear sighed another why did i ever come here  och murder im dyin send for the praist an me mother cried oconnor as he fell flat down on his back and pressed both hands tightly over his mouth  the poor blacksmith lost control over himself at this point andfound partial relief  the act tended to relieve others  most of the men were much too miserable to make any remark at all a few of them had not heart even to groan but five or six sat up on the edge of their beds with a weak intention of turning out  they sat there swaying about with the motions of the ship in helpless indecision until a tremendous roll sent them flying with unexpected violence against the starboard bulkheads  come lads cried ruby leaping out of his hammock theres nothing like a vigorous jump to put seasickness to flight  humbug ejaculated bremner who owned a little black dog which lay at that time on the pillow gazing into his masters green face with wondering sympathy  ah ruby groaned the smith its all very well for a seadog like you thats used to it but  james dove stopped short abruptly  it is not necessary to explain the cause of his abrupt silence  suffice it to say that he did not thereafter attempt to finish that sentence  steward roared joe dumsby  ay ay shipmate whats up cried the steward who chanced to pass the door of the mens sleepingplace with a large dish of boiled salt pork at the moment  wots up echoed dumsby  everythink that ever went into me since i was a hinfant must be up by this time  i say is there any chance of gettin on the rock today  o yes  i heard the capn say it would be quite easy and they seem to be makin ready now so if any of ee want breakfast youd better turn out  this speech acted like a shock of electricity on the wretched men  in a moment every bed was empty and the place was in a bustle of confusion as they hurriedly threw on their clothes  some of them even began to think of the possibility of venturing on a hard biscuit and a cup of tea but a gust of wind sent the fumes of the salt pork into the cabin at the moment and the mere idea of food filled them with unutterable loathing  presently the bell rang again  this was the signal for the men to muster the boats being ready alongside  the whole crew at once rushed on deck some of them thrusting biscuits into their pockets as they passed the stewards quarters  not a man was absent on the roll being called  even the smith crawled on deck and had spirit enough left to advise ruby not to forget the bellows to which ruby replied by recommending his comrade not to forget the matches  then the operation of embarking began  the sea at the time was running pretty high with little white flecks of foam tipping the crests of the deep blue waves  the eastern sky was dark and threatening  the black ridges of the bell rock were visible only at times in the midst of the sea of foam that surrounded them anyone ignorant of their nature would have deemed a landing absolutely impossible  the pharos as we have said was rolling violently from side to side insomuch that those who were in the boats had the greatest difficulty in preventing them from being stove in and getting into these boats had much the appearance of an exceedingly difficult and dangerous feat which active and reckless men might undertake for a wager  but custom reconciles one to almost anything  most of the men had had sufficient experience by that time to embark with comparative ease nevertheless there were a few whose physical conformation was such that they could do nothing neatly  poor forsyth was one of these  each man had to stand on the edge of the lightship outside the bulwarks holding on to a rope ready to let go and drop into the boat when it rose up and met the vessels roll  in order to facilitate the operation a boat went to either side of the ship so that two men were always in the act of watching for an opportunity to spring  the active men usually got in at the first or second attempt but others missed frequently and were of course chaffed by their more fortunate comrades  the embarking of long forsyth was always a scene in rough weather and many a narrow escape had he of a ducking  on the present occasion being very sick he was more awkward than usual  now longlegs cried the men who held the boat on the starboard side as forsyth got over the side and stood ready to spring lets see how good youll be today  he was observed by joe dumsby who had just succeeded in getting into the boat on the port side of the ship and who always took a lively interest in his tall comrades proceedings  hallo is that the spider he cried as the ship rolled towards him and the said spider appeared towering high on the opposite bulwark sharply depicted against the grey sky  it was unfortunate for joe that he chanced to be on the opposite side from his friend for at each roll the vessel necessarily intervened and hid him for a few seconds from view  next roll forsyth did not dare to leap although the gunwale of the boat came within a foot of him  he hesitated the moment was lost the boat sank into the hollow of the sea and the man was swung high into the air where he was again caught sight of by dumsby  what are you there yet he cried  you must be fond of a swing  before he could say more the ship rolled over to the other side and forsyth was hid from view  now lad now now shouted the boats crew as the unhappy man once more neared the gunwale  forsyth hesitated  suddenly he became desperate and sprang but the hesitation gave him a much higher fall than he would otherwise have had it caused him also to leap wildly in a sprawling manner so that he came down on the shoulders of his comrades all of a lump  fortunately they were prepared for something of the sort so that no damage was done  when the boats were at last filled they pushed off and rowed towards the rock  on approaching it the men were cautioned to pull steadily by mr stevenson who steered the leading boat  it was a standing order in the landing department that every man should use his greatest exertions in giving to the boats sufficient velocity to preserve their steerage way in entering the respective creeks at the rock that the contending seas might not overpower them at places where the free use of the oars could not be had on account of the surrounding rocks or the masses of seaweed with which the water was everywhere encumbered at low tide  this order had been thoroughly impressed upon the men as carelessness or inattention to it might have proved fatal to all on board  as the leading boat entered the fairway its steersman saw that more than ordinary caution would be necessary for the great green billows that thundered to windward of the rock came sweeping down on either side of it and met on the leeside where they swept onward with considerable though much abated force  mind your oars lads pull steady said mr stevenson as they began to get amongst the seaweed  the caution was unnecessary as far as the old hands were concerned but two of the men happened to be new hands who had come off with ruby and did not fully appreciate the necessity of strict obedience  one of these sitting at the bowoar looked over his shoulder and saw a heavy sea rolling towards the boat and inadvertently expressed some fear the other man on hearing this glanced round and in doing so missed a stroke of his oar  such a preponderance was thus given to the rowers on the opposite side that when the wave struck the boat it caught her on the side instead of the bow and hurled her upon a ledge of shelving rocks where the water left her  having been canted to seaward the next billow completely filled her and of course drenched the crew  instantly ruby brand and one or two of the most active men leaped out and putting forth all their strength turned the boat round so as to meet the succeeding sea with its bow first  then after making considerable efforts they pushed her off into deep water and finally made the landingplace  the other boat could render no assistance but indeed the whole thing was the work of a few minutes  as the boats could not conveniently leave the rock till floodtide all hands set to work with unwonted energy in order to keep themselves warm not however before they ate heartily of their favourite dulsethe blacksmith being conspicuous for the voracious manner in which he devoured it  soon the bellows were set up the fire was kindled and the ring of the anvil heard but poor dove and ruby had little pleasure in their work that day for the wind blew the smoke and sparks about their faces and occasionally a higher wave than ordinary sent the spray flying round them to the detriment of their fire  nevertheless they plied the hammer and bellows unceasingly  the other men went about their work with similar disregard of the fury of the elements and the wet condition of their garments    chapter ten  the rising of the tidea narrow escape  the portion of the work that mr stevenson was now most anxious to get advanced was the beacon  the necessity of having an erection of this kind was very obvious for in the event of anything happening to the boats there would be no refuge for the men to fly to and the tide would probably sweep them all away before their danger could be known or assistance sent from the attendant vessels  every man felt that his personal safety might depend on the beacon during some period of the work  the energies of all therefore were turned to the preliminary arrangements for its erection  as the beacon would require to withstand the utmost fury of the elements during all seasons of the year it was necessary that it should be possessed of immense strength  in order to do this six cuttings were made in the rock for the reception of the ends of the six great beams of the beacon  each beam was to be fixed to the solid rock by two strong and massive bats or stanchions of iron  these bats for the fixing of the principal and diagonal beams and bracingchains required fiftyfour holes each measuring a foot and a half deep and two inches wide  the operation of boring such holes into the solid rock was not an easy or a quick one but by admirable arrangements on the part of the engineer and steady perseverance on the part of the men they progressed faster than had been anticipated  three men were attached to each jumper or boring chisel one placed himself in a sitting posture to guide the instrument and give it a turn at each blow of the hammer he also sponged and cleaned out the hole and supplied it occasionally with a little water while the other two with hammers of sixteen pounds weight struck the jumper alternately generally bringing the hammer with a swing round the shoulder after the manner of blacksmith work  ruby we may remark in passing occupied himself at this work as often as he could get away from his duties at the forge being particularly fond of it as it enabled him to get rid of some of his superabundant energy and afforded him a suitable exercise for his gigantic strength it also tended to relieve his feelings when he happened to think of minnie being so near and he so utterly and hopelessly cut off from all communication with her  but to return to the batholes  the three men relieved each other in the operations of wielding the hammers and guiding the jumpers so that the work never flagged for a moment and it was found that when the tools were of a very good temper these holes could be sunk at the rate of one inch per minute including stoppages  but the tools were not always of good temper and severely was poor doves temper tried by the frequency of the scolds which he received from the men some of whom were clumsy enough dove said to spoil the best tempered tool in the world  but the most tedious part of the operation did not lie in the boring of these holes  in order that they should be of the required shape two holes had to be bored a few inches apart from each other and the rock cut away from between them  it was this latter part of the work that took up most time  those of the men who were not employed about the beacon were working at the foundationpit  while the party were thus busily occupied on the bell rock an event occurred which rendered the importance of the beacon if possible more obvious than ever and which wellnigh put an end to the career of all those who were engaged on the rock at that time  the pharos floating light lay at a distance of above two miles from the bell rock but one of the smaller vessels the sloop smeaton lay much closer to it and some of the artificers were berthed aboard of her instead of the floating light  some time after the landing of the two boats from the pharos the smeatons boat put off and landed eight men on the rock soon after which the crew of the boat pushed off and returned to the smeaton to examine her ridingropes and see that they were in good order for the wind was beginning to increase and the sea to rise  the boat had no sooner reached the vessel than the latter began to drift carrying the boat along with her  instantly those on board endeavoured to hoist the mainsail of the smeaton with the view of working her up to the buoy from which she had parted but it blew so hard that by the time she was got round to make a tack towards the rock she had drifted at least three miles to leeward  the circumstance of the smeaton and her boat having drifted was observed first by mr stevenson who prudently refrained from drawing attention to the fact and walked slowly to the farther point of the rock to watch her  he was quickly followed by the landingmaster who touched him on the shoulder and in perfect silence but with a look of intense anxiety pointed to the vessel  i see it wilson  god help us if she fails to make the rock within a very short time said mr stevenson  she will never reach us in time said wilson in a tone that convinced his companion he entertained no hope  perhaps she may he said hurriedly she is a good sailer  good sailing replied the other cannot avail against wind and tide together  no human power can bring that vessel to our aid until long after the tide has covered the bell rock  both remained silent for some time watching with intense anxiety the ineffectual efforts of the little vessel to beat up to windward  in a few minutes the engineer turned to his companion and said they cannot save us wilson  the two boats that are leftcan they hold us all  the landingmaster shook his head  the two boats said he will be completely filled by their own crews  for ordinary rough weather they would be quite full enough  in a sea like that he said pointing to the angry waves that were being gradually lashed into foam by the increasing wind they will be overloaded  come i dont know that wilson we may devise something said mr stevenson with a forced air of confidence as he moved slowly towards the place where the men were still working busy as bees and all unconscious of the perilous circumstances in which they were placed  as the engineer pondered the prospect of deliverance his thoughts led him rather to despair than to hope  there were thirtytwo persons in all upon the rock that day with only two boats which even in good weather could not unitedly accommodate more than twentyfour sitters but to row to the floating light with so much wind and in so heavy a sea a complement of eight men for each boat was as much as could with propriety be attempted so that about half of their number was thus unprovided for  under these circumstances he felt that to despatch one of the boats in expectation of either working the smeaton sooner up to the rock or in hopes of getting her boat brought to their assistance would besides being useless at once alarm the workmen each of whom would probably insist upon taking to his own boat and leaving the eight men of the smeaton to their chance  a scuffle might ensue and he knew well that when men are contending for life the results may be very disastrous  for a considerable time the men remained in ignorance of the terrible conflict that was going on in their commanders breast  as they wrought chiefly in sitting or kneeling postures excavating the rock or boring with jumpers their attention was naturally diverted from everything else around them  the dense volumes of smoke too that rose from the forge fire so enveloped them as to render distant objects dim or altogether invisible  while this lastedwhile the numerous hammers were going and the anvil continued to sound the situation of things did not appear so awful to the only two who were aware of what had occurred  but ere long the tide began to rise upon those who were at work on the lower parts of the beacon and lighthouse  from the run of the sea upon the rock the forge fire was extinguished sooner than usual the volumes of smoke cleared away and objects became visible in every direction  after having had about three hours work the men began pretty generally to make towards their respective boats for their jackets and socks  then it was that they made the discovery that one boat was absent  only a few exclamations were uttered  a glance at the two boats and a hurried gaze to seaward were sufficient to acquaint them with their awful position  not a word was spoken by anyone  all appeared to be silently calculating their numbers and looking at each other with evident marks of perplexity depicted in their countenances  the landingmaster conceiving that blame might attach to him for having allowed the boat to leave the rock kept a little apart from the men  all eyes were turned as if by instinct to mr stevenson  the men seemed to feel that the issue lay with him  the engineer was standing on an elevated part of the rock named smiths ledge gazing in deep anxiety at the distant smeaton in the hope that he might observe some effort being made at least to pull the boat to their rescue  slowly but surely the tide rose overwhelming the lower parts of the rock sending each successive wave nearer and nearer to the feet of those who were now crowded on the last ledge that could afford them standingroom  the deep silence that prevailed was awful  it proved that each mind saw clearly the impossibility of anything being devised and that a deadly struggle for precedence was inevitable  mr stevenson had all along been rapidly turning over in his mind various schemes which might be put in practice for the general safety provided the men could be kept under command  he accordingly turned to address them on the perilous nature of their circumstances intending to propose that all hands should strip off their upper clothing when the higher parts of the rock should be laid under water that the seamen should remove every unnecessary weight and encumbrance from the boats that a specified number of men should go into each boat and that the remainder should hang by the gunwales while the boats were to be rowed gently towards the smeaton as the course to the floating light lay rather to windward of the rock  but when he attempted to give utterance to his thoughts the words refused to come  so powerful an effect had the awful nature of their position upon him that his parched tongue could not articulate  he learned from terrible experience that saliva is as necessary to speech as the tongue itself  stooping hastily he dipped his hand into a pool of salt water and moistened his mouth  this produced immediate relief and he was about to speak when ruby brand who had stood at his elbow all the time with compressed lips and a stern frown on his brow suddenly took off his cap and waving it above his head shouted a boat a boat with all the power of his lungs  all eyes were at once turned in the direction to which he pointed and there sure enough a large boat was seen through the haze making towards the rock  doubtless many a heart there swelled with gratitude to god who had thus opportunely and most unexpectedly sent them relief at the eleventh hour but the only sound that escaped them was a cheer such as men seldom give or hear save in cases of deliverance in times of dire extremity  the boat belonged to james spink the bell rock pilot who chanced to have come off express from arbroath that day with letters  we have said that spink came off by chance but when we consider all the circumstances of the case and the fact that boats seldom visited the bell rock at any time and never during bad weather we are constrained to feel that god does in his mercy interfere sometimes in a peculiar and special manner in human affairs and that there was something more and higher than mere chance in the deliverance of stevenson and his men upon this occasion  the pilotboat having taken on board as many as it could hold set sail for the floating light the other boats then put off from the rock with the rest of the men but they did not reach the pharos until after a long and weary pull of three hours during which the waves broke over the boats so frequently as to necessitate constant baling  when the floating light was at last reached a new difficulty met them for the vessel rolled so much and the men were so exhausted that it proved to be a work of no little toil and danger to get them all on board  long forsyth in particular cost them all an infinite amount of labour for he was so sick poor fellow that he could scarcely move  indeed he did at one time beg them earnestly to drop him into the sea and be done with him altogether a request with which they of course refused to comply  however he was got up somehow and the whole of them were comforted by a glass of rum and thereafter a cup of hot coffee  ruby had the good fortune to obtain the additional comfort of a letter from minnie which although it did not throw much light on the proceedings of captain ogilvy for that sapient seamans proceedings were usually involved in a species of obscurity which light could not penetrate nevertheless assured him that something was being done in his behalf and that if he only kept quiet for a time all would be well  the letter also assured him of the unalterable affection of the writer an assurance which caused him to rejoice to such an extent that he became for a time perfectly regardless of all other sublunary things and even came to look upon the bell rock as a species of paradise watched over by the eye of an angel with golden hair in which he could indulge his pleasant dreams to the utmost  that he had to indulge those dreams in the midst of storm and rain and smoke surrounded by sea and seaweed workmen and hammers and forges and picks and jumpers and seals while his strong muscles and endurance were frequently tried to the uttermost was a matter of no moment to ruby brand  all experience goes to prove that great joy will utterly overbear the adverse influence of physical troubles especially if those troubles are without and do not touch the seats of life within  minnies love expressed as it was in her own innocent truthful and straightforward way rendered his body big though it was almost incapable of containing his soul  he pulled the oar hammered the jumper battered the anvil tore at the bellows and hewed the solid bell rock with a vehemence that aroused the admiration of his comrades and induced jamie dove to pronounce him to be the best fellow the world ever produced    chapter eleven  a storm and a dismal state of things on board the pharos  from what has been said at the close of the last chapter it will not surprise the reader to be told that the storm which blew during that night had no further effect on ruby brand than to toss his hair about and cause a ruddier glow than usual to deepen the tone of his bronzed countenance  it was otherwise with many of his hapless comrades a few of whom had also received letters that day but whose pleasure was marred to some extent by the qualms within  being saturday a glass of rum was served out in the evening according to custom and the men proceeded to hold what is known by the name of saturday night at sea  this being a night that was usually much enjoyed on board owing to the home memories that were recalled and the familiar songs that were sung owing also to the limited supply of grog which might indeed cheer but could not by any possibility inebriate the men endeavoured to shake off their fatigue and to forget if possible the rolling of the vessel  the first effort was not difficult but the second was not easy  at first however the gale was not severe so they fought against circumstances bravely for a time  come lads cried the smith in a species of seriocomic desperation when they had all assembled below lets drink to sweethearts and wives  hear hear  bless their hearts  sweethearts and wives responded the men  hip hip  the cheer that followed was a genuine one  now for a song boys cried one of the men and i think the last arrivals are bound to sing first  hear hear  ruby lad youre in for it said the smith who sat near his assistant  what shall i sing enquired ruby  oh let me see said joe dumsby assuming the air of one who endeavoured to recall something  could you come beetovens symphony on b flat  ah howld yer tongue joe cried oconnor sure the young man can only sing on the sharp kays aint he always sharpin the tools not to speak of his appetite  youve a blunt way of speaking yourself friend said dumsby in a tone of reproof  hallo stop your jokes cried the smith if you treat us to any more o that sort o thing well have ye dipped over the side and hung up to dry at the end o the mainyard  fire away ruby my tulip  ay thats hit said john watt  gie us the girl ye left behind ye  ruby flushed suddenly and turned towards the speaker with a look of surprise  whats wrang freend  hae ye never heard o that sang enquired watt  o yes i forgot said ruby recovering himself in some confusion  i know the songii was thinking of somethingof  the girl ye left behind ye av coorse put in oconnor with a wink  come strike up cried the men  ruby at once obeyed and sang the desired song with a sweet full voice that had the effect of moistening some of the eyes present  the song was received enthusiastically  your health and song lads said robert selkirk the principal builder who came down the ladder and joined them at that moment  thank you now its my call said ruby  i call upon ned oconnor for a song  or a speech cried forsyth  a spaitch is it said oconnor with a look of deep modesty  sure i never made a spaitch in me life except when i axed mrs oconnor to marry me an i never finished that spaitch for i only got the length of och darlint when she cut me short in the middle with sure you may have me ned and welcome  shame shame said dove to say that of your wife  shame to yersilf cried oconnor indignantly  aint i payin the good woman a compliment when i say that she had pity on me bashfulness and came to me help when i was in difficulty  quite right oconnor but lets have a song if you wont speak  would ye thank a cracked taykittle for a song said ned  certainly not replied peter logan who was apt to take things too literally  then dont ax me for wan said the irishman but ill do this for ye messmates ill read ye the last letter i got from the mistress just to show ye that her price is beyond all calkerlation  a round of applause followed this offer as ned drew forth a muchsoiled letter from the breast pocket of his coat and carefully unfolding it spread it on his knee  it begins said oconnor in a slightly hesitating tone with some expressions of aaraither endearin charackter that perhaps i may as well pass  no no shouted the men lets have them all  out with them paddy  well well av ye will have them here they be  galway  my own purty darlin as has bin my most luved sin the day we wos marrit youll be grieved to larn that the pigs gone to its long home  here oconnor paused to make some parenthetical remarks with which indeed he interlarded the whole letter  the pig you must know lads was an old sow as belonged to me wifes granmother an besides bein a sort o pet o the family was an uncommon profitable crature  but to purceed  she goes on to saywe waked her thats the pig boys yisterday and buried her this mornin  big rory the baist was for aitin her but i wouldnt hear of it so

folded the letter and replaced it in his pocket  six of em replied ned every one purtier and better nor another  is it a long way to galway continued joe  not long but its a coorious thing that englishmen never come back from them parts whin they wance ventur into them  joe was about to retort when the men called for another song  come jamie dove lets have rule britannia  dove was by this time quite yellow in the face and felt more inclined to go to bed than to sing but he braced himself up resolved to struggle manfully against the demon that oppressed him  it was in vain  poor dove had just reached that point in the chorus where britons stoutly affirm that they never never never shall be slaves when a tremendous roll of the vessel caused him to spring from the locker on which he sat and rush to his berth  there were several of the others whose selfrestraint was demolished by this example these likewise fled amid the laughter of their companions who broke up the meeting and went on deck  the prospect of things there proved beyond all doubt that britons never did and never will rule the waves  the storm which had been brewing for some time past was gathering fresh strength every moment and it became abundantly evident that the floating light would have her anchors and cables tested pretty severely before the gale was over  about eight oclock in the evening the wind shifted to eastsoutheast and at ten it became what seamen term a hard gale rendering it necessary to veer out about fifty additional fathoms of the hempen cable  the gale still increasing the ship rolled and laboured excessively and at midnight eighty fathoms more were veered out while the sea continued to strike the vessel with a degree of force that no one had before experienced  that night there was little rest on board the pharos  everyone who has been at sea knows what it is to lie in ones berth on a stormy night with the planks of the deck only a few inches from ones nose and the water swashing past the little port that always leaks the seas striking against the ship the heavy sprays falling on the decks and the constant rattle and row of blocks spars and cordage overhead but all this was as nothing compared with the state of things on board the floating light for that vessel could not rise to the seas with the comparatively free motions of a ship sailing either with or against the gale  she tugged and strained at her cable as if with the fixed determination of breaking it and she offered all the opposition of a fixed body to the seas  daylight though ardently longed for brought no relief  the gale continued with unabated violence  the sea struck so hard upon the vessels bows that it rose in great quantities or as ruby expressed it in green seas which completely swept the deck as far aft as the quarterdeck and not unfrequently went completely over the stern of the ship  those green seas fell at last so heavily on the skylights that all the glass was driven in and the water poured down into the cabins producing dire consternation in the minds of those below who thought that the vessel was sinking  im drowned intirely roared poor ned oconnor as the first of those seas burst in and poured straight down on his hammock which happened to be just beneath the skylight  ned sprang out on the deck missed his footing and was hurled with the next roll of the ship into the arms of the steward who was passing through the place at the time  before any comments could be made the deadlights were put on and the cabins were involved in almost absolute darkness  och let me in beside ye pleaded ned with the occupant of the nearest berth  awa wi ye  na na cried john watt pushing the unfortunate man away  cheinge yer wat claes first an ill maybe let ye in if ye can find me again i the dark  while the irishman was groping about in search of his chest one of the officers of the ship passed him on his way to the companion ladder intending to go on deck  ruby brand feeling uncomfortable below leaped out of his hammock and followed him  they had both got about halfway up the ladder when a tremendous sea struck the ship causing it to tremble from stem to stern  at the same moment someone above opened the hatch and putting his head down shouted for the officer who happened to be just ascending  ay ay replied the individual in question  just as he spoke another heavy sea fell on the deck and rushing aft like a river that has burst its banks hurled the seaman into the arms of the officer who fell back upon ruby and all three came down with tons of water into the cabin  the scene that followed would have been ludicrous had it not been serious  the still rising sea caused the vessel to roll with excessive violence and the large quantity of water that had burst in swept the men who had jumped out of their beds and all movable things from side to side in indescribable confusion  as the water dashed up into the lower tier of beds it was found necessary to lift one of the scuttles in the floor and let it flow into the limbers of the ship  fortunately no one was hurt and ruby succeeded in gaining the deck before the hatch was reclosed and fastened down upon the scene of discomfort and misery below  this state of things continued the whole day  the seas followed in rapid succession and each as it struck the vessel caused her to shake all over  at each blow from a wave the rolling and pitching ceased for a few seconds giving the impression that the ship had broken adrift and was running with the wind or in the act of sinking but when another sea came she ranged up against it with great force  this latter effect at last became the regular intimation to the anxious men below that they were still riding safely at anchor  no fires could be lighted therefore nothing could be cooked so that the men were fain to eat hard biscuitsthose of them at least who were able to eat at alland lie in their wet blankets all day  at ten in the morning the wind had shifted to northeast and blew if possible harder than before accompanied by a much heavier swell of the sea it was therefore judged advisable to pay out more cable in order to lessen the danger of its giving way  during the course of the gale nearly the whole length of the hempen cable of 120 fathoms was veered out besides the chainmoorings and for its preservation the cable was carefully served or wattled with pieces of canvas round the windlass and with leather well greased in the hawsehole where the chafing was most violent  as may readily be imagined the gentleman on whom rested nearly all the responsibility connected with the work at the bell rock passed an anxious and sleepless time in his darkened berth  during the morning he had made an attempt to reach the deck but had been checked by the same sea that produced the disasters above described  about two oclock in the afternoon great alarm was felt in consequence of a heavy sea that struck the ship almost filling the waist and pouring down into the berths below through every chink and crevice of the hatches and skylights  from the motion being suddenly checked or deadened and from the flowing in of the water above every individual on board thought that the ship was founderingat least all the landsmen were fully impressed with that idea  mr stevenson could not remain below any longer  as soon as the ship again began to range up to the sea he made another effort to get on deck  before going however he went through the various apartments in order to ascertain the state of things below  groping his way in darkness from his own cabin he came to that of the officers of the ship  here all was quiet as well as dark  he next entered the galley and other compartments occupied by the artificers here also all was dark but not quiet for several of the men were engaged in prayer or repeating psalms in a full tone of voice while others were protesting that if they should be fortunate enough to get once more ashore no one should ever see them afloat again but so loud was the creaking of the bulkheads the dashing of water and the whistling noise of the wind that it was hardly possible to distinguish words or voices  the master of the vessel accompanied mr stevenson and in one or two instances anxious and repeated enquiries were made by the workmen as to the state of things on deck to all of which he returned one characteristic answerit cant blow long in this way lads we must have better weather soon  the next compartment in succession moving forward was that allotted to the seamen of the ship  here there was a characteristic difference in the scene  having reached the middle of the darksome berth without the inmates being aware of the intrusion the anxious engineer was somewhat reassured and comforted to find that although they talked of bad weather and cross accidents of the sea yet the conversation was carried on in that tone and manner which bespoke ease and composure of mind  well lads said mr stevenson accosting the men what think you of this state of things  will the good ship weather it  nae fear o her sir replied one confidently shes light and new itll tak a heavy sea to sink her  ay observed another and shes got little hold o the water good groundtackle and no tophamper shell weather anything sir  having satisfied himself that all was right below mr stevenson returned aft and went on deck where a sublime and awful sight awaited him  the waves appeared to be what we hear sometimes termed mountains high  in reality they were perhaps about thirty feet of unbroken water in height their foaming crests being swept and torn by the furious gale  all beyond the immediate neighbourhood of the ship was black and chaotic  upon deck everything movable was out of sight having either been stowed away below previous to the gale or washed overboard  some parts of the quarter bulwarks were damaged by the breach of the sea and one of the boats was broken and halffull of water  there was only one solitary individual on deck placed there to watch and give the alarm if the cable should give way and this man was ruby brand who having become tired of having nothing to do had gone on deck as we have seen and volunteered his services as watchman  ruby had no greatcoat on no overall of any kind but was simply dressed in his ordinary jacket and trousers  he had thrust his cap into his pocket in order to prevent it being blown away and his brown locks were streaming in the wind  he stood just aft the foremast to which he had lashed himself with a gasket or small rope round his waist to prevent his falling on the deck or being washed overboard  he was as thoroughly wet as if he had been drawn through the sea and this was one reason why he was so lightly clad that he might wet as few clothes as possible and have a dry change when he went below  there appeared to be a smile on his lips as he faced the angry gale and gazed steadily out upon the wild ocean  he seemed to be enjoying the sight of the grand elemental strife that was going on around him perchance he was thinking of someone not very far awaywith golden hair  mr stevenson coupling this smile on rubys face with the remarks of the other seamen felt that things were not so bad as they appeared to unaccustomed eyes nevertheless he deemed it right to advise with the master and officers as to the probable result in the event of the ship drifting from her moorings  it is my opinion said the master on his being questioned as to this that we have every chance of riding out the gale which cannot continue many hours longer with the same fury and even if she should part from her anchor the stormsails have been laid ready to hand and can be bent in a very short time  the direction of the wind being noreast we could sail up the forth to leith roads but if this should appear doubtful after passing the may we can steer for tyningham sands on the western side of dunbar and there run the ship ashore  from the flatness of her bottom and the strength of her build i should think there would be no danger in beaching her even in a very heavy sea  this was so far satisfactory and for some time things continued in pretty much the state we have just described but soon after there was a sudden cessation of the straining motion of the ship which surprised everyone  in another moment ruby shouted all hands ahoy ships adrift  the consternation that followed may be conceived but not described  the windlass was instantly manned and the men soon gave out that there was no strain on the cable  the mizzensail which was occasionally bent for the purpose of making the ship ride easily was at once set the other sails were hoisted as quickly as possible and they bore away about a mile to the southwestward where at a spot that was deemed suitable the bestbower anchor was let go in twenty fathoms water  happily the storm had begun to abate before this accident happened  had it occurred during the height of the gale the result might have been most disastrous to the undertaking at the bell rock  having made all fast an attempt was made to kindle the galley fire and cook some food  wot are we to ave steward enquired joe dumsby in a feeble voice  plumduff my boy so cheer up replied the steward who was busy with the charming ingredients of a suet pudding which was the only dish to be attempted owing to the ease with which it could be both cooked and served up  accordingly the suet pudding was made the men began to eat the gale began to take off as seaman express it and although things were still very far removed from a state of comfort they began to be more endurable health began to return to the sick and hope to those who had previously given way to despair    chapter twelve  bell rock billowsan unexpected visita disaster and a rescue  it is pleasant it is profoundly enjoyable to sit on the margin of the sea during the dead calm that not unfrequently succeeds a wild storm and watch the gentle undulations of the glasslike surface which the very gulls seem to be disinclined to ruffle with their wings as they descend to hover above their own reflected images  it is pleasant to watch this from the shore where the waves fall in low murmuring ripples or from the ships deck far out upon the sea where there is no sound of water save the laving of the vessels bow as she rises and sinks in the broadbacked swell but there is something more than pleasant there is something deeply and peculiarly interesting in the same scene when viewed from such a position as the bell rock for there owing to the position of the rock and the depth of water around it the observer beholds at the same moment the presence as it were of storm and calm  the largest waves there are seen immediately after a storm has passed away not during its continuance no matter how furious the gale may have been for the rushing wind has a tendency to blow down the waves so to speak and prevent their rising to their utmost height  it is when the storm is over that the swell rises but as this swell appears only like large undulations it does not impress the beholder with its magnitude until it draws near to the rock and begins to feel the checking influence of the bottom of the sea  the upper part of the swell having then greater velocity than the lower parts assumes more and more the form of a billow  as it comes on it towers up like a great green wall of glittering glass moving with a grand solemn motion which does not at first give the idea of much force or impetus  as it nears the rock however its height probably fifteen or twenty feet becomes apparent its velocity increases the top with what may be termed gentle rapidity rushes in advance of the base its dark green side becomes concave the upper edge lips over then curls majestically downwards as if bowing to a superior power and a gleam of light flashes for a moment on the curling top  as yet there is no sound all has occurred in the profound silence of the calm but another instant and there is a mighty crasha deafening roar the great wall of water has fallen and a very sea of churning foam comes leaping bursting spouting over rocks and ledges carrying all before it with a tremendous sweep that seems to be absolutely irresistible until it meets the higher ledges of rock when it is hurled back and retires with a watery hiss that suggests the idea of baffled rage  but it is not conquered  with the calm majesty of unalterable determination wave after wave comes on in slow regular succession like the inexhaustible battalions of an unconquerable foe to meet with a similar repulse again and again  there is however this peculiar difference between the waves on the ordinary seashore and the billows on the bell rock that the latter unlike the former are not always defeated  the spectator on shore plants his foot confidently at the very edge of the mighty sea knowing that thus far it may come but no farther  on the bell rock the rising tide makes the conflict for a time more equal  now the rock stands proudly above the sea anon the sea sweeps furiously over the rock with a roar of victory  thus the war goes on and thus the tide of battle daily and nightly ebbs and flows all the year round  but when the cunning hand of man began to interfere the aspect of things was changed the sea was forced to succumb and the rock once a dreaded enemy became a servant of the human race  true the former rages in rebellion still and the latter although compelled to uphold the light that warns against itself continues its perpetual warfare with the sea but both are effectually conquered by means of the wonderful intelligence that god has given to man and the sea for more than half a century has vainly beat against the massive tower whose foundation is on the bell rock  but all this savours somewhat of anticipation  let us return to ruby brand in whose interest we have gone into this long digression for he it was who gazed intently at the mingled scene of storm and calm which we have attempted to describe and it was he who thought out most of the ideas which we have endeavoured to convey  ruby had lent a hand to work the pump at the foundationpit that morning  after a good spell at it he took his turn of rest and in order to enjoy it fully went as far out as he could upon the seaward ledges and sat down on a piece of rock to watch the waves  while seated there robert selkirk came and sat down beside him selkirk was the principal builder and ultimately laid every stone of the lighthouse with his own hand  he was a sedate quiet man but full of energy and perseverance  when the stones were landed faster than they could be built into their places he and bremner as well as some of the other builders used to work on until the rising tide reached their waists  its a grand sight ruby said selkirk as a larger wave than usual fell and came rushing in torrents of foam up to their feet sending a little of the spray over their heads  it is indeed a glorious sight said ruby  if i had nothing to do i believe i could sit here all day just looking at the waves and thinking  thinkin repeated selkirk in a musing tone of voice  can ye tell lad what ye think about when youre lookin at the waves  ruby smiled at the oddness of the question  well said he i dont think i ever thought of that before  ah but i have said the other an ive come to the conclusion that for the most part we dont think properly speakin at all that our thoughts so to speak think for us that they just take the bit in their teeth and go rumblin and tumblin about anyhow or nohow  ruby knitted his brows and pondered  he was one of those men who when they dont understand a thing hold their tongues and think  and continued selkirk its curious to observe what a lot o nonsense one thinks too when one is lookin at the waves  many a time i have pulled myself up thinkin the most astonishin stuff ye could imagine  i would hardly have expected this of such a grave kind o man as you said ruby  mayhap not  it is not always the gravest looking that have the gravest thoughts  but you dont mean to say that you never think sense continued ruby when you sit looking at the waves  by no means returned his companion im only talking of the way in which ones thoughts will wander  sometimes i think seriously enough sometimes i think it strange that men can look at such a scene as that and scarcely bestow a thought upon him who made it  speak for yourself friend said ruby somewhat quickly how know you that other men dont think about their creator when they look at his works  because returned selkirk i find that i so seldom do so myself even although i wish to and often try to and i hold that every man no matter what he is or feels is one of a class who think and feel as he does also because many people especially christians have told me that they have had the same experience to a large extent also and chiefly because as far as unbelieving man is concerned the bible tells me that god is not in all his thoughts  but ruby i did not make the remark as a slur upon men in general i merely spoke of a factan unfortunate factthat it is not natural to us and not easy to rise from nature to natures god and i thought you would agree with me  i believe you are right said ruby halfashamed of the petulance of his reply at any rate i confess you are right as far as i am concerned  as selkirk and ruby were both fond of discussion they continued this subject some time longer and there is no saying how far they would have gone down into the abstruse depths of theology had not their converse been interrupted by the appearance of a boat rowing towards the rock  is yonder craft a fishing boat think you said ruby rising and pointing to it  like enough lad  mayhap its the pilots only its too soon for him to be off again with letters  maybe its visitors to the rock for i see something like a womans bonnet  as there was only one woman in the world at that time as far as ruby was concerned of course putting his mother out of the question it will not surprise the reader to be told that the youth started that his cheek reddened a little and his heart beat somewhat faster than usual he immediately smiled however at the absurdity of supposing it possible that the woman in the boat could be minnie and as the blacksmith shouted to him at that moment he turned on his heel and leaped from ledge to ledge of rock until he gained his wonted place at the forge  soon he was busy wielding the forehammer causing the sparks to fly about himself and his comrade in showers while the anvil rang out its merry peal  meanwhile the boat drew near  it turned out to be a party of visitors who had come off from arbroath to see the operations at the bell rock they had been brought off by spink the pilot and numbered only three namely a tall soldierlike man a stout sailorlike man and a young woman withyeswith golden hair  poor ruby almost leaped over the forge when he raised his eyes from his work and caught sight of minnies sweet face  minnie had recognised her lover before the boat reached the rock for he stood on an elevated ledge and the work in which he was engaged swinging the large hammer round his shoulder rendered him very conspicuous  she had studiously concealed her face from him until quite close when looking him straight in the eyes without the least sign of recognition she turned away  we have said that the first glance ruby obtained caused him to leap nearly over the forge the second created such a revulsion of feeling that he let the forehammer fall  hallo  got a spark in yer eye enquired dove looking up anxiously  it flashed across ruby at that instant that the look given him by minnie was meant to warn him not to take any notice of her so he answered the smiths query with no no ive only let the hammer fall dont you see  get on old boy an dont let the metal cool  the smith continued his work without further remark and ruby assisted resolving in his own mind to be a little more guarded as to the expression of his feelings  meanwhile mr stevenson received the visitors and showed them over the works pointing out the peculiarities thereof and the difficulties that stood in the way  presently he came towards the forge and said brand the stout gentleman there wishes to speak to you  he says he knew you in arbroath  you can spare him for a few minutes i suppose mr dove  well yes but not for long replied the smith  the tide will soon be up and ive enough to do to get through with all these  ruby flung down his hammer at the first word and hastened to the ledge of rock where the visitors were standing as far apart from the workmen as the space of the rock would admit of  the stout gentleman was no other than his uncle captain ogilvy who put his finger to his lips as his nephew approached and gave him a look of mystery that was quite sufficient to put the latter on his guard  he therefore went forward pulled off his cap and bowed respectfully to minnie who replied with a stiff curtsy a slight smile and a decided blush  although ruby now felt convinced that they were all acting a part he could scarcely bear this cold reception  his impulse was to seize minnie in his arms but he did not even get the comfort of a cold shake of the hand  nephy said the captain in a hoarse whisper putting his face close to that of ruby mums the word  silence mystery an all that sort o thing  dont appear to be an old friend lad and as to minnie here    o no we never mention her   her name its never heard  allow me to introduce you to major stewart whose house you broke into you know ruby when    all in the downs the fleet was moored  at least when the termagant was waitin for you to go aboard  here the captain winked and gave ruby a facetious poke in the ribs which was not quite in harmony with the ignorance of each other he was endeavouring to inculcate  young man said the major quietly we have come off to tell you that everything is in a prosperous state as regards the investigation into your innocencethe private investigation i mean for the authorities happily know nothing of your being here  captain ogilvy has made me his confidant in this matter and from what he tells me i am convinced that you had nothing to do with this robbery  excuse me if i now add that the sight of your face deepens this conviction  ruby bowed to the compliment  we were anxious to write at once to the captain of the vessel in which you sailed continued the major but you omitted to leave his full name and address when you left  we were afraid to write to you lest your name on the letter might attract attention and induce a premature arrest  hence our visit to the rock today  please to write the address in this pocketbook  the major handed ruby a small green pocketbook as he spoke in which the latter wrote the full name and address of his late skipper  now nephy said the captain we must im sorry to say bid ye good day and ask you to return to your work for it wont do to rouse suspicion lad  only keep quiet here and do yer dootyengland expects every man to do his dootyand as sure as your names ruby all will be shipshape in a few weeks  i thank you sincerely said ruby addressing the major but looking at minnie  captain ogilvy observing this and fearing some display of feeling that would be recognised by the workmen who were becoming surprised at the length of the interview placed himself between minnie and her lover  no no ruby said he solemnly  im sorry for ye lad but it wont do  patience is a virtue which taken at the flood leads on to fortune  my mother said ruby wishing to prolong the interview  is well said the captain  now goodbye lad and be off  goodbye minnie cried ruby stepping forward suddenly and seizing the girls hand then wheeling quickly round he sprang over the rocks and returned to his post  ha its time cried the smith  i thought you would never be done makin love to that there girl  come blaze away  ruby felt so nettled by the necessity that was laid upon him of taking no notice of minnie that he seized the handle of the bellows passionately and at the first puff blew nearly all the fire away  hallo messmate cried the smith clearing the dust from his eyes what on airth ails ye  youve blowed the whole consarn out  ruby made no reply but scraping together the embers heaped them up and blew more gently  in a short time the visitors reentered their boat and rowed out of the creek in which it had been lying  ruby became so exasperated at not being able even to watch the boat going away that he showered terrific blows on the mass of metal the smith was turning rapidly on the anvil  not so fast lad not so fast cried dove hurriedly  rubys chafing spirit blew up just at that point he hit the iron a crack that knocked it as flat as a pancake and then threw down the hammer and deliberately gazed in the direction of the boat  the sight that met his eyes appalled him  the boat had been lying in the inlet named port stevenson  it had to pass out to the open sea through wilsons track and past a small outlying rock named grays rockknown more familiarly among the men as johnny gray  the boat was nearing this point when the sea which had been rising for some time burst completely over the seaward ledges and swept the boat high against the rocks on the left  the men had scarcely got her again into the track when another tremendous billow such as we have already described swept over the rocks again and swamped the boat which being heavily ballasted sank at once to the bottom of the pool  it was this sight that met the horrified eyes of ruby when he looked up  he vaulted over the bellows like an antelope and rushing over smiths ledge and trinity ledge sprang across port boyle and dived head foremost into neills pool before any of the other men who made a general rush could reach the spot  a few powerful strokes brought ruby to the place where the major and the captain neither of whom could swim were struggling in the water  he dived at once below these unfortunates and almost in a second reappeared with minnie in his arms  a few seconds sufficed to bring him to smiths ledge where several of his comrades hauled him and his burden beyond the reach of the next wave and where a moment or two later the major and captain with the crew of the boat were landed in safety  to bear the light form of minnie in his strong arms to the highest and driest part of the rock were the work of a few moments to ruby  brief though those moments were however they were precious to the youth beyond all human powers of calculation for minnie recovered partial consciousness and fancying doubtless that she was still in danger flung her arms round his neck and grasped him convulsively  reader we tell you in confidence that if ruby had at that moment been laid on the rack and torn limb from limb he would have cheered out his life triumphantly  it was not only that he knew she loved himthat he knew beforebut he had saved the life of the girl he loved and a higher terrestrial happiness can scarcely be attained by man  laying her down as gently as a mother would her firstborn ruby placed a coat under her head and bade his comrades stand back and give her air  it was fortunate for him that one of the foremen who understood what to do came up at this moment and ordered him to leave off chafing the girls hand with his wet fists and go get some water boiled at the forge if he wanted to do her good  second words were not needed  the bellows were soon blowing and the fire glowed in a way that it had not done since the works at the bell rock began  before the water quite boiled some tea was put in and with a degree of speed that would have roused the jealousy of any living waiter a cup of tea was presented to minnie who had recovered almost at the moment ruby left her  she drank a little and then closing her eyes moved her lips silently for a few seconds  captain ogilvy who had attended her with the utmost assiduity and tenderness as soon as he had wrung the water out of his own garments here took an opportunity of hastily pouring something into the cup out of a small flask  when minnie looked up again and smiled he presented her with the cup  she thanked him and drank a mouthful or two before perceiving that it had been tampered with  theres something in it she said hurriedly  so there is my pet said the captain with a benignant smile a little nectar that will do you more good than all the tea  come now dont shake your head but down with it all like a good child  but minnie was proof against persuasion and refused to taste any more  who was it that saved me uncle  she had got into the way of calling the captain uncle  ruby brand did it my darlin said the old man with a look of pride ah youre better now stay dont attempt to rise  yes yes uncle she said getting up and looking round it is time that we should go now we have a long way to go you know  where is the boat  the boat my precious is at the bottom of the sea  as he said this he pointed to the mast half of which was seen rising out of the pool where the boat had gone down  but you dont need to mind continued the captain for theyre goin to send us in one o their own boats aboord the floatin lightship where well get a change o clothes an somethin to eat  as he spoke one of the sailors came forward and announced that the boat was ready so the captain and the major assisted minnie into the boat which soon pushed off with part of the workmen from the rock  it was to be sent back for the remainder of the crew by which time the tide would render it necessary that all should leave  ruby purposely kept away from the group while they were embarking and after they were gone proceeded to resume work  you took a smart dive that time lad observed joe dumsby as they went along  not more than anyone would do for a girl said ruby  an such a purty wan too said oconnor  ah av shes not irish she should ha bin  yere a lucky chap to hae sic a chance observed john watt  make up to her lad said forsyth i think she couldnt refuse ye after doin her such service  time enough to chaff after work is over cried ruby with a laugh as he turned up his sleeves and seizing the hammer began as his friend dove said to work himself dry  in a few minutes work was resumed and for another hour all continued busy as bees cutting and pounding at the flinty surface of the bell rock    chapter thirteen  a sleepless but a pleasant night  the evening which followed the day that has just been described was bright calm and beautiful with the starry host unclouded and distinctly visible to the profoundest depths of space  as it was intended to send the smeaton to arbroath next morning for a cargo of stones from the buildingyard the wrecked party were prevailed on to remain all night on board the pharos instead of going ashore in one of the ships boats which could not well be spared at the time  this arrangement we need hardly say gave inexpressible pleasure to ruby and was not altogether distasteful to minnie although she felt anxious about mrs brand who would naturally be much alarmed at the prolonged absence of herself and the captain  however there was no help for it and it was wonderful the resignation which she displayed in the circumstances  it was not rubys duty to watch on deck that night yet strange to say ruby kept watch the whole night long  there was no occasion whatever for minnie to go on deck after it was dark yet strange to say minnie kept coming on deck at intervals nearly the whole night long  sometimes to look at the stars sometimes to get a mouthful of fresh air frequently to find out what that strange noise could be that had alarmed her and at last especially towards the early hours of morningfor no reason whatever except that she could not sleep below  it was very natural that when minnie paced the quarterdeck between the stern and the mainmast and ruby paced the forepart of the deck between the bows and the mainmast the two should occasionally meet at the mainmast  it was also very natural that when they did meet the girl who had been rescued should stop and address a few words of gratitude to the man who had saved her  but it was by no means naturalnay it was altogether unnatural and unaccountable that when it became dark the said man and the said girl should get into a close and confidential conversation which lasted for hours to the amusement of captain ogilvy and the major who quite understood it and to the amazement of many of the ships crew who couldnt understand it at all  at last minnie bade ruby a final good night and went below and ruby who could not persuade himself that it was final continued to walk the deck until his eyes began to shut and open involuntarily like those of a sick owl  then he also went below and before he fell quite asleep according to his own impression was awakened by the bell that called the men to land on the rock and commence work  it was not only ruby who found it difficult to rouse himself that morning  the landingbell was rung at four oclock as the tide suited at that early hour but the men were so fatigued that they would gladly have slept some hours longer  this however the nature of the service would not admit of  the building of the bell rock lighthouse was a peculiar service  it may be said to have resembled duty in the trenches in military warfare  at times the work was light enough but for the most part it was severe and irregular as the men had to work in all kinds of weather as long as possible in the face of unusual difficulties and dangers and were liable to be called out at all unseasonable hours  but they knew and expected this and faced the work like men  after a growl or two and a few heavy sighs they all tumbled out of their berths and in a very short time were mustered on deck where a glass of rum and a biscuit were served to each being the regular allowance when they had to begin work before breakfast  then they got into the boats and rowed away  rubys troubles were peculiar on this occasion  he could not bear the thought of leaving the pharos without saying goodbye to minnie but as minnie knew nothing of such early rising there was no reasonable hope that she would be awake  then he wished to put a few questions to his uncle which he had forgotten the day before but his uncle was at that moment buried in profound repose with his mouth wide open and a trombone solo proceeding from his nose which sadly troubled the unfortunates who lay near him  as there was no way of escape from these difficulties ruby like a wise man made up his mind to cast them aside so after swallowing his allowance he shouldered his big bellows heaved a deep sigh and took his place in one of the boats alongside  the lassitude which strong men feel when obliged to rise before they have had enough of rest soon wears off  the two boats had not left the pharos twenty yards astern when joe dumsby cried ho boys lets have a race  hooray shouted oconnor whose elastic spirits were always equal to anything an sure ruby will sing us the girl weve left behind us och an there she is av im not draymin  at that moment a little hand was waved from one of the ports of the floating light  ruby at once waved his in reply but as the attention of the men had been directed to the vessel by neds remark each saw the salutation and claiming it as a compliment to himself uttered a loud cheer which terminated in a burst of laughter caused by the sight of rubys halfangry halfashamed expression of face  as the other boat had shot ahead however at the first mention of the word race the men forgot this incident in their anxiety to overtake their comrades  in a few seconds both boats were going at full speed and they kept it up all the way to the rock  while this was going on the smeatons boat was getting ready to take the strangers on board the sloop and just as the workmen landed on the rock the smeaton cast loose her sails and proceeded to arbroath  there were a few seals basking on the bell rock this morning when the men landed  these at once made off and were not again seen during the day  at first seals were numerous on the rock  frequently from fifty to sixty of them were counted at one time and they seemed for a good while unwilling to forsake their old quarters but when the forge was set up they could stand it no longer  some of the boldest ventured to sun themselves there occasionally but when the clatter of the anvil and the wreaths of smoke became matters of daily occurrence they forsook the rock finally and sought the peace and quiet which man denied them there in other regions of the deep  the building of the lighthouse was attended with difficulties at every step  as a short notice of some of these and an account of the mode in which the great work was carried on cannot fail to be interesting to all who admire those engineering works which exhibit prominently the triumph of mind over matter we shall turn aside for a brief space to consider this subject    chapter fourteen  somewhat statistical  it has been already said that the bell rock rises only a few feet out of the sea at low tide  the foundation of the tower sunk into the solid rock was just three feet three inches above low water of the lowest springtides so that the lighthouse may be said with propriety to be founded beneath the waves  one great point that had to be determined at the commencement of the operations was the best method of landing the stones of the building this being a delicate and difficult process in consequence of the weight of the stones and their brittle nature especially in those parts which were worked to a delicate edge or formed into angular points  as the loss of a single stone too would stop the progress of the work until another should be prepared at the workyard in arbroath and sent off to the rock it may easily be imagined that this matter of the landing was of the utmost importance and that much consultation was held in regard to it  it would seem that engineers as well as doctors are apt to differ some suggested that each particular stone should be floated to the rock with a cork buoy attached to it while others proposed an airtank instead of the cork buoy  others again proposed to sail over the rock at high water in a flatbottomed vessel and drop the stones one after another when over the spot they were intended to occupy  a few still more eccentric and daring in their views suggested that a huge cofferdam or vessel should be built on shore and as much of the lighthouse built in this as would suffice to raise the building above the level of the highest tides that then it should be floated off to its station on the rock which should be previously prepared for its reception that the cofferdam should be scuttled and the ponderous mass of masonry weighing perhaps 1000 tons allowed to sink at once into its place  all these plans however were rejected by mr stevenson who resolved to carry the stones to the rock in boats constructed for the purpose these were named praam boats  the stones were therefore cut in conformity with exactly measured moulds in the workyard at arbroath and conveyed thence in the sloops already mentioned to the rock where the vessels were anchored at a distance sufficient to enable them to clear it in case of drifting  the cargoes were then unloaded at the moorings and laid on the decks of the praam boats which conveyed them to the rock where they were laid on small trucks run along the temporary rails to their positions and built in at once  each stone of this building was treated with as much care and solicitude as if it were a living creature  after being carefully cut and curiously formed and conveyed to the neighbourhood of the rock it was hoisted out of the hold and laid on the vessels deck when it was handed over to the landingmaster whose duty it became to transfer it by means of a combination of ropes and blocks to the deck of the praam boat and then deliver it at the rock  as the sea was seldom calm during the building operations and frequently in a state of great agitation lowering the stones on the decks of the praam boats was a difficult matter  in the act of working the apparatus one man was placed at each of the guytackles  this man assisted also at the purchasetackles for raising the stones and one of the ablest and most active of the crew was appointed to hold on the end of the falltackle which often required all his strength and his utmost agility in letting go for the purpose of lowering the stone at the instant the word lower was given  in a rolling sea much depended on the promptitude with which this part of the operation was performed  for the purpose of securing this the man who held the tackle placed himself before the mast in a sitting more frequently in a lying posture with his feet stretched under the winch and abutting against the mast as by this means he was enabled to exert his greatest strength  the signal being given in the hold that the tackle was hooked to the stone and all ready every man took his post the stone was carefully we might almost say tenderly raised and gradually got into position over the praam boat the right moment was intently watched and the word lower given sternly and sharply  the order was obeyed with exact promptitude and the stone rested on the deck of the praam boat  six blocks of granite having been thus placed on the boats deck she was rowed to a buoy and moored near the rock until the proper time of the tide for taking her into one of the landing creeks  we are thus particular in describing the details of this part of the work in order that the reader may be enabled to form a correct estimate of what may be termed the minor difficulties of the undertaking  the same care was bestowed upon the landing of every stone of the building and it is worthy of record that notwithstanding the difficulty of this process in such peculiar circumstances not a single stone was lost or even seriously damaged during the whole course of the erection of the tower which occupied four years in building or rather we should say four seasons for no work was or could be done during winter  a description of the first entire course of the lower part of the tower which was built solid will be sufficient to give an idea of the general nature of the whole work  this course or layer consisted of 123 blocks of stone those in the interior being sandstone while the outer casing was of granite  each stone was fastened to its neighbour above below and around by means of dovetails joggles oaken trenails and mortar  each course was thus built from its centre to its circumference and as all the courses from the foundation to a height of thirty feet were built in this way the tower up to that height became a mass of solid stone as strong and immovable as the bell rock itself  above this or thirty feet from the foundation the entrancedoor was placed and the hollow part of the tower began  thus much then as to the tower itself the upper part of which will be found described in a future chapter  in regard to the subsidiary works the erection of the beacon house was in itself a work of considerable difficulty requiring no common effort of engineering skill  the principal beams of this having been towed to the rock by the smeaton all the stanchions and other material for setting them up were landed and the workmen set about erecting them as quickly as possible for if a single day of bad weather should occur before the necessary fixtures could be made the whole apparatus would be infallibly swept away  the operation being perhaps the most important of the season and one requiring to be done with the utmost expedition all hands were on the day in which its erection was begun gathered on the rock besides ten additional men engaged for the purpose and as many of the seamen from the pharos and other vessels as could be spared  they amounted altogether to fiftytwo in number  about halfpast eight oclock in the morning a derrick or mast thirty feet high was erected and properly supported with guyropes for suspending the block for raising the first principal beam of the beacon and a winchmachine was bolted down to the rock for working the purchasetackle  the necessary blocks and tackle were likewise laid to hand and properly arranged  the men were severally allotted in squads to different stations some were to bring the principal beams to hand others were to work the tackles while a third set had the charge of the iron stanchions bolts and wedges so that the whole operation of raising the beams and fixing them to the rock might go forward in such a mariner that some provision might be made in any stage of the work for securing what had been accomplished in case of an adverse change of weather  the raising of the derrick was the signal for three hearty cheers for this was a new era in the operations  even that single spar could it be preserved would have been sufficient to have saved the workmen on that day when the smeaton broke adrift and left them in such peril  this was all however that could be accomplished that tide  next day the great beams each fifty feet long and about sixteen inches square were towed to the rock about seven in the morning and the work immediately commenced although they had gone there so much too early in the tide that the men had to work a considerable time up to their middle in water  each beam was raised by the tackle affixed to the derrick until the end of it could be placed or stepped into the hole which had been previously prepared for its reception then two of the great iron stanchions or supports were set into their respective holes on each side of the beam and a rope passed round them to keep it from slipping until it could be more permanently fixed  this having been accomplished the first beam became the means of raising the second and when the first and second were fastened at the top they formed a pair of shears by which the rest were more easily raised to their places  the heads of the beams were then fitted together and secured with ropes in a temporary manner until the falling of the tide would permit the operations to be resumed  thus the work went on each man labouring with all his might until this important erection was completed  the raising of the first beams took place on a sunday  indeed during the progress of the works at the bell rock the men were accustomed to work regularly on sundays when possible but it is right to say that it was not done in defiance of or disregard to gods command to cease from labour on the sabbath day but because of the urgent need of a lighthouse on a rock which unlighted would be certain to wreck numerous vessels and destroy many lives in time to come as it had done in time past  delay in this matter might cause death and disaster therefore it was deemed right to carry on the work on sundays  see note 1  an accident happened during the raising of the last large beam of the beacon which although alarming fortunately caused no damage considering the nature of the work it is amazing and greatly to the credit of all engaged that so few accidents occurred during the building of the lighthouse  when they were in the act of hoisting the sixth and last log and just about to cant it into its place the iron hook of the principal purchaseblock gave way and the great beam measuring fifty feet in length fell upon the rock with a terrible crash but although there were fiftytwo men around the beacon at the time not one was touched and the beam itself received no damage worth mentioning  soon after the beacon had been set up and partially secured to the rock a severe gale sprang up as if ocean were impatient to test the handiwork of human engineers  gales set in from the eastward compelling the attending sloops to slip from their moorings and run for the shelter of arbroath and saint andrews and raising a sea on the bell rock which was described as terrific the spray rising more than thirty feet in the air above it  in the midst of all this turmoil the beacon stood securely and after the weather moderated permitting the workmen once more to land it was found that no damage had been done by the tremendous breaches of the sea over the rock  that the power of the waves had indeed been very great was evident from the effects observed on the rock itself and on materials left there masses of rock upwards of a ton in weight had been cast up by the sea and then in their passage over the bell rock had made deep and indelible ruts  an anchor of a ton weight which had been lost on one side of the rock was found to have been washed up and over it to the other side  several large blocks of granite that had been landed and left on a ledge were found to have been swept away like pebbles and hurled into a hole at some distance and the heavy hearth of the smiths forge with the ponderous anvil had been washed from their places of supposed security  from the time of the setting up of the beacon a new era in the work began  some of the men were now enabled to remain on the rock all day working at the lighthouse when the tide was low and betaking themselves to the beacon when it rose and leaving it at night for there was much to do before this beacon could be made the habitable abode which it finally became but it required the strictest attention to the state of the weather in case of their being overtaken with a gale which might prevent the possibility of their being taken off the rock  at last the beacon was so far advanced and secured that it was deemed capable of withstanding any gale that might blow  as yet it was a great ungainly pile of logs iron stanchions and bracingchains without anything that could afford shelter to man from winds or waves but with a platform laid from its crossbeams at a considerable height above highwater mark  the works on the rock were in this state when two memorable circumstances occurred in the bell rock annals to which we shall devote a separate chapter    note 1  it was always arranged however to have public worship on sundays when practicable  and this arrangement was held to during the continuance of the work  indeed the manner in which mr stevenson writes in regard to the conclusion of the days work at the beacon which we have described shows clearly that he felt himself to be acting in this matter in accordance with the spirit of our saviour who wrought many of his works of mercy on the sabbath day  mr stevenson writes thus    all hands having returned to their respective ships they got a shift   of dry clothes and some refreshment  being sunday they were   afterwards convened by signal on board of the lighthouse yacht when   prayers were read for every heart upon this occasion felt gladness   and every mind was disposed to be thankful for the happy and   successful termination of the operations of this day  it is right to add that the men although requested were not constrained to work on sundays  they were at liberty to decline if they chose  a few conscientiously refused at first but were afterwards convinced of the necessity of working on all opportunities that offered and agreed to do so    chapter fifteen  ruby has a rise in life and a fall  james dove the blacksmith had for some time past been watching the advancing of the beaconworks with some interest and a good deal of impatience  he was tired of working so constantly up to the knees in water and aspired to a drier and more elevated workshop  one morning he was told by the foreman that orders had been given for him to remove his forge to the beacon and this removal this flitting as he called it was the first of the memorable events referred to in the last chapter  hallo  ruby my boy cried the elated son of vulcan as he descended the companion ladder were goin to flit lad  were about to rise in the world so get up your bellows  its the last time we shall have to be bothered with them in the boat i hope  thats well said ruby shouldering the unwieldy bellows they have worn my shoulders threadbare and tried my patience almost beyond endurance  well its all over now lad rejoined the smith  in future you shall have to blow up in the beacon yonder so come along  come ruby that ought to comfort the cockles o yer heart said oconnor who passed up the ladder as he spoke the smith wont need to blow you up any more av youre to blow yourself up in the beacon in futur  arrah theres the bell again  sorrow wan o me iver gits to slape but im turned up immadiately to go an poke away at that rock faix its well named the bell rock for it makes me like to bellow me lungs out wid vexation  that pun is below contempt said joe dumsby who came up at the moment  thats yer sort laddies yere guid at ringing the changes on that head onyway cried watt  i say were gittin a bellyfull of it observed forsyth with a rueful look  i hope nobodys goin to give us another  itll create a rebellion said bremner if ye go on like that  itll bring my bellows down on the head o the next man that speaks cried ruby with indignation  dont you hear the bell there cried the foreman down the hatchway  there was a burst of laughter at this unconscious continuation of the joke and the men sprang up the ladderdown the side and into the boats which were soon racing towards the rock  the day though not sunny was calm and agreeable nevertheless the landing at the rock was not easily accomplished owing to the swell caused by a recent gale  after one or two narrow escapes of a ducking however the crews landed and the bellows instead of being conveyed to their usual place at the forge were laid at the foot of the beacon  the carriage of these bellows to and fro almost daily had been a subject of great annoyance to the men owing to their being so much in the way and so unmanageably bulky yet so essential to the progress of the works that they did not dare to leave them on the rock lest they should be washed away and they had to handle them tenderly lest they should get damaged  now boys lend a hand with the forge cried the smith hurrying towards his anvil  those who were not busy eating dulse responded to the call and in a short time the ponderous materiel of the smithy was conveyed to the beacon where in process of time it was hoisted by means of tackle to its place on the platform to which reference has already been made  when it was safely set up and the bellows placed in position ruby went to the edge of the platform and looking down on his comrades below took off his cap and shouted in the tone of a stentor now lads three cheers for the dovecot  this was received with a roar of laughter and three tremendous cheers  howld on boys cried oconnor stretching out his hand as if to command silence youll scare the dove from his cot altogether av ye roar like that  surely theyre sendin us a fire to warm us observed one of the men pointing to a boat which had put off from the smeaton and was approaching the rock by way of macurichs track  what cand be i wonder said watt i think i can smell somethin  i halways thought you ad somethink of an old dog in you said dumsby  ay man said the scot with a leer i ken o war beasts than auld dowgs  do you come lets ear wat they are said the englishman  young puppies answered the other  hurrah dinner as im a dutchman cried forsyth  this was indeed the case  dinner had been cooked on board the smeaton and sent hot to the men and thisthe first dinner ever eaten on the bell rockwas the second of the memorable events before referred to  the boat soon ran into the creek and landed the baskets containing the food on hopes wharf  the men at once made a rush at the viands and bore them off exultingly to the flattest part of the rock they could find  a regular picnic cried dumsby in high glee for unusual events of even a trifling kind had the effect of elating those men more than one might have expected  heres the murphies cried oconnor staggering over the slippery weed with a large smoking tin dish  mind you dont let em fall cried one  have a care shouted the smith if you drop them ill beat you redhot and hammer ye so flat that the biggest flatterer as ever walked wont be able to spread ye out another halfinch  mutton oh exclaimed forsyth who had been some time trying to wrench the cover off the basket containing a roast leg and at last succeeded  here spread them all out on this rock  you hant forgot the grog i hope steward  no fear of him hes a good feller is the steward when hes asleep partiklerly  the grogs here all right  dinna let dumsby git haud ot then cried watt  what hae ye begood aready  patience man patience  is there ony saut  lots of it darlin in the say  sure this shape must have lost his tail somehow  och murther if there isnt bobby selkirk gone an tumbled into port hamilton wid the cabbage av its not the carrots  there now dont talk so much boys cried peter logan  lets drink success to the bell rock lighthouse  it need scarcely be said that this toast was drunk with enthusiasm and that it was followed up with three times three  now for a song  come joe dumsby strike up cried one of the men  oconnor who was one of the most reckless of men in regard to duty and propriety here shook his head gravely and took upon himself to read his comrade a lesson  ye shouldnt talk o sitch things in workin hours said he  av we wos all foolish waakehidded cratures like you how dye think wed iver git the lighthouse sot up  ate yer dinner lad and howld yer tongue  o ned i didnt think your jealousy would show out so strong retorted his comrade  now then dumsby fire away if it was only to aggravate him  thus pressed joe dumsby took a deep draught of the smallbeer with which the men were supplied and began a song of his own composition  when the song was finished the meal was also concluded and the men returned to their labours on the rock some to continue their work with the picks at the hard stone of the foundationpit others to perform miscellaneous jobs about the rock such as mixing the mortar and removing debris while james dove and his fast friend ruby brand mounted to their airy cot on the beacon from which in a short time began to proceed the volumes of smoke and the clanging sounds that had formerly arisen from smiths ledge  while they were all thus busily engaged ruby observed a boat advancing towards the rock from the floating light  he was blowing the bellows at the time after a spell at the forehammer  we seem to be favoured with unusual events today jamie said he wiping his forehead with the corner of his apron with one hand while he worked the handle of the bellows with the other yonder comes another boat what can it be think you  surely it cant be tea said the smith with a smile as he turned the end of a pickaxe in the fire its too soon after dinner for that  it looks like the boat of our friends the fishermen big swankie and davy spink said ruby shading his eyes with his hand and gazing earnestly at the boat as it advanced towards them  friends repeated the smith rascally smugglers both of them theyre no friends of mine  well i didnt mean bosom friends replied ruby but after all davy spink is not such a bad fellow though i cant say that im fond of his comrade  the two men resumed their hammers at this point in the conversation and became silent as long as the anvil sounded  the boat had reached the rock when they ceased and its occupants were seen to be in earnest conversation with peter logan  there were only two men in the boat besides its owners swankie and spink  what can they want said dove looking down on them as he turned to thrust the iron on which he was engaged into the fire  as he spoke the foreman looked up  ho  ruby brand he shouted come down here youre wanted  hallo  ruby exclaimed the smith more friends o yours  your acquaintance is extensive lad but theres no girl in the case this time  ruby made no reply for an indefinable feeling of anxiety filled his breast as he threw down the forehammer and prepared to descend  on reaching the rock he advanced towards the strangers both of whom were stout thickset men with grave stern countenances  one of them stepped forward and said your name is  ruby brand said the youth promptly at the same time somewhat proudly for he knew that he was in the hands of the philistines  the man who first spoke hereupon drew a small instrument from his pocket and tapping ruby on the shoulder said  i arrest you ruby brand in the name of the king  the other man immediately stepped forward and produced a pair of handcuffs  at sight of these ruby sprang backward and the blood rushed violently to his forehead while his blue eyes glared with the ferocity of those of a tiger  come lad its of no use you know said the man pausing if you wont come quietly we must find ways and means to compel you  compel me cried ruby drawing himself up with a look of defiance and a laugh of contempt that caused the two men to shrink back in spite of themselves  ruby said the foreman gently stepping forward and laying his hand on the youths shoulder you had better go quietly for theres no chance of escape from these fellows  i have no doubt its a mistake and that youll come off with flyin colours but its best to go quietly whatever turns up  while logan was speaking ruby dropped his head on his breast the officer with the handcuffs advanced and the youth held out his hands while the flush of anger deepened into the crimson blush of shame  it was at this point that jamie dove wondering at the prolonged absence of his friend and assistant looked down from the platform of the beacon and beheld what was taking place  the stentorian roar of amazement and rage that suddenly burst from him attracted the attention of all the men on the rock who dropped their tools and looked up in consternation expecting no doubt to behold something terrible  their eyes at once followed those of the smith and no sooner did they see ruby being led in irons to the boat which lay in port hamilton close to sir ralph the rovers ledge than they uttered a yell of execration and rushed with one accord to the rescue  the officers who were just about to make their prisoner step into the boat turned to face the foeone who seemed to be the more courageous of the two a little in advance of the other  ned oconnor with that enthusiasm which seems to be inherent in irish blood rushed with such irresistible force against this man that he drove him violently back against his comrade and sent them both head over heels into port hamilton  nay with such momentum was this act performed that ned could not help but follow them falling on them both as they came to the surface and sinking them a second time amid screams and yells of laughter  oconnor was at once pulled out by his friends  the officers also were quickly landed  i ax yer parding gintlemen said the former with an expression of deep regret on his face but the sayweed is so slippy on them rocks were almost for iver doin that sort o thing be the merest accident but av yer as fond o cowld wather as meself ye wont objec to it although it do come raither onexpected  the officers made no reply but collaring ruby pushed him into the boat  again the men made a rush but peter logan stood between them and the boat  lads said he holding up his hand its of no use resistin the law these are kings officers and they are only doin their duty  sure am i that ruby brand is guilty of no crime so theyve only to enquire into it and set him free  the men hesitated but did not seem quite disposed to submit without another struggle  its a shame to let them take him cried the smith  so it is  i vote for a rescue cried joe dumsby  hooray so does i cried oconnor stripping off his waistcoat and for once in his life agreeing with joe  na na lads cried john watt rolling up his sleeves and baring his brawny arms as if about to engage in a fight itll niver do to interfere wi the law but what dye say to gie them anither dook  seeing that the men were about to act upon watts suggestion ruby started up in the boat and turning to his comrade said  boys its very kind of you to be so anxious to save me but you cant  faix but we can darlin interrupted oconnor  no you cant repeated ruby firmly because i wont let you  i dont think i need say to you that i am innocent he added with a look in which truth evidently shone forth like a sunbeam but now that they have put these irons on me i will not consent that they shall be taken off except by the law which put them on  while he was speaking the boat had been pushed off and in a few seconds it was beyond the reach of the men  depend upon it comrades cried ruby as they pulled away that i shall be back again to help you to finish the work on the bell rock  so you will lad so you will cried the foreman  my blessin on ye shouted oconnor  ach ye dirty villains ye lowminded spalpeens he added shaking his fist at the officers of justice  dont be long away ruby cried one  never say die shouted another earnestly  three cheers for ruby brand exclaimed forsyth hip hip hip  the cheer was given with the most vociferous energy and then the men stood in melancholy silence on ralph the rovers ledge watching the boat that bore their comrade to the shore    chapter sixteen  new arrangementsthe captains philosophy in regard to pipeology  that night our hero was lodged in the common jail of arbroath  soon after he was tried and as captain ogilvy had prophesied was acquitted  thereafter he went to reside for the winter with his mother occupying the same room as his worthy uncle as there was not another spare one in the cottage and sleeping in a hammock slung parallel with and close to that of the captain  on the night following his release from prison ruby lay on his back in his hammock meditating intently on the future and gazing at the ceiling or rather at the place where he knew the ceiling to be for it was a dark night and there was no light in the room the candle having just been extinguished  we are not strictly correct however in saying that there was no light in the room for there was a deep red glowing spot of fire near to captain ogilvys head which flashed and grew dim at each alternate second of time  it was in fact the captains pipe a luxury in which that worthy man indulged morning noon and night  he usually rested the bowl of the pipe on and a little over the edge of his hammock and lying on his back passed the mouthpiece over the blankets into the corner of his mouth where four of his teeth seemed to have agreed to form an exactly round hole suited to receive it  at each draw the fire in the bowl glowed so that the captains nose was faintly illuminated in the intervals the nose disappeared  the breaking or letting fall of this pipe was a common incident in the captains nocturnal history but he had got used to it from long habit and regarded the event each time it occurred with the philosophic composure of one who sees and makes up his mind to endure an inevitable and unavoidable evil  ruby said the captain after the candle was extinguished  well uncle  ive bin thinkin lad  here the captain drew a few whiffs to prevent the pipe from going out in which operation he evidently forgot himself and went on thinking for he said nothing more  well uncle what have you been thinking  eh ah yes ive bin thinkin lad pull that youll have to pufftheres somethin wrong with the pipe tonight it dont draw well puffyoull have to do somethin or other in the town for it wont do to leave the old woman lad in her delicate state o health had she turned in when you left the kitchen  oh yes an hour or more  an blue eyes    the tender bit flower that waves in the breeze   and scatters its fragrance all over the seas  has she turned in too  she was just going to when i left replied ruby but what has that to do with the question  i didnt say as it had anything to do with it lad  moreover there aint no question between us as i knows on puff but what have you to say to stoppin here all winter  impossible said ruby with a sigh  no so lad whats to hinderah there she goes  the pipe fell with a crash to the floor and burst with a bright shower of sparks like a little bombshell  thats the third ruby since i turned in said the captain getting slowly over the side of his hammock and alighting on the floor heavily i wont git up again if it goes another time  after knocking off the chimneypiece five or six articles which appeared to be made of tin from the noise they made in falling the captain succeeded in getting hold of another pipe and the tinderbox for in those days flint and steel were the implements generally used in procuring a light  with much trouble he relit the pipe  now ruby lad hold it till i tumble in  but i cant see the stem uncle  what a speech for a seaman to make  dont you see the fire in the bowl  yes of course  well just make a grab two inches astarn of the bowl and youll hook the stem  the captain was looking earnestly into the bowl while he spoke stuffing down the burning tobacco with the end of his little finger  ruby acting in rather too prompt obedience to the instructions made a grab as directed and caught his uncle by the nose  a yell and an apology followed of course in the midst of which the fourth pipe was demolished  oh uncle what a pity  ah  ruby that comes o inconsiderate youth which philosophers tell us is the natral consequence of unavoidable necessity for you cant put a young head on old shoulders dye see  from the tone in which this was said ruby knew that the captain was shaking his head gravely and from the noise of articles being kicked about and falling he became aware that the unconquerable man was filling a fifth pipe  this one was more successfully managed and the captain once more got into his hammock and began to enjoy himself  well ruby where was i  o ay whats to hinder you goin and gettin employed in the bell rock workyard  theres plenty to do and good wages there  it may be as well to inform the reader here that although the operations at the bell rock had come to an end for the season about the beginning of october the work of hewing the stones for the lighthouse was carried on briskly during the winter at the workyard on shore and as the tools etcetera required constant sharpening and mending a blacksmith could not be dispensed with  do you think i can get in again enquired ruby  no doubt of it lad  but the question is are ye willin to go if theyll take you  quite willing uncle  good then thats all square an i knows how to lay my courseup anchor tomorrow mornin crowd all sail bear down on the workyard bringto off the countinroom and open fire on the superintendent  the captain paused at this point and opened fire with his pipe for some minutes  now he continued theres another thing i want to ax you  im goin tomorrow afternoon to take a cruise along the cliffs to the eastard in the preventive boat just to keep up my sea legs  theyve got scent o some smugglin business thats goin on an my friend leftenant lindsay has asked me to go  now ruby if you want a short cruise of an hour or so you may come with me  ruby smiled at the manner in which this offer was made and replied  with pleasure uncle  so then thats settled too  good night nephy  the captain turned on his side and dropped the pipe on the floor where it was shivered to atoms  it must not be supposed that this was accidental  it was done on purpose  captain ogilvy had found from experience that it was not possible to stretch out his arm to its full extent and lay the pipe on the chimneypiece without waking himself up just at that critical moment when sleep was consenting to be wooed  he also found that on the average he broke one in every four pipes that he thus attempted to deposit  being a philosophical and practical man he came to the conclusion that it would be worth while to pay something for the comfort of being undisturbed at the minute of time that lay between the conclusion of smoking and the commencement of repose  he therefore got a sheet of foolscap and a pencil and spent a whole forenoon in abstruse calculations  he ascertained the exact value of three hundred and sixtyfive clay pipes  from this he deducted a fourth for breakage that would have certainly occurred in the old system of laying the pipes down every night and which therefore he felt in a confused sort of way ought not to be charged in the estimates of a new system  then he added a small sum to the result for probable extra breakages such as had occurred that night and found that the total was not too high a price for a man in his circumstances to pay for the blessing he wished to obtain  from that night forward he deliberately dropped his pipe every night over the side of his hammock before going to sleep  the captain in commenting on this subject was wont to observe that everything in life no matter how small afforded matter of thought to philosophical men  he had himself found a pleasing subject of study each morning in the fact that some of the pipes survived the fall of the previous night  this led him to consider the nature of clay pipes in general and to test them in various ways  it is true he did not say that anything of importance resulted from his peculiar studies but he argued that a true philosopher looks for facts and leaves results alone  one discovery he undoubtedly did make which was that the pipes obtained from a certain maker in the town invariably broke while those obtained from another maker broke only occasionally  hence he came to the conclusion that one maker was an honest man the other a doubtful character and wisely bestowed his custom in accordance with that opinion  about one minute after the falling of the pipe ruby brand fell asleep and about two minutes after that captain ogilvy began to snore both of which conditions were maintained respectively and uninterruptedly until the birds began to whistle and the sun began to shine    chapter seventeen  a meeting with old friends and an excursion  next morning the captain and his nephew bore down as the former expressed it on the workyard and ruby was readily accepted his good qualities having already been well tested at the bell rock  now boy well go and see about the little preventive craft said the captain on quitting the office  but first said ruby let me go and tell my old comrade dove that i am to be with him again  there was no need to enquire the way to the forge the sound of the anvil being distinctly heard above all the other sounds of that busy spot  the workyard at arbroath where the stones for the lighthouse were collected and hewn into shape before being sent off to the rock was an enclosed piece of ground extending to about threequarters of an acre conveniently situated on the northern side of the lady lane or street leading from the western side of the harbour  here were built a row of barracks for the workmen and several apartments connected with the engineers office mouldmakers department stores workshops for smiths and joiners stables etcetera extending 150 feet along the north side of the yard  all of these were fully occupied there being upwards of forty men employed permanently  sheds of timber were also constructed to protect the workmen in wet weather and a kiln was built for burning lime  in the centre of the yard stood a circular platform of masonry on which the stones were placed when dressed so that each stone was tested and marked and each course or layer of the lighthouse fitted up and tried before being shipped to the rock  the platform measured 44 feet in diameter  it was founded with large broad stones at a depth of about 2 feet 6 inches and built to within 10 inches of the surface with rubble work on which a course of neatly dressed and welljointed masonry was laid of the red sandstone from the quarries to the eastward of arbroath which brought the platform on a level with the surface of the ground  here the dressed part of the first entire course or layer of the lighthouse was lying and the platform was so substantially built as to be capable of supporting any number of courses which it might be found convenient to lay upon it in the further progress of the work  passing this platform the captain and ruby threaded their way through a mass of workyard debris until they came to the building from which the sounds of the anvil proceeded  for a few minutes they stood looking at our old friend jamie dove who with bared arms was causing the sparks to fly and the glowing metal to yield as vigorously as of old presently he ceased hammering and turning to the fire thrust the metal into it  then he wiped his brow and glanced towards the door  what eh  ruby brand he shouted in surprise  och or his ghost cried ned oconnor who had been appointed to rubys vacant situation  a pretty solid ghost youll find me said ruby with a laugh as he stepped forward and seized the smith by the hand  musha but its thrue cried oconnor quitting the bellows and seizing rubys disengaged hand which he shook almost as vehemently as the smith did the other  now then dont dislocate him altogether cried the captain who was much delighted with this warm reception hes goin to jine you boys so have mercy on his old timbers  jine us cried the smith  ay been appointed to the old berth said ruby so ill have to unship you ned  the sooner the better faix i niver had much notion o this fiery style o life its only fit for sallymanders and bottleimps  but when dye begin work lad  tomorrow i believe  at least i was told to call at the office tomorrow  today i have an engagement  ay an its time we was under weigh said captain ogilvy taking his nephew by the arm  come along lad an dont keep them waiting  so saying they bade the smith goodbye and leaving the forge walked smartly towards that part of the harbour where the boats lay  ruby said the captain as they went along its lucky its such a fine day for minnie is going with us  ruby said nothing but the deep flush of pleasure that overspread his countenance proved that he was not indifferent to the news  you see shes bin out of sorts continued the captain for some time back and no wonder poor thing seein that your mother has been so anxious about you and required more than usual care so ive prevailed on the leftenant to let her go  shell get good by our afternoons sail and we wont be the worse of her company  what say ye to that nephy  ruby said that he was glad to hear it but he thought a great deal more than he said and among other things he thought that the lieutenant might perhaps be rather in the way but as his presence was unavoidable he made up his mind to try to believe that he the lieutenant would in all probability be an engaged man already  as to the possibility of his seeing minnie and being indifferent to her in the event of his being a free man he felt that such an idea was preposterous  suddenly a thought flashed across him and induced a question  is the lieutenant married uncle  not as i know of lad why dye ask  becausebecausemarried men are so much pleasanter than  ruby stopped short for he just then remembered that his uncle was a bachelor  pon my word youngster go on why dye stop in your purlite remark  because said ruby laughing i meant to say that young married men were so much more agreeable than young bachelors  humph ejaculated the captain who did not see much force in the observation and how dye know the leftenants a young man  i didnt say he was young mayhap hes old  but here he is so youll judge for yourself  at the moment a tall deeplybronzed man of about thirty years of age walked up and greeted captain ogilvy familiarly as his buck enquiring at the same time how his old timbers were and where the bit of baggage was  shes to be at the end o the pier in five minutes said the captain drawing out and consulting a watch that was large enough to have been mistaken for a small eightday clock  this is my nephy ruby  ruby brandleftenant lindsay  true blues both of ye    when shall we three meet again   where the stormy winds do blow do blow do blow   and the thunder lightenin and the rain   riots up above and also down below below below  ah here comes the pretty little craft  minnie appeared as he spoke and walked towards them with a modest yet decided air that was positively bewitching  she was dressed in homely garments but that served to enhance the beauty of her figure and she had on the plainest of little bonnets but that only tended to make her face more lovely  ruby thought it was perfection  he glanced at lieutenant lindsay and perceiving that he thought so too as how could he think otherwise a pang of jealousy shot into his breast  but it passed away when the lieutenant after politely assisting minnie into the boat sat down beside the captain and began to talk earnestly to him leaving minnie entirely to her lover we may remark here that the title of leftenant bestowed on lindsay by the captain was entirely complimentary  the crew of the boat rowed out of the harbour and the lieutenant steered eastward towards the cliffs that have been mentioned in an earlier part of our tale  the day turned out to be one of those magnificent and exceptional days which appear to have been cut out of summer and interpolated into autumn  it was bright warm and calm so calm that the boats sail was useless and the crew had to row but this was in minnies estimation no disadvantage for it gave her time to see the caves and picturesque inlets which abound all along that rocky coast  it also gave her time tobut no matter  o how very much i should like to have a little boat said minnie with enthusiasm and spend a long day rowing in and out among these wild rocks and exploring the caves  wouldnt it be delightful ruby  ruby admitted that it would and added you shall have such a day minnie if we live long  have you ever been in the forbidden cave enquired minnie  ill warrant you he has cried the captain who overheard the question you may be sure that wherever ruby is forbidden to go there hell be sure to go  ay is he so selfwilled asked the lieutenant with a smile and a glance at minnie  a mule a positive mule said the captain  come uncle you know that i dont deserve such a character and its too bad to give it to me today  did i not agree to come on this excursion at once when you asked me  ay but you wouldnt if i had ordered you returned the captain  i rather think he would observed the lieutenant with another smile and another glance at minnie  both smiles and glances were observed and noticed by ruby whose heart felt another pang shoot through it but this like the former subsided when the lieutenant again addressed the captain and devoted himself to him so exclusively that ruby began to feel a touch of indignation at his want of appreciation of such a girl as minnie  hes a stupid ass thought ruby to himself and then turning to minnie directed her attention to a curious natural arch on the cliffs and sought to forget all the rest of the world  in this effort he was successful and had gradually worked himself into the firm belief that the world was paradise and that he and minnie were its sole occupantsa second edition as it were of adam and evewhen the lieutenant rudely dispelled the sweet dream by saying sharply to the man at the bowoar  is that the boat baker  you ought to know it pretty well  i think it is sir answered the man resting on his oar a moment and glancing over his shoulder but i cant be sure at this distance  well pull easy said the lieutenant you see it wont do to scare them captain ogilvy and theyll think were a pleasure party when they see a woman in the boat  ruby thought they would not be far wrong in supposing them a pleasure party  he objected mentally however to minnie being styled a womannot that he would have had her called a man but he thought that girl would have been more suitableangel perhaps the most appropriate term of all  come captain i think i will join you in a pipe said the lieutenant pulling out a tin case in which he kept the blackest of little cutty pipes  in days of old our ancestors loved to fightnow we degenerate souls love to smoke the pipe of peace  i did not know that your ancestors were enemies said minnie to the captain  enemies lass ay that they were  what have ye never heard tell o the great fight between the ogilvys and lindsays  never said minnie  then my girl your education has been neglected but ill do what i can to remedy that defect  here the captain rekindled his pipe which was in the habit of going out and requiring to be relighted and clearing his throat with the emphasis of one who is about to communicate something of importance held forth as follows    chapter eighteen  the battle of arbroath and other warlike matters  it was in the year 1445thats not far short o four hundred years agoah tempus fugit which is a latin quotation my girl from horace walpole i believe an signifies time and tide waits for no man thats what they calls a free translation you must know well it was in the winter o 1445 that a certain alexander ogilvy of inverquharity was chosen to act as chief justiciar in these partsi suppose that means a kind of upper bailiff a sort o bosns mate to compare great things with small  he was set up in place of one o the lindsay family who it seems was rather extravagant though whether his extravagance lay in wearin a beard for he was called earl beardie or in spendin too much cash i cant take upon me for to say  anyhow beardie refused to haul down his colours so the ogilvys mustered their men and friends and the lindsays did the same and they went at it hammer and tongs and fowt what ye may call the battle of arbroath for it was close to the old town where they fell to  it was a most bloody affair  the two families were connected with many o the richest and greatest people in the land and these went to lend a hand when they beat to quarters and there was no end o barbed horses as they call themwhich means critters with steel spikes in their noses im toldand lots of embroidered banners and flags though i never heard that anyone hoisted the union jack but however that may be they fowt like bluejackets for five hundred men were left dead on the field an among them a lot o the great folk  but im sorry to say that the ogilvys were licked though i say it that shouldnt continued the captain with a sigh as he relighted his pipe  howsever    never ventur never win   blaze away an dont give in  as milton remarks in his preface to the pilgrims progress  true captain said the lieutenant and you know that he who fights and runs away shall live to fight another day  leftenant said the captain gravely your quotation besides bein a kind o desecration is not applicable cause the ogilvys did not run away  they fowt on that occasion like born imps an they would ha certainly won the day if they hadnt been every man jack of em cut to pieces before the battle was finished  well said uncle exclaimed ruby with a laugh  no doubt the ogilvys would lick the lindsays now if they had a chance  i believe they would said the lieutenant for they have become a race of heroes since the great day of the battle of arbroath  no doubt miss gray continued the lieutenant turning to minnie with an arch smile no doubt you have heard of that more recent event the threatened attack on arbroath by the french fireeater captain fall and the heroic part played on that occasion by an ogilvyan uncle i am told of my good friend here  i have heard of captain fall of course replied minnie for it was not many years before i was born that his visit took place and mrs brand has often told me of the consternation into which the town was thrown by his doings but i never heard of the deeds of the ogilvy to whom you refer  no  now that is surprising  how comes it captain that you have kept so silent on this subject  cause it aint true replied the captain stoutly yet with a peculiar curl about the corners of his mouth that implied something in the mind beyond what he expressed with the lips  ah  i seemodesty said lindsay  your uncle is innately modest miss gray and never speaks of anything that bears the slightest resemblance to boasting  see the grave solemnity with which he smokes while i say this proves the truth of my assertion  well since he has never told you i will tell yell myself  you have no objection captain  the captain sent a volume of smoke from his lips and followed it up withfire away shipmet  the lieutenant having drawn a few whiffs in order to ensure the continued combustion of his pipe related the following anecdote which is now matter of history as anyone may find by consulting the archives of arbroath  in the year 1781 on a fine evening of the month of may the seamen of arbroath who chanced to be loitering about the harbour observed a strange vessel manoeuvring in the offing  they watched and commented on the motions of the stranger with considerable interest for the wary skill displayed by her commander proved that he was unacquainted with the navigation of the coast and from the cut of her jib they knew that the craft was a foreigner  after a time she took up a position and cast anchor in the bay directly opposite the town  at that time we were as we still are and as it really appears likely to me we ever shall be at war with france but as the scene of the war was far removed from arbroath it never occurred to the good people that the smell of powder could reach their peaceful town  that idea was somewhat rudely forced upon them when the french flag was run up to the mizzentop and a white puff of smoke burst from the vessel which was followed by a shot that went hissing over their heads and plumped right into the middle of the town  that shot knocked over fifteen chimneypots and two weathercocks in marketgate went slap through a house in the suburbs and finally stuck in the carcass of an old horse belonging to the provost of the town which didnt survive the shockthe horse i mean not the provost  it is said that there was an old gentleman lying in bed in a room of the house that the shot went through  he was a sort of hipped character and believed that he could not walk if he were to try ever so much  he was looking quietly at the face of a great dutch clock when the shot entered and knocked the clock inside out sending its contents in a shower over the old gentleman who jumped up and rushed out of the house like a maniac  he was cured completely from that hour  at least so its said but i dont vouch for the truth of the story  however certain it is that the shot was fired and was followed up by two or three more after which the frenchman ceased firing and a boat was seen to quit the side of the craft bearing a flag of truce  the consternation into which the town was thrown is said to have been tremendous  thats false interrupted the captain removing his pipe while he spoke  the word aint appropriate  the men of arbroath doesnt know nothin about no such word as consternation  they was surprised if ye choose an powerfully enraged mayhap but they wasnt consternated by no means  well i dont insist on the point said the lieutenant but chroniclers write so  chroniclers write lies sometimes interrupted the captain curtly  perhaps they do but you will admit i dare say that the women and children were thrown into a great state of alarm  im not so sure of that interposed ruby  in a town where the men were so bold the women and children would be apt to feel very much at their ease  at all events i am acquainted with some women who are not easily frightened  really i think it is not fair to interrupt the story in this way said minnie with a laugh  right lass right said the captain  come leftenant spin away at yer yarn and dont ventur too much commentary thereon cause its apt to lead to error an ye know as the poet says    errors in the heart breed errors in the brain   an these are apt to twist ye wrong again  im not xactly sure o the precise words in this case but thats the sentiment and everybody knows that sentiment is everything in poetry whether ye understand it or not  fire away leftenant an dont be longwinded if ye can help it  well to return to the point resumed lindsay  the town was certainly thrown into a tremendous state of some sort for the people had no arms of any kind wherewith to defend themselves  there were no regular soldiers no militia and no volunteers  everybody ran wildly about in every direction not knowing what to do  there was no leader and in short the town was very like a shoal of small fish in a pool when a boy wades in and makes a dash amongst them  at last a little order was restored by the provost who was a sensible old man and an old soldier to boot but too infirm to take as active a part in such an emergency as he would have done had he been a dozen years younger  he with several of the principal men of the town went down to the beach to receive the bearers of the flag of truce  the boat was manned by a crew of five or six seamen armed with cutlasses and arquebusses  as soon as its keel grated on the sand a smart little officer leaped ashore and presented to the provost a letter from captain fall which ran somewhat in this fashion  at sea may twentythird  gentlemeni send these two words to inform you that i will have you to bringto the french colour in less than a quarter of an hour or i set the town on fire directly  such is the order of my master the king of france i am sent by  send directly the mair and chiefs of the town to make some agreement with me or ill make my duty  it is the will of yoursg fall  to monsieur mair of the town called arbrought or in his absence to the chief man after him in scotland  on reading this the provost bowed respectfully to the officer and begged of him to wait a few minutes while he should consult with his chief men  this was agreed to and the provost said to his friends as he walked to a neighbouring house  ye see freens this whippersnapper o a tadeeater has gotten the whup hand o us but well be upsides wi him  the main thing is to get delay so cut away tam cargill and tak horse to montrose for the sodgers  spare na the spur lad an gar them to understan that the case is urgent  while tam cargill started away on his mission the provost whose chief aim was to gain time and cause delay penned an epistle to the frenchman in which he stated that he had neglected to name the terms on which he would consent to spare the town and that he would consider it extremely obliging if he would as speedily as possible return an answer stating them in order that they might be laid before the chief men of the place  when the provost who was a grave dignified old man with a strong dash of humour in him handed this note to the french officer he did so with a humble obeisance that appeared to afford much gratification to the little man  as the latter jumped into the boat and ordered the men to push off the provost turned slowly to his brother magistrates with a wink and a quiet smile that convulsed them with suppressed laughter and did more to encourage any of the wavering or timid inhabitants than if he had harangued them heroically for an hour  some time after the boat returned with a reply which ran thus  at sea eight oclock in the afternoon  gentlemeni received just now your answer by which you say i ask no terms  i thought it was useless since i asked you to come aboard for agreement  but here are my termsi will have 30000 pounds sterling at least and six of the chiefs men of the town for otage  be speedy or i shot your town away directly and i set fire to it  i am gentlemen your servantg fall  i sent some of my crew to you but if some harm happens to them youll be sure well hang up the mainyard all the prisoners we have aboard  to monsieurs the chiefs men of arbrought in scotland  im not quite certain continued the lieutenant what were the exact words of the provosts reply to this letter but they conveyed a distinct and contemptuous refusal to accede to any terms and i believe invited fall to come ashore where if he did not get precisely what he had asked he would be certain to receive a great deal more than he wanted  the enraged and disappointed frenchman at once began a heavy fire upon the town and continued it for a long time but fortunately it did little or no harm as the town lay in a somewhat low position and falls guns being too much elevated the shot passed over it  next day another letter was sent to the provost by some fishermen who were captured while fishing off the bell rock  this letter was as tremendous as the two former  i can give it to you word for word from memory  at sea may 24th  gentlemensee whether you will come to some terms with me or i come in presently with my cutter into the arbour and i will cast down the town all over  make haste because i have no time to spare  i give you a quarter of an hour to your decision and after ill make my duty  i think it would be better for you gentlemen to come some of you aboard presently to settle the affairs of your town  youll sure no to be hurt  i give you my parole of honour  i am your g fall  when the provost received this he looked round and said now gentlemen all well hae to fight  send me ogilvy  here i am provost cried a stout active young fellow something like what the captain must have been when he was young i should think  ahem coughed the captain  well continued lindsay the provost said now ogilvy youre a smart cheel an ken aboot war and strategy and the like i charge ye to organise the men o the toon without delay and tak what steps ye think adveesable  meanwhile ill away and ripe oot a the airms and guns i can find  haste ye lad an mak as muckle noise aboot it as ye can  trust me said ogilvy who appeared to have been one of those men who regard a fight as a piece of good fun  turning to the multitude who had heard the commission given and were ready for anything he shouted now boys ye heard the provost  i need not ask if you are all ready to fight  a deafening cheer interrupted the speaker who when it ceased proceeded  well then ive but one piece of advice to give ye obey orders at once  when i tell ye to halt stop dead like lampposts when i say charge go at them like wild cats and drive the frenchmen into the sea  hurrah yelled the crowd for they were wild with excitement and rage and only wanted a leader to organise them and make them formidable  when the cheer ceased ogilvy cried now then every man who knows how to beat a kettledrum and blow a trumpet come here  about twenty men answered to the summons and to these ogilvy said aloud in order that all might hear go get you all the trumpets drums horns bugles and trombones in the town beat the drums till they split and blow the bugles till they burst and dont give in till ye cant go on  the rest of you he added turning to the crowd go get arms guns swords pistols scythes pitchforks pokersany thing everythingand meet me at the head of marketgateaway  no king of necromancers ever dispersed his legions more rapidly than did ogilvy on that occasion  they gave one final cheer and scattered like chaff before the wind leaving their commander alone with a select few whom he kept by him as a sort of staff to consult with and despatch with orders  the noise that instantly ensued in the town was something pandemoniacal  only three drums were found but tin kettles and pans were not wanting and these superintended by hugh barr the town drummer did great execution  three keybugles an old french horn and a tin trumpet of a mailcoach guard were sounded at intervals in every quarter of the town while the men were marshalled and made to march hither and thither in detached bodies as if all were busily engaged in making preparations for a formidable defence  in one somewhat elevated position a number of men were set to work with spades picks and shovels to throw up an earthwork  when it had assumed sufficiently large dimensions to attract the attention of the french a body of men with blue jackets and caps with bits of red flannel hanging down the sides were marched up behind it at the double and posted there  meanwhile ogilvy had prepared a dummy field piece by dismounting a cart from its wheels and fixing on the axle a great old wooden pump not unlike a big gun in shape another cart was attached to this to represent a limber four horses were harnessed to the affair two men mounted these and amid a tremendous flourish of trumpets and beating of drums the artillery went crashing along the streets and up the eminence crowned by the earthwork where they wheeled the gun into position  the artillerymen sprang at the old pump like true britons and began to sponge it out as if they had been bred to gunnery from childhood while the limber was detached and galloped to the rear  in this operation the cart was smashed to pieces and the two hindmost horses were thrown but this mattered little as they had got round a corner and the french did not see it  fall and his brave men seem to have been upset altogether by these warlike demonstrations for the moment the big gun made its appearance the sails were shaken loose and the french privateer sheered off capturing as he left the bay however several small vessels which he carried off as prizes to france  and so concluded the lieutenant captain fall sailed away and never was heard of more  well told well told leftenant cried the captain whose eyes sparkled at the concluding account of the defensive operations and true every word of it  thats good testimony to my truthfulness then said lindsay laughing for you were there yourself  there yourself uncle repeated minnie with a glance of surprise that quickly changed into a look of intelligence as she exclaimed with a merry laugh ah  i see  it was you uncle who did it all who commanded on that occasion  my child said the captain resuming his pipe with an expression of mild reproof on his countenance dont go for to pry too deep into things o the past  i may have been a fireeater oncei may have been a gay young feller as could but no matter  avast musin  as lord bacon says    the light of other days is faded   an all their glorys past   my boots no longer look as they did   but like my coat are goin fast  but i say leftenant how long do you mean to keep pullin about here without an enemy or as far as i can see an object in view  dont you think we might land and let minnie see some of the caves  with all my heart captain and here is a convenient bay to run the boat ashore  as he spoke the boat shot past one of those bold promontories of red sandstone which project along that coast in wild picturesque forms terminating in some instances in detached headlands elsewhere in natural arches  the cliffs were so close to the boat that they could have been touched by the oars while the rocks rising to a considerable height almost overhung them  just beyond this a beautiful bay opened up to view with a narrow strip of yellow shingle round the base of the cliffs which here lost for a short distance their rugged character though not their height and were covered with herbage  a zigzag path led to the top and the whole neighbourhood was full of oceanworn coves and gullies some of them dry and many filled with water while others were filled at high tide and left empty when the tides fell  o how beautiful and what a place for smugglers was minnies enthusiastic exclamation on first catching sight of the bay  the smugglers and you would appear to be of one mind said ruby for they are particularly fond of this place  so fond of it said the lieutenant that i mean to wait for them here in anticipation of a moonlight visit this night if my fair passenger will consent to wander in such wild places at such late hours guarded from the night air by my boatcloak and assured of the protection of my stout boatmen in case of any danger although there is little prospect of our meeting with any greater danger than a breeze or a shower of rain  minnie said that she would like nothing better that she did not mind the night air and as to danger from men she felt that she should be well cared for in present circumstances  as she uttered the last words she naturally glanced at ruby for minnie was of a dependent and trusting nature but as ruby happened to be regarding her intently though quite accidentally at the moment she dropped her eyes and blushed  it is wonderful the power of a little glance at times  the glance referred to made ruby perfectly happy  it conveyed to him the assurance that minnie regarded the protection of the entire boats crew including the lieutenant as quite unnecessary and that she deemed his single arm all that she required or wanted  the sun was just dipping behind the tall cliffs and his parting rays were kissing the top of minnies head as if they positively could not help it and had recklessly made up their mind to do it come what might  ruby looked at the golden light kissing the golden hair and he felt  oh you know reader if you have ever been in similar circumstances you understand what he felt if you have not no words from me or from any other man can ever convey to you the most distant idea of what ruby felt on that occasion  on reaching the shore they all went up to the green banks at the foot of the cliffs and turned round to watch the men as they pulled the boat to a convenient point for reembarking at a moments notice  you see said the lieutenant pursuing a conversation which he had been holding with the captain i have been told that big swankie and his mate davy spink who it seems is not overfriendly with him just now mean to visit one of the luggers which is expected to come in tonight before the moon rises and bring off some kegs of auchmithie water which no doubt they will try to hide in dickmonts den  i shall lie snugly here on the watch and hope to nab them before they reach that celebrated old smugglers abode  well ill stay about here said the captain and show minnie the caves  i would like to have taken her to see the gaylet pot which is one o the queerest hereabouts but im too old for such rough work now  but i am not too old for it interposed ruby so if minnie would like to go  but i wont desert you uncle said minnie hastily  nay lass call it not desertion  i can smoke my pipe here an contemplate  im fond of contemplation    by the starry light of the summer night   on the banks of the blue moselle  though for the matter o that moonlightll do if theres no stars i think its good for the mind minnie and keeps all taut contemplation is just like takin an extra pull on the lee braces  so you may go with ruby lass  thus advised and being further urged by ruby himself and being moreover exceedingly anxious to see this cave minnie consented so the two set off together and climbing to the summit of the cliffs followed the narrow footpath that runs close to their giddy edge all along the coast  in less than half an hour they reached the giel or gaylet pot    chapter nineteen  an adventuresecrets revealed and a prize  the giel or gaylet pot down into which ruby with great care and circumspection led minnie is one of the most curious of natures freaks among the cliffs of arbroath  in some places there is a small scrap of pebbly beach at the base of those perpendicular cliffs in most places there is nonethe cliffs presenting to the sea almost a dead wall where neither ship nor boat could find refuge from the storm  the country inland however does not partake of the rugged nature of the cliffs  it slopes gradually towards themso gradually that it may be termed flat and if a stranger were to walk towards the sea over the fields in a dark night the first intimation he would receive of his dangerous position would be when his foot descended into the terrible abyss that would receive his shattered frame a hundred feet below  in one of the fields there is a hole about a hundred yards across and as deep as the cliffs in that part are high  it is about fifty or eighty yards from the edge of the cliffs and resembles an old quarry but it is cut so sharply out of the flat field that it shows no sign of its existence until the traveller is close upon it  the rocky sides too are so steep that at first sight it seems as if no man could descend into it  but the most peculiar point about this hole is that at the foot of it there is the opening of a cavern through which the sea rolls into the hole and breaks in wavelets on a miniature shore the sea has forced its way inland and underground until it has burst into the bottom of this hole which is not inaptly compared to a pot with water boiling at the bottom of it  when a spectator looks into the cave standing at the bottom of the pot he sees the seaward opening at the other enda bright spot of light in the dark interior  you wont get nervous minnie said ruby pausing when about halfway down the steep declivity where the track or rather the place of descent became still more steep and difficult a slip here would be dangerous  i have no fear ruby as long as you keep by me  in a few minutes they reached the bottom and looking up the sky appeared above them like a blue circular ceiling with the edges of the gaylet pot sharply defined against it  proceeding over a mass of fallen rock they reached the pebbly strand at the caves inner mouth  i can see the interior now as my eyes become accustomed to the dim light said minnie gazing up wistfully into the vaulted roof where the edges of projecting rocks seemed to peer out of darkness  surely this must be a place for smugglers to come to  they dont often come here  the place is not so suitable as many of the other caves are  from the low subdued tones in which they both spoke it was evident that the place inspired them with feelings of awe  come minnie said ruby at length in a more cheerful tone let us go into this cave and explore it  but the water may be deep objected minnie besides i do not like to wade even though it be shallow  nay sweet one do you think i would ask you to wet your pretty feet there is very little wading required  see i have only to raise you in my arms and take two steps into the water and a third step to the left round that projecting rock where i can set you down on another beach inside the cave  your eyes will soon get used to the subdued light and then you will see things much more clearly than you would think it possible viewed from this point  minnie did not require much pressing  she had perfect confidence in her lover and was naturally fearless in disposition so she was soon placed on the subterranean beach of the gaylet cave and for some time wandered about in the dimlylighted place leaning on rubys arm  gradually their eyes became accustomed to the place and then its mysterious beauty and wildness began to have full effect on their minds inducing them to remain for a long time silent as they sat side by side on a piece of fallen rock  they sat looking in the direction of the seaward entrance to the cavern where the light glowed brightly on the rocks gradually losing its brilliancy as it penetrated the cave until it became quite dim in the centre  no part of the main cave was quite dark but the offshoot in which the lovers sat was almost dark  to anyone viewing it from the outer cave it would have appeared completely so  is that a seagull at the outlet enquired minnie after a long pause  ruby looked intently for a moment in the direction indicated  minnie he said quickly and in a tone of surprise that is a large gull if it be one at all and uses oars instead of wings  who can it be  smugglers never come here that i am aware of and lindsay is not a likely man to waste his time in pulling about when he has other work to do  perhaps it may be some fishermen from auchmithie suggested minnie who are fond of exploring like you and me  mayhap it is but we shall soon see for here they come  we must keep out of sight my girl  ruby rose and led minnie into the recesses of the cavern where they were speedily shrouded in profound darkness and could not be seen by anyone although they themselves could observe all that occurred in the space in front of them  the boat which had entered the cavern by its seaward mouth was a small one manned by two fishermen who were silent as they rowed under the arched roof but it was evident that their silence did not proceed from caution for they made no effort to prevent or check the noise of the oars  in a few seconds the keel grated on the pebbles and one of the men leaped out  noo davy he said in a voice that sounded deep and hollow under that vaulted roof oot wi the kegs  haste ye man  tis big swankie whispered ruby  theres nae hurry objected the other fisherman who we need scarcely inform the reader was our friend davy spink  nae hurry repeated his comrade angrily  thats aye yer cry  half o oor ventures hae failed because ye object to hurry  hoot man thats enough ot said spink in the nettled tone of a man who has been a good deal worried  indeed the tones of both showed that these few sentences were but the continuation of a quarrel which had begun elsewhere  its plain to me that we must pairt freen said swankie in a dogged manner as he lifted a keg out of the boat and placed it on the ground  ay exclaimed spink with something of a sneer an dye think ill pairt without a diveesion o the siller teapots and things that ye daurna sell for fear o bein fund out  i wonder ye dinna claim half o the jewels and things as weel retorted swankie ye hae mair right to them seein ye had a hand in findin them  me a hand in findin them exclaimed spink with sudden indignation was it me that fand the deed body o the auld man on the bell rock na na freend  i hae naething to do wi deed mens jewels  have ye no retorted the other  its strange then that ye should entertain such sma objections to deed mens siller  weelaweel swankie the less we say on thae matters the better here tak haud o the tither keg  the conversation ceased at this stage abruptly  evidently each had touched on the others weak point so both tacitly agreed to drop the subject  presently big swankie took out a flint and steel and proceeded to strike a light  it was some some time before the tinder would catch at each stroke of the steel a shower of brilliant sparks lit up his countenance for an instant and this momentary glance showed that its expression was not prepossessing by any means  ruby drew minnie farther into the recess which concealed them and awaited the result with some anxiety for he felt that the amount of knowledge with which he had become possessed thus unintentionally small though it was was sufficient to justify the smugglers in regarding him as a dangerous enemy  he had scarcely drawn himself quite within the shadow of the recess when swankie succeeded in kindling a torch which filled the cavern with a lurid light and revealed its various forms rendering it if possible more mysterious and unearthly than ever  here spink cried swankie who was gradually getting into better humour haud the light and gie me the spade  ye better put them behind the rock far in suggested spink  the other seemed to entertain this idea for a moment for he raised the torch above his head and advancing into the cave carefully examined the rocks at the inner end  step by step he drew near to the place where ruby and minnie were concealed muttering to himself as he looked at each spot that might possibly suit his purpose na na the waves wad wash the kegs oot o that if it cam on to blaw  he made another step forward and the light fell almost on the head of ruby who felt minnies arm tremble  he clenched his hands with that feeling of resolve that comes over a man when he has made up his mind to fight  just then an exclamation of surprise escaped from his comrade  losh man what have we here he cried picking up a small object that glittered in the light  minnies heart sank for she could see that the thing was a small brooch which she was in the habit of wearing in her neckerchief and which must have been detached when ruby carried her into the cave  she felt assured that this would lead to their discovery but it had quite the opposite effect for it caused swankie to turn round and examine the trinket with much curiosity  a long discussion as to how it could have come there immediately ensued between the smugglers in the midst of which a wavelet washed against swankies feet reminding him that the tide was rising and that he had no time to lose  theres nae place behint the rocks said he quickly putting the brooch in his pocket so well just hide the kegs amang the stanes lucky for us that we got the rest o the cargo run ashore at auchmithie thisll lie snugly here and well pull past the leftenant who thinks we havena seen him with oor heeds up and oor tongues in oor cheeks  they both chuckled heartily at the idea of disappointing the preventive officer and while one held the torch the other dug a hole in the beach deep enough to contain the two kegs  in ye go my beauties said swankie covering them up  monys the time ive buried ye  ay an monys the time yeve helped at their resurrection added spink with a laugh  noo well away an have a look at the kegs in the forbidden cave said swankie see that theyre a richt an then have our game wi the landsharks  next moment the torch was dashed against the stones and extinguished and the two men leaping into their boat rowed away  as they passed through the outer cavern ruby heard them arrange to go back to auchmithie  their voices were too indistinct to enable him to ascertain their object in doing so but he knew enough of the smugglers to enable him to guess that it was for the purpose of warning some of their friends of the presence of the preventive boat which their words proved that they had seen  now minnie said he starting up as soon as the boat had disappeared this is what i call good luck for not only shall we be able to return with something to the boat but we shall be able to intercept big swankie and his comrade and offer them a glass of their own gin  yes and i shall be able to boast of having had quite a little adventure said minnie who now that her anxiety was ever began to feel elated  they did not waste time in conversation however for the digging up of two kegs from a gravelly beach with fingers instead of a spade was not a quick or easy thing to do so ruby found as he went down on his knees in that dark place and began the work  can i help you asked his fair companion after a time  help me  what  chafe and tear your little hands with work that all but skins mine  nay truly  but here comes one and the other will soon follow  yo heave ho  with the wellknown nautical shout ruby put forth an herculean effort and tore the kegs out of the earth  after a short pause he carried minnie out of the cavern and led her to the field above by the same path by which they had descended  then he returned for the kegs of gin  they were very heavy but not too heavy for the strength of the young giant who was soon hastening with rapid strides towards the bay where they had left their friends  he bore a keg under each arm and minnie tripped lightly by his sideand laughingly too for she enjoyed the thought of the discomfiture that was in store for the smugglers    chapter twenty  the smugglers are treated to gin and astonishment  they found the lieutenant and captain ogilvy stretched on the grass smoking their pipes together  the daylight had almost deepened into night and a few stars were beginning to twinkle in the sky  hey what have we heresmugglers cried the captain springing up rather quickly as ruby came unexpectedly on them  just so uncle said minnie with a laugh  we have here some gin smuggled all the way from holland and have come to ask your opinion of it  why ruby how came you by this enquired lindsay in amazement as he examined the kegs with critical care  suppose i should say that i have been taken into confidence by the smugglers and then betrayed them  i should reply that the one idea was improbable and the other impossible returned the lieutenant  well i have at all events found out their secrets and now i reveal them  in a few words ruby acquainted his friends with all that has just been narrated  the moment he had finished the lieutenant ordered his men to launch the boat  the kegs were put into the sternsheets the party embarked and pushing off they rowed gently out of the bay and crept slowly along the shore under the deep shadow of the cliffs  how dark it is getting said minnie after they had rowed for some time in silence  the moon will soon be up said the lieutenant  meanwhile ill cast a little light on the subject by having a pipe  will you join me captain  this was a temptation which the captain never resisted indeed he did not regard it as a temptation at all and would have smiled at the idea of resistance  minnie lass said he as he complacently filled the blackened bowl and calmly stuffed down the glowing tobacco with the end of that marvellously callous little fingers its a wonderful thing that baccy i dont know what man would do without it  quite as well as woman does i should think replied minnie  im not so sure of that lass  its more natral for man to smoke than for woman  ye see woman lovely woman should be all my fancy painted her both lovely and divine  it would never do to have baccy perfumes hangin about her rosy lips  but uncle why should man have the disagreeable perfumes you speak of hanging about his lips  i dont know lass  its all a matter o feeling  twere vain to tell thee all i feel how much my heart would wish to say but of this im certain sure that id never git along without my pipe  its like compass helm and ballast all in one  is that the moon leftenant  the captain pointed to a faint gleam of light on the horizon which he knew well enough to be the moon but he wished to change the subject  ay is it and there comes a boat  steady men lay on your oars a bit  this was said earnestly  in one instant all were silent and the boat lay as motionless as the shadows of the cliffs among which it was involved  presently the sound of oars was heard  almost at the same moment the upper edge of the moon rose above the horizon and covered the sea with rippling silver  ere long a boat shot into this stream of light and rowed swiftly in the direction of arbroath  there are only two men in it whispered the lieutenant  ay these are my good friends swankie and spink who know a deal more about other improper callings besides smuggling if i did not greatly mistake their words cried ruby  give way lads cried the lieutenant  the boat sprang at the word from her position under the cliffs and was soon out upon the sea in full chase of the smugglers who bent to their oars more lustily evidently intending to trust to their speed  strange said the lieutenant as the distance between the two began sensibly to decrease if these be smugglers with an empty boat as you lead me to suppose they are they would only be too glad to stop and let us see that they had nothing aboard that we could touch  it leads me to think that you are mistaken ruby brand and that these are not your friends  nay the same fact convinces me that they are the very men we seek for they said they meant to have some game with you and what more amusing than to give you a long hard chase for nothing  true you are right  well we will turn the tables on them  take the helm for a minute while i tap one of the kegs  the tapping was soon accomplished and a quantity of the spirit was drawn off into the captains pocketflask  taste it captain and lets have your opinion  captain ogilvy complied  he put the flask to his lips and on removing it smacked them and looked at the party with that extremely grave almost solemn expression which is usually assumed by a man when strong liquid is being put to the delicate test of his palate  oh exclaimed the captain opening his eyes very wide indeed  what oh meant was rather doubtful at first but when the captain put the flask again to his lips and took another pull a good deal longer than the first much if not all of the doubt was removed  prime nectar he murmured in a species of subdued ecstasy at the end of the second draught  evidently the right stuff said lindsay laughing    liquid streamscelestial nectar   darted through the ambient sky  said the captain liquid ay liquid is the word  he was about to test the liquid again  stop stop fair play captain its my turn now cried the lieutenant snatching the flask from his friends grasp and applying it to his own lips  both the lieutenant and ruby pronounced the gin perfect and as minnie positively refused either to taste or to pronounce judgment the flask was returned to its owners pocket  they were now close on the smugglers whom they hailed and commanded to lay on their oars  the order was at once obeyed and the boats were speedily rubbing sides together  i should like to examine your boat friends said the lieutenant as he stepped across the gunwales  oh sir im thankfu to find youre not smugglers said swankie with an assumed air of mingled respect and alarm  if wed only knowd ye was preventives wed ha backed oars at once theres nothin here ye may seek as longs ye please  the hypocritical rascal winked slyly to his comrade as he said this meanwhile lindsay and one of the men examined the contents of the boat and finding nothing contraband the former said  so youre honest men i find  fishermen doubtless  ay some o yer crew ken us brawly said davy spink with a grin  well i wont detain you rejoined the lieutenant its quite a pleasure to chase honest men on the high seas in these times of war and smuggling  but its too bad to have given you such a fright lads for nothing  what say you to a glass of gin  big swankie and his comrade glanced at each other in surprise  they evidently thought this an unaccountably polite government officer and were puzzled  however they could do no less than accept such a generous offer  thankee sir said big swankie spitting out his quid and significantly wiping his mouth  i hae nae objection  doubtless itll be the best that the like o you carries in yer bottle  the best certainly said the lieutenant as he poured out a bumper and handed it to the smuggler  it was smuggled of course and you see his majesty is kind enough to give his servants a little of what they rescue from the rascals to drink his health  weel i drink to the king said swankie an confusion to all his enemies specially to smugglers  he tossed off the gin with infinite gusto and handed back the cup with a smack of the lips and a look that plainly said more if you please  but the hint was not taken  another bumper was filled and handed to davy spink who had been eyeing the crew of the boat with great suspicion  he accepted the cup nodded curtly and said  heres tye gentlemen no forgettin the fair leddy in the sternsheets  while he was drinking the gin the lieutenant turned to his men  get out the keg lads from which that came and refill the flask hold it well up in the moonlight and see that ye dont spill a single drop as you value your lives  hey my man what ails you  does the gin disagree with your stomach or have you never seen a smuggled keg of spirits before that you stare at it as if it were a keg of ghosts  the latter part of this speech was addressed to swankie who no sooner beheld the keg than his eyes opened up until they resembled two great oysters  his mouth slowly followed suit  davy spinks attention having been attracted he became subject to similar alterations of visage  hallo cried the captain while the whole crew burst into a laugh you must have given them poison  have you a stomachpump doctor he said turning hastily to ruby  no nothing but a penknife and a tobaccostopper  if theyre of any use to you  he was interrupted by a loud laugh from big swankie who quickly recovered his presence of mind and declared that he had never tasted such capital stuff in his life  have ye much ot sir  o yes a good deal  i have two kegs of it the lieutenant grinned very hard at this point and we expect to get a little more tonight  ha exclaimed davy spink theres no doot plenty ot in the coves hereaway for theyre an awfu smugglin set  whan did ye find the twa kegs noo if i may ask  oh certainly  i got them not more than an hour ago  the smugglers glanced at each other and were struck dumb but they were now too much on their guard to let any further evidence of surprise escape them  weel i wush ye success sirs said swankie sitting down to his oar its likely yell come across mair if ye try dickmonts den  theres usually somethin hidden thereaboots  thank you friend for the hint said the lieutenant as he took his place at the tillerropes but i shall have a look at the gaylet cove i think this evening  what the gaylet cove cried spink  ye might as weel look for kegs at the bottom o the deep sea  perhaps so nevertheless i have taken a fancy to go there  if i find nothing i will take a look into the forbidden cave  the forbidden cave almost howled swankie  wha iver heard o smugglers hidin onything there  the air int wad pushen a rotten  perhaps it would yet i mean to try  weelaweel ye may try but ye might as weel seek for kegs o gin on the bell rock  ha its not the first time that strange things have been found on the bell rock said ruby suddenly  i have heard of jewels even being discovered there  give way men shove off cried the lieutenant  a pleasant pull to you lads  good night  the two boats parted and while the lieutenant and his friends made for the shore the smugglers rowed towards arbroath in a state of mingled amazement and despair at what they had heard and seen  it was ruby brand that spoke last davy  ay he was i the shadow o captain ogilvy and i couldna see his face but i thought it like his voice when he first spoke  hoo can he hae come to ken aboot the jewels  thats mair than i can tell  ill bury them said swankie an then itll puzzle onybody to tell whaur they are  yell please yoursell said spink  swankie was too angry to make any reply or to enter into further conversation with his comrade about the kegs of gin so they continued their way in silence  meanwhile as lieutenant lindsay and his men had a night of work before them the captain suggested that minnie ruby and himself should be landed within a mile of the town and left to find their way thither on foot  this was agreed to and while the one party walked home by the romantic pathway at the top of the cliffs the other rowed away to explore the dark recesses of the forbidden cave    chapter twenty one  the bell rock againa dreary night in a strange habitation  during that winter ruby brand wrought diligently in the workyard at the lighthouse materials and by living economically began to save a small sum of money which he laid carefully by with a view to his marriage with minnie gray  being an impulsive man ruby would have married minnie then and there without looking too earnestly to the future  but his mother had advised him to wait till he should have laid by a little for a rainy day  the captain had recommended patience tobacco and philosophy and had enforced his recommendations with sundry apt quotations from dead and living novelists dramatists and poets  minnie herself poor girl felt that she ought not to run counter to the wishes of her best and dearest friends so she too advised delay for a little time and ruby was fain to content himself with bewailing his hard lot internally and knocking jamie doves bellows anvils and sledgehammers about in a way that induced that son of vulcan to believe his assistant had gone mad  as for big swankie he hid his illgotten gains under the floor of his tumbledown cottage and went about his evil courses as usual in company with his comrade davy spink who continued to fight and make it up with him as of yore  it must not be supposed that ruby forgot the conversation he had overheard in the gaylet cove  he and minnie and his uncle had frequent discussions in regard to it but to little purpose for although swankie and spink had discovered old mr brands body on the bell rock it did not follow that any jewels or money they had found there were necessarily his  still ruby could not divest his mind of the feeling that there was some connexion between the two and he was convinced from what had fallen from davy spink about silver teapots and things that swankie was the man of whose bad deeds he himself had been suspected  as there seemed no possibility of bringing the matter home to him however he resolved to dismiss the whole affair from his mind in the meantime  things were very much in this state when in the spring the operations at the bell rock were resumed  jamie dove ruby robert selkirk and several of the principal workmen accompanied the engineers on their first visit to the rock and they sailed towards the scene of their former labours with deep and peculiar interest such as one might feel on renewing acquaintance with an old friend who had passed through many hard and trying struggles since the last time of meeting  the storms of winter had raged round the bell rock as usualas they had done in fact since the world began but that winter the handiwork of man had also been exposed to the fury of the elements there  it was known that the beacon had survived the storms for it could be seen by telescope from the shore in clear weatherlike a little speck on the seaward horizon  now they were about to revisit the old haunt and have a close inspection of the damage that it was supposed must certainly have been done  to the credit of the able engineer who planned and carried out the whole works the beacon was found to have resisted winds and waves successfully  it was on a bitterly cold morning about the end of march that the first visit of the season was paid to the bell rock  mr stevenson and his party of engineers and artificers sailed in the lighthouse yacht and on coming within a proper distance of the rock two boats were lowered and pushed off  the sea ran with such force upon the rock that it seemed doubtful whether a landing could be effected  about halfpast eight when the rock was fairly above water several attempts were made to land but the breach of the sea was still so great that they were driven back  on the eastern side the sea separated into two distinct waves which came with a sweep round the western side where they met and rose in a burst of spray to a considerable height  watching however for what the sailors termed a smooth and catching a favourable opportunity they rowed between the two seas dexterously and made a successful landing at the western creek  the sturdy beacon was then closely examined  it had been painted white at the end of the previous season but the lower parts of the posts were found to have become greenthe sea having clothed them with a soft garment of weed  the seabirds had evidently imagined that it was put up expressly for their benefit for a number of cormorants and large herringgulls had taken up their quarters on itfinding it no doubt conveniently near to their fishinggrounds  a critical inspection of all its parts showed that everything about it was in a most satisfactory state  there was not the slightest indication of working or shifting in the great iron stanchions with which the beams were fixed nor of any of the joints or places of connexion and excepting some of the bracingchains which had been loosened everything wars found in the same entire state in which it had been left the previous season  only those who know what that beacon had been subjected to can form a correct estimate of the importance of this discovery and the amount of satisfaction it afforded to those most interested in the works at the bell rock  to say that the party congratulated themselves would be far short of the reality  they hailed the event with cheers and their looks seemed to indicate that some piece of immense and unexpected good fortune had befallen each individual  from that moment mr stevenson saw the practicability and propriety of fitting up the beacon not only as a place of refuge in case of accidents to the boats in landing but as a residence for the men during the working months  from that moment too poor jamie dove began to see the dawn of happier days for when the beacon should be fitted up as a residence he would bid farewell to the hated floating light and take up his abode as he expressed it on land  on land  it is probable that this jamie dove was the first man since the world began who had entertained the till then absurdly preposterous notion that the fatal bell rock was land or that it could be made a place of even temporary residence  a hundred years ago men would have laughed at the bare idea  fifty years ago that idea was realised for more than half a century that sunken reef has been and still is the safe and comfortable home of man  forgive reader our tendency to anticipate  let us proceed with our inspection  having ascertained that the foundations of the beacon were all right the engineers next ascended to the upper parts where they found the crossbeams and their fixtures in an equally satisfactory condition  on the top a strong chest had been fixed the preceding season in which had been placed a quantity of seabiscuits and several bottles of water in case of accident to the boats or in the event of shipwreck occurring on the rock  the biscuit having been carefully placed in tin canisters was found in good condition but several of the waterbottles had burst in consequence it was supposed of frost during the winter twelve of the bottles however remained entire so that the bell rock may be said to have been transformed even at that date from a point of destruction into a place of comparative safety  while the party were thus employed the landingmaster reminded them that the sea was running high and that it would be necessary to set off while the rock afforded anything like shelter to the boats which by that time had been made fast to the beacon and rode with much agitation each requiring two men with boathooks to keep them from striking each other or ranging up against the beacon  but under these circumstances the greatest confidence was felt by everyone from the security afforded by that temporary erection for supposing that the wind had suddenly increased to a gale and that it had been found inadvisable to go into the boats or supposing they had drifted or sprung a leak from striking upon the rocks in any of these possible and not at all improbable cases they had now something to lay hold of and though occupying the dreary habitation of the gull and the cormorant affording only bread and water yet life would be preserved and under the circumstances they would have been supported by the hope of being ultimately relieved  soon after this the works at the bell rock were resumed with if possible greater vigour than before and ere long the house was fixed to the top of the beacon and the engineer and his men took up their abode there  think of this reader  six great wooden beams were fastened to a rock over which the waves roared twice every day and on the top of these a pleasant little marine residence was nailed as one might nail a dovecot on the top of a pole  this residence was ultimately fitted up in such a way as to become a comparatively comfortable and commodious abode  it contained four storeys  the first was the mortargallery where the mortar for the lighthouse was mixed as required it also supported the forge  the second was the cookroom  the third the apartment of the engineer and his assistants and the fourth was the artificers barrackroom  this house was of course built of wood but it was firmly put together for it had to pass through many a terrific ordeal  in order to give some idea of the interior we shall describe the cabin of mr stevenson  it measured four feet three inches in breadth on the floor and though from the oblique direction of the beams of the beacon it widened towards the top yet it did not admit of the full extension of the occupants arms when he stood on the floor  its length was little more than sufficient to admit of a cotbed being suspended during the night  this cot was arranged so as to be triced up to the roof during the day thus leaving free room for occasional visitors and for comparatively free motion  a folding table was attached with hinges immediately under the small window of the apartment  the remainder of the space was fitted up with books barometer thermometer portmanteau and two or three campstools  the walls were covered with green cloth formed into panels with red tape a substance which by the way might have had an accidental connexion with the bell rock lighthouse but which could not by any possibility have influenced it as a principle otherwise that building would probably never have been built or if built would certainly not have stood until the present day  the bed was festooned with yellow cotton stuff and the diet being plain the paraphernalia of the table was proportionally simple  it would have been interesting to know the individual books required and used by the celebrated engineer in his singular abode but his record leaves no detailed account of these  it does however contain a sentence in regard to one volume which we deem it just to his character to quote  he writes thus  if in speculating upon the abstract wants of man in such a state of exclusion one were reduced to a single book the sacred volume whether considered for the striking diversity of its story the morality of its doctrine or the important truths of its gospel would have proved by far the greatest treasure  it may be easily imagined that in a place where the accommodation of the principal engineer was so limited that of the men was not extensive accordingly we find that the barrackroom contained beds for twentyone men  but the completion of the beacon house as we have described it was not accomplished in one season  at first it was only used as a smiths workshop and then as a temporary residence in fine weather  one of the first men who remained all night upon it was our friend bremner  he became so tired of the floating light that he earnestly solicited and obtained permission to remain on the beacon  at the time it was only in a partially sheltered state  the joiners had just completed the covering of the roof with a quantity of tarpaulin which the seamen had laid over with successive coats of hot tar and the sides of the erection had been painted with three coats of white lead between the timber framing of the habitable part the interstices were stuffed with moss but the green baize cloth with which it was afterwards lined had not been put on when bremner took possession  it was a splendid summer evening when the bold man made his request and obtained permission to remain  none of the others would join him  when the boats pushed off and left him the solitary occupant of the rock he felt a sensation of uneasiness but having formed his resolution he stuck by it and bade his comrades good night cheerfully  good night and goodbye cried forsyth as he took his seat at the oar  farewell dear cried oconnor wiping his eyes with a very ragged pocket handkerchief  you wont forget me retorted bremner  never replied dumsby with fervour  av the beacon should be carried away darlin cried oconnor howld tight to the provisionchest praps yell be washed ashore  ill drink your health in water paddy replied bremner  faix i hope it wont be salt wather retorted ned  they continued to shout good wishes warnings and advice to their comrade until out of hearing and then waved adieu to him until he was lost to view  we have said that bremner was alone yet he was not entirely so he had a comrade with him in the shape of his little black dog to which reference has already been made  this creature was of that very thin and tightskinned description of dog that trembles at all times as if afflicted with chronic cold summer and winter  its thin tail was always between its extremely thin legs as though it lived in a perpetual condition of wrongdoing and were in constant dread of deserved punishment  yet no dog ever belied its looks more than did this one for it was a good dog and a warmhearted dog and never did a wicked thing and never was punished so that its excessive humility and apparent fear and trembling were quite unaccountable  like all dogs of its class it was passionately affectionate and intensely grateful for the smallest favour  in fact it seemed to be rather thankful than otherwise for a kick when it chanced to receive one and a pat on the head or a kind word made it all but jump out of its black skin for very joy  bremner called it pup  it had no other name and didnt seem to wish for one  on the present occasion it was evidently much perplexed and very unhappy for it looked at the boat and then wistfully into its masters face as if to say this is awful have you resolved that we shall perish together  now pup said bremner when the boat disappeared in the shades of evening you and i are left alone on the bell rock  there was a touch of sad uncertainty in the wag of the tail with which pup received this remark  but cheer up pup cried bremner with a sudden burst of animation that induced the creature to wriggle and dance on its hind legs for at least a minute you and i shall have a jolly night together on the beacon so come along  like many a night that begins well that particular night ended ill even while the man spoke a swell began to rise and as the tide had by that time risen a few feet an occasional billow swept over the rocks and almost washed the feet of bremner as he made his way over the ledges  in five minutes the sea was rolling all round the foot of the beacon and bremner and his friend were safely ensconced on the mortargallery  there was no storm that night nevertheless there was one of those heavy ground swells that are of common occurrence in the german ocean  it is supposed that this swell is caused by distant westerly gales in the atlantic which force an undue quantity of water into the north sea and thus produce the apparent paradox of great rolling breakers in calm weather  on this night there was no wind at all but there was a higher swell than usual so that each great billow passed over the rock with a roar that was rendered more than usually terrible in consequence of the utter absence of all other sounds  at first bremner watched the rising tide and as he sat up there in the dark he felt himself dreadfully forsaken and desolate and began to comment on things in general to his dog by way of inducing a more sociable and cheery state of mind  pup this is a lugubrious state o things  wot dye think ot  pup did not say but he expressed such violent joy at being noticed that he nearly fell off the platform of the mortargallery in one of his extravagant gyrations  that wont do pup said bremner shaking his head at the creature whose countenance expressed deep contrition  dont go on like that else youll fall into the sea and be drownded and then i shall be left alone  what a dark night it is to be sure  i doubt if it was wise of me to stop here  suppose the beacon were to be washed away  bremner paused and pup wagged his tail interrogatively as though to say what then  ah its of no use supposin continued the man slowly  the beacon has stood it out all winter and it aint likely its goin to be washed away tonight  but suppose i was to be took bad  again the dog seemed to demand what then  well thats not very likely either for i never was took bad in my life since i took the measles and thats more than twenty years ago come pup dont let us look at the black side o things let us try to be cheerful my dog  hallo  the exclamation was caused by the appearance of a green billow which in the uncertain light seemed to advance in a threatening attitude towards the beacon as if to overwhelm it but it fell at some distance and only rolled in a churning sea of milky foam among the posts and sprang up and licked the beams as a serpent might do before swallowing them  come it was the light deceived me  if i go for to start at every wave like that ill have a poor night of it for the tide has a long way to rise yet  lets go and have a bit supper lad  bremner rose from the anvil on which he had seated himself and went up the ladder into the cookhouse above  here all was pitch dark owing to the place being enclosed all round which the mortargallery was not but a light was soon struck a lamp trimmed and the fire in the stove kindled  bremner now busied himself in silently preparing a cup of tea which with a quantity of seabiscuit a little cold salt pork and a hunk of stale bread constituted his supper  pup watched his every movement with an expression of earnest solicitude combined with goodwill in his sharp intelligent eyes  when supper was ready pup had his share then feeling that the duties of the day were now satisfactorily accomplished he coiled himself up at his masters feet and went to sleep  his master rolled himself up in a rug and lying down before the fire also tried to sleep but without success for a long time  as he lay there counting the number of seconds of awful silence that elapsed between the fall of each successive billow and listening to the crash and the roar as wave after wave rushed underneath him and caused his habitation to tremble he could not avoid feeling alarmed in some degree  do what he would the thought of the wrecks that had taken place there the shrieks that must have often rung above these rocks and the dead and mangled bodies that must have lain among them would obtrude upon him and banish sleep from his eyes  at last he became somewhat accustomed to the rush of waters and the tremulous motion of the beacon  his frame too exhausted by a day of hard toil refused to support itself and he sank into slumber  but it was not unbroken  a falling cinder from the sinking fire would awaken him with a start a larger wave than usual would cause him to spring up and look round in alarm or a shrieking seabird as it swooped past would induce a dream in which the cries of drowning men arose causing him to awake with a cry that set pup barking furiously  frequently during that night after some such dream bremner would get up and descend to the mortargallery to see that all was right there he found the waves always hissing below but the starry sky was calm and peaceful above so he returned to his couch comforted a little and fell again into a troubled sleep to be again awakened by frightful dreams of dreadful sights and scenes of death and danger on the sea  thus the hours wore slowly away  as the tide fell the noise of waves retired a little from the beacon and the wearied man and dog sank gradually at last into deep untroubled slumber  so deep was it that they did not hear the increasing noise of the gulls as they wheeled round the beacon after having breakfasted near it so deep that they did not feel the sun as it streamed through an opening in the woodwork and glared on their respective faces so deep that they were ignorant of the arrival of the boats with the workmen and were dead to the shouts of their companions until one of them jamie dove put his head up the hatchway and uttered one of his loudest roars close to their ears  then indeed bremner rose up and looked bewildered and pup starting up barked as furiously as if its own little black body had miraculously become the concentrated essence of all the other noisy dogs in the wide world rolled into one    chapter twenty two  life in the beaconstory of the eddystone lighthouse  some time after this a number of the men took up their permanent abode in the beacon house and the work was carried on by night as well as by day when the state of the tide and the weather permitted  immense numbers of fish called poddlies were discovered to be swimming about at high water  so numerous were they that the rock was sometimes hidden by the shoals of them  fishing for these thenceforth became a pastime among the men who not only supplied their own table with fresh fish but at times sent presents of them to their friends in the vessels  all the men who dwelt on the beacon were volunteers for mr stevenson felt that it would be cruel to compel men to live at such a post of danger  those who chose therefore remained in the lightship or the tender and those who preferred it went to the beacon  it is scarcely necessary to add that among the latter were found all the seasick men  these bold artificers were not long of having their courage tested soon after their removal to the beacon they experienced some very rough weather which shook the posts violently and caused them to twist in a most unpleasant way  but it was not until some time after that a storm arose which caused the stoutesthearted of them all to quail more than once  it began on the night of as fine a day as they had had the whole season  in order that the reader may form a just conception of what we are about to describe it may not be amiss to note the state of things at the rock and the employment of the men at the time  a second forge had been put up on the higher platform of the beacon but the night before that of which we write the lower platform had been burst up by a wave and the mortar and forge thereon with all the implements were cast down  the damaged forge was therefore set up for the time on its old site near the foundationpit of the lighthouse while the carpenters were busy repairing the mortargallery  the smiths were as usual busy sharpening picks and irons and making bats and stanchions and other iron work connected with the building operations  the landingmasters crew were occupied in assisting the millwrights to lay the railways to hand and joiners were kept almost constantly employed in fitting picks to their handles which latter were very frequently broken  nearly all the miscellaneous work was done by seamen  there was no such character on the bell rock as the common labourer  the sailors cheerfully undertook the work usually performed by such men and they did it admirably  in consequence of the men being able to remain on the beacon the work went on literally by double tides and at night the rock was often ablaze with torches while the artificers wrought until the waves drove them away  on the night in question there was a low springtide so that a nighttides work of five hours was secured  this was one of the longest spells they had had since the beginning of the operations  the stars shone brightly in a very dark sky  not a breath of air was felt  even the smoke of the forge fire rose perpendicularly a short way until an imperceptible zephyr wafted it gently to the west  yet there was a heavy swell rolling in from the eastward which caused enormous waves to thunder on ralph the rovers ledge as if they would drive down the solid rock  mingled with this solemn intermittent roar of the sea was the continuous clink of picks chisels and hammers and the loud clang of the two forges that on the beacon being distinctly different from the other owing to the wooden erection on which it stood rendering it deep and thunderous  torches and forge fires cast a glare over all rendering the foam pale green and the rocks deep red  some of the active figures at work stood out black and sharp against the light while others shone in its blaze like redhot fiends  above all sounded an occasional cry from the seagulls as they swooped down into the magic circle of light and then soared away shrieking into darkness  hard works not easy observed james dove pausing in the midst of his labours to wipe his brow  true for ye but as weve got to arn our brid be the sweat of our brows were in the fair way to fortin said ned oconnor blowing away energetically with the big bellows  ned had been reappointed to this duty since the erection of the second forge which was in rubys charge  it was our heros hammer that created such a din up in the beacon while dove wrought down on the rock  well have a gale tonight said the smith i know that by the feelin of the air  well i cant boast o much knowledge o feelin said oconnor but i believe youre right for the fish towld me the news this mornin  this remark of ned had reference to a wellascertained fact that when a storm was coming the fish invariably left the neighbourhood of the rock doubtless in order to seek the security of depths which are not affected by winds or waves  while dove and his comrade commented on this subject two of the other men had retired to the southeastern end of the rock to take a look at the weather  these were peter logan the foreman whose position required him to have a care for the safety of the men as well as for the progress of the work and our friend bremner who had just descended from the cookingroom where he had been superintending the preparation of supper  it will be a stiff breeze i fear tonight said logan  dye think so i said bremner it seems to me so calm that i would think a storm amost impossible  but the fish never tell lies  true  you got no fish today i believe said logan  not a nibble replied the other  as he spoke he was obliged to rise from a rock on which he had seated himself because of a large wave which breaking on the outer reefs sent the foam a little closer to his toes than was agreeable  that was a big one but yonder is a bigger cried logan  the wave to which he referred was indeed a majestic wall of water  it came on with such an awful appearance of power that some of the men who perceived it could not repress a cry of astonishment  in another moment it fell and bursting over the rocks with a terrific roar extinguished the forge fire and compelled the men to take refuge in the beacon  jamie dove saved his bellows with difficulty  the other men catching up their things as they best might crowded up the ladder in a more or less draggled condition  the beacon house was gained by means of one of the main beams which had been converted into a stair by the simple process of nailing small battens thereon about a foot apart from each other  the men could only go up one at a time but as they were active and accustomed to the work were all speedily within their place of refuge  soon afterwards the sea covered the rock and the place where they had been at work was a mass of seething foam  still there was no wind but dark clouds had begun to rise on the seaward horizon  the sudden change in the appearance of the rock after the last torches were extinguished was very striking  for a few seconds there seemed to be no light at all  the darkness of a coal mine appeared to have settled down on the scene  but this soon passed away as the mens eyes became accustomed to the change and then the dark loom of the advancing billows the pale light of the flashing foam and occasional gleams of phosphorescence and glimpses of black rocks in the midst of all took the place of the warm busy scene which the spot had presented a few minutes before  supper boys shouted bremner  peter bremner we may remark in passing was a particularly useful member of society  besides being small and corpulent he was a capital cook  he had acted during his busy life both as a groom and a houseservant he had been a soldier a sutler a writers clerk and an apothecaryin which latter profession he had acquired the art of writing and suggesting recipes and a taste for making collections in natural history  he was very partial to the use of the lancet and quite a terrible adept at toothdrawing  in short peter was the factotum of the beacon house where in addition to his other offices he filled those of barber and steward to the admiration of all  but bremner came out in quite a new and valuable light after he went to reside in the beaconnamely as a storyteller  during the long periods of inaction that ensued when the men were imprisoned there by storms he lightened many an hour that would have otherwise hung heavily on their hands and he cheered the more timid among them by speaking lightly of the danger of their position  on the signal for supper being given there was a general rush down the ladders into the kitchen where as comfortable a meal as one could wish for was smoking in pot and pan and platter  as there were twentythree to partake it was impossible of course for all to sit down to table  they were obliged to stow themselves away on such articles of furniture as came most readily to hand and eat as they best could  hungry men find no difficulty in doing this  for some time the conversation was restricted to a word or two  soon however as appetite began to be appeased tongues began to loosen  the silence was first broken by a groan  ochone exclaimed oconnor as well as a mouthful of pork and potatoes would allow him was it you that groaned like a dyin pig  the question was put to forsyth who was holding his head between his hands and swaying his body to and fro in agony  hae ye the colic freen enquired john watt in a tone of sympathy  nono groaned forsyth its aatootooth  och is that all  have it out man at once  ram a redhot skewer into it  no no let it alone and itll go away  such was the advice tendered and much more of a similar nature to the suffering man  theres nothink like ot water an cold said joe dumsby in the tones of an oracle  just fill your mouth with bilin ot water an dip your face in a basin o cold and its sartain to cure  or kill suggested jamie dove  its better now said forsyth with a sigh of relief  i scrunched a bit o bone into it that was all  theres nothing like the string and the redhot poker suggested ruby brand  tie the one end o the string to a post and tother end to the tooth an stick a redhot poker to your nose  away it comes at once  hoot nonsense said watt  ye might as weel tie a string to his lug an dip him into the sea  tak my word fort theres naethin like pooin  dyou mean pooh pooin enquired dumsby  watts reply was interrupted by a loud gust of wind which burst upon the beacon house at that moment and shook it violently  everyone started up and all clustered round the door and windows to observe the appearance of things without  every object was shrouded in thick darkness but a flash of lightning revealed the approach of the storm which had been predicted and which had already commenced to blow  all tendency to jest instantly vanished and for a time some of the men stood watching the scene outside while others sat smoking their pipes by the fire in silence  what think ye of things enquired one of the men as ruby came up from the mortargallery to which he had descended at the first gust of the storm  i dont know what to think said he gravely  its clear enough that we shall have a stiffish gale  i think little of that with a tight craft below me and plenty of searoom but i dont know what to think of a beacon in a gale  as he spoke another furious burst of wind shook the place and a flash of vivid lightning was speedily followed by a crash of thunder that caused some hearts there to beat faster and harder than usual  pooh cried bremner as he proceeded coolly to wash up his dishes thats nothing boys  has not this old timber house weathered all the gales o last winter and dye think its goin to come down before a summer breeze  why theres a lighthouse in france called the tour de cordouan which rises light out o the sea an im told it had some fearful gales to try its metal when it was buildin  so dont go an git narvous  whos gittin narvous exclaimed george forsyth at whom bremner had looked when he made the last remark  sure ye misjudge him cried oconnor  its only another twist o the toothick  but its all very well in you to spake lightly o gales in that fashion  wasnt the eddystone lighthouse cleared away one stormy night with the engineer and all the men an was niver more heard on  thats true said ruby  come bremner i have heard you say that you had read all about that business  lets hear the story it will help to while away the time for theres no chance of anyone gettin to sleep with such a row outside  i wish it may be no worse than a row outside said forsyth in a doleful tone as he shook his head and looked round on the party anxiously  wot another fit o the toothick enquired oconnor ironically  dont try to put us in the dismals said jamie dove knocking the ashes out of his pipe and refilling that solace of his leisure hours let us hear about the eddystone bremner itll cheer up our spirits a bit  will it though said bremner with a look that john watt described as awesome well we shall see  you must know boys  ere light your pipe my earty said dumsby  hold yer tongue an dont interrupt him cried one of the men flattening dumsbys cap over his eyes  and dont drop yer haitches observed another cause if ye do theyll fall into the sea an be drownded an then yell have none left to put into their wrong places when ye wants em  come bremner go on  well then boys began bremner you must know that it is more than a hundred years since the eddystone lighthouse was begunin the year 1696 if i remember rightlythat would be just a hundred and thirteen years to this date  up to that time these rocks were as great a terror to sailors as the bell rock is now or rather as it was last year for now that this here comfortable beacon has been put up its no longer a terror to nobody  except geordie forsyth interposed oconnor  silence cried the men  well resumed bremner as you all know the eddystone rocks lie in the british channel fourteen miles from plymouth and ten from the ram head an open to a most tremendious sea from the bay o biscay and the atlantic as i knows well for ive passed the place in a gale close enough amost to throw a biscuit on the rocks  they are named the eddystone rocks because of the whirls and eddies that the tides make among them but for the matter of that the bell rock might be so named on the same ground  howsever its six o one an half a dozen o tother  only theres this difference that the highest point o the eddystone is barely covered at high water while here the rock is twelve or fifteen feet below water at high tide  well it was settled by the trinity board in 1696 that a lighthouse should be put up and a mr winstanley was engaged to do it  he was an uncommon clever an ingenious man  he used to exhibit wonderful waterworks in london and in his house down in essex he used to astonish his friends and frighten them sometimes with his queer contrivances  he had invented an easy chair which laid hold of anyone that sat down in it and held him prisoner until mr winstanley set him free  he made a slipper also and laid it on his bedroom floor and when anyone put his foot into it he touched a spring that caused a ghost to rise from the hearth  he made a summer house too at the foot of his garden on the edge of a canal and if anyone entered into it and sat down he very soon found himself adrift on the canal  such a man was thought to be the best for such a difficult work as the building of a lighthouse on the eddystone so he was asked to undertake it and agreed and began it well  he finished it too in four years his chief difficulty being the distance of the rock from land and the danger of goin backwards and forwards  the light was first shown on the 14th november 1698  before this the engineer had resolved to pass a night in the building which he did with a party of men but he was compelled to pass more than a night for it came on to blow furiously and they were kept prisoners for eleven days drenched with spray all the time and hard up for provisions  it was said the sprays rose a hundred feet above the lantern of this first eddystone lighthouse  well it stood till the year 1703 when repairs became necessary and mr winstanley went down to plymouth to superintend  it had been prophesied that this lighthouse would certainly be carried away  but dismal prophecies are always made about unusual things  if men were to mind prophecies there would be precious little done in this world  howsever the prophecies unfortunately came true  winstanleys friends advised him not to go to stay in it but he was so confident of the strength of his work that he said he only wished to have the chance o bein there in the greatest storm that ever blew that he might see what effect it would have on the buildin  poor man he had his wish  on the night of the 26th november a terrible storm arose the worst that had been for many years and swept the lighthouse entirely away  not a vestige of it or the people on it was ever seen afterwards  only a few bits of the iron fastenings were left fixed in the rocks  that was terrible said forsyth whose uneasiness was evidently increasing with the rising storm  ay but the worst of it was continued bremner that owing to the absence of the light a large east indiaman went on the rocks immediately after and became a total wreck  this however set the trinity house on putting up another which was begun in 1706 and the light shown in 1708  this tower was ninetytwo feet high built partly of wood and partly of stone  it was a strong building and stood for fortynine years  mayhap it would have been standin to this day but for an accident which you shall hear of before i have done  while this lighthouse was building a french privateer carried off all the workmen prisoners to france but they were set at liberty by the king because their work was of such great use to all nations  the lighthouse when finished was put in charge of two keepers with instructions to hoist a flag when anything was wanted from the shore one of these men became suddenly ill and died  of course his comrade hoisted the signal but the weather was so bad that it was found impossible to send a boat off for four weeks  the poor keeper was so afraid that people might suppose he had murdered his companion that he kept the corpse beside him all that time  what his feelins could have been i dont know but they must have been awful for besides the horror of such a position in such a lonesome place the body decayed to an extent  thatll do lad dont be too partickler said jamie dove  the others gave a sigh of relief at the interruption and bremner continued  there were always three keepers in the eddystone after that  well it was in the year 1755 on the 2nd december that one o the keepers went to snuff the candles for they only burned candles in the lighthouses at that time and before that time great open grates with coal fires were the most common but there were not many lights either of one kind or another in those days  on gettin up to the lantern he found it was on fire  all the efforts they made failed to put it out and it was soon burned down  boats put off to them but they only succeeded in saving the keepers and of them one went mad on reaching the shore and ran off and never was heard of again and another an old man died from the effects of melted lead which had run down his throat from the roof of the burning lighthouse  they did not believe him when he said he had swallowed lead but after he died it was found to be a fact  the tower became redhot and burned for five days before it was utterly destroyed  this was the end o the second eddystone  its builder was a mr john rudyerd a silk mercer of london  the third eddystone which has now stood for half a century as firm as the rock itself and which bids fair to stand till the end of time was begun in 1756 and completed in 1759  it was lighted by means of twentyfour candles  of mr smeaton the engineer who built it those who knew him best said that he had never undertaken anything without completing it to the satisfaction of his employers  dye know lads continued bremner in a halfmusing tone ive sometimes been led to couple this character of smeaton with the text that he put round the top of the first room of the lighthouseexcept the lord build the house they labour in vain that build it and also the words praise god which he cut in latin on the last stone the lintel of the lantern door  i think these words had somethin to do with the success of the last eddystone lighthouse  i agree with you said robert selkirk with a nod of hearty approval and moreover i think the bell rock lighthouse stands a good chance of equal success for whether he means to carve texts on the stones or not i dont know but i feel assured that our engineer is animated by the same spirit  when bremners account of the eddystone came to a close most of the men had finished their third or fourth pipes yet no one proposed going to rest  the storm without raged so furiously that they felt a strong disinclination to separate  at last however peter logan rose and said he would turn in for a little  two or three of the others also rose and were about to ascend to their barrack when a heavy sea struck the building causing it to quiver to its foundation    chapter twenty three  the storm  tis a fearful night said logan pausing with his foot on the first step of the ladder  perhaps we had better sit up  whats the use said oconnor who was by nature reckless  av the beacon howlds on we may as well slape as not an if it dont howld on why well be none the worse o slapin anyhow  i mean to sit up said forsyth whose alarm was aggravated by another fit of violent toothache  so do i exclaimed several of the men as another wave dashed against the beacon and a quantity of spray came pouring down from the rooms above  this latter incident put an end to further conversation  while some sprang up the ladder to see where the leak had occurred ruby opened the door which was on the leeside of the building and descended to the mortargallery to look after his tools which lay there  here he was exposed to the full violence of the gale for as we have said this first floor of the beacon was not protected by sides  there was sufficient light to enable him to see all round for a considerable distance  the sight was not calculated to comfort him  the wind was whistling with what may be termed a vicious sound among the beams to one of which ruby was obliged to cling to prevent his being carried away  the sea was bursting leaping and curling wildly over the rocks which were now quite covered and as he looked down through the chinks in the boards of the floor he could see the foam whirling round the beams of his trembling abode and leaping up as if to seize him  as the tide rose higher and higher the waves roared straight through below the floor their curling backs rising terribly near to where he stood and the sprays drenching him and the whole edifice completely  as he gazed into the dark distance where the turmoil of waters seemed to glimmer with ghostly light against a sky of the deepest black he missed the light of the smeaton which up to that time had been moored as near to the lee of the rock as was consistent with safety  he fancied she must have gone down and it was not till next day that the people on the beacon knew that she had parted her cables and had been obliged to make for the firth of forth for shelter from the storm  while he stood looking anxiously in the direction of the tender a wave came so near to the platform that he almost involuntarily leaped up the ladder for safety  it broke before reaching the beacon and the spray dashed right over it carrying away several of the smiths tools  ho boys lend a hand here some of you shouted ruby as he leaped down on the mortargallery again  jamie dove bremner oconnor and several others were at his side in a moment and in the midst of tremendous sprays they toiled to secure the movable articles that lay there  these were passed up to the sheltered parts of the house but not without great danger to all who stood on the exposed gallery below  presently two of the planks were torn up by a sea and several bags of coal a barrel of smallbeer and a few casks containing lime and sand were all swept away  the men would certainly have shared the fate of these had they not clung to the beams until the sea had passed  as nothing remained after that which could be removed to the room above they left the mortargallery to its fate and returned to the kitchen where they were met by the anxious glances and questions of their comrades  the fire meanwhile could scarcely be got to burn and the whole place was full of smoke besides being wet with the sprays that burst over the roof and found out all the crevices that had not been sufficiently stopped up  attending to these leaks occupied most of the men at intervals during the night  ruby and his friend the smith spent much of the time in the doorway contemplating the gradual destruction of their workshop  for some time the gale remained steady and the anxiety of the men began to subside a little as they became accustomed to the ugly twisting of the great beams and found that no evil consequences followed  in the midst of this confusion poor forsyths anxiety of mind became as nothing compared with the agony of his toothache  bremner had already made several attempts to persuade the miserable man to have it drawn but without success  i could do it quite easy said he only let me get a hold of it an before you could wink id have it out  well you may try cried forsyth in desperation with a face of ashy paleness  it was an awful situation truly  in danger of his life suffering the agonies of toothache and with the prospect of torments unbearable from an inexpert hand for forsyth did not believe in bremners boasted powers  whatll you do it with he enquired meekly  jamie doves small pincers  here they are said bremner moving about actively in his preparations as if he enjoyed such work uncommonly  by this time the men had assembled round the pair and almost forgot the storm in the interest of the moment  hold him two of you said bremner when his victim was seated submissively on a cask  you dont need to hold me said forsyth in a gentle tone  dont we said bremner  here dove ned grip his arms and some of you stand by to catch his legs but you neednt touch them unless he kicks  ruby youre a strong fellow hold his head  the men obeyed  at that moment forsyth would have parted with his dearest hopes in life to have escaped and the toothache strange to say left him entirely but he was a plucky fellow at bottom having agreed to have it done he would not draw back  bremner introduced the pincers slowly being anxious to get a good hold of the tooth  forsyth uttered a groan in anticipation  alarmed lest he should struggle too soon bremner made a sudden grasp and caught the tooth  a wrench followed a yell was the result and the pincers slipped  this was fortunate for he had caught the wrong tooth  now be aisy boy said ned oconnor whose sympathies were easily roused  once more said bremner as the unhappy man opened his mouth  be still and it will be all the sooner over  again bremner inserted the instrument and fortunately caught the right tooth  he gave a terrible tug that produced its corresponding howl but the tooth held on  again again again and the beacon house resounded with the deadly yells of the unhappy man who struggled violently despite the strength of those who held him  och poor sowl ejaculated oconnor  bremner threw all his strength into a final wrench which tore away the pincers and left the tooth as firm as ever  forsyth leaped up and dashed his comrades right and left  thatll do he roared and darted up the ladder into the apartment above through which he ascended to the barrackroom and flung himself on his bed  at the same time a wave burst on the beacon with such force that every man there except forsyth thought it would be carried away the wave not only sprang up against the house but the spray scarcely less solid than the wave went quite over it and sent down showers of water on the men below  little cared forsyth for that  he lay almost stunned on his couch quite regardless of the storm  to his surprise however the toothache did not return  nay to make a long story short it never again returned to that tooth till the end of his days  the storm now blew its fiercest and the men sat in silence in the kitchen listening to the turmoil and to the thundering blows given by the sea to their wooden house  suddenly the beacon received a shock so awful and so thoroughly different from any that it had previously received that the men sprang to their feet in consternation  ruby and the smith were looking out at the doorway at the time and both instinctively grasped the woodwork near them expecting every instant that the whole structure would be carried away but it stood fast  they speculated a good deal on the force of the blow they had received but no one hit on the true cause and it was not until some days later that they discovered that a huge rock of fully a ton weight had been washed against the beams that night  while they were gazing at the wild storm a wave broke up the mortargallery altogether and sent its remaining contents into the sea all disappeared in a moment nothing was left save the powerful beams to which the platform had been nailed  there was a small boat attached to the beacon  it hung from two davits on a level with the kitchen about thirty feet above the rock  this had got filled by the sprays and the weight of water proving too much for the tackling it gave way at the bow shortly after the destruction of the mortargallery and the boat hung suspended by the sterntackle here it swung for a few minutes and then was carried away by a sea the same sea sent an eddy of foam round towards the door and drenched the kitchen so that the door had to be shut and as the fire had gone out the men had to sit and await their fate by the light of a little oillamp  they sat in silence for the noise was now so great that it was difficult to hear voices unless when they were raised to a high pitch  thus passed that terrible night and the looks of the men the solemn glances the closed eyes the silently moving lips showed that their thoughts were busy reviewing bygone days and deeds perchance in making good resolutions for the futureif spared  morning brought a change  the rush of the sea was indeed still tremendous but the force of the gale was broken and the danger was past    chapter twenty four  a chapter of accidents  time rolled on and the lighthouse at length began to grow  it did not rise slowly as does an ordinary building  the courses of masonry having been formed and fitted on shore during the winter had only to be removed from the workyard at arbroath to the rock where they were laid mortared wedged and trenailed as fast as they could be landed  thus foot by foot it grew and soon began to tower above its foundation  from the foundation upwards for thirty feet it was built solid  from this point rose the spiral staircase leading to the rooms above  we cannot afford space to trace its erection step by step neither is it desirable that we should do so  but it is proper to mention that there were as might be supposed leading points in the processeras as it were in the building operations  the first of these of course was the laying of the foundation stone which was done ceremoniously with all the honours  the next point was the occasion when the tower showed itself for the first time above water at full tide  this was a great event  it was proof positive that the sea had been conquered for many a time before that event happened had the sea done its best to level the whole erection with the rock  three cheers announced and celebrated the fact and a glass all round stamped it on the memories of the men  another noteworthy point was the connexionthe marriage if the simile may be allowedof the tower and the beacon  this occurred when the former rose to a few feet above highwater mark and was effected by means of a ropebridge which was dignified by the sailors with the name of jacobs ladder  heretofore the beacon and lighthouse had stood in close relation to each other  they were thenceforward united by a stronger tie and it is worthy of record that their attachment lasted until the destruction of the beacon after the work was done  jacobs ladder was fastened a little below the doorway of the beacon  its other end rested on and rose with the wall of the tower  at first it sloped downward from beacon to tower gradually it became horizontal then it sloped upward when this happened it was removed and replaced by a regular wooden bridge which extended from the doorway of the one structure to that of the other  along this way the men could pass to and fro at all tides and during any time of the day or night  this was a matter of great importance as the men were no longer so dependent on tides as they had been and could often work as long as their strength held out  although the work was regular and as some might imagine rather monotonous there were not wanting accidents and incidents to enliven the routine of daily duty  the landing of the boats in rough weather with stones etcetera was a neverfailing source of anxiety alarm and occasionally amusement  strangers sometimes visited the rock too but these visits were few and far between  accidents were much less frequent however than might have been expected in a work of the kind  it was quite an event something to talk about for days afterwards when poor john bonnyman one of the masons lost a finger  the balance crane was the cause of this accident  we may remark in passing that this balance crane was a very peculiar and clever contrivance which deserves a little notice  it may not have occurred to readers who are unacquainted with mechanics that the raising of ponderous stones to a great height is not an easy matter  as long as the lighthouse was low cranes were easily raised on the rock but when it became too high for the cranes to reach their heads up to the top of the tower what was to be done  blocktackles could not be fastened to the skies  scaffolding in such a situation would not have survived a moderate gale  in these circumstances mr stevenson constructed a balance crane which was fixed in the centre of the tower and so arranged that it could be raised along with the rising works  this crane resembled a cross in form  at one arm was hung a movable weight which could be run out to its extremity or fixed at any part of it  the other arm was the one by means of which the stones were hoisted  when a stone had to be raised its weight was ascertained and the movable weight was so fixed as exactly to counterbalance it  by this simple contrivance all the cumbrous and troublesome machinery of long guys and bracingchains extending from the crane to the rock below were avoided  well bonnyman was attending to the working of the crane and directing the lowering of a stone into its place when he inadvertently laid his left hand on a part of the machinery where it was brought into contact with the chain which passed over his forefinger and cut it so nearly off that it was left hanging by a mere shred of skin  the poor man was at once sent off in a fast rowing boat to arbroath where the finger was removed and properly dressed  see note 1  a much more serious accident occurred at another time however which resulted in the death of one of the seamen belonging to the smeaton  it happened thus  the smeaton had been sent from arbroath with a cargo of stones one morning and reached the rock about halfpast six oclock am  the mate and one of the men james scott a youth of eighteen years of age got into the sloops boat to make fast the hawser to the floating buoy of her moorings  the tides at the time were very strong and the mooringchain when sweeping the ground had caught hold of a rock or piece of wreck by which the chain was so shortened that when the tide flowed the buoy got almost under water and little more than the ring appeared at the surface  when the mate and scott were in the act of making the hawser fast to the ring the chain got suddenly disentangled at the bottom and the large buoy measuring about seven feet in length by three in diameter in the middle vaulted upwards with such force that it upset the boat which instantly filled with water  the mate with great difficulty succeeded in getting hold of the gunwale but scott seemed to have been stunned by the buoy for he lay motionless for a few minutes on the water apparently unable to make any exertion to save himself for he did not attempt to lay hold of the oars or thwarts which floated near him  a boat was at once sent to the rescue and the mate was picked up but scott sank before it reached the spot  this poor lad was a great favourite in the service and for a time his melancholy end cast a gloom over the little community at the bell rock the circumstances of the case were also peculiarly distressing in reference to the boys mother for her husband had been for three years past confined in a french prison and her son had been the chief support of the family  in order in some measure to make up to the poor woman for the loss of the monthly aliment regularly allowed her by her lost son it was suggested that a younger brother of the deceased might be taken into the service  this appeared to be a rather delicate proposition but it was left to the landingmaster to arrange according to circumstances  such was the resignation and at the same time the spirit of the poor woman that she readily accepted the proposal and in a few days the younger scott was actually afloat in the place of his brother  on this distressing case being represented to the board the commissioners granted an annuity of 5 pounds to the lads mother  the painter who represents only the sunny side of nature portrays a onesided and therefore a false view of things for as everyone knows nature is not all sunshine  so if an author makes his penandink pictures represent only the amusing and picturesque view of things he does injustice to his subject  we have no pleasure good reader in saddening you by accounts of fatal accidents but we have sought to convey to you a correct impression of things and scenes and incidents at the building of the bell rock lighthouse as they actually were and looked and occurred  although there was much very much of risk exposure danger and trial connected with the erection of that building there was in the good providence of god very little of severe accident or death  yet that little must be toldat least touched uponelse will our picture remain incomplete as well as untrue  now do not imagine with a shudder that these remarks are the prelude to something that will harrow up your feelings  not so  they are merely the apology if apology be needed for the introduction of another accident  well then  one morning the artificers landed on the rock at a quarterpast six and as all hands were required for a piece of special work that day they breakfasted on the beacon instead of returning to the tender and spent the day on the rock  the special work referred to was the raising of the crane from the eighth to the ninth coursean operation which required all the strength that could be mustered for working the guytackles  this be it remarked was before the balance crane already described had been set up and as the top of the crane stood at the time about thirtyfive feet above the rock it became much more unmanageable than heretofore  at the proper hour all hands were called and detailed to their several posts on the tower and about the rock  in order to give additional purchase or power in tightening the tackle one of the blocks of stone was suspended at the end of the movable beam of the crane which by adding greatly to the weight tended to slacken the guys or supportingropes in the direction to which the beam with the stone was pointed and thereby enabled the men more easily to brace them one after another  while the beam was thus loaded and in the act of swinging round from one guy to another a great strain was suddenly brought upon the opposite tackle with the end of which the men had very improperly neglected to take a turn round some stationary object which would have given them the complete command of the tackle  owing to this simple omission the crane with the large stone at the end of the beam got a preponderancy to one side and the tackle alluded to having rent it fell upon the building with a terrible crash  the men fled right and left to get out of its way but one of them michael wishart a mason stumbled over an uncut trenail and rolled on his back and the ponderous crane fell upon him  fortunately it fell so that his body lay between the great shaft and the movable beam and thus he escaped with his life but his feet were entangled with the wheelwork and severely injured  wishart was a robust and spirited young fellow and bore his sufferings with wonderful firmness while he was being removed  he was laid upon one of the narrow framebeds of the beacon and despatched in a boat to the tender  on seeing the boat approach with the poor man stretched on a bed covered with blankets and his face overspread with that deadly pallor which is the usual consequence of excessive bleeding the seamens looks betrayed the presence of those wellknown but indescribable sensations which one experiences when brought suddenly into contact with something horrible  relief was at once experienced however when wisharts voice was heard feebly accosting those who first stepped into the boat  he was immediately sent on shore where the best surgical advice was obtained and he began to recover steadily though slowly  meanwhile having been one of the principal masons robert selkirk was appointed to his vacant post  and now let us wind up this chapter of accidents with an account of the manner in which a party of strangers to use a slang but expressive phrase came to grief during a visit to the bell rock  one morning a trim little vessel was seen by the workmen making for the rock at low tide  from its build and size ruby at once judged it to be a pleasure yacht  perchance some delicate shades in the seamanship displayed in managing the little vessel had influenced the sailor in forming his opinion  be this as it may the vessel brought up under the lee of the rock and cast anchor  it turned out to be a party of gentlemen from leith who had run down the firth to see the works  the weather was fine and the sea calm but these yachters had yet to learn that fine weather and a calm sea do not necessarily imply easy or safe landing at the bell rock  they did not know that the swell which had succeeded a recent gale was heavier than it appeared to be at a distance and worst of all they did not know or they did not care to remember that there is a time for all things and that the time for landing at the bell rock is limited  seeing that the place was covered with workmen the strangers lowered their little boat and rowed towards them  theyre mad said logan who with a group of the men watched the motions of their wouldbe visitors  no observed joe dumsby they are brave but hignorant  faix they wont be ignorant long cried ned oconnor as the little boat approached the rock propelled by two active young rowers in guernsey shirts white trousers and straw hats  youre stout lads both of ye an purty good hands at the oar for gintlemen but av ye wos as strong as samson it would puzzle ye to stem these breakers so ye better go back  the yachters did not hear the advice and they would not have taken it if they had heard it  they rowed straight up towards the landingplace and so far showed themselves expert selectors of the right channel but they soon came within the influence of the seas which burst on the rock and sent up jets of spray to leeward  these jets had seemed very pretty and harmless when viewed from the deck of the yacht but they were found on a nearer approach to be quite able and we might almost add not unwilling to toss up the boat like a ball and throw it and its occupants head over heels into the air  but the rowers like most men of their class were not easily cowed they watched their opportunityallowed the waves to meet and rush on and then pulled into the midst of the foam in the hope of crossing to the shelter of the rock before the approach of the next wave  heedless of a warning cry from ned oconnor whose anxiety began to make him very uneasy the amateur sailors strained every nerve to pull through while their companion who sat at the helm in the stern of the boat seemed to urge them on to redoubled exertions  of course their efforts were in vain  the next billow caught the boat on its foaming crest and raised it high in the air  for one moment the wave rose between the boat and the men on the rock and hid her from view causing ned to exclaim with a genuine groan arrah theys gone  but they were not the boats head had been carefully kept to the sea and although she had been swept back a considerable way and nearly halffilled with water she was still afloat  the chief engineer now hailed the gentlemen and advised them to return and remain on board their vessel until the state of the tide would permit him to send a proper boat for them  in the meantime however a large boat from the floating light pretty deeply laden with lime cement and sand approached when the strangers with a view to avoid giving trouble took their passage in her to the rock  the accession of three passengers to a boat already in a lumbered state put her completely out of trim and as it unluckily happened the man who steered her on this occasion was not in the habit of attending the rock and was not sufficiently aware of the run of the sea at the entrance of the eastern creek  instead therefore of keeping close to the small rock called johnny gray he gave it as ruby expressed it a wide berth  a heavy sea struck the boat drove her to leeward and the oars getting entangled among the rocks and seaweed she became unmanageable  the next sea threw her on a ledge and instantly leaving her she canted seaward upon her gunwale throwing her crew and part of her cargo into the water  all this was the work of a few seconds  the men had scarce time to realise their danger ere they found themselves down under the water and when they rose gasping to the surface it was to behold the next wave towering over them ready to fall on their heads  when it fell it scattered crew cargo and boat in all directions  some clung to the gunwale of the boat others to the seaweed and some to the thwarts and oars which floated about and which quickly carried them out of the creek to a considerable distance from the spot where the accident happened  the instant the boat was overturned ruby darted towards one of the rock boats which lay near to the spot where the party of workmen who manned it had landed that morning  wilson the landingmaster was at his side in a moment  shove off lad and jump in cried wilson  there was no need to shout for the crew of the boat  the men were already springing into her as she floated off  in a few minutes all the men in the water were rescued with the exception of one of the strangers named strachan  this gentleman had been swept out to a small insulated rock where he clung to the seaweed with great resolution although each returning sea laid him completely under water and hid him for a second or two from the spectators on the rock  in this situation he remained for ten or twelve minutes and those who know anything of the force of large waves will understand how severely his strength and courage must have been tried during that time  when the boat reached the rock the most difficult part was still to perform as it required the greatest nicety of management to guide her in a rolling sea so as to prevent her from being carried forcibly against the man whom they sought to save  take the steeringoar ruby you are the best hand at this said wilson  ruby seized the oar and notwithstanding the breach of the seas and the narrowness of the passage steered the boat close to the rock at the proper moment  starboard noo stiddy shouted john watt who leant suddenly over the bow of the boat and seized poor strachan by the hair  in another moment he was pulled inboard with the aid of selkirks stout arms and the boat was backed out of danger  now a cheer boys cried ruby  the men did not require urging to this  it burst from them with tremendous energy and was echoed back by their comrades on the rock in the midst of whose wild hurrah ned oconnors voice was distinctly heard to swell from a cheer into a yell of triumph  the little rock on which this incident occurred was called strachans ledge and it is known by that name at the present day    note 1  it is right to state that this man afterwards obtained a lightkeepers situation from the board of commissioners of northern lights who seem to have taken a kindly interest in all their servants especially those of them who had suffered in the service    chapter twenty five  the bell rock in a fognarrow escape of the smeaton  change of scene is necessary to the healthful working of the human mind at least so it is said  acting upon the assumption that the saying is true we will do our best in this chapter for the human minds that condescend to peruse these pages by leaping over a space of time and by changing at least the character of the scene if not the locality  we present the bell rock under a new aspect that of a dense fog and a dead calm  this is by no means an unusual aspect of things at the bell rock but as we have hitherto dwelt chiefly on storms it may be regarded as new to the reader  it was a june morning  there had been few breezes and no storms for some weeks past so that the usual swell of the ocean had gone down and there were actually no breakers on the rock at low water and no ruffling of the surface at all at high tide  the tide had about two hours before overflowed the rock and driven the men into the beacon house where having breakfasted they were at the time enjoying themselves with pipes and small talk  the lighthouse had grown considerably by this time  its unfinished top was more than eighty feet above the foundation but the fog was so dense that only the lower part of the column could be seen from the beacon the summit being lost as it were in the clouds  nevertheless that summit high though it was did not yet project beyond the reach of the sea  a proof of this had been given in a very striking manner some weeks before the period about which we now write to our friend george forsyth  george was a studious man and fond of reading the bible critically  he was proof against laughter and ridicule and was wont sometimes to urge the men into discussions  one of his favourite arguments was somewhat as follows  boys he was wont to say you laugh at me for readin the bible carefully  you would not laugh at a schoolboy for reading his books carefully would you  yet the learnin of the way of salvation is of far more consequence to me than book learnin is to a schoolboy  an astronomer is never laughed at for readin his books o geometry an suchlike day an nighteven to the injury of his healthbut what is an astronomers business to him compared with the concerns of my soul to me  ministers tell me there are certain things i must know and believe if i would be savedsuch as the death and resurrection of our saviour jesus christ and they also point out that the bible speaks of certain christians who did well in refusin to receive the gospel at the hands of the apostles without first enquirin into these things to see if they were true  now lads if these things that so many millions believe in and that you all profess to believe in are lies then you may well laugh at me for enquirin into them but if they be true why i think the devils themselves must be laughing at you for not enquirin into them  of course forsyth found among such a number of intelligent men some who could argue with him as well as some who could laugh at him  he also found one or two who sympathised openly while there were a few who agreed in their hearts although they did not speak  well it was this tendency to study on the part of forsyth that led him to cross the wooden bridge between the beacon and the lighthouse during his leisure hours and sit reading at the top of the spiral stair near one of the windows of the lowest room  forsyth was sitting at his usual window one afternoon at the end of a storm  it was a comfortless place for neither sashes nor glass had at that time been put in and the wind howled up and down the shaft dreadfully  the man was robust however and did not mind that  the height of the building was at that time fully eighty feet  while he was reading there a tremendous breaker struck the lighthouse with such force that it trembled distinctly  forsyth started up for he had never felt this before and fancied the structure was about to fall  for a moment or two he remained paralysed for he heard the most terrible and inexplicable sounds going on overhead  in fact the wave that shook the building had sent a huge volume of spray right over the top part of which fell into the lighthouse and what poor forsyth heard was about a ton of water coming down through storey after storey carrying lime mortar buckets trowels and a host of other things violently along with it  to plunge down the spiral stair almost headforemost was the work of a few seconds  forsyth accompanied the descent with a yell of terror which reached the ears of his comrades in the beacon and brought them to the door just in time to see their comrades long legs carry him across the bridge in two bounds  almost at the same instant the water and rubbish burst out of the doorway of the lighthouse and flooded the bridge  but let us return from this digression or rather this series of digressions to the point where we branched off the aspect of the beacon in the fog and the calm of that still morning in june  some of the men inside were playing draughts others were finishing their breakfast one was playing auld lang syne with many extempore flourishes and trills on a flute which was very much out of tune  a few were smoking of course where exists the band of britons who can get on without that and several were sitting astride on the crossbeams below bobbingnot exactly for whales but for any monster of the deep that chose to turn up  the men fishing and the beacon itself loomed large and mysterious in the halfluminous fog  perhaps this was the reason that the seagulls flew so near them and gave forth an occasional and very melancholy cry as if of complaint at the changed appearance of things  theres naethin to be got the day said john watt rather peevishly as he pulled up his line and found the bait gone  baits are always found gone when lines are pulled up  this would seem to be an angling law of nature  at all events it would seem to have been a very aggravating law of nature on the present occasion for john watt frowned and growled to himself as he put on another bait  theres a bite exclaimed joe dumsby with a look of doubt at the same time feeling his line  pood in then said watt ironically  no es hoff observed joe  hm he never was on muttered watt  what are you two growling at said ruby who sat on one of the beams at the other side  at our luck ruby said joe  ha was that a nibble  naethin o the kind from watt it was as i live its large an addock i think  a naddock sneered watt mair like a bit o tangle thaneh losh me it is a fish  well done joe cried bremner from the doorway above as a large rockcod was drawn to the surface of the water  stay its too large to pull up with the line  ill run down and gaff it cried ruby fastening his own line to the beam and descending to the water by the usual ladder on one of the main beams  now draw him this waygently not too roughlytake time  ah that was a misshes off no  again now then  another moment and a goodly cod of about ten pounds weight was wriggling on the iron hook which ruby handed up to dumsby who mounted with his prize in triumph to the kitchen  from that moment the fish began to take  while the men were thus busily engaged a boat was rowing about in the fog vainly endeavouring to find the rock  it was the boat of two fast friends jock swankie and davy spink  these worthies were in a rather exhausted condition having been rowing almost incessantly from daybreak  i tell ee what it is said swankie ill be hanged if i poo another stroke  he threw his oar into the boat and looked sulky  its my belief said his companion that we ought to be near aboot denmark be this time  denmark or rooshia its a ane to me rejoined swankie ill hae a smoke  so saying he pulled out his pipe and tobaccobox and began to cut the tobacco  davy did the same  suddenly both men paused for they heard a sound  each looked enquiringly at the other and then both gazed into the thick fog  is that a ship said davy spink  they seized their oars hastily  the beacon as im a leevin sinner exclaimed swankie  if spink had not backed his oar at that moment there is some probability that swankie would have been a dead instead of a living sinner in a few minutes for they had almost run upon the northeast end of the bell rock and distinctly heard the sound of voices on the beacon  a shout settled the question at once for it was replied to by a loud holloa from ruby  in a short time the boat was close to the beacon and the water was so very calm that day that they were able to venture to hand the packet of letters with which they had come off into the beacon even although the tide was full  letters said swankie as he reached out his hand with the packet  hurrah cried the men who were all assembled on the mortargallery looking down at the fishermen excepting ruby watt and dumsby who were still on the crossbeams below  mind the boat keep her aff said swankie stretching out his hand with the packet to the utmost while dumsby descended the ladder and held out his hand to receive it  take care cried the men in chorus for news from shore was always a very exciting episode in their career and the idea of the packet being lost filled them with sudden alarm  the shout and the anxiety together caused the very result that was dreaded  the packet fell into the sea and sank amid a volley of yells  it went down slowly  before it had descended a fathom rubys head cleft the water and in a moment he returned to the surface with the packet in his hand amid a wild cheer of joy but this was turned into a cry of alarm as ruby was carried away by the tide despite his utmost efforts to regain the beacon  the boat was at once pushed off but so strong was the current there that ruby was carried past the rock and a hundred yards away to sea before the boat overtook him  the moment he was pulled into her he shook himself and then tore off the outer covering of the packet in order to save the letters from being wetted  he had the great satisfaction of finding them almost uninjured he had the greater satisfaction thereafter of feeling that he had done a deed which induced every man in the beacon that night to thank him half a dozen times over and he had the greatest possible satisfaction in finding that among the rest he had saved two letters addressed to himself one from minnie gray and the other from his uncle  the scene in the beacon when the contents of the packet were delivered was interesting  those who had letters devoured them and in many cases read them unwittingly halfaloud  those who had none read the newspapers and those who had neither papers nor letters listened  rubys letter ran as follows we say his letter because the other letter was regarded comparatively as nothing    arbroath etcetera    darling rubyi have just time to tell you that we have made a   discovery which will surprise you  let me detail it to you   circumstantially  uncle ogilvy and i were walking on the pier a few   days ago when we overheard a conversation between two sailors who   did not see that we were approaching  we would not have stopped to   listen but the words we heard arrested our attention soo what a   pity there big swankie has come for our letters  is it not strange   that he should be the man to take them off  i meant to have given   you such an account of it especially a description of the case   they wont wait  come ashore as soon as you can dearest ruby  the letter broke off here abruptly  it was evident that the writer had been obliged to close it abruptly for she had forgotten to sign her name  a description of the case what case muttered ruby in vexation o minnie minnie in your anxiety to go into details you have omitted to give me the barest outline  well well darling ill just take the will for the deed but i wish you had  here ruby ceased to mutter for captain ogilvys letter suddenly occurred to his mind  opening it hastily he read as follows    dear neffyi never was much of a hand at spellin an im not   rightly sure o that word howsever it reads all square so ittle do   if i had been the inventer o writin id have had signs for a lot o   words  just think how much better it would ha bin to have put a   regular d like that instead o writin square  then round   would have bin far better o like that  an crooked thus draws a   squiggly line see how significant an suggestive if i may say so   no humbugall fair an aboveboard as the pirate said when he ran   up the black flag to the peak    but avast speckillatin shiver my timbers but that last was a   pensplitter thats not what i sat down to write about  my object   in takin up the pen neffy is twofold    double double toil an trouble    as macbeath saidif it wasnt hamlet    we want you to come home for a day or two if you can git leave lad   about this strange affair  minnie said she was goin to give you a   full true and partikler account of it so its of no use my goin   over the same course  theres that blackguard swankie come for the   letters  ha it makes me chuckle  no time for more  this letter also concluded abruptly and without a signature  theres a pretty kettle o fish exclaimed ruby aloud  so tis lad so tis said bremner who at that moment had placed a superb pot of codlings on the fire though why ye should say it so positively when nobodys denyin it is more nor i can tell  ruby laughed and retired to the mortargallery to work at the forge and ponder  he always found that he pondered best while employed in hammering especially if his feelings were ruffled  seizing a mass of metal he laid it on the anvil and gave it five or six heavy blows to straighten it a little before thrusting it into the fire  strange to say these few blows of the hammer were the means in all probability of saving the sloop smeaton from being wrecked on the bell rock  that vessel had been away with mr stevenson at leith and was returning when she was overtaken by the calm and the fog  at the moment that ruby began to hammer the smeaton was within a stones cast of the beacon running gently before a light air which had sprung up  no one on board had the least idea that the tide had swept them so near the rock and the ringing of the anvil was the first warning they got of their danger  the lookout on board instantly sang out starboard harrrd beacon ahead and ruby looked up in surprise just as the smeaton emerged like a phantomship out of the fog  her sails fluttered as she came up to the wind and the crew were seen hurrying to and fro in much alarm  mr stevenson himself stood on the quarterdeck of the little vessel and waved his hand to assure those on the beacon that they had sheered off in time and were safe  this incident tended to strengthen the engineer in his opinion that the two large bells which were being cast for the lighthouse to be rung by the machinery of the revolving light would be of great utility in foggy weather  while the smeaton was turning away as if with a graceful bow to the men on the rock ruby shouted  there are letters here for you sir  the mate of the vessel called out at once send them off in the shoreboat well layto  no time was to be lost for if the smeaton should get involved in the fog it might be very difficult to find her so ruby at once ran for the letters and hailing the shoreboat which lay quite close at hand jumped into it and pushed off  they boarded the smeaton without difficulty and delivered the letters  instead of returning to the beacon however ruby was ordered to hold himself in readiness to go to arbroath in the shoreboat with a letter from mr stevenson to the superintendent of the workyard  you can go up and see your friends in the town if you choose said the engineer but be sure to return by tomorrows forenoon tide  we cannot dispense with your services longer than a few hours my lad so i shall expect you to make no unnecessary delay  you may depend upon me sir said ruby touching his cap as he turned away and leaped into the boat  a light breeze was now blowing so that the sails could be used  in less than a quarter of an hour sloop and beacon were lost in the fog and ruby steered for the harbour of arbroath overjoyed at this unexpected and happy turn of events which gave him an opportunity of solving the mystery of the letters and of once more seeing the sweet face of minnie gray  but an incident occurred which delayed these desirable ends and utterly changed the current of rubys fortunes for a time    chapter twenty six  a sudden and tremendous change in rubys fortunes  what a variety of appropriate aphorisms there are to express the great truths of human experience  there is many a slip twixt the cup and the lip is one of them  undoubtedly there is  so is there many a miss of a sweet little kiss  the course of true love also never did run smooth  certainly not  why should it  if it did we should doubt whether the love were true  our own private belief is that the course of true love is always uncommonly rough but collective human wisdom has seen fit to put the idea in the negative form  so let it stand  ruby had occasion to reflect on these things that day but the reflection afforded him no comfort whatever  the cause of his inconsolable state of mind is easily explained  the boat had proceeded about halfway to arbroath when they heard the sound of oars and in a few seconds a ships gig rowed out of the fog towards them  instead of passing them the gig was steered straight for the boat and ruby saw that it was full of menofwars men  he sprang up at once and seized an oar  out oars he cried  boys if ever you pulled hard in your lives do so now  its the pressgang  before those few words were uttered the two men had seized the oars for they knew well what the pressgang meant and all three pulled with such vigour that the boat shot over the smooth sea with double speed  but they had no chance in a heavy fishing boat against the picked crew of the light gig  if the wind had been a little stronger they might have escaped but the wind had decreased and the small boat overhauled them yard by yard  seeing that they had no chance ruby said between his set teeth  will ye fight boys  i will cried davy spink sternly for davy had a wife and little daughter on shore who depended entirely on his exertions for their livelihood so he had a strong objection to go and fight in the wars of his country  whats the use muttered big swankie with a savage scowl  he too had a strong disinclination to serve in the royal navy being a lazy man and not overburdened with courage  theyve got eight men of a crew wi pistols an cutlashes  well its all up with us cried ruby in a tone of sulky anger as he tossed his oar overboard and folding his arms on his breast sat sternly eyeing the gig as it approached  suddenly a beam of hope shot into his heart  a few words will explain the cause thereof  about the time the works at the bell rock were in progress the war with france and the northern powers was at its height and the demand for men was so great that orders were issued for the establishment of an impress service at dundee arbroath and aberdeen  it became therefore necessary to have some protection for the men engaged in the works  as the impress officers were extremely rigid in the execution of their duty it was resolved to have the seamen carefully identified and therefore besides being described in the usual manner in the protectionbills granted by the admiralty each man had a ticket given to him descriptive of his person to which was attached a silver medal emblematical of the lighthouse service  that very week ruby had received one of the protectionmedals and tickets of the bell rock a circumstance which he had forgotten at the moment  it was now in his pocket and might perhaps save him  when the boat ranged up alongside ruby recognised in the officer at the helm the youth who had already given him so much annoyance  the officer also recognised ruby and with a glance of surprise and pleasure exclaimed  what have i bagged you at last my slippery young lion  ruby smiled as he replied not quite yet my persevering young jackall  he was sorely tempted to transpose the word into jackass but he wisely restrained himself im not so easily caught as you think  eh how what mean you exclaimed the officer with an expression of surprise for he knew that ruby was now in his power  i have you safe my lad unless you have provided yourself with a pair of wings  of course i shall leave one of you to take your boat into harbour but you may be sure that ill not devolve that pleasant duty upon you  i have not provided myself with wings exactly returned ruby pulling out his medal and ticket but here is something that will do quite as well  the officers countenance fell for he knew at once what it was  he inspected it however closely  let me see said he reading the description on the ticket which ran thus    bell rock workyard arbroath    20th june 1810    ruby brand seaman and blacksmith in the service of the honourable   the commissioners of the northern lighthouses aged 25 years 5   feet 10 inches high very powerfully made fair complexion   straight nose darkblue eyes and curling auburn hair  this description was signed by the engineer of the works and on the obverse was written the bearer ruby brand is serving as a blacksmith in the erection of the bell rock lighthouse  this is all very well my fine fellow said the officer but i have been deceived more than once with these medals and tickets  how am i to know that you have not stolen it from someone  by seeing whether the description agrees replied ruby  of course i know that as well as you and i dont find the description quite perfect  i would say that your hair is lightbrown now not auburn and your nose is a little roman if anything and theres no mention of whiskers or that delicate moustache  why look here he added turning abruptly to big swankie this might be the description of your comrade as well as if not better than yours  whats your name  swankie sir said that individual ruefully yet with a gleam of hope that the advantages of the bell rock medal might possibly in some unaccountable way accrue to himself for he was sharp enough to see that the officer would be only too glad to find any excuse for securing ruby  well swankie stand up and lets have a look at you said the officer glancing from the paper to the person of the fisherman and commenting thereon  here we have very powerfully madeno mistake about thatstrong as samson fair complexionthats it exactly auburn hairso it is  auburn is a very undecided colour theres a great deal of red in it and no one can deny that swankie has a good deal of red in his hair  there was indeed no denying this for it was altogether red of an intense carroty hue  you see friend continued the officer turning to ruby that the description suits swankie very well  true as far as you have gone said ruby with a quiet smile but swankie is six feet two in his stockings and his nose is turned up and his hair dont curl and his eyes are lightgreen and his complexion is sallow if i may not say yellow  fair lad fair said the officer laughing in spite of himself  ah ruby brand you are jealous of him  well i see that im fated not to capture you so ill bid you good day  meanwhile your companions will be so good as to step into my gig  the two men rose to obey  big swankie stepped over the gunwale with the fling of a sulky reckless man who curses his fate and submits to it  davy spink had a very crestfallen subdued look  he was about to follow when a thought seemed to strike him  he turned hastily round and ruby was surprised to see that his eyes were suffused with tears and that his features worked with the convulsive twitching of one who struggles powerfully to restrain his feelings  ruby brand said he in a deep husky voice which trembled at first but became strong as he went on ruby brand i deserve nae good at your hands yet ill ask a favour o ye  yeve seen the wife and the bairn the wee ane wi the fair curly pow  ye ken the auld hoose  itll be mony a lang day afore i see them again if iver i come back ava theres naebody left to care for them  theyll be starvin soon lad wull yewull ye lookdoon  poor davy spink stopped here and covered his face with his big sunburnt hands  a sudden gush of sympathy filled rubys heart  he started forward and drawing from his pocket the letter with which he was charged thrust it into spinks hand and said hurriedly  dont fail to deliver it the first thing you do on landing  and harkee spink go to mrs brands cottage and tell them there why i went away  be sure you see them all and explain why it was  tell minnie gray that i will be certain to return if god spares me  without waiting for a reply he sprang into the gig and gave the other boat a shove that sent it several yards off  give way lads cried the officer who was delighted at this unexpected change in affairs though he had only heard enough of the conversation to confuse him as to the cause of it  stop stop shouted spink tossing up his arms  id rather not returned the officer  davy seized the oars and turning his boat in the direction of the gig endeavoured to overtake it  as well might the turkeybuzzard attempt to catch the swallow  he was left far behind and when last seen faintly through the fog he was standing up in the stern of the boat wringing his hands  ruby had seated himself in the bow of the gig with his face turned steadily towards the sea so that no one could see it  this position he maintained in silence until the boat ranged up to what appeared like the side of a great mountain looming through the mist  then he turned round and whatever might have been the struggle within his breast all traces of it had left his countenance which presented its wonted appearance of goodhumoured frankness  we need scarcely say that the mountain turned out to be a british manofwar  ruby was quickly introduced to his future messmates and warmly received by them  then he was left to his own free will during the remainder of that day for the commander of the vessel was a kind man and did not like to add to the grief of the impressed men by setting them to work at once  thus did our hero enter the royal navy and many a long and weary day and month passed by before he again set foot in his native town    chapter twenty seven  other things besides murder will out  meanwhile davy spink with his heart full returned slowly to the shore  he was long of reaching it the boat being very heavy for one man to pull  on landing he hurried up to his poor little cottage which was in a very low part of the town and in a rather outoftheway corner of that part  janet said he flinging himself into a rickety old armchair that stood by the fireplace the pressgang has catched us at last and theyve took big swankie away and worse than that  oh cried janet unable to wait for more thats the best news ive heard for mony a day  yere sure they have him safe  ay sure enough said spink dryly but ye needna be sae glad aboot it for  swankie was aye good to you  ay davy cried janet putting her arm round her husbands neck and kissing him but he wasna good to you  he led ye into evil ways mony a time when ye would rather hae keepit oot o them  na na davy ye needna shake yer heed i kend fine  weel weel haed yer ain way lass but swankies awa to the wars and sos ruby brand for theyve gotten him as weel  ruby brand exclaimed the woman  ay ruby brand and this is the way they did it  here spink detailed to his helpmate who sat with folded hands and staring eyes opposite to her husband all that had happened  when he had concluded they discussed the subject together  presently the little girl came bouncing into the room with rosy cheeks sparkling eyes a dirty face and fair ringlets very much dishevelled and with a pitcher of hot soup in her hands  davy caught her up and kissing her said abruptly maggie big swankies awa to the wars  the child looked enquiringly in her fathers face and he had to repeat his words twice before she quite realised the import of them  are ye jokin daddy  no maggie its true  the pressgang got him and took him awa an i doot well never see him again  the little girls expression changed while he spoke then her lip trembled and she burst into tears  see there janet said spink pointing to maggie and looking earnestly at his wife  weelaweel replied janet somewhat softened yet with much firmness ill no deny that the man was fond o the bairn and it liked him weel enough but my certes he wad hae made a bad man o you if he could but im real sorry for ruby brand and whatll the puir lassie gray do yell hae to gang up an gie them the message  so i will but thats like somethin to eat i think  spink pointed to the soup  ay its a weve got so lets fa to and haste ye lad  its a sair heart shell hae this nightwaes me  while spink and his wife were thus employed widow brand minnie gray and captain ogilvy were seated at tea round the little table in the snug kitchen of the widows cottage  it might have been observed that there were two teapots on the table a large one and a small and that the captain helped himself out of the small one and did not take either milk or sugar  but the captains teapot did not necessarily imply tea  in fact since the death of the captains mother that small teapot had been accustomed to strong drink only  it never tasted tea  i wonder if ruby will get leave of absence said the captain throwing himself back in his armchair in order to be able to admire with greater ease the smoke as it curled towards the ceiling from his mouth and pipe  i do hope so said mrs brand looking up from her knitting with a little sigh  mrs brand usually followed up all her remarks with a little sigh  sometimes the sigh was very little  it depended a good deal on the nature of her remark whether the sigh was of the little less or least description but it never failed in one or other degree to close her every observation  i think he will said minnie as she poured a second cup of tea for the widow  ay thats right lass observed the captain theres nothin like hope    the pleasures of hope told a flatterin tale   regardin the fleet when lord nelson set sail  fill me out another cup of tea hebe  it was a pleasant little fiction with the captain to call his beverage tea  minnie filled out a small cupful of the contents of the little teapot which did indeed resemble tea but which smelt marvellously like hot rum and water  enough enough  come on macduff  ah  minnie this is prime jamaica its got such abut i forgot you dont understand nothin about nectar of this sort  the captain smoked in silence for a few minutes and then said with a sudden chuckle  wasnt it odd sister that we should have found it all out in such an easy sort o way  if criminals would always tell on themselves as plainly as big swankie did there would be no use for lawyers  swankie would not have spoken so freely said minnie with a laugh if he had known that we were listening  thats true girl said the captain with sudden gravity and i dont feel quite easy in my mind about that same eavesdropping  its a dirty thing to doespecially for an old sailor who likes everything to be fair and aboveboard but then you see the natur o the words we couldnt help hearin justified us in waitin to hear more  yes it was quite right as it turned out  a little more tea minnie  thankee lass  now go get the case and let us look over it again  the girl rose and going to a drawer quickly returned with a small red leather case in her hand  it was the identical jewelcase that swankie had found on the dead body at the bell rock  ah thats it now let us see let us see  he laid aside his pipe and for some time felt all his pockets and looked round the room as if in search of something  what are you looking for uncle  the specs lass these specsll be the death o me  minnie laughed  theyre on your brow uncle  so they are  well well  the captain smiled deprecatingly and drawing his chair close to the table began to examine the box  its contents were a strange mixture and it was evident that the case had not been made to hold them  there was a ladys gold watch of very small size and beautifully formed a set of ornaments consisting of necklace bracelets ring and earrings of turquoise and pearls set in gold of the most delicate and exquisite chasing also an antique diamond cross of great beauty besides a number of rings and bracelets of considerable value  as the captain took these out one by one and commented on them he made use of minnies pretty hand and arm to try the effect of each and truly the ornaments could not have found a more appropriate restingplace among the fairest ladies of the land  minnie submitted to be made use of in this way with a pleased and amused expression for while she greatly admired the costly gems she could not help smiling at the awkwardness of the captain in putting them on  read the paper again said minnie after the contents of the box had been examined  the captain took up a small parcel covered with oiled cloth which contained a letter  opening it he began to read but was interrupted by mrs brand who had paid little attention to the jewels  read it out loud brother said she i dont hear you well  read it out i love to hear of my darlings gallant deeds  the captain cleared his throat raised his voice and read slowly    lisbon 10th march 1808    dear captain brandi am about to quit this place for the east in a   few days and shall probably never see you again  pray accept the   accompanying case of jewels as a small token of the love and esteem in   which you are held by a heartbroken father  i feel assured that if   it had been in the power of man to have saved my drowning child your   gallant efforts would have been successful  it was ordained   otherwise and i now pray that i may be enabled to say gods will be   done  but i cannot bear the sight of these ornaments  i have no   relativesnone at least who deserve them half so well as yourself   do not pain me by refusing them  they may be of use to you if you are   ever in want of money being worth i believe between three and four   hundred pounds  of course you cannot misunderstand my motive in   mentioning this  no amount of money could in any measure represent   the gratitude i owe to the man who risked his life to save my child   may god bless you sir  the letter ended thus without signature and the captain ceased to read aloud  but there was an addition to the letter written in pencil in the hand of the late captain brand which neither he nor minnie had yet found courage to read to the poor widow  it ran thus    our doom is sealed  my schooner is on the bell rock  it is blowing   a gale from the north east and she is going to pieces fast  we are   all standing under the lee of a ledge of rocksix of us  in half an   hour the tide will be roaring over the spot  god in christ help us   it is an awful end  if this letter and box is ever found i ask the   finder to send it with my blessing to mrs brand my beloved wife   in arbroath  the writing was tremulous and the paper bore the marks of having been soiled with seaweed  it was unsigned  the writer had evidently been obliged to close it hastily  after reading this in silence the captain refolded the letter  no wonder minnie that swankie did not dare to offer such things for sale  he would certainly have been found out  wasnt it lucky that we heard him tell spink the spot under his floor where he had hidden them  at that moment there came a low knock to the door  minnie opened it and admitted davy spink who stood in the middle of the room twitching his cap nervously and glancing uneasily from one to another of the party  hallo spink cried the captain pushing his spectacles up on his forehead and gazing at the fisherman in surprise you dont seem to be quite easy in your mind  hope your fortunes have not sprung a leak  weel captain ogilvy they just have gone to the bottom i might amost say  ive come to tell yethatthe fact is that the pressgang have catched us at last and taen awa my mate jock swankie better kennd as big swankie  hemwell my lad in so far as that does damage to you im sorry for it but as regards society at large i rather think that swankie havin tripped his anchor is a decided advantage  if you lose by this in one way you gain much in another for your mates companionship did ye no good  birds of a feather should flock together  youre better apart for i believe you to be an honest man spink  davy looked at the captain in unfeigned astonishment  weel yere the first man that iver said that an i thank ee sir but youre wrang though i wush ye was right  but thats no what i cam to tell ye  here the fishermans indecision of manner returned  come make a clean breast of it lad  there are none here but friends  weel sir ruby brand  he paused and minnie turned deadly pale for she jumped at once to the right conclusion  the widow on the other hand listened for more with deep anxiety but did not guess the truth  the fact is rubys catched too an hes awa to the wars and he sent me toech sirs the auld wumans fentit  poor widow brand had indeed fallen back in her chair in a state bordering on insensibility  minnie was able to restrain her feelings so as to attend to her  she and the captain raised her gently and led her into her own room from whence the captain returned and shut the door behind him  now spink said he tell me all about it an be particlar  davy at once complied and related all that the reader already knows in a deep serious tone of voice for he felt that in the captain he had a sympathetic listener  when he had concluded captain ogilvy heaved a sigh so deep that it might have been almost considered a groan then he sat down on his armchair and pointing to the chair from which the widow had recently risen said sit down lad  as he advanced to comply spinks eyes for the first time fell on the case of jewels  he started paused and looked with a troubled air at the captain  ha exclaimed the latter with a grin you seem to know these things old acquaintances eh  it wasna me that stole them said spink hastily  i did not say that anyone stole them  weel i mean thatthat  he stopped abruptly for he felt that in whatever way he might attempt to clear himself he would unavoidably criminate by implication his absent mate  i know what you mean my lad sit down  spink sat down on the edge of the chair and looked at the other uneasily  have a cup of tea said the captain abruptly seizing the small pot and pouring out a cupful  thank eeii niver tak tea  take it tonight then  it will do you good  spink put the cup to his lips and a look of deep surprise overspread his rugged countenance as he sipped the contents  the captain nodded spinks look of surprise changed into a confidential smile he also nodded winked and drained the cup to the bottom  yes resumed the captain you mean that you did not take the case of jewels from old brands pocket on that day when you found his body on the bell rock though you were present and saw your comrade pocket the booty  you see i know all about it davy an your only fault lay in concealing the matter and in keepin company with that scoundrel  the gaze of surprise with which spink listened to the first part of this speech changed to a look of sadness towards the end of it  captain ogilvy said he in a tone of solemnity that was a strong contrast to his usual easy careless manner of speaking you cad me an honest man an ye think im clear o guilt in this matter but yere mistaen  hoo ye cam to find oot a this i canna divine but i can tell ye somethin mair than ye ken  dye see that bag  he pulled a small leather purse out of his coat pocket and laid it with a little bang on the table  the captain nodded  weel sir that was my share o the plunder thretty goolden sovereigns  we tossed which o us was to hae them an the siller fell to me  but ive niver spent a boddle ot  mony a time have i been tempit an mony a time wad i hae gien in to the temptation but for a certain lass cad janet thats been an angel its my belief sent doon frae heeven to keep me frae gawin to the deevil athegither  but be that as it may ive brought the siller to them that owns it by right an so my conscience is clear ot at lang last  the sigh of relief with which davy spink pushed the bag of gold towards his companion showed that the poor mans mind was in truth released from a heavy load that had crushed it for years  the captain who had lit his pipe stared at the fisherman through the smoke for some time in silence then he began to untie the purse and said slowly spink i said you were an honest man an i see no cause to alter my opinion  he counted out the thirty gold pieces put them back into the bag and the bag into his pocket  then he continued spink if this gold was mine i wouldbut no matter its not mine it belongs to widow brand to whom i shall deliver it up  meantime ill bid you good night  all these things require reflection  call back here tomorrow my fine fellow and ill have something to say to you  another cup of tea  weel ill no objec  davy spink rose swallowed the beverage and left the cottage  the captain returned and stood for some time irresolute with his hand on the handle of the door of his sisters room  as he listened he heard a sob and the tones of minnies voice as if in prayer  changing his mind he walked softly across the kitchen into his own room where having trimmed the candle refilled and lit his pipe he sat down at the table and resting his arms thereon began to meditate    chapter twenty eight  the lighthouse completedrubys escape from trouble by a desperate venture  there came a time at last when the great work of building the bell rock lighthouse drew to a close  four years after its commencement it was completed and on the night of the 1st of february 1811 its bright beams were shed for the first time far and wide over the sea  it must not be supposed however that this lighthouse required four years to build it  on the contrary the seasons in which work could be done were very short  during the whole of the first season of 1807 the aggregate time of lowwater work caught by snatches of an hour or two at a tide did not amount to fourteen days of ten hours while in 1808 it fell short of four weeks  a great event is worthy of very special notice  we should fail in our duty to our readers if we were to make only passing reference to this important event in the history of our country  that 1st of february 1811 was the birthday of a new era for the influence of the bell rock light on the shipping interests of the kingdom not merely of scotland by any means was far greater than people generally suppose  here is a fact that may well be weighed with attention that might be not inappropriately inscribed in diamond letters over the lintel of the lighthouse door  up to the period of the building of the lighthouse the known history of the bell rock was a black record of wreck ruin and death  its unknown history in remote ages who shall conceive much less tell  up to that period seamen dreaded the rock and shunned itay so earnestly as to meet destruction too often in their anxious efforts to avoid it  from that period the bell rock has been a friendly point a guiding starhailed as such by stormtossed marinersmarked as such on the charts of all nations  from that date not a single night for more than half a century has passed without its wakeful eye beaming on the waters or its fogbells sounding on the air and best of all not a single wreck has occurred on that rock from that period down to the present day  say not good reader that much the same may be said of all lighthouses in the first place the history of many lighthouses is by no means so happy as that of this one  in the second place all lighthouses are not of equal importance  few stand on an equal footing with the bell rock either in regard to its national importance or its actual pedestal  in the last place it is our subject of consideration at present and we object to odious comparisons while we sing its praises  whatever may be said of the other lights that guard our shores special gratitude is due to the bell rockto those who projected itto the engineer who planned and built itto god who inspired the will to dare and bestowed the skill to accomplish a work so difficult so noble so prolific of good to man    the nature of our story requires that we should occasionally annihilate time and space  let us then leap over both and return to our hero ruby brand  his period of service in the navy was comparatively brief much more so than either he or his friends anticipated  nevertheless he spent a considerable time in his new profession and having been sent to foreign stations he saw a good deal of what is called service in which he distinguished himself as might have been expected for coolness and courage  but we must omit all mention of his warlike deeds and resume the record of his history at that point which bears more immediately on the subject of our tale  it was a wild stormy night in november  rubys ship had captured a french privateer in the german ocean and a prize crew having been put aboard she was sent away to the nearest port which happened to be the harbour of leith in the firth of forth  ruby had not been appointed one of the prize crew but he resolved not to miss the chance of again seeing his native town if it should only be a distant view through a telescope  being a favourite with his commander his plea was received favourably and he was sent on board the frenchman  those who know what it is to meet with an unexpected piece of great good fortune can imagine the delight with which ruby stood at the helm on the night in question and steered for home  he was known by all on board to be the man who understood best the navigation of the forth so that implicit trust was placed in him by the young officer who had charge of the prize  the manofwar happened to be shorthanded at the time the privateer was captured owing to her boats having been sent in chase of a suspicious craft during a calm  some of the french crew were therefore left on board to assist in navigating the vessel  this was unfortunate for the officer sent in charge turned out to be a careless man and treated the frenchmen with contempt  he did not keep strict watch over them and the result was that shortly after the storm began they took the english crew by surprise and overpowered them  ruby was the first to fall  as he stood at the wheel indulging in pleasant dreams a frenchman stole up behind him and felled him with a handspike  when he recovered he found that he was firmly bound along with his comrades and that the vessel was lyingto  one of the frenchmen came forward at that moment and addressed the prisoners in broken english  now me boys said he you was see we have konker you again  you behold the sea pointing over the side well that bees your bed tonight if you no behave  now i wants to know who is best man of you as onderstand die cost  speak de trut else you die  the english lieutenant at once turned to ruby  well cast him loose de rest of you go blowgood day ver moch indeed  here the frenchman made a low bow to the english who were led below with the exception of ruby  now my goot mans you onderstand dis cost  yes  i know it well  it is dangereoux  it isvery but not so much so as it used to be before the bell rock light was shown  have you see dat light  no never  it was first lighted when i was at sea but i have seen a description of it in the newspapers and should know it well  ver goot you will try to come to dat light an den you will steer out from dis place to de open sea  afterwards we will show you to france if you try mischiefvoila  the frenchman pointed to two of his comrades who stood one on each side of the wheel with pistols in their hands ready to keep ruby in order  now cut him free  go sare do your dooty  ruby stepped to the wheel at once and glancing at the compass directed the vessels head in the direction of the bell rock  the gale was rapidly increasing and the management of the helm required his undivided attention nevertheless his mind was busy with anxious thoughts and plans of escape  he thought with horror of a french prison for there were old shipmates of his who had been captured years before and who were pining in exile still  the bare idea of being separated indefinitely perhaps for ever from minnie was so terrible that for a moment he meditated an attack singlehanded on the crew but the muzzle of a pistol on each side of him induced him to pause and reflect  reflection however only brought him again to the verge of despair  then he thought of running up to leith and so take the frenchmen prisoners but this idea was at once discarded for it was impossible to pass up to leith roads without seeing the bell rock light and the frenchmen kept a sharp lookout  then he resolved to run the vessel ashore and wreck her but the thought of his comrades down below induced him to give that plan up  under the influence of these thoughts he became inattentive and steered rather wildly once or twice  stiddy  ha you tink of how you escape  yes i do said ruby doggedly  good and have you see how  no replied ruby i tell you candidly that i can see no way of escape  ver good sare mind your helm  at that moment a bright star of the first magnitude rose on the horizon right ahead of them  ha dat is a star said the frenchman after a few moments observation of it  stars dont go out replied ruby as the light in question disappeared  it is de lightouse den  i dont know said ruby but we shall soon see  just then a thought flashed into rubys mind  his heart beat quick his eye dilated and his lip was tightly compressed as it came and went almost at the same moment another star rose right ahead of them  it was of a deep red colour and rubys heart beat high again for he was now certain that it was the revolving light of the bell rock which shows a white and red light alternately every two minutes  voila that must be him now exclaimed the frenchman pointing to the light and looking enquiringly at ruby  i have told you said the latter that i never saw the light before i believe it to be the bell rock light but it would be as well to run close and see  i think i could tell the very stones of the tower even in a dark night  anyhow i know the rock itself too well to mistake it  be there plenty watter  ay on the east side close to the rock there is enough water to float the biggest ship in your navy  good we shall go close  there was a slight lull in the gale at this time and the clouds broke a little allowing occasional glimpses of moonlight to break through and tinge the foaming crests of the waves  at last the light that had at first looked like a bright star soon increased and appeared like a glorious sun in the stormy sky  for a few seconds it shone intensely white and strong then it slowly died away and disappeared but almost before one could have time to wonder what had become of it it returned in the form of a brilliant red sun which also shone for a few seconds steadily and then like the former slowly died out  thus alternating the red and white suns went round  in a few minutes the tall and graceful column itself became visible looking pale and spectral against the black sky  at the same time the roar of the surf broke familiarly on rubys ears  he steered close past the north end of the rock so close that he could see the rocks and knew that it was low water  a gleam of moonlight broke out at the time as if to encourage him  now said ruby you had better go about for if we carry on at this rate in the course we are going in about an hour you will either be a dead man on the rocks of forfar or enjoying yourself in a scotch prison  ha ha laughed the frenchman who immediately gave the order to put the vessel about good ver good bot i was not wish to see the scottish prison though i am told the mountains be ver superb  while he was speaking the little vessel lay over on her new course and ruby steered again past the north side of the rock  he shaved it so close that the frenchman shouted prenez garde and put a pistol to rubys ear  do you think i wish to die asked ruby with a quiet smile  now captain i want to point out the course so as to make you sure of it bid one of your men take the wheel and step up on the bulwarks with me and i will show you  this was such a natural remark in the circumstances and moreover so naturally expressed that the frenchman at once agreed  he ordered a seaman to take the wheel and then stepped with ruby upon the bulwarks at the stern of the vessel  now you see the position of the lighthouse said ruby well you must keep your course due east after passing it  if you steer to the norard o that youll run on the scotch coast if you bear away to the southard of it youll run a chance in this state o the tide of getting wrecked among the farne islands so keep her head due east  ruby said this very impressively so much so that the frenchman looked at him in surprise  why you so particulare he enquired with a look of suspicion  because i am going to leave you said ruby pointing to the bell rock which at that moment was not much more than a hundred yards to leeward indeed it was scarcely so much for the outlying rock at the northern end named johnny gray lay close under their lee as the vessel passed just then a great wave burst upon it and roaring in wild foam over the ledges poured into the channels and pools on the other side  for one instant rubys courage wavered as he gazed at the flood of boiling foam  what you say exclaimed the frenchman laying his hand on the collar of rubys jacket  the young sailor started struck the frenchman a backhanded blow on the chest which hurled him violently against the man at the wheel and bending down sprang with a wild shout into the sea  so close had he steered to the rock in order to lessen the danger of his reckless venture that the privateer just weathered it  there was not of course the smallest chance of recapturing ruby  no ordinary boat could have lived in the sea that was running at the time even in open water much less among the breakers of the bell rock  indeed the crew felt certain that the english sailor had allowed despair to overcome his judgment and that he must infallibly be dashed to pieces on the rocks so they did not check their onward course being too glad to escape from the immediate neighbourhood of such a dangerous spot  meanwhile ruby buffeted the billows manfully  he was fully alive to the extreme danger of the attempt but he knew exactly what he meant to do he trusted to his intimate knowledge of every ledge and channel and current and had calculated his motions to a nicety  he knew that at the particular state of the tide at the time and with the wind blowing as it then did there was a slight eddy at the point of cunninghams ledge  his life he felt depended on his gaining that eddy  if he should miss it he would be dashed against johnny grays rock or be carried beyond it and cast upon strachans ledge or scorebys point and no man however powerful he might be could have survived the shock of being launched on any of these rocks  on the other hand if in order to avoid these dangers he should swim too much to windward there was danger of his being carried on the crest of a billow and hurled upon the weatherside of cunninghams ledge instead of getting into the eddy under its lee  all this ruby had seen and calculated when he passed the north end of the rock the first time and he had fixed the exact spot where he should take the plunge on repassing it  he acted so promptly that a few minutes sufficed to carry him towards the eddy the tide being in his favour  but when he was about to swim into it a wave burst completely over the ledge and pouring down on his head thrust him back  he was almost stunned by the shock but retained sufficient presence of mind to struggle on  for a few seconds he managed to bear up against wind and tide for he put forth his giant strength with the energy of a desperate man but gradually he was carried away from the rock and for the first time his heart sank within him  just then one of those rushes or swirls of water which are common among rocks in such a position swept him again forward right into the eddy which he had struggled in vain to reach and thrust him violently against the rock  this back current was the precursor of a tremendous billow which came towering on like a black moving wall  ruby saw it and twining his arm amongst the seaweed held his breath  the billow fell  only those who have seen the bell rock in a storm can properly estimate the roar that followed  none but ruby himself could tell what it was to feel that world of water rushing overhead  had it fallen directly upon him it would have torn him from his grasp and killed him but its full force had been previously spent on cunninghams ledge  in another moment it passed and ruby quitting his hold struck out wildly through the foam  a few strokes carried him through sinclairs and wilsons tracks into the little pool formerly mentioned as port stevenson  the author has himself bathed in port stevenson so that the reader may rely on the fidelity of this description of it and the surrounding ledges  here he was in comparative safety  true the sprays burst over the ledge called the last hope in heavy masses but these could do him no serious harm and it would take a quarter of an hour at least for the tide to sweep into the pool  ruby therefore swam quietly to trinity ledge where he landed and stepping over it sat down to rest with a thankful heart on smiths ledge the old familiar spot where he and jamie dove had wrought so often and so hard at the forge in former days  he was now under the shadow of the bell rock lighthouse which towered high above his head and the impression of immovable solidity which its cold grey stately column conveyed to his mind contrasted powerfully with the howling wind and the raging sea around  it seemed to him as he sat there within three yards of its granite base like the impersonation of repose in the midst of turmoil of peace surrounded by war of calm and solid selfpossession in the midst of fretful and raging instability  no one was there to welcome ruby  the lightkeepers high up in the apartments in their wild home knew nothing and heard nothing of all that had passed so near them  the darkness of the night and the roaring of the storm was all they saw or heard of the world without as they sat in their watch tower reading or trimming their lamps  but ruby was not sorry for this he felt glad to be alone with god to thank him for his recent deliverance  exhausting though the struggle had been its duration was short so that he soon recovered his wonted strength  then rising he got upon the iron railway or rails as the men used to call it and a few steps brought him to the foot of the metal ladder conducting to the entrancedoor  climbing up he stood at last in a place of safety and disappeared within the doorway of the lighthouse    chapter twenty nine  the wreck  meantime the french privateer sped onward to her doom  the force with which the french commander fell when ruby cast him off had stunned him so severely that it was a considerable time before he recovered  the rest of the crew were therefore in absolute ignorance of how to steer  in this dilemma they layto for a short time after getting away to a sufficient distance from the dangerous rock and consulted what was to be done  some advised one course and some another but it was finally suggested that one of the english prisoners should be brought up and commanded to steer out to sea  this advice was acted on and the sailor who was brought up chanced to be one who had a partial knowledge of the surrounding coasts  one of the frenchmen who could speak a few words of english did his best to convey his wishes to the sailor and wound up by producing a pistol which he cocked significantly  all right said the sailor i knows the coast and can run ye straight out to sea  thats the bell rock light on the weatherbow i spose  oui dat is de bell roke  wery good our course is due norwest  so saying the man took the wheel and laid the ships course accordingly  now he knew quite well that this course would carry the vessel towards the harbour of arbroath into which he resolved to run at all hazards trusting to the harbourlights to guide him when he should draw near he knew that he ran the strongest possible risk of getting himself shot when the frenchmen should find out his faithlessness but he hoped to prevail on them to believe the harbourlights were only another lighthouse which they should have to pass on their way out to sea and then it would be too late to put the vessel about and attempt to escape  but all his calculations were useless as it turned out for in half an hour the men at the bow shouted that there were breakers ahead and before the helm could be put down they struck with such force that the topmasts went overboard at once and the sails bursting their sheets and tackling were blown to ribbons  just then a gleam of moonlight struggled through the wrack of clouds and revealed the dark cliffs of the forfar coast towering high above them  the vessel had struck on the rocks at the entrance to one of those rugged bays with which that coast is everywhere indented  at the first glance the steersman knew that the doom of all on board was fixed for the bay was one of those which are surrounded by almost perpendicular cliffs and although during calm weather there was a small space between the cliffs and the sea which might be termed a beach yet during a storm the waves lashed with terrific fury against the rocks so that no human being might land there  it chanced at the time that captain ogilvy who took great delight in visiting the cliffs in stormy weather had gone out there for a midnight walk with a young friend and when the privateer struck he was standing on the top of the cliffs  he knew at once that the fate of the unfortunate people on board was almost certain but with his wonted energy he did his best to prevent the catastrophe  run lad and fetch men and ropes and ladders  alarm the whole town and use your legs well  lives depend on your speed said the captain in great excitement  the lad required no second bidding  he turned and fled like a greyhound  the lieges of arbroath were not slow to answer the summons  there were neither lifeboats nor mortarapparatus in those days but there were the same willing hearts and stout arms then as now and in a marvellously short space of time hundreds of the ablebodied men of the town gentle and semple were assembled on these wild cliffs with torches rope etcetera in short with all the appliances for saving life that the philanthropy of the times had invented or discovered  but alas these appliances were of no avail  the vessel went to pieces on the outer point of rocks and part of the wreck with the crew clinging to it drifted into the bay  the horrified people on the cliffs looked down into that dreadful abyss of churning water and foam into which no one could descend  ropes were thrown again and again but without avail  either it was too dark to see or the wrecked men were paralysed  an occasional shriek was heard above the roar of the tempest as one after another the exhausted men fell into the water or were wrenched from their hold of the piece of wreck  at last one man succeeded in catching hold of a rope and was carefully hauled up to the top of the cliff  it was found that this was one of the english sailors  he had taken the precaution to tie the rope under his arms poor fellow having no strength left to hold on to it but he was so badly bruised as to be in a dying state when laid on the grass  keep back and give him air said captain ogilvy who had taken a prominent part in the futile efforts to save the crew and who now kneeled at the sailors side and moistened his lips with a little brandy  the poor man gave a confused and rambling account of the circumstances of the wreck but it was sufficiently intelligible to make the captain acquainted with the leading particulars  were there many of your comrades aboard he enquired  the dying man looked up with a vacant expression  it was evident that he did not quite understand the question but he began again to mutter in a partly incoherent manner  theyre all gone said he every man of em but me  all tied together in the hold  they cast us loose though after she struck all gone all gone  after a moment he seemed to try to recollect something  no said he we werent all together  they took ruby on deck and i never saw him again  i wonder what they did  here he paused  who did you say enquired the captain with deep anxiety  rubyruby brand replied the man  what became of him said you  dont know  was he drowned  dont know repeated the man  the captain could get no other answer from him so he was compelled to rest content for the poor man appeared to be sinking  a sort of couch had been prepared for him on which he was carried into the town but before he reached it he was dead  nothing more could be done that night but next day when the tide was out men were lowered down the precipitous sides of the fatal bay and the bodies of the unfortunate seamen were sent up to the top of the cliffs by means of ropes  these ropes cut deep grooves in the turf as the bodies were hauled up one by one and laid upon the grass after which they were conveyed to the town and decently interred  the spot where this melancholy wreck occurred is now pointed out to the visitor as the seamens grave and the young folk of the town have from the time of the wreck annually recut the grooves in the turf above referred to in commemoration of the event so that these grooves may be seen there at the present day  it may easily be imagined that poor captain ogilvy returned to arbroath that night with dark forebodings in his breast  he could not however imagine how ruby came to be among the men on board of the french prize and tried to comfort himself with the thought that the dying sailor had perhaps been a comrade of rubys at some time or other and was in his wandering state of mind mixing him up with the recent wreck  as however he could come to no certain conclusion on this point he resolved not to tell what he had heard either to his sister or minnie but to confine his anxieties at least for the present to his own breast    chapter thirty  old friends in new circumstances  let us now return to ruby brand and in order that the reader may perfectly understand the proceedings of that bold youth let us take a glance at the bell rock lighthouse in its completed condition  we have already said that the lower part from the foundation to the height of thirty feet was built of solid masonry and that at the top of this solid part stood the entrancedoor of the buildingfacing towards the south  the position of the door was fixed after the solid part had been exposed to a winters storms  the effect on the building was such that the most sheltered or leeside was clearly indicated the weatherside being thickly covered with limpets barnacles and short green seaweed while the leeside was comparatively free from such incrustations  the walls at the entrancedoor are nearly seven feet thick and the short passage that pierces them leads to the foot of a spiral staircase which conducts to the lowest apartment in the tower where the walls decrease in thickness to three feet  this room is the provision store here are kept watertanks and provisions of all kinds including fresh vegetables which with fresh water are supplied once a fortnight to the rock all the year round  the provision store is the smallest apartment for as the walls of the tower decrease in thickness as they rise the several apartments necessarily increase as they ascend  the second floor is reached by a wooden staircase or ladder leading up through a manhole in the ceiling  here is the lightroom store which contains large tanks of polished metal for the oil consumed by the lights  a whole years stock of oil or about 1100 gallons is stored in these tanks  here also is a small carpenters bench and toolbox besides an endless variety of odds and endssuch as paintpots brushes flags waste for cleaning the reflectors etcetera etcetera  another stair similar to the first leads to the third floor which is the kitchen of the building  it stands about sixtysix feet above the foundation  we shall have occasion to describe it and the rooms above presently  meanwhile let it suffice to say that the fourth floor contains the mens sleepingberths of which there are six although three men is the usual complement on the rock  the fifth floor is the library and above that is the lantern the whole building from base to summit being 115 feet high  at the time when ruby entered the door of the bell rock lighthouse as already described there were three keepers in the building one of whom was on his watch in the lantern while the other two were in the kitchen  these men were all old friends  the man in the lantern was george forsyth who had been appointed one of the lightkeepers in consideration of his good services and steadiness  he was seated reading at a small desk  close above him was the blazing series of lights which revolved slowly and steadily by means of machinery moved by a heavy weight  a small bell was struck slowly but regularly by the same machinery in token that all was going on well  if that bell had ceased to sound forsyth would at once have leaped up to ascertain what was wrong with the lights  so long as it continued to ring he knew that all was well and that he might continue his studies peacefullynot quietly however for besides the rush of wind against the thick plateglass of the lantern there was the neverceasing roar of the ventilator in which the heated air from within and the cold air from without met and kept up a terrific war  keepers get used to that sound however and do not mind it  each keepers duty was to watch for three successive hours in the lantern  not less familiar were the faces of the occupants of the kitchen  to this apartment ruby ascended without anyone hearing him approach for one of the windows was open and the roar of the storm effectually drowned his light footfall  on reaching the floor immediately below the kitchen he heard the tones of a violin and when his head emerged through the manhole of the kitchen floor he paused and listened with deep interest for the air was familiar  peeping round the corner of the oaken partition that separated the manhole from the apartment he beheld a sight which filled his heart with gladness for there seated on a campstool with his back leaning against the dresser his face lighted up by the blaze of a splendid fire which burned in a most comfortablelooking kitchen range and his hands drawing forth most pathetic music from a violin sat his old friend joe dumsby while opposite to him on a similar campstool with his arm resting on a small table and a familiar black pipe in his mouth sat that worthy son of vulcan jamie dove  the little apartment glowed with ruddy light and to ruby who had just escaped from a scene of such drear and dismal aspect it appeared what it really was a place of the most luxurious comfort  dove was keeping time to the music with little puffs of smoke and joe was in the middle of a prolonged shake when ruby passed through the doorway and stood before them  doves eyes opened to their widest and his jaw dropt so did his pipe and the music ceased abruptly while the face of both men grew pale  im not a ghost boys said ruby with a laugh which afforded immense relief to his old comrades  come have ye not a welcome for an old messmate who swims off to visit you on such a night as this  dove was the first to recover  he gasped and holding out both arms exclaimed ruby brand  and no mistake cried ruby advancing and grasping his friend warmly by the hands  for at least half a minute the two men shook each others hands lustily and in silence  then they burst into a loud laugh while joe suddenly recovering went crashing into a scotch reel with energy so great that time and tune were both sacrificed  as if by mutual impulse ruby and dove began to dance  but this was merely a spurt of feeling more than halfinvoluntary  in the middle of a bar joe flung down the fiddle and springing up seized ruby round the neck and hugged him an act which made him aware of the fact that he was dripping wet  did ye swim hoff to the rock he enquired stepping back and gazing at his friend with a look of surprise mingled with awe  indeed i did  but how why what mystery are ye rolled up in exclaimed the smith  sit down sit down and quiet yourselves said ruby drawing a stool near to the fire and seating himself  ill explain if youll only hold your tongues and not look so scared like  no ruby no lad you must change yer clothes first said the smith in a tone of authority why the fire makes you steam like a washin biler  come along with me an ill rig you out  ay go hup with im ruby  bless me this is the most amazin hincident as ever appened to me  never saw nothink like it  as dove and ruby ascended to the room above joe went about the kitchen talking to himself poking the fire violently overturning the campstools knocking about the crockery on the dresser and otherwise conducting himself like a lunatic  of course ruby told dove parts of his story by fits and starts as he was changing his garments of course he had to be taken up to the lightroom and go through the same scene there with forsyth that had occurred in the kitchen and of course it was not until all the men himself included had quite exhausted themselves that he was able to sit down at the kitchen fire and give a full and connected account of himself and of his recent doings  after he had concluded his narrative which was interrupted by frequent question and comment and after he had refreshed himself with a cup of tea he rose and said  now boys its not fair to be spending all the night with you here while my old comrade forsyth sits up yonder all alone  ill go up and see him for a little  well go hup with ee lad said dumsby  no ye wont replied ruby i want him all to myself for a while fair play and no favour you know used to be our watchword on the rock in old times  besides his watch will be out in a little so ye can come up and fetch him down  well go along with you said the smith  hallo that must have been a big un  this last remark had reference to a distinct tremor in the building caused by the falling of a great wave upon it  does it often get raps like that enquired ruby with a look of surprise  not often said dove once or twice durin a gale mayhap when a bigger one than usual chances to fall on us at the right angle  but the lighthouse shakes worst just the gales begin to take off and when the swell rolls in heavy from the eastard  ay thats the time quoth joe  wy ive eard all the cups and saucers on the dresser rattle with the blows o them heavy seas but the gale is gittin to be too strong tonight to shake us much  too strong exclaimed ruby  ay  you see wen it blows very hard the breakers have not time to come down on us with a eavy tellin blow they goes tumblin and swashin round us and over us hammerin away wildly everyhow or nohow or anyhow just like a hexcited man fightin in a hurry  the afterswell thats wot does it  thats wot comes on slow and big and easy but powerful like a great prizefighter as knows what he can do and means to do it  a most uncomfortable sort of residence said ruby as he turned to quit the room  not a bit when ye git used to it said the smith  at first we was rather skeered but we dont mind now  come joe give us rule britanniapity she dont rule the waves straighter as somebody writes somewhere  so saying dove resumed his pipe and dumsby his fiddle while ruby proceeded to the staircase that led to the rooms above  just as he was about to ascend a furious gust of wind swept past accompanied by a wild roar of the sea at the same moment a mass of spray dashed against the small window at his side  he knew that this window was at least sixty feet above the rock and he was suddenly filled with a strong desire to have a nearer view of the waves that had force to mount so high  instead therefore of ascending to the lantern he descended to the doorway which was open for as the storm blew from the eastward the door was on the leeside  there were two doorsone of metal with thick plateglass panels at the inner end of the passage the other at the outer end of it was made of thick solid wood bound with metal and hung so as to open outwards when the two leaves of this heavy door were shut they were flush with the tower so that nothing was presented for the waves to act upon  but this door was never closed except in cases of storm from the southward  the scene which presented itself to our hero when he stood in the entrance passage was such as neither pen nor pencil can adequately depict  the tide was full or nearly so and had the night been calm the water would have stood about twelve or fourteen feet on the sides of the tower leaving a space of about the same height between its surface and the spot at the top of the copper ladder where ruby stood but such was the wild commotion of the sea that this space was at one moment reduced to a few feet as the waves sprang up towards the doorway or nearly doubled as they sank hissing down to the very rock  acres of white leaping seething foam covered the spot where the terrible bell rock lay  never for a moment did that boiling cauldron get time to show one spot of darkcoloured water  billow after billow came careering on from the open sea in quick succession breaking with indescribable force and fury just a few yards to windward of the foundations of the lighthouse where the outer ledges of the rock although at the time deep down in the water were sufficiently near the surface to break their first full force and save the tower from destruction though not from many a tremendous blow and overwhelming deluge of water  when the waves hit the rock they were so near that the lighthouse appeared to receive the shock  rushing round it on either side the cleft billows met again to leeward just opposite the door where they burst upwards in a magnificent cloud of spray to a height of full thirty feet  at one time while ruby held on by the manropes at the door and looked over the edge he could see a dark abyss with the foam shimmering pale far below another instant and the solid building perceptibly trembled as a green sea hit it fair on the weatherside  a continuous roar and hiss followed as the billow swept round filled up the dark abyss and sent the white water gleaming up almost into the doorway  at the same moment the sprays flew by on either side of the column so high that a few drops were thrown on the lantern  to rubys eye these sprays appeared to be clouds driving across the sky so high were they above his head  a feeling of awe crept over him as his mind gradually began to realise the world of water which as it were overwhelmed himwater and foam roaring and flying everywherethe heavy seas thundering on the column at his backthe sprays from behind arching almost over the lighthouse and meeting those that burst up in front while an eddy of wind sent a cloud swirling in at the doorway and drenched him to the skin  it was an exhibition of the might of god in the storm such as he had never seen before and a brief sudden exclamation of thanksgiving burst from the youths lips as he thought of how hopeless his case would have been had the french vessel passed the lighthouse an hour later than it did  the contrast between the scene outside and that inside the bell rock lighthouse at that time was indeed striking  outside there was madly raging conflict inside there were peace comfort security ruby with his arms folded standing calmly in the doorway jamie dove and joe dumsby smoking and fiddling in the snug kitchen george forsyth reading the pilgrims progress mayhap or robinson crusoe for both works were in the bell rock library by the bright blaze of the crimson and white lamps high up in the crystal lantern  if a magician had divided the tower in two from top to bottom while some ship was staggering past before the gale he would have presented to the amazed mariners the most astonishing picture of war without and peace within that the world ever saw    chapter thirty one  midnight chat in a lantern  ill have to borrow another shirt and pair of trousers from you dove said ruby with a laugh as he returned to the kitchen  what been having another swim exclaimed the smith  not exactly but you see im fond o water  come along lad  in a few minutes the clothes were changed and ruby was seated beside forsyth asking him earnestly about his friends on shore  ah  ruby said forsyth i thought it would have killed your old mother when she was told of your bein caught by them seasharks and taken off to the wars  you must know i came to see a good deal of your friends throughthroughhoot whats the name the fairhaired lass that lives with  minnie suggested ruby who could not but wonder that any man living should forget her name for a moment  ay minnie it is  she used to come to see my wife about some work they wanted her to do and i was now and again sent up with a message to the cottage and captain ogilvy always invited me in to take a glass out of his old teapot  your mother used to ask me ever so many questions about you an what you used to say and do on the rock when this lighthouse was buildin  she looked so sad and pale poor thing i really thought it would be all up with her an i believe it would but for minnie  it was quite wonderful the way that girl cheered your mother up by readin bits o the bible to her an tellin her that god would certainly send you back again  she looked and spoke always so brightly too  did she do that exclaimed ruby with emotion  forsyth looked for a moment earnestly at his friend  i mean continued ruby in some confusion did she look bright when she spoke of my bein away  no lad it was when she spoke of you comin back but i could see that her good spirits was partly put on to keep up the old woman  for a moment or two the friends remained silent  suddenly forsyth laid his hand on the others shoulder and said impressively ruby brand its my belief that that girl is rather fond of you  ruby looked up with a bright smile and said dyou think so  well dye know i believe she is  upon my word youngster exclaimed the other with a look of evident disgust your conceit is considerable  i had thought to be somewhat confidential with you in regard to this idea of mine but you seem to swallow it so easy and to look upon it as so natural a thing that thatdo you suppose youve nothin to do but ask the girl to marry you and shell say yes at once  i do said ruby quietly nay i am sure of it  forsyths eyes opened very wide indeed at this  young man said he the sea must have washed all the modesty you once had out of you  i hope not interrupted the other but the fact is that i put the question you have supposed to minnie long ago and she did say yes to it then so its not likely shes goin to draw back now  whew that alters the case cried forsyth seizing his friends hand and wringing it heartily  hallo you two seem to be on good terms anyhow observed jamie dove whose head appeared at that moment through the hole in the floor by which the lantern communicated with the room below  i came to see if anything had gone wrong for your time of watch is up  so it is exclaimed forsyth rising and crossing to the other side of the apartment where he applied his lips to a small tube in the wall  what are you doing enquired ruby  whistling up joe said forsyth  this pipe runs down to the sleepin berths where theres a whistle close to joes ear  he must be asleep ill try again  he blew down the tube a second time and listened for a reply which came up a moment or two after in a sharp whistle through a similar tube reversed that is with the mouthpiece below and the whistle above  soon after joe dumsby made his appearance at the trapdoor looking very sleepy  i feels as eavy as a lump o lead said he  wot an orrible thing it is to be woke out o a comfrable sleep  just as he spoke the lighthouse received a blow so tremendous that all the men started and looked at each other for a moment in surprise  i say is it warranted to stand anything enquired ruby seriously  i hope it is replied the smith else itll be a blue lookout for us  but we dont often get such a rap as that  dye mind the first we ever felt o that sort forsyth  it happened last month  i was on watch at the time forsyth was smokin his pipe in the kitchen and dumsby was in bed when a sea struck us with such force that i thought we was done for  in a moment forsyth and joe came tumblin up the ladderjoe in his shirt  it must have been a ship sailed right against us says forsyth and with that we all jumped on the rail that runs round the lantern there and looked out but no ship could be seen though it was a moonlight night  you see theres plenty o water at high tide to let a ship of two hundred tons drawin twelve feet run slap into us and weve sometimes feared this in foggy weather but it was just a blow of the sea  weve had two or three like it since and are gettin used to it now  well we cant get used to do without sleep said forsyth stepping down through the trapdoor so ill bid ye all good night  old on  tell ruby about junk before ye go cried dumsby  ah well ill tell im myself  you must know ruby that weve got what they calls an hoccasional lightkeeper ashore who larns the work out ere in case any of us reglar keepers are took ill so as e can supply our place on short notice  well e was out ere larnin the dooties one tremendous stormy night an the poor fellow was in a mortial fright for fear the lantern would be blowed right hoff the top o the stone column and imself along with it  you see the door that covers the manhole there is usually shut when were on watch but junk we called im junk cause e wos so like a lump o fat pork e kep the door open all the time an sat close beside it so as to be ready for a dive  well it was my turn to watch so i went up an just as i puts my fut on the first step o the lanternladder there comes a sea like wot we had a minit ago the wind at the same time roared in the wentilators like a thousand fiends and the spray dashed agin the glass  junk gave a yell and dived  he thought it wos all over with im and wos in sich a funk that he came down ead foremost and would sartinly ave broke is neck if e adnt come slap into my buzzum  i tell e it was no joke for e wos fourteen stone if e wos an ounce an  come along ruby said dove interrupting the sooner we dive too the better for theres no end to that story when dumsby get off in full swing  good night  good night lads an better manners tye said joe as he sat down beside the little desk where the lightkeepers were wont during the lonely watchhours of the night to read or write or meditate    chapter thirty two  everyday life on the bell rock and old memories recalled  the sun shone brightly over the sea next morning so brightly and powerfully that it seemed to break up and disperse by force the great stormclouds which hung about the sky like the fragments of an army of black bullies who had done their worst and been baffled  the storm was over at least the wind had moderated down to a fresh invigorating breeze  the white crests of the billows were few and far between and the wild turmoil of waters had given place to a grand procession of giant waves that thundered on the bell rock lighthouse at once with more dignity and more force than the raging seas of the previous night  it was the sun that awoke ruby by shining in at one of the small windows of the library in which he slept  of course it did not shine in his face because of the relative positions of the library and the sun the first being just below the lantern and the second just above the horizon so that the rays struck upwards and shone with dazzling brilliancy on the domeshaped ceiling  this was the second time of wakening for ruby that night since he lay down to rest  the first wakening was occasioned by the winding up of the machinery which kept the lights in motion and the chain of which with a ponderous weight attached to it passed through a wooden pilaster close to his ear causing such a sudden and hideous din that the sleeper not having been warned of it sprang like a jackinthebox out of bed into the middle of the room where he first stared vacantly around him like an unusually surprised owl and then guessing the cause of the noise smiled pitifully as though to say poor fellow youre easily frightened and tumbled back into bed where he fell asleep again instantly  on the second time of wakening ruby rose to a sitting posture yawned looked about him yawned again wondered what oclock it was and then listened  no sound could be heard save the intermittent roar of the magnificent breakers that beat on the bell rock  his couch was too low to permit of his seeing anything but sky out of his windows three of which about two feet square lighted the room  he therefore jumped up and while pulling on his garments looked towards the east where the sun greeted and almost blinded him  turning to the north window a bright smile lit up his countenance and a blessing rest on you escaped audibly from his lips as he kissed his hand towards the cliffs of forfarshire which were seen like a faint blue line on the faroff horizon with the town of arbroath just rising above the morning mists  he gazed out at this north window and thought over all the scenes that had passed between him and minnie from the time they first met down to the day when they last parted  one of the sweetest of the mental pictures that he painted that morning with unwonted facility was that of minnie sitting at his mothers feet comforting her with the words of the bible  at length he turned with a sigh to resume his toilette  looking out at the southern window he observed that the rocks were beginning to be uncovered and that the rails or iron pathway that led to the foot of the entrancedoor ladder were high enough out of the water to be walked upon  he therefore hastened to descend  we know not what appearance the library presented at the time when ruby brand slept in it but we can tell from personal experience that at the present day it is a most comfortable and elegant apartment  the other rooms of the lighthouse although thoroughly substantial in their furniture and fittings are quite plain and devoid of ornament but the library or strangers room as it is sometimes called being the guestchamber is fitted up in a style worthy of a ladys boudoir with a turkey carpet handsome chairs and an elaborately carved oak table supported appropriately by a centre stem of three twining dolphins  the dome of the ceiling is painted to represent stucco panelling and the partition which cuts off the small segment of this circular room that is devoted to passage and staircase is of panelled oak  the thickness of this partition is just sufficient to contain the bookcase also a cleverly contrived bedstead which can be folded up during the day out of sight  there is also a small cupboard of oak which serves the double purpose of affording shelf accommodation and concealing the iron smokepipe which rises from the kitchen and passing through the several storeys projects a few feet above the lantern  the centre window is ornamented with marble sides and top and above it stands a marble bust of robert stevenson the engineer of the building with a marble slab below bearing testimony to the skill and energy with which he had planned and executed the work  if not precisely what we have described it to be at the present time the library must have been somewhat similar on that morning when our hero issued from it and descended to the rock  the first stair landed him at the entrance to the sleepingberths  he looked into one and observed forsyths head and arms lying in the bed in that peculiarly negligent style that betokens deep and sweet repose dumsbys rest was equally sound in the next berth  this fact did not require proof by ocular demonstration his nose announced it sonorously over the whole building  passing to the kitchen immediately below ruby found his old messmate jamie dove busy in the preparation of breakfast  ha  ruby good mornin you keep up your early habits i see  cant shake yer paw lad cause im up to the elbows in grease not to speak o sutt an ashes  when did you learn to cook jamie said ruby laughing  when i came here  you see weve all got to take it turn and turn about and its wonderful how soon a feller gets used to it  im rather fond of it dye know  we havent overmuch to work on in the way o variety to be sure but what we have theres lots of it an it gives us occasion to exercise our wits to invent somethin new  its wonderful what can be done with fresh beef cabbage carrots potatoes flour tea bread mustard sugar pepper an the like if yeve got a talent that way  youve got it all off by heart i see said ruby  true boy but its not so easy to get it all off yer stomach sometimes  what with confinement and want of exercise we was troubled with indigestion at first but were used to it now and i have acquired quite a fancy for cooking  no doubt youll hear forsyth and joe say that ive halfpisoned them four or five times but thats all envy besides a feller cant learn a trade without doin a little damage to somebody or something at first  did you ever taste blackbird pie  no replied ruby never  then you shall taste one today for we caught fifty birds last week  caught fifty birds  ay but ill tell ye about it some other time  be off just now and get as much exercise out o the rock as ye can before breakfast  the smith resumed his work as he said this and ruby descended  he found the sea still roaring over the rock but the rails were so far uncovered that he could venture on them yet he had to keep a sharp lookout for whenever a larger breaker than usual struck the rock the gush of foaming water that flew over it was so great that a spurt or two would sometimes break up between the iron bars and any one of these spurts would have sufficed to give him a thorough wetting  in a short time however the sea went back and left the rails free soon after that ruby was joined by forsyth and dumsby who had come down for their morning promenade  they had to walk in single file while taking exercise as the tramway was not wide enough for two and the rock even when fully uncovered did not afford sufficient level space for comfortable walking although at low water as the reader already knows it afforded fully a hundred yards of scrambling ground if not more  they had not walked more than a few minutes when they were joined by jamie dove who announced breakfast and proceeded to take two or three turns by way of cooling himself  thereafter the party returned to the kitchen where they sat down to as good a meal as any reasonable man could desire  there was cold boiled beefthe remains of yesterdays dinnerand a bit of broiled cod a native of the bell rock caught from the doorway at high water the day before  there was tea also and toastbuttered toast hot out of the oven  dove was peculiarly good at what may be styled toastcooking  indeed all the lightkeepers were equally good  the bread was cut an inch thick and butter was laid on as plasterers spread plaster with a trowel  there was no scraping off a bit here to put it on there no digging out pieces from little caverns in the bread with the point of the knife no repetition of the work to spread it thinner and above all no omitting of corners and edgesno the smallest conceivable fly could not have found the minutest atom of dry footing on a bell rock slice of toast from its centre to its circumference  dove had a liberal heart and he laid on the butter with a liberal hand  fair play and no favour was his motto quarterinch thick was his gauge railway speed his practice  the consequence was that the toast floated as it were down the throats of the men and compensated to some extent for the want of milk in the tea  now boys sit in cried dove seizing the teapot  we have not much variety observed dumsby to ruby in an apologetic tone  variety exclaimed forsyth what dye call that pointing to the fish  well that is a hextra morsel i admit returned joe but we dont get that every day owsever wot there is is good an theres plenty of it so lets fall to  forsyth said grace and then they all fell to with appetites peculiar to that isolated and breezy spot where the wind blows so fresh from the open sea that the nostrils inhale culinary odours and the palates seize culinary products with unusual relish  there was something singularly unfeminine in the manner in which the duties of the table were performed by these stalwart guardians of the rock  we are accustomed to see such duties performed by the tender hands of woman or it may be by the expert fingers of trained landsmen but in places where woman may not or can not act with proprietyas on shipboard or in seagirt towersmen go through such feminine work in a way that does credit to their versatilityalso to the strength of culinary materials and implements  the way in which jamie dove and his comrades knocked about the pans teapots cups and saucers etcetera without smashing them would have astonished as well as gratified the hearts of the fraternity of tinsmiths and earthenware manufacturers  we have said that everything in the lighthouse was substantial and very strong  all the woodwork was oak the floors and walls of solid stonehence when dove who had no nerves or physical feelings proceeded with his cooking the noise he caused was tremendous  a man used to womans gentle ways would on seeing him poke the fire have expected that the poker would certainly penetrate not only the coals but the back of the grate also and perchance make its appearance at the outside of the building itself through stones joggles dovetails trenails pozzolano mortar and all the strong materials that have withstood the fury of winds and waves for the last halfcentury  dove treated the other furniture in like manner not that he treated it illwe would not have the reader imagine this for a moment  he was not reckless of the household goods  he was merely indifferent as to the row he made in using them  but it was when the cooking was over and the table had to be spread that the thing culminated  under the impulse of lightheartedness caused by the feeling that his labours for the time were nearly ended and that his reward was about to be reaped he went about with irresistible energy like the proverbial bull in a china shop without reaching that creatures destructive point  it was then that a beaming smile overspread his countenance and he raged about the kitchen with vulcanlike joviality  he pulled out the table from the wall to the centre of the apartment with a swing that produced a prolonged crash up went its two leaves with two minor crashes  down went the four plates and the cups and saucers with such violence and rapidity that they all seemed to be dancing on the board together  the beef all but went over the side of its dish by reason of the shock of its sudden stoppage on touching the table and the pile of toast was only saved from scatteration by the strength of the material so to speak with which its successive layers were cemented  when the knives forks and spoons came to be laid down the storm seemed to lull because these were comparatively light implements so that this periodwhich in shoregoing life is usually found to be the exasperating onewas actually a season of relief  but it was always followed by a terrible squall of scraping wooden legs and clanking human feet when the campstools were set and the men came in and sat down to the meal  the pouring out of the tea however was the point that would have called forth the admiration of the worldhad the world seen it  what a contrast between the miserable sickly slowdribbling silver and other teapots of the land and this great teapot of the sea  the bell rock teapot had no sham no humbug about it  it was a big boldlooking one of true britannia metal with vast internal capacity and a gaping mouth  dove seized it in his strong hand as he would have grasped his biggest forehammer  before you could wink a sluice seemed to burst open a torrent of rich brown tea spouted at your cup and it was fullthe saucer too perhapsin a moment  but why dwell on these luxurious scenes  reader you can never know them from experience unless you go to visit the bell rock we will therefore cease to tantalise you  during breakfast it was discussed whether or not the signalball should be hoisted  the signalball was fixed to a short staff on the summit of the lighthouse and the rule was that it should be hoisted at a fixed hour every morning when all was well and kept up until an answering signal should be made from a signaltower in arbroath where the keepers families dwelt and where each keeper in succession spent a fortnight with his family after a spell of six weeks on the rock  it was the duty of the keeper on shore to watch for the hoisting of the ball the alls well signal each morning on the lighthouse and to reply to it with a similar ball on the signaltower  if on any occasion the hour for signalling should pass without the ball on the lighthouse being shown then it was understood that something was wrong and the attending boat of the establishment was sent off at once to ascertain the cause and afford relief if necessary the keeping down of the ball was however an event of rare occurrence so that when it did take place the poor wives of the men on the rock were usually thrown into a state of much perturbation and anxiety each naturally supposing that her husband must be seriously ill or have met with a bad accident  it was therefore natural that there should be some hesitation about keeping down the ball merely for the purpose of getting a boat off to send ruby ashore  you see said forsyth the day after tomorrow the relief boat is due and it may be as well just to wait for that ruby and then you can go ashore with your friend jamie dove for its his turn this time  ay lad just make up your mind to stay another day said the smith as they dont know youre here they cant be wearyin for you and ill take ye an introduce you to my little wife that i fell in with on the cliffs of arbroath not long after ye was kidnapped  besides ruby itll do ye good to feed like a fighting cock out here another day have another cup o tea  an a junk o beef said forsyth  an a slice o toast said dumsby  ruby accepted all these offers and soon afterwards the four friends descended to the rock to take as much exercise as they could on its limited surface during the brief period of low water that still remained to them  it may easily be imagined that this ramble was an interesting one and was prolonged until the tide drove them into their tower of refuge every rock every hollow called up endless reminiscences of the busy building seasons  ruby went over it all step by step with somewhat of the feelings that influence a man when he revisits the scene of his childhood  there was the spot where the forge had stood  dye mind it lad said dove  there are the holes where the hearth was fixed and theres the rock where you vaulted over the bellows when ye took that splendid dive after the fairhaired lassie into the pool yonder  mind it  ay i should think so  then there were the holes where the great beams of the beacon had been fixed and the iron bats most of which latter were still left in the rock and some of which may be seen there at the present day  there was also the pool into which poor selkirk had tumbled with the vegetables on the day of the first dinner on the rock and that other pool into which forsyth had plunged after the mermaids and not least interesting among the spots of note there was the ledge now named the last hope on which mr stevenson and his men had stood on the day when the boat had been carried away and they had expected but were mercifully preserved from a terrible tragedy  after they had talked much on all these things and long before they were tired of it the sea drove them to the rails gradually as it rose higher it drove them into the lighthouse and then each man went to his workjamie dove to his kitchen in order to clean up and prepare dinner and the other two to the lantern to scour and polish the reflectors refill and trim the lamps and generally to put everything in order for the coming night  ruby divided his time between the kitchen and lantern lending a hand in each but we fear interrupting the work more than he advanced it  that day it fell calm and the sun shone brightly  well have fog tonight observed dumsby to brand pausing in the operation of polishing a reflector in which his fat face was mirrored with the most indescribable and dreadful distortions  dye think so  im sure of it  youre right remarked forsyth looking from his elevated position to the seaward horizon i can see it coming now  i say what smell is that exclaimed ruby sniffing  somethink burnin said dumsby also sniffing  why what can it be murmured forsyth looking round and likewise sniffing  hallo  joe look out youre on fire  joe started clapped his hand behind him and grasped his inexpressibles which were smouldering warmly  ruby assisted and the fire was soon put out amidst much laughter  ang them reflectors said joe seating himself and breathing hard after his alarm and exertions its the third time theyve set me ablaze  the reflectors joe said ruby  ay dont ye see  theyve natrally got a focus an wen i appen to be standin on a sunny day in front of em contemplatin the face o natur as it wor through the lantern panes if i gits into the focus by haccident dye see it just acts like a burninglass  ruby could scarcely believe this but after testing the truth of the statement by actual experiment he could no longer doubt it  presently a light breeze sprang up rolling the fog before it and then dying away leaving the lighthouse enshrouded  during fog there is more danger to shipping than at any other time  in the daytime in ordinary weather rocks and lighthouses can be seen  at night lights can be seen but during fog nothing can be seen until danger may be too near to be avoided  the two great fogbells of the lighthouse were therefore set agoing and they rang out their slow deeptoned peal all that day and all that night as the bell of the abbot of aberbrothoc is said to have done in days of yore  that night ruby was astonished and then he was stunned  first as to his astonishment  while he was seated by the kitchen fire chatting with his friend the smith sometime between nine oclock and midnight dumsby summoned him to the lantern to help in catching tomorrows dinner  dove laughed at the summons and they all went up  the first thing that caught rubys eye at one of the window panes was the round visage of an owl staring in with its two large eyes as if it had gone mad with amazement and holding on to the iron frame with its claws  presently its claws lost hold and it fell off into outer darkness  what think ye o that for a beauty said forsyth  rubys eyes being set free from the fascination of the owls stare now made him aware of the fact that hundreds of birds of all kindscrows magpies sparrows tomtits owls larks mavises blackbirds etcetera etceterawere fluttering round the lantern outside apparently bent on ascertaining the nature of the wonderful light within  ah poor things said forsyth in answer to rubys look of wonder they often visit us in foggy weather  i suppose they get out to sea in the fog and cant find their way back to land and then some of them chance to cross our light and take refuge on it  now ill go out and get tomorrows dinner said dumsby  he went out accordingly and walking round the balcony that encircled the base of the lantern was seen to put his hand up and quietly take down and wring the necks of such birds as he deemed suitable for his purpose  it seemed a cruel act to ruby but when he came to think of it he felt that as they were to be stewed at any rate the more quickly they were killed the better  he observed that the birds kept fluttering about alighting for a few moments and flying off again all the time that dumsby was at work yet dumsby never failed to seize his prey  presently the man came in with a small basket full of game  now ruby said he ill bet a sixpence that you dont catch a bird within five minutes  i dont bet such large sums usually but ill try said ruby going out  he tried and failed  just as the five minutes were expiring however the owl happened to alight before his nose so he nabbed it and carried it in triumphantly  that aint a bird said dumsby  its not a fish retorted ruby but how is it that you caught them so easily and i found it so difficult  because lad you must do it at the right time  you watch wen the focus of a revolvin light is comin full in a birds face  the moment it does so es dazzled and you grab im  if you grab too soon or too late es away  thats ow it is and theyre capital heatin as youll find  thus much for rubys astonishment  now for his being stunned  late that night the fog cleared away and the bells were stopped  after a long chat with his friends ruby mounted to the library and went to bed  later still the fog returned and the bells were again set agoing  both of them being within a few feet of rubys head they awakened him with a bang that caused him to feel as if the room in which he lay were a bell and his own head the tongue thereof  at first the sound was solemnising then it was saddening  after a time it became exasperating and then maddening  he tried to sleep but he only tossed  he tried to meditate but he only wanderednot in dreams however  he tried to laugh but the laugh degenerated into a growl  then he sighed and the sigh ended in a groan  finally he got up and walked up and down the floor till his legs were cold when he turned into bed again very tired and fell asleep but not to restto dream  he dreamt that he was at the forge again and that he and dove were trying to smash their anvils with the sledgehammersbang and bang about  but the anvil would not break  at last he grew desperate hit the horn off and then with another terrific blow smashed the whole affair to atoms  this startled him a little and he awoke sufficiently to become aware of the fogbells  again he dreamed  minnie was his theme now but strange to say he felt little or no tenderness towards her  she was beset by a hundred ruffians in peajackets and souwesters  something stirred him to madness  he rushed at the foe and began to hit out at them right and left  the hitting was slow but sureregular as clockwork  first the right then the left and at each blow a seamans nose was driven into his head and a seamans body lay flat on the ground  at length they were all floored but onethe last and the biggest  ruby threw all his remaining strength into one crashing blow drove his fist right through his antagonists body and awoke with a start to find his knuckles bleeding  hang these bells he exclaimed starting up and gazing round him in despair  then he fell back on his pillow in despair and went to sleep in despair  once more he dreamed  he was going to church now dressed in a suit of the finest broadcloth with minnie on his arm clothed in pure white emblematic it struck him of her pure gentle spirit  friends were with him all gaily attired and very happy but unaccountably silent perhaps it was the noise of the weddingbells that rendered their voices inaudible  he was struck by the solemnity as well as the pertinacity of these weddingbells as he entered the church  he was puzzled too being a presbyterian why he was to be married in church but being a man of liberal mind he made no objection to it  they all assembled in front of the pulpit into which the clergyman a very reverend but determined man mounted with a prayer book in his hand  ruby was puzzled again  he had not supposed that the pulpit was the proper place but modestly attributed this to his ignorance  stop those bells said the clergyman with stern solemnity but they went on  stop them i say he roared in a voice of thunder  the sexton pulling the ropes in the middle of the church paid no attention  exasperated beyond endurance the clergyman hurled the prayer book at the sextons head and felled him  still the bells went on of their own accord  stop stoooop  i say he yelled fiercely and hitting the pulpit with his fist he split it from top to bottom  minnie cried shame at this and from that moment the bells ceased  whether it was that the fogbells ceased at that time or that minnies voice charmed rubys thoughts away we cannot tell but certain it is that the severely tried youth became entirely oblivious of everything the marriageparty vanished with the bells minnie alas faded away also finally the roar of the sea round the bell rock the rock itself its lighthouse and its inmates and all connected with it faded from the sleepers mind and    like the baseless fabric of a vision   left not a wrack behind    chapter thirty three  conclusion  facts are facts there is no denying that  they cannot be controverted nothing can overturn them or modify them or set them aside  there they stand in naked simplicity mildly contemptuous alike of sophists and theorists  immortal facts  bacon founded on you newton found you out dugald stewart and all his fraternity reasoned on you and followed in your wake  what would this world be without facts  rest assured reader that those who ignore facts and prefer fancies are fools  we say it respectfully  we have no intention of being personal whoever you may be  on the morning after ruby was cast on the bell rock our old friend ned oconnor having been appointed one of the lighthousekeepers and having gone for his fortnight ashore in the order of his course sat on the top of the signaltower at arbroath with a telescope at his eye directed towards the lighthouse and became aware of a facta fact which seemed to be contradicted by those who ought to have known better  ned soliloquised that morning  his soliloquy will explain the circumstances to which we refer we therefore record it here  whats that  sure theres something wrong wid me eye intirely this mornin howld on he wiped it here and applying it again to the telescope proceeded wan tshoo three four  no mistake about it  try agin wan tshoo three four  an yet the balls up there as cool as a cookumber tellin a big lie ye know ye are continued ned apostrophising the ball and readjusting the glass  there ye are as bold as brassav yere not coppertellin me that everythins goin on as usual whin i can see with me two eyes one after the other that theres four men on the rock whin there should be only three well well continued ned after a pause and a careful examination of the bell rock which being twelve miles out at sea could not be seen very distinctly in its lower parts even through a good glass the day afther tomorrowll settle the question misther ball for then the relief goes off and faix if i dont guv ye the lie direct im not an irishman  with this consolatory remark ned oconnor descended to the rooms below and told his wife who immediately told all the other wives and the neighbours so that ere long the whole town of arbroath became aware that there was a mysterious stranger a fourth party on the bell rock  thus it came to pass that when the relieving boat went off numbers of fishermen and sailors and others watched it depart in the morning and increased numbers of people of all sorts among whom were many of the old hands who had wrought at the building of the lighthouse crowded the pier to watch its return in the afternoon  as soon as the boat left the rock those who had glasses announced that there was an extra man in her  speculation remained on tiptoe for nearly three hours at the end of which time the boat drew near  its a man anyhow observed captain ogilvy who was one of those near the outer end of the pier  i say observed his friend the leftenant who was looking through a telescope ifthatsnotrubybrandill eat my hat without sauce  you dont meanlet me see cried the captain snatching the glass out of his friends hand and applying it to his eye  i do believeyes it is ruby or his ghost  by this time the boat was near enough for many of his old friends to recognise him and ruby seeing that some of the faces were familiar to him rose in the stern of the boat took off his hat and waved it  this was the signal for a tremendous cheer from those who knew our hero and those who did not know him but knew that there was something peculiar and romantic in his case and in the manner of his arrival began to cheer from sheer sympathy while the little boys who were numerous and who love to cheer for cheerings sake alone yelled at the full pitch of their lungs and waved their ragged caps as joyfully as if the king of england were about to land upon their shores  the boat soon swept into the harbour and rubys friends headed by captain ogilvy pressed forward to receive and greet him  the captain embraced him the friends surrounded him and almost pulled him to pieces finally they lifted him on their shoulders and bore him in triumphal procession to his mothers cottage  and where was minnie all this time  she had indeed heard the rumour that something had occurred at the bell rock but satisfied from what she heard that it would be nothing very serious she was content to remain at home and wait for the news  to say truth she was too much taken up with her own sorrows and anxieties to care as much for public matters as she had been wont to do  when the uproarious procession drew near she was sitting at widow brands feet comforting her in her usual way  before the procession turned the corner of the street leading to his mothers cottage ruby made a desperate effort to address the crowd and succeeded in arresting their attention  friends friends he cried its very good of you very kind but my mother is old and feeble she might be hurt if we were to come on her in this fashion  we must go in quietly  true true said those who bore him letting him down so good day lad good day  a shake o your flipper give us your hand glad youre back ruby good luck to ee boy  such were the words followed by three cheers with which his friends parted from him and left him alone with the captain  we must break it to her nephy said the captain as they moved towards the cottage    still so gently oer me stealin   memory will bring back the feelin  it wont do to go slap into her as a british frigate does into a french lineobattle ship  ill go in an do the breakin business and send out minnie to you  ruby was quite satisfied with the captains arrangement so when the latter went in to perform his part of this delicate business the former remained at the doorpost expectant  minnie lass i want to speak to my sister said the captain leave us a bitand theres somebody wants to see you outside  me uncle  ay you look alive now  minnie went out in some surprise and had barely crossed the threshold when she found herself pinioned in a strong mans arms  a cry escaped her as she struggled for one instant to free herself but a glance was sufficient to tell who it was that held her  dropping her head on rubys breast the load of sorrow fell from her heart  ruby pressed his lips upon her forehead and they both rested there  it was one of those preeminently sweet restingplaces which are vouchsafed to some though not to all of the pilgrims of earth in their toilsome journey through the wilderness towards that eternal rest in the blessedness of which all minor restingplaces shall be forgotten whether missed or enjoyed by the way  their rest however was not of long duration for in a few minutes the captain rushed out and exclaiming shes swounded lad grasped ruby by the coat and dragged him into the cottage where he found his mother lying in a state of insensibility on the floor  seating himself by her side on the floor he raised her gently and placing her in a halfsitting halfreclining position in his lap laid her head tenderly on his breast  while in this position minnie administered restoratives and the widow ere long opened her eyes and looked up  she did not speak at first but twining her arms round rubys neck gazed steadfastly into his face then drawing him closer to her heart she fervently exclaimed thank god and laid her head down again with a deep sigh  she too had found a restingplace by the way on that day of her pilgrimage    now reader we feel bound to tell you in confidence that there are few things more difficult than drawing a story to a close  our tale is done for ruby is married to minnie and the bell rock lighthouse is finished and most of those who built it are scattered beyond the possibility of reunion  yet we are loath to shake hands with them and to bid you farewell  nevertheless so it must be for if we were to continue the narrative of the aftercareers of our friends of the bell rock the books that should be written would certainly suffice to build a new lighthouse  but we cannot make our bow without a parting word or two  ruby and minnie as we have said were married  they lived in the cottage with their mother and managed to make it sufficiently large to hold them all by banishing the captain into the scullery  do not suppose that this was done heartlessly and without the captains consent  by no means  that worthy son of neptune assisted at his own banishment  in fact he was himself the chief cause of it for when a consultation was held after the honeymoon as to what was to be done now he waved his hand commanded silence and delivered himself as follows  now shipmates all give ear to me an dont ventur to interrupt its natral an proper ruby that you an minnie and your mother should wish to live together as the old song says birds of a feather flock together an the old songs right and as the thing ought to be an you all want it to be so it shall be  theres only one little difficulty in the way which is that the ships too small to hold us by reason of the aftercabin bein occupied by an old seaman of the name of ogilvy  now then not bein pigs the question is whats to be done  i will answer that question the seaman of the name of ogilvy shall change his quarters  observing at this point that both ruby and his bride opened their mouths to speak the captain held up a threatening finger and sternly said silence  then he proceeded  i speak authoritatively on this point havin conversed with the seaman ogilvy and diskivered his sentiments  that seaman intends to resign the cabin to the young couple and to hoist his flag for the futur in the fogsl  he pointed in explanation to the scullery a small dirtylooking apartment off the kitchen which was full of pots and pans and miscellaneous articles of household chiefly kitchen furniture  ruby and minnie laughed at this and the widow looked perplexed but perfectly happy and at her ease for she knew that whatever arrangement the captain should make it would be agreeable in the end to all parties  the seaman ogilvy and i continued the captain have gone over the fogsl meaning the forecastle together and we find that by the use of mops buckets water and swabs the place can be made clean  by the use of paper paint and whitewash it can be made respectable and by the use of furniture pictures books and baccy it can be made comfortable  now the question that ive got to propound this day to the judge and jury iswhy not  upon mature consideration the judge and jury could not answer why not therefore the thing was fixed and carried out and the captain thereafter dwelt for years in the scullery and the inmates of the cottage spent so much of their time in the scullery that it became as it were the parlour or boudoir or drawingroom of the place  when in course of time a number of small brands came to howl and tumble about the cottage they naturally gravitated towards the scullery which then virtually became the nursery with a stout old seaman of the name of ogilvy usually acting the part of head nurse  his duties were onerous by reason of the strength of constitution lungs and muscles of the young brands whose ungovernable desire to play with that dangerous element from which heat is evolved undoubtedly qualified them for the honorary title of firebrands  with the proceeds of the jewelcase ruby bought a little coasting vessel with which he made frequent and successful voyages  absence makes the heart grow fonder no doubt for minnie grew fonder of ruby every time he went away and every time he came back  things prospered with our hero and you may be sure that he did not forget his old friends of the lighthouse  on the contrary he and his wife became frequent visitors at the signaltower and the families of the lighthousekeepers felt almost as much at home in the cottage as they did in their own houses  and each keeper on returning from his six weeks spell on the rock to take his two weeks spell at the signaltower invariably made it his first business after kissing his wife and children to go up to the brands and smoke a pipe in the scullery with that eccentric old seafaring nurserymaid of the name of ogilvy  in time ruby found it convenient to build a top flat on the cottage and above this a small turret which overlooked the opposite houses and commanded a view of the sea  this tower the captain converted into a point of lookout and a summer smokingroomand many a time and oft in the years that followed did he and ruby climb up there about nightfall to smoke the pipe of peace with minnie beside them and to watch the bright flashing of the red and white light on the bell rock as it shone over the waters far and wide like a star of the first magnitude a star of hope and safety guiding sailors to their desired haven perchance reminding them of that star of bethlehem which guided the shepherds to him who is the light of the world and the rock of ages
