32599649	the lady of blossholme  by h rider haggard     chapter i  sir john foterell  who that has ever seen them can forget the ruins of blossholme abbey set upon their mount between the great waters of the tidal estuary to the north the rich lands and grazing marshes that backed with woods border it east and south and to the west by the rolling uplands merging at last into purple moor and far away the sombre eternal hills probably the scene has not changed very much since the days of henry viii when those things happened of which we have to tell for here no large town has arisen nor have mines been dug or factories built to affront the earth and defile the air with their hideousness and smoke  the village of blossholme we know has scarcely varied in its population for the old records tell us this and as there is no railway here its aspect must be much the same houses built of the local grey stone do not readily fall down the folk of that generation walked in and out of the doorways of many of them although the roofs for the most part are now covered with tiles or rough slates in place of reeds from the dike the parish wells also fitted with iron pumps that have superseded the old rollers and buckets still serve the place with drinkingwater as they have done since the days of the first edward and perhaps for centuries before  although their use if not their necessity has passed away not far from the abbey gate the stocks and whippingpost the latter arranged with three sets of iron loops fixed at different heights and of varying diameters to accommodate the wrists of man woman and child may still be found in the middle of the priests green these stand it will be remembered under a quaint old roof supported on rough oaken pillars and surmounted by a weathercock which the monkish fancy has fashioned to the shape of the archangel blowing the last trump his clarion or coachhorn or whatever instrument of music it was he blew has vanished the parish book records that in the time of george i a boy broke it off melted it down and was publicly flogged in consequence the last time apparently that the whippingpost was used but gabriel still twists about as manfully as he did when old peter the famous smith fashioned and set him up with his own hand in the last year of king henry viii as it is said to commemorate the fact that on this spot stood the stakes to which cicely harflete lady of blossholme and her fostermother emlyn were chained to be burned as witches  so it is with everything at blossholme a place that time has touched but lightly the fields or many of them bear the same names and remain identical in their shape and outline the old farmsteads and the few halls in which reside the gentry of the district stand where they always stood the glorious tower of the abbey still points upwards to the sky although bells and roof are gone while halfamile away the parish church that was there before ithaving been rebuilt indeed upon saxon foundations in the days of william rufusyet lies among its ancient elms farther on situate upon the slope of a vale down which runs a brook through meadows is the stark ruin of the old nunnery that was subservient to the proud abbey on the hill some of it now roofed in with galvanised iron sheets and used as cowsheds  it is of this abbey and this nunnery and of those who dwelt around them in a day bygone and especially of that fair and persecuted woman who came to be known as the lady of blossholme that our story has to tell    it was dead winter in the year 1535the 31st of december indeed old sir john foterell a whitebearded redfaced man of about sixty years of age was seated before the log fire in the dininghall of his great house at shefton spelling through a letter which had just been brought to him from blossholme abbey he mastered it at length and when it was done any one who had been there to look might have seen a knight and gentleman of large estate in a rage remarkable even for the time of the eighth henry he dashed the document to the ground he drank three cups of strong ale of which he had already had enough in quick succession he swore a number of the best oaths of the period and finally in the most expressive language he consigned the body of the abbot of blossholme to the gallows and his soul to hell  he claims my lands does he he exclaimed shaking his fist in the direction of blossholme what does the rogue say that the abbot who went before him parted with them to my grandfather for no good consideration but under fear and threats now writes he this secretary cromwell whom they call vicargeneral has declared that the said transfer was without the law and that i must hand over the said lands to the abbey of blossholme on or before candlemas what was cromwell paid to sign that order with no inquiry made i wonder  sir john poured out and drank a fourth cup of ale then set to walking up and down the hall presently he halted in front of the fire and addressed it as though it were his enemy  you are a clever fellow clement maldon they tell me that all spaniards are and you were taught your craft at rome and sent here for a purpose you began as nothing and now you are abbot of blossholme and if the king had not faced the pope would be more but you forget yourself at times for the southern blood is hot and when the wine is in the truth is out there were certain words you spoke not a year ago before me and other witnesses of which i will remind you presently perhaps when secretary cromwell learns them he will cancel his gift of my lands and mayhap lift that plotting head of yours up higher ill go remind you of them  sir john strode to the door and shouted it would not be too much to say that he bellowed like a bull it opened after a while and a servingman appeared a bowlegged sturdylooking fellow with a shock of black hair  why are you not quicker jeffrey stokes he asked must i wait your pleasure from noon to night  i came as fast as i could master why then do you rate me  would you argue with me fellow do it again and i will have you tied to a post and lashed  lash yourself master and let out the choler and good ale which you need to do replied jeffrey in his gruff voice there be some men who never know when they are well served and such are apt to come to ill and lonely ends what is your pleasure ill do it if i can and if not do it yourself  sir john lifted his hand as though to strike him then let it fall again  i like one who braves me to my teeth he said more gently and that was ever your nature take it not ill man i was angered and have cause to be  the anger i see but not the cause though as a monk came from the abbey but now perhaps i can hazard a guess  aye thats it thats it jeffrey hark i ride to yonder crowsnest and at once saddle me a horse  good master ill saddle two horses  two i said one fool can i ride a pair at once like a mountebank  i know not but you can ride one and i another when the abbot of blossholme visits sir john foterell of shefton he comes with hawk on wrist with chaplains and pages and ten stout menatarms of whom he keeps more of late than a priest would seem to need about him when sir john foterell visits the abbot of blossholme at least he should have one servingman at his back to hold his nag and bear him witness  sir john looked at him shrewdly  i called you fool he said but you are none except in looks do as you will jeffrey but be swift stop where is my daughter  the lady cicely sits in her parlour i saw her sweet face at the window but now staring out at the snow as though she thought to see a ghost in it  um grunted sir john the ghost she thinks to see rides a grand grey mare stands over six feet high has a jolly face and a pair of arms well made for sword and shield or to clip a girl in yet that ghost must be laid jeffrey  pity if so master moreover you may find it hard ghostlaying is a priests job and when maids waists are willing mens arms reach far  be off sirrah roared sir john and jeffrey went  ten minutes later they were riding for the abbey three miles away and within halfanhour sir john was knocking not gently at its gate while the monks within ran to and fro like startled ants for the times were rough and they were not sure who threatened them when they knew their visitor at last they set to work to unbar the great doors and let down the drawbridge that had been hoist up at sunset  presently sir john stood in the abbots chamber warming himself at the great fire and behind him stood his servingman jeffrey carrying his long cloak it was a fine room with a noble roof of carved chestnut wood and stone walls hung with costly tapestry whereon were worked scenes from the scriptures the floor was hid with rich carpets made of coloured eastern wools the furniture also was rich and foreignlooking being inlaid with ivory and silver while on the table stood a golden crucifix a miracle of art and upon an easel so that the light from a hanging silver lamp fell on it a lifesized picture of the magdalene by some great italian painter turning her beauteous eyes to heaven and beating her fair breast  sir john looked about him and sniffed  now jeffrey would you think that you were in a monks cell or in some great dames bower hunt under the table man sure you will find her lute and needlework whose portrait is that think you and he pointed to the magdalene  a sinner turning saint i think master good company for laymen when she was sinner and good for priests now that she is saint for the rest i could snore well here after a cup of yon red wine and he jerked his thumb towards a longnecked bottle on a sideboard also the fire burns bright which is not to be wondered at seeing that it is made of dry oak from your sticksley wood  how know you that jeffrey asked sir john  by the grain of it masterby the grain of it i have hewn too many a timber there not to know theres that in the sticksley clays which makes the rings grow wavy and darker at the heart see there  sir john looked and swore an angry oath  you are right man and now i come to think of it when i was a little lad my old grandsire bade me note this very thing about the sticksley oaks these cursed monks waste my woods beneath my nose my forester is a rogue they have scared or bribed him and he shall hang for it  first prove the crime master which wont be easy then talk of hanging which only kings and abbots with right of gallows can do at will ah you speak truth he added in a changed voice it is a lovely chamber though not good enough for the holy man who dwells in it since such a saint should have a silver shrine like him before the altar yonder as doubtless he will do when ere long he is old bones and as though by chance he trod upon his lords foot which was somewhat gouty  round came sir john like the blossholme weathercock on a gusty day  clumsy toad he yelled then paused for there within the arras that had been lifted silently stood a tall tonsured figure clothed in rich furs and behind him two other figures also tonsured in simple black robes it was the abbot with his chaplains  benedicite said the abbot in his soft foreign voice lifting the two fingers of his right hand in blessing  goodday answered sir john while his retainer bowed his head and crossed himself why do you steal upon a man like a thief in the night holy father he added irritably  that is how we are told judgment shall come my son answered the abbot smiling and in truth there seems some need of it we heard loud quarrelling and talk of hanging men what is your argument  a hard one of oak answered old sir john sullenly my servant here said those logs upon your fire came from my sticksley wood and i answered him that if so they were stolen and my reeve should hang for it  the worthy man is right my son and yet your forester deserves no punishment i bought our scanty store of firing from him and to tell truth the count has not yet been paid the money that should have discharged it has gone to london so i asked him to let it stand until the summer rents come in blame him not sir john if out of friendship knowing it was naught to you he has not bared the nakedness of our poor house  is it the nakedness of your poor houseand he glanced round the sumptuous chamberthat caused you to send me this letter saying that you have cromwells writ to seize my lands asked sir john rushing at his grievance like a bull and casting down the document upon the table or do you also mean to make payment for themwhen your summer rents come in  nay son in that matter duty led me for twenty years we have disputed of those estates which as you know your grandsire took from us in a time of trouble thus cutting the abbey lands in twain against the protest of him who was abbot in those days therefore at last i laid the matter before the vicargeneral who i hear has been pleased to decide the suit in favour of this abbey  to decide a suit of which the defendant had no notice exclaimed sir john my lord abbot this is not justice it is roguery that i will never bear did you decide aught else pray you  since you ask itsomething my son to save costs i laid before him the sundry points at issue between us and in sum this is the judgment your title to all your blossholme lands and those contiguous totalling eight thousand acres is not voided yet it is held to be tainted and doubtful  gods blood why asked sir john  my son i will tell you replied the abbot gently because within a hundred years they belonged to this abbey by gift of the crown and there is no record that the crown consented to their alienation  no record exclaimed sir john when i have the indentured deed in my strongbox signed by my greatgrandfather and the abbot frank ingham no record when my said forefather gave you other lands in place of them which you now hold but go on holy priest  my son i obey you your title though pronounced so doubtful is not utterly voided yet it is held that you have all these lands as tenant of this abbey to which should you die without issue they will relapse or should you die with issue under age such issue will be ward to the abbot of blossholme for the time being and failing him that is if there were no abbot and no abbey of the crown  sir john listened then sank back into a chair while his face went white as ashes  show me that judgment he said slowly  it is not yet engrossed my son within ten days or so i hopebut you seem faint the warmth of this room after the cold outer air perhaps drink a cup of our poor wine and at a motion of his hand one of the chaplains stepped to the sideboard filled a goblet from the longnecked flask that stood there and brought it to sir john  he took it as one that knows not what he does then suddenly threw the silver cup and its contents into the fire whence a chaplain recovered it with the woodtongs  it seems that you priests are my heirs said sir john in a new quiet voice or so you say and if that is so my life is likely to be short ill not drink your wine lest it should be poisoned hearken now sir abbot i believe little of this tale though doubtless by bribes and other means you have done your best to harm me behind my back up yonder in london well tomorrow at the dawn come fair weather or come foul i ride through the snows to london where i too have friends and we will see we will see you are a clever man abbot maldon and i know that you need money or its worth to pay your menatarms and satisfy the great costs at which you liveand there are our famous jewelsyes yes the old crusader jewels therefore you have sought to rob me whom you ever hated and perchance cromwell has listened to your tale perchance fool priest he added slowly he had it in his mind to fat this church goose of yours with my meal before he wrings its neck and cooks it  at these words the abbot started for the first time and even the two impassive chaplains glanced at each other  ah does that touch you asked sir john foterell well then here is what shall make you smart you think yourself in favour at the court do you not because you took the oath of succession which braver men like the brethren of the charterhouse refused and died for it but you forget the words you said to me when the wine you love had a hold of you in my hall  silence for your own sake silence sir john foterell broke in the abbot you go too far  not so far as you shall go my lord abbot ere i have done with you not so far as tower hill or tyburn thither to be hung and quartered as a traitor to his grace i tell you you forget the words you spoke but i will remind you of them did you not say to me when the guests had gone that king henry was a heretic a tyrant and an infidel whom the pope would do well to excommunicate and depose did you not when i led you on ask me if i could not bring about a rising of the common people in these parts among whom i have great power and of those gentry who know and love me to overthrow him and in his place set up a certain cardinal pole and for the deed promise me the pardon and absolution of the pope and much advancement in his name and that of the spanish emperor  never answered the abbot  and did i not went on sir john taking no note of his denial did i not refuse to listen to you and tell you that your words were traitorous and that had they been spoken otherwhere than in my house i as in duty bound by my office would make report of them aye and have you not from that hour striven to undo me whom you fear  i deny it all said the abbot again these be but empty lies bred of your malice sir john foterell  empty words are they my lord abbot well i tell you that they are all written down and signed in due form i tell you i had witnesses you knew naught of who heard them with their ears here stands one of them behind my chair is it not so jeffrey  aye master answered the servingman i chanced to be in the little chamber beyond the wainscot with others waiting to escort the abbot home and heard them all and afterward i and they put our marks upon the writing as i am a christian man that is so though master this is not the place that i should have chosen to speak of it however much i might be wronged  it will serve my turn said the enraged knight though it is true that i will speak of it louder elsewhere namely before the kings council tomorrow my lord abbot this paper and i go to london and then you shall learn how well it pays you to try to pluck a foterell of his own  now it was the abbots turn to be frightened his smooth olivecoloured cheeks sank in and went white as though already he felt the cord about his throat his jewelled hand shook and he caught the arm of one of his chaplains and hung to it  man he hissed do you think that you can utter such false threats and go hence to ruin me a consecrated abbot i have dungeons here i have power it will be said that you attacked me and that i did but strive to defend myself others can bring witness besides you sir john and he whispered some words in latin or spanish into the ear of one of his chaplains whereon that priest turned to leave the room  now it seems that we are getting to business said jeffrey stokes as lying his hand upon the knife at his girdle he slipped between the monk and the door  thats it jeffrey cried sir john stop the rats hole look you spaniard i have a sword show me to your gate or by virtue of the kings commission that i hold i do instant justice on you as a traitor and afterward answer for it if i win out  the abbot considered a moment taking the measure of the fierce old knight before him then he said slowly  go as you came in peace o man of wrath and evil but know that the curse of the church shall follow you i say that you stand near to ill  sir john looked at him the anger went out of his face and instead upon it appeared something strangea breath of foresight an inspiration call it what you will  by heaven and all its saints i think you are right clement maldon he muttered beneath that black dress of yours you are a man like the rest of us are you not you have a heart you have members you have a brain to think with you are a fiddle for god to play on and however much your superstitions mask and alter it out of those strings now and again will come some squeak of truth well i am another fiddle of a more honest sort mayhap though i do not lift two fingers of my right hand and say benedicite my son and your sins are forgiven you and just now the god of both of us plays his tune in me and i will tell you what it is i stand near to death but you stand not far from the gallows ill die an honest man you will die like a dog false to everything and afterwards let your beads and your masses and your saints help you if they can well talk it over when we meet again elsewhere and now my lord abbot lead me to your gate remembering that i follow with my sword jeffrey set those carrion crow in front of you and watch them well my lord abbot i am your servant march    chapter ii  the murder by the mere  for a while sir john and his retainer rode in silence then he laughed loudly  jeffrey he called that was a near touch sir priest was minded to stick his spanish picktooth between our ribs and shrive us afterwards as we lay dying to salve his conscience  yes master only being reasonable he remembered that english swords have a longer reach and that his bullies are in the ford alehouse seeing the old year out and so put it off master i have always told you that old october of yours is too strong to drink at noon it should be saved till bedtime  what do you mean man  i mean that ale spoke yonder not wisdom you have showed your hand and played the fool  who are you to teach me asked sir john angrily i meant that he should hear the truth for once the slimy traitor  perhaps perhaps but these be bad days for truth and those who court her was it needful to tell him that tomorrow you journey to london upon a certain errand  why not ill be there before him  will you ever be there master the road runs past the abbey and that priest has good ruffians in his pay who can hold their tongues  do you mean that he will waylay me i say he dare not still to please you we will take the longer path through the forest  a rough one master but who goes with you on this business most of us are away with the wains and others make holiday there are but three servingmen at the hall and you cannot leave the lady cicely without a guard or take her with you through this cold remember theres wealth yonder which some may need more even than your lands he added meaningly wait a while then till your people return or you can call up your tenants and go to london as one of your quality should with twenty good men at your back  and so give our friend the abbot time to get cromwells ear and through him that of the king no no i ride tomorrow at the dawn with you or if you are afraid without you as i have done before and taken no harm  none shall say that jeffrey stokes is afraid of man or priest or devil answered the old soldier colouring your road has been good enough for me this thirty years and it is good enough now if i warned you it was not for my own sake who care little what comes but for yours and that of your house  i know it said sir john more kindly take not my words ill my temper is up today thank the saints here is the hall at last why whose horse has passed the gates before us  jeffrey glanced at the tracks which the moonlight showed very clearly in the newfallen snow  sir christopher harfletes grey mare he said i know the shoeing and the round shape of the hoof doubtless he is visiting mistress cicely  whom i have forbidden to him grumbled sir john swinging himself from the saddle  forbid him not answered jeffrey as he took his horse christopher harflete may yet be a good friend to a maid in need and i think that need is nigh  mind your business knave shouted sir john am i to be set at naught in my own house by a chit of a girl and a gallant who would mend his broken fortunes  if you ask me i think so replied the imperturbable jeffrey as he led away the horses  sir john strode into the house by the backway which opened on to the stableyard taking the lantern that stood by the door he went along galleries and upstairs to the sittingchamber above the hall which since her mothers death his daughter had used as her own for here he guessed that he would find her setting down the lantern upon the passage table he pushed open the door which was not latched and entered  the room was large and being lighted only by the great fire that burned upon the hearth and two candles all this end of it was hid in shadow near to the deep windowplace the shadow ceased however and here seated in a highbacked oak chair with the light of the blazing fire falling full upon her was cicely foterell sir johns only surviving child she was a tall and graceful maiden blueeyed brownhaired fairskinned with a round and childlike face which most people thought beautiful to look upon just now this face that generally was so arch and cheerful seemed somewhat troubled for this there might be a reason since seated upon a stool at her side was a young man talking to her earnestly  he was a stalwart young man very broad about the shoulders cleancut in feature with a long straight nose black hair and merry black eyes also as such a gallant should do he appeared to be making love with much vigour and directness for his face was upturned pleading with the girl who leaned back in her chair answering him nothing at this moment indeed his copious flow of words came to an end perhaps from exhaustion perhaps for other reasons and was succeeded by a more effective method of attack suddenly sinking from the stool to his knees he took the unresisting hand of cicely and kissed it several times then emboldened by his success threw his long arms about her and before sir john choked with indignation could find words to stop him drew her towards him and treated her red lips as he had treated her fingers this rude proceeding seemed to break the spell that bound her for she pushed back the chair and escaping from his grasp rose saying in a broken voice  oh christopher dear christopher this is most wrong  may be he answered so long as you love me i care not what it is  that you have known these two years christopher i love you well but alas my father will have none of you get you hence now ere he returns or we both shall pay for it and i perhaps be sent to a nunnery where no man may come  nay sweet i am here to ask his consent to my suit  then at last sir john broke out  to ask my consent to your suit you dishonest knave he roared from the darkness whereat cicely sank back into her chair looking as though she would faint and the strong christopher staggered like a man pierced by an arrow first to take my girl and hug her before my very eyes and then when the mischief is done to ask my consent to your suit and he rushed at them like a charging bull  cicely rose to fly then seeing no escape took refuge in her lovers arms her infuriated father seized the first part of her that came to his hand which chanced to be one of her long brown plaits of hair and tugged at it till she cried out with pain purposing to tear her away at which sight and sound christopher lost his temper also  leave go of the maid sir he said in a low fierce voice or by god ill make you  leave go of the maid gasped sir john why who holds her tightest you or i do you leave go of her  yes yes christopher she whispered ere i am pulled in two  then he obeyed lifting her into the chair but her father still kept his hold of the brown tress  now sir christopher he said i am minded to put my sword through you  and pierce your daughters heart as well as mine well do it if you will and when we are dead and you are childless weep yourself and go to the grave  oh father father broke in cicely who knew the old mans temper and feared the worst in justice and in pity listen to me all my heart is christophers and has been from a child with him i shall have happiness without him black despair and that is his case too or so he swears why then should you part us is he not a proper man and of good lineage and name unstained until of late did you not ever favour him much and let us be together day by day and now when it is too late you deny him oh why why  you know why well enough girl because i have chosen another husband for you the lord despard is taken with your baby face and would marry you but this morning i had it under his own hand  the lord despard gasped cicely why he only buried his second wife last month father he is as old as you are and drunken and has grandchildren of wellnigh my age i would obey you in all things but never will i go to him alive  and never shall he live to take you muttered christopher  what matter his years daughter he is a sound man and has no son and should one be born to him his will be the greatest heritage within three shires moreover i need his friendship who have bitter enemies but enough of this get you gone christopher before worse befall you  so be it sir i will go but first as an honest man and my fathers friend and as i thought my own answer me one question why have you changed your tune to me of late am i not the same christopher harflete i was a year or two ago and have i done aught to lower me in the worlds eye or in yours  no lad answered the old knight bluntly but since you will have it here it is within that year or two your uncle whose heir you were has married and bred a son and now you are but a gentleman of good name and little to float it on that big house of yours must go to the hammer christopher youll never stow a bride in it  ah i thought as much christopher harflete with the promise of the lesborough lands was one man christopher harflete without them is anotherin your eyes yet sir i hold you foolish i love your daughter and she loves me and those lands and more may come back or i who am no fool will win others soon there will be plenty going up there at court where i am known further i tell you this i believe that i shall marry cicely and earlier than you think and i would have had your blessing with her  what will you steal the girl away asked sir john furiously  by no means sir but this is a strange world of ours in which from hour to hour top becomes bottom and bottom top and therei think i shall marry her at least i am sure that despard the sot never will for ill kill him first if i hang for it sir sir surely you will not throw your pearl upon that muckheap better crush it beneath your heel at once look and say you cannot do it and he pointed to the pathetic figure of cicely who stood by them with clasped hands panting breast and a face of agony  the old knight glanced at her out of the corners of his eyes and saw something that moved him to pity for at bottom his heart was honest and though he treated her so roughly as was the fashion of the times he loved his daughter more than all the world  who are you that would teach me my duty to my bone and blood he grumbled then he thought a while and added hear me now christopher harflete tomorrow at the dawn i ride to london with jeffrey stokes on a somewhat risky business  what business sir  if you would knowthat of a quarrel with yonder spanish rogue of an abbot who claims the best part of my lands and has poisoned the ear of that upstart the vicargeneral cromwell i go to take the deeds and prove him a liar and a traitor also which cromwell does not know now is my nest safe from you while i am away give me your word and ill believe you for at least you are an honest gentleman and if you have poached a kiss or two that may be forgiven others have done the same before you were born give me your word or i must drag the girl through the snows to london at my heels  you have it sir answered christopher if she needs my company she must come for it to cranwell towers for ill not seek hers while you are away  good then one gift for another ill not answer my lord of despards letter till i get back againnot to please you but because i hate writing it is a labour to me and i have no time to spare tonight now have a cup of drink and be off with you lovemaking is thirsty work  aye gladly sir but hear me hear me ride not to london with such slight attendance after a quarrel with abbot maldon let me wait on you although my fortunes be so low i can bring a man or twosix or eight indeedwhile yours are away with the wains  never christopher my own hand has guarded my head these sixty years and can do so still also he added with a flash of insight as you say the journey is dangerous and who knows if aught went wrong you might be wanted nearer home christopher you shall never have my girl shes not for you yet perhaps if need were you would strike a blow for her even if it made you excommunicate get hence wench why do you stand there gaping on us like an owl in sunlight and remember if i catch you at more such tricks youll spend your days mumbling at prayers in a nunnery and much good may they do you  at least i should find peace there and gentle words answered cicely with spirit for she knew her father and the worst of her fear had departed only sir i did not know that you wished to swell the wealth of the abbots of blossholme  swell their wealth roared her father nay ill stretch their necks get you to your chamber and send up jeffrey with the liquor  then having no choice cicely curtseyed first to her father and next to christopher to whom she sent a message with her eyes that she dared not utter with her lips and so vanished into the shadows where presently she was heard stumbling against some article of furniture  show the maid a light christopher said sir john who lost in his own thoughts was now gazing into the fire  seizing one of the two candles christopher sprang after her like a hound after a hare and presently the pair of them passed through the door and down the long passage beyond at a turn in it they halted and once more without word spoken she found her way into those long arms  you will not forget me even if we must part sobbed cicely  nay sweet he answered moreover keep a brave heart we do not part for long for god has given us to each other your father does not mean all he says and his temper which has been stirred today will soften if not we must look to ourselves i keep a swift horse or two cicely could you ride one if need were  i have ever loved riding she said meaningly  good then you shall never go to that fat hogs sty for ill stick him first and i have friends both in scotland and in france which like you best  they say the air of france is softer now away from me or one will come to seek us and they tore themselves apart  emlyn your fostermother is to be trusted he said rapidly also she loves me well if there be need let me hear of you through her  aye she answered without fail and glided from him like a ghost  have you been waiting to see the moon rise asked sir john glancing at christopher from beneath his shaggy eyebrows as he returned  nay sir but the passages in this old house of yours are most wondrous long and i took a wrong turn in threading them  oh said sir john well you have a talent for wrong turns and such partings are hard now do you understand that this is the last of them  i understand that you may say so sir  and that i mean it too i hope listen christopher he added with earnestness but in a kindly voice believe me i like you well and would not give you pain or the maid yonder if i could help it yet i have no choice i am threatened on all sides by priest and king and you have lost your heritage she is the only jewel that i can pawn and for your own safetys sake and her childrens sake must marry well yonder despard will not live long he drinks too hard and then your day may come if you still care for his leavingsperhaps in two years perhaps in less for she will soon see him out now let us talk no more of the matter but if aught befalls me be a friend to her here comes the liquordrink it up and be off though i seem rough with you my hope is that you may quaff many another cup at shefton    it was seven oclock of the next morning and sir john having eaten his breakfast was girding on his swordfor jeffrey had already gone to fetch the horseswhen the door opened and his daughter entered the great hall candle in hand wrapped in a fur cloak over which her long hair fell glancing at her sir john noted that her eyes were wide and frightened  what is it now girl he asked youll take your death of cold among these draughts  oh father she said kissing him i came to bid you farewell andandto pray you not to start  not to start and why  because father i have dreamed a bad dream at first last night i could not sleep and when at length i did i dreamed that dream thrice and she paused  go on cicely i am not afraid of dreams which are but foolishnesscoming from the stomach  mayhap yet father it was so plain and clear i can scarcely bear to tell it to you i stood in a dark place amidst black things that i knew to be trees then the red dawn broke upon the snow and i saw a little pool with brown rushes frozen in its ice and therethere at the edge of the pool by a pollard willow with one white limb you lay your bare sword in your hand and an arrow in your neck shot from behind while in the trunk of the willow were other arrows and lying near you two slain then cloaked men came as though to carry them away and i awoke i say i dreamed it thrice  a jolly good morrow indeed said sir john turning a shade paler and now daughter what do you make of this business  i oh i make that you should stop at home and send some one else to do your business sir christopher for instance  why then i should baulk your dream which is either true or false if true i have no choice it must be fulfilled if false why should i heed it cicely i am a plain man and take no note of such fancies yet i have enemies and it may well chance that my day is done if so use your mother wit girl beware of maldon look to yourself and as for your mothers jewels hide them and he turned to go  she clasped him by the arm  in that sad case what should i do father she asked eagerly  he stopped and stared at her up and down  i see that you believe in your dream he said and therefore although it shall not stay a foterell i begin to believe in it too in that case you have a lover whom i have forbid to you yet he is a man after my own heart who would deal well by you if i die my game is played set your own anew sweet cicely and set it soon ere that abbot is at your heels rough as i may have been remember me with kindness and gods blessing and mine be on you hark jeffrey calls and if they stand the horses will take cold there fare you well fear not for me i wear a chain shirt beneath my cloak get back to bed and warm you and he kissed her on the brow thrust her from him and was gone  thus did cicely and her father partfor ever    all that day sir john and jeffrey his servingman trotted forward through the snowthat is when they were not obliged to walk because of the depth of the drifts their plan was to reach a certain farm in a glade of the woodland within two hours of sundown and sleep there for they had taken the forest path leaving again for the fens and cambridge at the dawn this however proved not possible because of the exceeding badness of the road so it came about that when the darkness closed in on them a little before five oclock bringing with it a cold moaning wind and a scurry of snow they were obliged to shelter in a faggotbuilt woodmans hut waiting for the moon to appear among the clouds here they fed the horses with corn that they had brought with them and themselves also from their store of dried meat and barley cakes which jeffrey carried on his shoulder in a bag it was a poor meal eaten thus in the darkness but served to stay their stomachs and pass away the time  at length a ray of light pierced the doorway of the hut  shes up said sir john let us be going ere the nags grow stiff  making no answer jeffrey slipped the bits back into the horses mouths and led them out now the full moon had appeared like a great white eye between two black banks of cloud and turned the world to silver it was a dreary scene on which she shone a dazzling plain of snow broken by patches of hawthorns and here and there by the gaunt shape of a pollard oak since this being the outskirt of the forest folk came hither to lop the tops of the trees for firing a hundred and fifty yards away or so at the crest of a slope was a roundshaped hill made not by nature but by man none knew what that hill might be but tradition said that once hundreds or thousands of years before a big battle had been fought around it in which a king was killed and that his victorious army had raised this mound above his bones to be a memorial for ever  the story was indeed that being a seaking they had built a boat or dragged it thither from the river shore and set him in it with all the slain for rowers also that he might be seen at nights seated on his horse in armour and staring about him as when he directed the battle at least it is true that the mount was called kings grave and that people feared to pass it after sundown  as jeffrey stokes was holding his masters stirrup for him to mount he uttered an exclamation and pointed following the line of his outstretched hand in the clear moonlight sir john saw a man who sat still as any statue upon a horse on the very point of kings grave he appeared to be covered with a long cloak but above it his helmet glittered like silver next moment a fringe of black cloud hid the face of the moon and when it passed away the man and horse were gone  what did that fellow there asked sir john  fellow answered jeffrey in a shaken voice i saw none that was the ghost of the grave my grandfather met him ere he came to his end in the forest none know how for the wolves of which there were plenty in his day picked his bones clean and so have many others for hundreds of years always just before their doom he is an ill fowl that ghost of the grave and those who clap eyes on him do wisely to turn their horses heads homewards as i would tonight if i had my way master  what use jeffrey if the sight of him means death death will come moreover i believe nothing of the tale your ghost was some forest reeve or herdsman  a forest reeve or herdsman who wanders about in a steel helm on a fine horse in snowtime when there are no trees to cut or cattle to mind well have it as you will master only god save me from such reeves and herdmen for i think they hail from hell  then he was a spy watching whither we go answered sir john angrily  if so who sent him the abbot of blossholme in that case i would sooner meet the devil for this means mischief i say that we had better ride back to shefton  then do so jeffrey if you are scared and i will go on alone who being on an honest business fear not satan or an abbot either  nay master many a year ago when we were younger i stood by you on flodden field when sir edward christopher harfletes father was killed at our side and those redbearded scotch barebreeks pressed us hard yet i never itched to turn my back even after that great fellow with an axe got you down and we thought that all was lost then shall i do so nowthough it is true that i fear yon goblin more than all the highlanders beyond the tweed ride on man can die but once and for my part i care not when it comes who have little to lose in an ill world  so without more words they started forward peering about them as they went soon the forest thickened and the track they followed wound its way round great trunks of primeval oaks or the edges of bogholes or through brakes of thorns hard enough it was to find it at times since the snow made it one with the bordering ground and the gloom of the oaks was great but jeffrey was a woodman born and from his childhood had known the shape of every tree in that waste so that they held safely to their road well would it have been for them if they had not  they came to a place where three other tracks crossed that which they rode upon and here jeffrey stokes who was ahead held up his hand  what is it asked sir john  it is the marks of ten or a dozen shod horses passed within two hours since the last snow fell and who be they i wonder  doubtless travellers like ourselves ride on man that farm is not a mile ahead  then jeffrey broke out  master i like it not he said battlehorses have gone by here not chapmens or farmers nags and i think i know their breed i say that we had best turn about if we would not walk into some snare  turn you then grumbled sir john indifferently i am cold and weary and seek my rest  pray god that you may not find it when you are colder muttered jeffrey spurring his horse  they went on through the dead winter silence that was broken only by the hoots of a flitting owl hungry for the food that it could not find and the swish of the feet of a galloping fox as it looped past them through the snow presently they came to an open place ringed in by forest so wet that only marshtrees would grow there to their right lay a little icecovered mere with sere brown reeds standing here and there upon its face and at the end of it a group of stark pollarded willows whereof the tops had been cut for poles by those who dwelt in the forest farm near by sir john looked at the place and shivered a littleperhaps because the frost bit him or was it that he remembered his daughters dream which told of such a spot at any rate he set his teeth and his right hand sought the hilt of his sword his weary horse sniffed the air and neighed and the neigh was answered from close at hand  thank the saints we are nearer to that farm than i thought said sir john  as he spoke the words a number of men appeared galloping down on them from out of the shelter of a thornbrake and the moonlight shone on the bared weapons in their hands  thieves shouted sir john at them now jeffrey and win through to the farm  the man hesitated for he saw that their foes were many and no common robbers but his master drew his sword and spurred his beast so he must do likewise in twenty seconds they were among them and some one commanded them to yield sir john rushed at the fellow and rising in his stirrups cut him down he fell all of a heap and lay still in the snow which grew crimson about him one came at jeffrey who turned his horse so that the blow missed then took his weight upon the point of his sword so that this man too fell down and lay in the snow moving feebly  the rest thinking this greeting too warm for them swung round and vanished again among the thorns  now ride for it said jeffrey  i cannot answered sir john one of those knaves has hurt my mare and he pointed to blood that ran from a great gash in the beasts foreleg which it held up piteously  take mine said jeffrey ill dodge them afoot  never man to the willows we will hold our own there and springing from the wounded beast which tried to hobble after them but could not for its sinews were cut he ran to the shelter of the trees followed by jeffrey on his horse  who are these rogues he asked  the abbots menatarms answered jeffrey i saw the face of him i spitted  now sir johns jaw dropped  then we are sped friend for they dare not let us go cicely dreams well  as he spoke an arrow whistled by them  jeffrey he went on i have papers on me that should not be lost for with them might go my girls heritage take them and he thrust a packet into his hand and this purse also theres plenty in it awayanywhere and lie hid out of reach a while or theyll still your tongue then i charge you on your soul come back with help and hang that knave abbotfor your ladys sake jeffrey shell reward you and so will god above  the man thrust away purse and deeds in some deep pocket  how can i leave you to be butchered he muttered grinding his teeth  as the words left his lips he heard his master utter a gurgling sound and saw that an arrow shot from behind had pierced him through the throat saw too he who was skilled in war that the wound was mortal then he hesitated no longer  christ rest you he said ill do your bidding or die and turning his horse he drove the rowels into its sides causing it to bound away like a deer  for a moment the stricken sir john watched him go then he ran out of his cover shaking his sword above his headran into the open moonlight to draw the arrows they came fast enough but ere ever he fell for that steel shirt of his was strong jeffrey lying low on his horses neck was safe away and though the murderers followed hard they never caught him  nor though they searched for days could they find him at shefton or elsewhere for jeffrey who knew that all roads were blocked and who dared not venture home doubling like a hare across country had won down to the water where a ship lay foreign bound and by dawn was on the sea    chapter iii  a wedding  about noon of the day after that upon which sir john had come to his death cicely foterell sat at her meal in shefton hall not much of the rough midwinter fare passed her lips for she was ill at ease the man she loved had been dismissed from her because his fortunes were on the wane and her father had gone upon a journey which she felt rather than knew to be very dangerous the great old hall was lonesome also for a young girl who had no comrades near sitting there in the big room she bethought her how different it had been in her childhood before some foul sickness of which she knew not the name or nature had swept away her mother her two brothers and her sister all in a single week leaving her untouched then there were merry voices about the house where now was silence and she alone with naught bout a spaniel dog for company also most of the men were away with the wains laden with the years clip of wool which her father had held until the price had heightened nor in this snow would they be back for another week or perhaps longer  oh her heart was heavy as the winter clouds without and young and fair as she might be almost she wished that she had gone when her brothers went and found her peace  to cheer her spirits she drank from a cup of spiced ale that the manservant had placed beside her covered with a napkin and was glad of its warmth and comfort just then the door opened and her fostermother mrs stower entered she was still a handsome woman in her prime for her husband had been carried off by a fever when she was but nineteen and her baby with him whereon she had been brought to the hall to nurse cicely whose mother was very ill after her birth moreover she was tall and dark with black and flashing eyes for her father had been a spaniard of gentle birth and it was said gypsy blood ran in her mothers veins  there were but two people in the world for whom emlyn stower caredcicely her fosterchild and a certain playmate of hers one thomas bolle now a laybrother at the abbey who had charge of the cattle the tale was that in their early youth he had courted her not against her will and that when after her parents tragic deaths as a ward of the former abbot of blossholme she was married to her husband not with her will this thomas put on the robe of a monk of the lowest degree being but a yeoman of good stock though of little learning  something in the womans manner attracted cicelys attention and gave a hint of tragedy she paused at the door fumbling with its latch which was not her way then turned and stood upright against it like a picture in its frame  what is it nurse asked cicely in a shaken voice from your look you bear tidings  emlyn stower walked forward rested one hand upon the oak table and answered  aye evil tidings if they be true prepare your heart my sweet  quick with them emlyn gasped cicely who is dead christopher  she shook her head and cicely sighed in relief adding  who then oh was that dream true  aye dear you are an orphan  the girls head fell forward then she lifted it and asked  who told you give me all the truth or i shall die  a friend of mine who has to do with the abbey yonder ask not his name  i know it emlyn thomas bolle she whispered back  a friend of mine repeated the tall dark woman told me that sir john foterell your sire was murdered last night in the forest by a gang of armed men of whom he slew two  from the abbey queried cicely in the same whisper  who knows i think it they say that the arrow in his throat was such as they make there jeffrey stokes was hunted but escaped on to some ship that had her anchor up  ill have his life for it the coward exclaimed cicely  blame him not yet he met another friend of mine and sent a message it was that he did but obey his masters last orders and as he had seen too much and to linger here was certain death if he lived he would return from overseas with the papers when the times are safer he prayed that you would not doubt him  the papers what papers emlyn  she shrugged her broad shoulders  how should i know doubtless some that your father was taking to london and did not desire to lose his iron chest stands open in his chamber  now poor cicely remembered that her father had spoken of certain deeds which he must take with him and began to sob  weep not darling said her fostermother smoothing cicelys brown hair with her strong hand these things are decreed of god and done with now you must look to yourself your father is gone but one remains  cicely lifted her tearstained face  yes i have you she said  me she answered with a quick smile nay of what use am i your nursing days are over what did you tell me your father said to you before he rodeabout sir christopher hush theres no time to talk you must away to cranwell towers  why asked cicely he cannot bring my father back to life and it would be thought strange indeed that at such a time i should visit a man in his own house send and tell him the tidings i bide here to bury my father and she added proudly to avenge him  if so sweet you bide here to be buried yourself in yonder nunnery hark i have not told you all my news the abbot maldon claims the blossholme lands under some trick of law it was as to them that your father quarrelled with him the other night and with the land goes your wardship as once mine went under this monks charter before sunset the abbot rides here with his menatarms to take them and to set you for safekeeping in the nunnery where you will find a husband called holy church  name of god is it so said cicely springing up and the most of the men are away i cannot hold the hall against that foreign abbot and his hirelings and an orphaned heiress is but a chattel to be sold oh now i understand what my father meant order horses ill off to christopher yet stay nurse what will he do with me it may seem shameless and will vex him  i think he will marry you i think tonight you will be a wife if not ill know the reason why she added viciously  a wife tonight exclaimed the girl turning crimson to her hair and my father but just dead how can it be  well talk of that with harflete mayhap like you hell wish to wait and ask the banns or to lay the case before a london lawyer meanwhile i have ordered horses and sent a message to the abbot to say you come to learn the meaning of these rumours which will keep him still till nightfall and another to cranwell towers that we may find food and lodging there quick now and get your cloak and hood i have the jewels in their case for maldon seeks them more even than your lands and with them all the money i can find also i have bid the sewinggirl make a pack of some garments come now come for that abbot is hungry and will be stirring there is no time for talk    three hours later in the red glow of the sunset christopher harflete watching at his door saw two women riding towards him across the snow and knew them while they were yet far off  it is true then he said to father roger necton the old clergyman of cranwell whom he had summoned from the vicarage i thought that fool of a messenger must be drunk what can have chanced father  death i think my son for sure naught else would bring the lady cicely here unaccompanied save by a waitingwoman the question iswhat will happen now and he glanced sideways at him  i know well if i can get my way answered christopher with a merry laugh say now father if it should so be that this lady were willing could you marry us  without a doubt my son with the consent of the parents and again he looked at him  and if there were no parents  then with the consent of the guardian the bride being under age  and if no guardian had been declared or admitted  then such a marriage duly solemnized being a sacrament of the church would hold fast until the crack of doom unless the pope annulled it and as you know the pope is out of favour in this realm on this very matter of marriage let me explain the law to you ecclesiastic and civil  but christopher was already running towards the gate so the old parsons lecture remained undelivered  the two met in the snow emlyn stower riding on ahead and leaving them together  what is it sweetest he asked what is it  oh christopher she answered weeping my poor father is deadmurdered or so says emlyn  murdered by whom  by the abbot of blossholmes soldiersso says emlyn yonder in the forest last eve and the abbot is coming to shefton to declare me his ward and thrust me into the nunnerythat was emlyns tale and so although it is a strange thing to do having none to protect me i have fled to youbecause emlyn said i ought  she is a wise woman emlyn broke in christopher i always thought well of her judgment but did you only come to me because emlyn told you  not altogether christopher i came because i am distraught and you are a better friend than none at all andwhere else should i go also my poor father with his last words to me although he was so angry with you bade me seek your help if there were needandoh christopher i came because you swore you loved me and therefore it seemed right if i had gone to the nunnery although the prioress mother matilda is good and my friend who knows she might not have let me out again for the abbot is her master and not my friend it is our lands he loves and the famous jewelsemlyn has them with her  by now they were across the moat and at the steps of the house so without answering christopher lifted her tenderly from the saddle pressing her to his breast as he did so for that seemed his best answer a groom came to lead away the horses touching his bonnet and staring at them curiously and leaning on her lovers shoulder cicely passed through the arched doorway of cranwell towers into the hall where a great fire burned before this fire warming his thin hands stood father necton engaged in eager conversation with emlyn stower as the pair advanced this talk ceased evidently because it was of them  mistress cicely said the kindlyfaced old man speaking in a nervous fashion i fear that you visit us in sad case and he paused not knowing what to add  yes indeed she answered if all i hear is true they say that my father is killed by cruel meni know not for certain why or by whomand that the abbot of blossholme comes to claim me as his ward and immure me in blossholme priory whither i would not go i have fled here to escape him having no other refuge though you may think ill of me for this deed  not i my child i should not speak against yonder abbot for he is my superior in the church though mind you i owe him no allegiance since this benefice is not in his gift nor am i a benedictine therefore i will tell you the truth i hold the man not honest all is provender that comes to his maw moreover he is no englishman but a spaniard one sent here to work against the welfare of this realm to suck its wealth stir up rebellion and make report of all that passes in it for the benefit of englands enemies  yet he has friends at court or so said my father  aye aye such folks have ever friendstheir money buys them though mayhap an ill day is at hand for him and his likes well your poor father is gone god knows how though i thought for long that would be his end who ever spoke his mind or more and you with your wealth are the morsel that tempts maldons appetite and now what is to be done this is a hard case would you refuge in some other nunnery  nay answered cicely glancing sideways at her lover  then whats to be done  oh i know not she said bursting into a fit of weeping how can i tell you who am mazed with grief and doubt i had but a single friendmy father though at times he was a rough one yet he loved me in his way and i have obeyed his last counsel and all her courage gone she sank into a chair and rocked herself to and fro her head resting on her hands  that is not true said emlyn in her bold voice am i who suckled you no friend and is father necton here no friend and is sir christopher no friend well if you have lost your judgment i have kept mine and here it is yonder not two bowshots away stands a church and before me i see a priest and a pair who would serve for bride and bridegroom also we can rake up witnesses and a cup of wine to drink your health and after that let the abbot of blossholme do his worst what say you sir christopher  you know my mind nurse emlyn but what says cicely oh cicely what say you and he bent over her  she raised herself still weeping and throwing her arms about his neck laid her head upon his shoulder  i think it is the will of god she whispered and why should i fight against it who am his servantand yours chris  and now father what say you asked emlyn pointing to the pair  i do not think there is much to say answered the old clergyman turning his head aside save that if it should please you to come to the church in ten minutes time you will find a candle on the altar and a priest within the rails and a clerk to hold the book more we cannot do at such short notice  then he paused for a while and hearing no dissent walked down the hall and out of the door  emlyn took cicely by the hand led her to a room that was shown to them and there made her ready for her bridal as best she might she had no fine dress in which to clothe her nor indeed would there have been time to don it but she combed out her beautiful brown hair and opening that box of eastern jewels which were the great pride of the foterellsbeing the rarest and the most ancient in all the countrysideshe decked her with them on her broad brow she set a circlet from which hung sparkling diamonds that had been brought the story said by her mothers ancestor a carfax from the holy land where once they were the peculiar treasure of a paynim queen and upon her bosom a necklet of large pearls brooches and rings also she found for her breast and fingers and for her waist a jewelled girdle with a golden clasp while to her ears she hung the finest gems of alltwo great pearls pink like the hawthornbloom when it begins to turn lastly she flung over her head a veil of lace most curiously wrought and stood back with pride to look at her  now cicely who all this while had been silent and unresisting spoke for the first time saying  how came this here nurse  your mother wore it at her bridal and her mother too so i have been told also once before i wrapped it about youwhen you were christened sweet  mayhap but how came it here  in the bosom of my robe not knowing when we should get home again i brought it thinking that perhaps one day you might marry when it would be useful and now strangely enough the marriage has come  emlyn emlyn i believe that you planned all this business whereof god alone knows the end  that is why he makes a beginning dear that his end may be fulfilled in due season  aye but what is that end mayhap this is my shroud you wrap about me in truth i feel as though death were near  he is ever that replied emlyn unconcernedly but so long as he doesnt touch what does it matter now hark you sweetest ive spanish and gypsy blood in me with which go gifts and so ill tell you something for your comfort however oft he snatches death will not lay his bony hand on you for many a long yearnot till you are wellnigh as thin with age as he is oh youll have your troubles like all of us worse than many mayhap but you are lucks own child who lived when the rest were taken and youll win through and take others on your back as a whale does barnacles so snap your fingers at death as i do and she suited the action to the word and be happy while you may and when youre not happy wait till your turn comes round again now follow me and though your father is murdered smile as you should in such an hour for what man wants a sadfaced bride  they walked down the broad oaken stairs into the hall where christopher stood waiting for them glancing at him shyly cicely saw that he was clad in mail beneath his cloak and that his sword was girded at his side also that some men with him were armed for a moment he stared at her glittering beauty confused then said  fear not this hint of war in loves own hour and he touched his shining armour cicely these nuptials are strange as they are happy and some might try to break in upon them come now my sweet lady and bowing before her he took her by the hand and led her from the house emlyn walking behind them and the men with torches going before and following after  outside it was freezing sharply so that the snow crunched beneath their feet in the west the last red glow of sunset still lingered on the steely sky and over against it the great moon rose above the round edge of the world in the bushes of the garden and the tall poplars that bordered the moat blackbirds and fieldfares chattered their winter evening song while about the grey tower of the neighbouring church the daws still wheeled  the picture of that scene whereof at the time she seemed to take no note always remained fixed in the mind of cicely the cold expanse of snow the inky trees the hard sky the lambent beams of the moon the dull glow of the torches caught and reflected by her jewels and her lovers mail the midwinter sound of birds the barking of a distant hound the black porch of the church that drew nearer the little oblong mounds which hid the bones of hundreds who in their day had passed it as infants as bridegrooms and as brides and at last as cold white things that had been men and women  now they were in the nave of the old fane where the cold struck them like a sword the dim lights of the torches showed them that short as had been the time the news of this marvellous marriage had spread about for at least a score of people were standing here and there in knots or a few of them seated on the oak benches near the chancel all these turned to stare at them eagerly as they walked towards the altar where stood the priest in his robes and since his sight was dim behind him the old clerk with a stablelantern held on high to enable him to read from his book  they reached the carven roodscreen and at a sign kneeled down in a clear voice the clergyman began the service presently at another sign the pair rose advanced to the altarrails and again knelt down the moonlight flowing through the eastern window fell full on both of them turning them to cold white statues such as those that knelt in marble upon the tomb at their side  all through the holy office cicely watched these statues with fascinated eyes and it seemed to her that they and the old crusaders harfletes of a longpast day who lay near by were watching her with a wistful and kindly interest she made certain answers a ring that was somewhat too small was thrust upon her fingerall the rest of her life that ring hurt her at times but she would have never it moved and then some one was kissing her at first she thought it must be her father and remembering nearly wept till she heard christophers voice calling her wife and knew that she was wed  father roger the old clerk still holding the lantern behind him writing something in a little vellum book asking her the date of her birth and her full name which as he had been present at her christening she thought strange then her husband signed the book using the altar as a table not very easily for he was no great scholar and she signed also in her maiden name for the last time and the priest signed and at his bidding emlyn stower who could write well signed too next as though by an afterthought father roger called several of the congregation who rather unwillingly made their marks as witnesses while they did so he explained to them that as the circumstances were uncommon it was well that there should be evidence and that he intended to send copies of this entry to sundry dignities not forgetting the holy father at rome  on learning this they appeared to be sorry that they had anything to do with the matter and one and all of them melted into the darkness of the nave and out of cicelys mind  so it was done at last  father necton blew on his little book till the ink was dry then hid it away in his robe the old clerk having pocketed a handsome fee from christopher lit the pair down the nave to the porch where he locked the oaken door behind them extinguished his lantern and trudged off through the snow to the alehouse there to discuss these nuptials and hot beer escorted by their torchbearers cicely and christopher walked silently arminarm back to the towers whither emlyn after embracing the bride had already gone on ahead so having added one more ceremony to its countless record perhaps the strangest of them all the ancient church behind them grew silent as the dead within its graves  the towers reached the newwed pair with father roger and emlyn sat down to the best meal that could be prepared for them at such short notice a very curious wedding feast still though the company was so small it did not lack for heartiness since the old clergyman proposed their health in a speech full of latin words which they did not understand and every member of the household who had assembled to hear him drank to it in cups of wine this done the beautiful bride now blushing and now pale was led away to the best chamber which had been hastily prepared for her but emlyn remained behind a while for she had words to speak  sir christopher she said you are fast wed to the sweetest lady that ever sun or moon shone on and in that may hold yourself a lucky man yet such deep joys seldom come without their pain and i think that this is near at hand there are those who will envy you your fortune sir christopher  yet they cannot change it emlyn he answered anxiously the knot that was tied tonight may not be unloosed  never broke in father roger though the suddenness and the circumstances of it may be unusual this marriage is a sacrament celebrated in the face of the world with the full consent of both parties and of the holy church moreover before the dawn ill send the record of it to the bishops registry and elsewhere that it may not be questioned in days to come giving copies of the same to you and your ladys fostermother who is her nearest friend at hand  it may not be loosed on earth or in heaven replied emlyn solemnly yet perchance the sword can cut it sir christopher i think that we should all do well to travel as soon as may be  not tonight surely nurse he exclaimed  no not tonight she answered with a faint smile your wife has had a weary day and could not moreover preparation must be made which is impossible at this hour but tomorrow if the roads are open to you i think we should start for london where she may make complaint of her fathers slaying and claim her heritage and the protection of the law  that is good counsel said the vicar and christopher with whom words seemed to be few nodded his head  meanwhile went on emlyn you have six men in this house and others round it send out a messenger and summon them all here at dawn bidding them bring provision with them and what bows and arms they have set a watch also and after the father and the messenger have gone command that the drawbridge be triced  what do you fear he asked waking from his dream  i fear the abbot of blossholme and his hired ruffians who reck little of the laws as the soul of dead sir john knows now or can use them as a cover to evil deeds hell not let such a prize slip between his fingers if he can help it and the times are turbulent  alas alas it is true said father roger and that abbot is a relentless man who sticks at nothing having much wealth and many friends both here and beyond the seas yet surely he would never dare  that we shall learn interrupted emlyn meanwhile sir christopher rouse yourself and give the orders  so christopher summoned his men and spoke words to them at which they looked very grave but being truehearted fellows who loved him said they would do his bidding  a while later having written out a copy of the marriage lines and witnessed it father roger departed with the messenger the drawbridge was hoisted above the moat the doors were barred and a man set to watch in the gateway tower while christopher forgetful of all else even of the danger in which they were sought the company of her who waited for him    chapter iv  the abbots oath  on the following morning shortly after it was light christopher was called from his chamber by emlyn who gave him a letter  whence came this he asked turning it over suspiciously  a messenger has brought it from blossholme abbey she answered  wife cicely he called through the door come hither if you will  presently she appeared looking quaint and lovely in her long fur cloak and having embraced her fostermother asked what was the matter  this my darling he answered handing her the paper i never loved booklearnings overmuch and this morn i seem to hate them read you who are more scholarly  i mistrust me of that great seal it bodes us no good chris she replied doubtfully and paling a little  the message within is no medlar to soften by keeping said emlyn give it me i was schooled in a nunnery and can read their scrawls  so nothing loth cicely handed her the paper which she took in her strong fingers broke the seal snapped the silk unfolded and read it ran thus   to sir christopher harflete to mistress cicely foterell to emlyn stower the waitingwoman and to all others whom it may concern  i clement maldon abbot of blossholme having heard of the death of sir john foterell knt at the cruel hands of the forest thieves and outlaws sent last night to serve the declaration of my wardship according to my prerogative established by law and custom over the person and property of you cicely his only child surviving my messengers returned saying that you had fled from your home of shefton hall they said further that it was rumoured that you had ridden with your fostermother emlyn stower to cranwell towers the house of sir christopher harflete if this be so for the sake of your good name it is needful that you should remove from such company at once as there is talk about you and the said sir christopher harflete i purpose therefore god permitting me to ride this day to cranwell towers and if you be there as your lawful guardian and ghostly father to command you being an infant under age to accompany me thence to the nunnery of blossholme there i have determined in the exercise of my authority you shall abide until a fitting husband is found for you unless indeed god should move your heart to remain within its walls as one of the brides of christ  clement abbot   now when the reading of this letter was finished the three of them stood a little while staring at each other knowing well that it meant trouble for them all till cicely said  bring me ink and paper nurse i will answer this abbot  so they were brought and cicely wrote in her round girlish hand   my lord abbot  in answer to your letter i would have you know that as my noble father whose cruel death must be inquired of and avenged bade me with his last words i fearing that a like fate would overtake me at the hands of his murderers did as you suppose seek refuge at this house here yesterday i was married in the face of god and man in the church of cranwell as you may learn from the paper sent herewith it is not therefore needful that you should seek a husband for me since my dear lord sir christopher harflete and i are one till death do part us nor do i admit that now or at any time you had or have right of wardship over my person or the lands and goods which i hold and inherit your humble servant  cicely harflete   this letter cicely copied out fair and sealed and presently it was given to the abbots messenger who placed it in his pouch and rode off as fast as the snow would let him  they watched him go from a window  now said christopher turning to his wife i think dear we shall do well to ride also as soon as may be yonder abbot is sharpset and i doubt whether letters will satisfy his appetite  i think so also said emlyn make ready and eat both of you i go to see that the horses are saddled  an hour later everything was prepared three horses stood before the door and with them an escort of four mounted men who were all having arms and beasts to ride that christopher could gather at such short notice though others of his tenants and servants had already assembled at the towers in answer to his summons to the number of twelve indeed without the snow was falling fast and although she tried to look brave and happy cicely shivered a little as she saw it through the open door  we go on a strange honeymoon my sweet said christopher uneasily  what matter so long as we go together she answered in a gay voice that yet seemed to ring untrue although she added with a little choke of the throat i would that we could have stayed here until i had found and buried my father it haunts me to think of him lying somewhere in the snows like a perished ox  it is his murderers that i wish to bury exclaimed christopher and by gods name i swear ill do it ere all is done think not dear that i forget your griefs because i do not speak much of them but bridals and buryings are strange company so while we may let us take what joy we can since the ill that goes before ofttimes follows after also come let us mount and away to london to find friends and justice  then having spoken a few words to his housepeople he lifted cicely to her horse and they rode out into the softlyfalling snow thinking that they had seen their last of the towers for many a day but this was not to be for as they passed along the blossholme highway purposing to leave the abbey on their left when they were about three miles from cranwell suddenly a tall fellow who wore a great sheepskin coat with a monks hood to it and carried a thick staff in his hand burst through the fence and stood in front of them  who are you asked christopher laying his hand upon his sword  youd know me well enough if my hood were back he answered in a deep voice but if you want my name its thomas bolle cattlereeve to the abbey yonder  your voice proves you said christopher laughing and now what is your business laybrother bolle  to get up a bunch of yearling steers that have been running on the forestedge living like the rest of us on what they can find as the weather is coming on hard enough to starve them thats my business sir christopher but as i see an old friend of mine there and he nodded towards emlyn who was watching him from her horse with your leave ill ask her if she has any confession to make since she seems to be on a dangerous journey  now christopher made as though he would push on for he was in no mood to chat with cattlereeves but emlyn who had been eyeing the man called out  come here thomas and i will answer you myself who always have a few sins to spare for a priests wallet and need a blessing or two to warm me  he strode forward and taking her horse by the bridle led it a little way apart and as soon as they were out of earshot fell into an eager conversation with its rider a minute or so later cicely looking roundfor they had ridden forward at a slow pacesaw thomas bolle leap through the other fence of the roadway and vanish at a run into the falling snow while emlyn spurred her horse after them  stop she said to christopher i have tidings for you the abbot with all his menatarms and servants to the number of forty or more waits for us under shelter of blossholme grove yonder purposing to take the lady cicely by force some spy has told him of this journey  i see no one said christopher staring at the grove which lay below them about a quarter of a mile away for they were on the top of a rise still the matter is not hard to prove and he called to the two best mounted of his men and bade them ride forward and make report if any lurked behind that wood  so the men went off while they remained where they were silent but anxious enough ten minutes or so later before they could see them for the snow was now falling quickly they heard the sound of many horses galloping then the two men appeared calling out as they came  the abbot and all his folk are after us back to cranwell ere you be taken  christopher thought for a moment then remembering that with but four men and cumbered by two women it was not possible to cut his way through so great a force and admonished by that sound of advancing hoofs he gave a sudden order they turned about and not too soon for as they did so scarce two hundred yards away the first of the abbots horsemen appeared plunging towards them up the slope then the race began and well for them was it that their horses were good and fresh since before ever they came in sight of cranwell towers the pursuers were not ninety yards behind but here on the flat their beasts scenting home answered nobly to whip and spur and drew ahead a little moreover those who watched within the house saw them and ran to the drawbridge when they were within fifty yards of the moat cicelys horse stumbled slipped and fell throwing her into the snow then recovered itself and galloped on alone christopher reined up alongside of her and as she rose frightened but unharmed put out his long arm and lifting her to the saddle in front of him plunged forward while those behind shouted yield  under this double burden his horse went but slowly still they reached the bridge before any could lay hands upon them and thundered over it  wind up shouted christopher and all there even the womenfolk laid hands upon the cranks the bridge began to rise but now five or six of the abbots folk dismounting sprang at it catching the end of it with their hands when it was about six feet in the air and holding on so that it could not be lifted but remained moving neither up nor down  leave go you knaves shouted christopher but by way of answer one of them with the help of his fellows scrambled on to the end of the bridge and stood there hanging to the chains  then christopher snatched a bow from the hand of a servingman and the arrow being already on the string again shouted  get off at your peril  in answer the man called out something about the commands of the lord abbot  christopher looking past him saw that others of the company had dismounted and were running towards the bridge if they reached it he knew well that the game was played so he hesitated no longer but aiming swiftly drew and loosed the bow at that distance he could not miss the arrow struck the man where his steel cap joined the mail beneath and pierced him through the throat so that he fell back dead the others scared by his fate loosed their hold so that now the bridge relieved of the weight upon it instantly rose up beyond their reach and presently came home and was made fast  as they afterwards discovered this man it may here be said was a captain of the abbots guard moreover it was he who had shot the arrow that killed sir john foterell some forty hours before striking him through the throat as it was fated that he himself should be struck thus then one of that good knights murderers reaped his just reward  now the men ran back out of range for they feared more arrows while christopher watched them go in silence cicely who stood by his side her hands held before her face to shut out the sight of death let them fall suddenly and turning to her husband said as she pointed to the corpse that lay upon the bloodstained snow of the roadway  how many more will follow him i wonder i think that is but the first throw of a long game husband  nay sweet he answered the second the first was cast two nights gone by kings grave mount in the forest yonder and blood ever calls for blood  aye she answered blood calls for blood then remembering that she was orphaned and what sort of a honeymoon hers was like to be she turned and sought her chamber weeping  now while christopher still stood irresolute for he was oppressed by the sense of this manslaying and knew not what he should do next he saw three men separate from the knot of soldiers and ride towards the towers one of whom held a white cloth above his head in token of parley then christopher went up into the little gateway turret followed by emlyn who crouched down behind the brick battlement so that she could see and hear without being seen having reached the further side of the moat he who held the white cloth threw back the hood of his long cape and they saw that it was the abbot of blossholme himself also that his dark eyes flashed and that his olivehued face was almost white with rage  why do you hunt me across my own park and come knocking so rudely at my doors my lord abbot asked christopher leaning on the parapet of the gateway  why do you work murder on my servant christopher harflete answered the abbot pointing to the dead man in the snow know you not that whoso sheds blood by man shall his blood be shed and that under our ancient charters here i have the right to execute justice on you as by gods holy name i swear that i will do he added in a choked voice  aye repeated christopher reflectively by man shall his blood be shed perhaps that is why this fellow died tell me abbot was he not one of those who rode by moonlight round kings grave lately and there chanced to meet sir john foterell  the shot was a random one yet it seemed that it went home at least the abbots jaw dropped and some words that were on his lips never passed them  i know naught of the meaning of your talk he said presently in a quieter voice or of how my late friend and neighbour sir johnmay god rest his soulcame to his end yet it is of him or rather of his that we must speak it seems that you have stolen his daughter a woman under age and by pretence of a false marriage as i fear brought her to shamea crime even fouler than this murder  nay by means of a true marriage i have brought her to such small honour as may be the share of christopher harfletes lawful wife if there be any virtue in the rites of holy church then gods own hand has bound us fast as man can be tied to woman and death is the only pope who can loose that knot  death repeated the abbot in a slow voice looking up at him very curiously for a little while he was silent then went on well his court is always open and he has many shrewd and instant messengers such as this and he pointed to the arrow in the neck of the slain soldier yet i am a man of peace and although you have murdered my servant i would settle our cause more gently if i may listen now sir christopher here is my offer yield up to me the person of cicely foterell  of cicely harflete interrupted christopher  of cicely foterell and i swear to you that no violence shall be done to her nor shall she be given to a husband till the king or his vicargeneral or whatever court he may appoint has passed judgment in this matter and declared this mock marriage of yours null and void  what broke in christopher scoffingly does the abbot of blossholme announce that the powers temporal of this realm have right of divorce ere now i have heard him argue differently and so have others when the case of queen catherine was in question  the abbot bit his lip but continued taking no heed  nor will i lay any complaint against you as to the death of my servant here for which otherwise you should hang that i will write down as an accident and further compensate his family now you have my offeranswer  and what if i refuse this same generous offer to surrender her whom i hold dearer than a thousand lives  then by virtue of my rights and authority i will take her by force christopher harflete and if harm should happen to come to you now or hereafter on your own head be it  at this christophers rage broke out  do you dare to threaten me a loyal englishman you false priest and foreign traitor he shouted whom all men know to be in the pay of spain and using the cover of a monks dress to plot against the land on which you fatten like a horseleech why was john foterell murdered in the forest two nights gone you wont answer then i will because he rode to court to prove the truth about you and your treachery and therefore you butchered him why do you claim my wife as your ward because you wish to steal her lands and goods to feed your plots and luxury you think you have bought friends at court and that for moneys sake those in power there will turn a blind eye to your crimes so it may be for a while but wait wait all eyes are not blind yonder nor all ears deaf that head of yours shall yet be lifted higher than you thinkso high that it sticks upon the top of blossholme towers a warning to all who would sell england to her enemies john foterell lies dead with your knaves arrow in his throat but jeffrey stokes is away with the writings and now do your worst clement maldon if you want my wife come take her  the abbot listened listened intently drinking in every ominous word his swarthy face went white with fear then turned black with rage the veins upon his forehead gathered into knots even from that distance christopher could see them he looked so evil that his countenance became twisted and ridiculous and christopher noting it burst into one of his hearty laughs  the abbot who was not accustomed to mockery whispered something to the two men who were with him whereon they lifted the crossbows which they carried and pulled trigger one quarel went wide and hit the wall of the house behind where it stuck fast in the joints of the studwork but the other better aimed smote christopher above the heart causing him to stagger but being shot from below and turned by the mail he wore glanced upwards over his left shoulder the men seeing that he was unhurt pulled their horses round and galloped off but christopher setting another arrow to the string of the bow he carried drew it to his ear covering the abbot  loose and make an end of him muttered emlyn from her shelter behind the parapet but christopher thought a moment then cried  stay a while sir abbot i have more to say to you  he took no heed who was also turning about  stay thundered christopher or i will kill that fine nag of yours then as the abbot still dragged upon the reins he let the arrow fly the aim was true enough right through the arch of the neck it sped cutting the cord between the bones so that the poor beast reared straight up and fell in a heap tumbling its rider off into the snow  now clement maldon cried christopher will you listen or will you bide with your horse and servant and hear no more till judgment day if you do not guess it learn that i have practised archery from my youth should you doubt hold up your hand and ill send a shaft between your fingers  the abbot who was shaken but unhurt rose slowly and stood there the dead horse on one side and the dead man on the other  speak he said in a muffled voice  my lord abbot went on christopher a minute ago you tried to murder me and had not my mail been good would have succeeded now your life is in my hand for as you have seen i do not miss those servants of yours are coming to your help call to them to halt or and he lifted the bow  the abbot obeyed and the men understanding stayed where they were at a distance but within earshot  you have a crucifix upon your breast continued christopher take it in your right hand now and swear an oath  again the abbot obeyed  swear thus he said emlyn who was crouched beneath the parapet prompting him from time to time i clement maldon abbot of blossholme in the presence of almighty god in heaven and of christopher harflete and others upon earth and he jerked his head backwards towards the windows of the house where all therein were gathered listening make oath upon the symbol of the rood i swear that i abandon all claim of wardship over the body of cicely harflete born cicely foterell the lawful wife of christopher harflete and all claim to the lands and goods that she may possess or that were possessed by her father john foterell knight or by her mother dame foterell deceased i swear that i will raise no suit in any court spiritual or temporal of this or other realms against the said cicely harflete or against the said christopher harflete her husband nor seek to work injury to their bodies or their souls or to the bodies or the souls of any who cling to them and that henceforth they may live and die in peace from me or any whom i control set your lips to the rood and swear thus now clement maldon  the abbot hearkened and so great was his rage for he had no meek heart that he seemed to swell like an angry toad  who gave you authority to administer oaths to me he asked at length ill not swear and he cast the crucifix down upon the snow  then ill shoot answered christopher come pick up that cross  but maldon stood silent his arms folded on his breast christopher aimed and loosed and so great was his skillfor there were few archers in england like to himthat the arrow pierced maldons fur cap and carried it away without touching the shaven head beneath  the next shall be two inches lower he said as he set another on the string i waste no more good shafts  then very slowly to save his life which he loved well enough maldon bent down and lifting the crucifix from the snow held it to his lips and kissed it muttering  i swear but the oath he swore was very different to that which christopher had repeated to him for like a hunted fox he knew how to meet guile with guile  now that i a consecrated abbot deeming it right that i should live on to fulfil my work on earth have done your bidding have i leave to go about my business christopher harflete he asked with bitter irony  why not asked christopher only be pleased henceforth not to meddle with me and my business tomorrow i wish to ride to london with my lady and we do not seek your company on the road  then having found his cap the abbot turned and walked back towards his own men drawing the arrow from it as he went and presently all of them rode away over the rise towards blossholme  now that is well finished and i have an oath that he will scarcely dare to break said christopher presently what say you nurse  i say that you are even a bigger simpleton than i took you to be answered emlyn angrily as she rose and stretched herself for her limbs were cramped the oath pshaw by now he is absolved from it as given under fear did you not hear me whisper to you to put an arrow through his heart instead of playing boys pranks with his cap  i did not wish to kill an abbot nurse  foolish man what is the difference in such a matter between him and one of his servants moreover he will only say that you tried to slay him and missed and produce the cap and arrow in evidence against you well my talk serves nothing to mend a bad matter and soon you will hear it straighter from himself go now and make your house ready for attack and never dare to set a foot without its doors for death waits you there  emlyn was right within three hours an unarmed monk trudged up to cranwell towers through the falling snow and cast across the moat a letter that was tied to a stone then he nailed a writing to one of the oak posts of the outer gate and without a word departed as he had come in the presence of christopher and cicely emlyn opened and read this second letter as she had read the first it was short and ran   take notice sir christopher harflete and all others whom it may concern that the oath which i clement maldon abbot of blossholme swore to you this day is utterly void and of none effect having been wrung from me under the threat of instant death take notice further that a report of the murder which you have done has been forwarded to the kings grace and to the sheriff and other officers of this county and that by virtue of my rights and authority ecclesiastical and civil i shall proceed to possess myself of the person of cicely foterell my ward and of the lands and other property held by her father sir john foterell deceased upon the former of which i have already entered on her behalf and by exercise of such force as may be needful to seize you christopher harflete and to hand you over to justice further by means of notice sent herewith i warn all that cling to you and abet you in your crimes that they will do so at the peril of their souls and bodies  clement maldon abbot of blossholme    chapter v  what passed at cranwell  a week had gone by for the first three days of that time little of note had happened at cranwell towers that is no assault was delivered only christopher and his dozen or so of houseservants and small tenants discovered that they were quite surrounded once or twice some of them rode out a little way to be hunted back again by a much superior force which emerged from the copses near by or from cottages in the village and even from the porch of the church with these men they never came to close quarters so that no lives were lost in a fashion this was a disadvantage to them since they lacked the excitement of actual fighting the dread of which was ever present but not its joy  meanwhile in other ways things went ill with them thus first of all their beer gave out and then such other cordials as they had so that they were reduced to water to drink next their fuel became exhausted for nearly all the stock of it was kept at the farmstead about a quarter of a mile away and on the second day of the siege this stead was fired and burned with its contents the cattle and horses being driven off they knew not where  so it came about at length they could keep only one fire in the kitchen and that but small which in the end they were obliged to feed with the doors of the outhouses and even with the floorings torn out of the attics in order that they might cook their food nor was there much of this only a store of salt meat and some pickled pork and smoked bacon together with a certain amount of oatmeal and flour that they made into cakes and bread  on the fourth day however these gave out so that they were reduced to a scanty diet of hung flesh with a few apples by way of vegetables and hot water to drink to warm them at length too there was nothing more to burn and therefore they must eat their meat raw and grew sick on it moreover a cold thaw set in and the house grew icy so that they moved about it with chattering teeth and at night illnurtured as they were could scarce keep the life in them beneath all the coverings which they had  ah how long were those nights with never a blaze upon the hearth or so much as a candle to light them at four oclock the darkness came down which did not lessen for the moon grew low and the mists were thick until day broke about seven on the following morning and all this time fearing attack they must keep watch and ward through the gloom so that even sleep was denied them  for a while they bore up bravely even the tenants though news was shouted to these that their steads had been harried and their wives and children hunted off to seek shelter where they might  cicely and emlyn never murmured indeed this newmade wife kept her dreadful honeymoon with a cheerful face trudging through the black hours around the circle of the moat at her husbands side or from windowplace to windowplace in the empty rooms till at length they cast themselves down upon some bed to sleep a while giving over the watch to others only emlyn never seemed to sleep but at length their companions did begin to murmur  one morning at the dawn after a very bitter night they waited upon christopher and told him that they were willing to fight for his sake and his ladys but that as there was no hope of help they could no longer freeze and starve in short that they must either escape from the house or surrender he listened to them patiently knowing that what they said was true and then consulted for a while with cicely and emlyn  our case is desperate dear wife now what shall we do who have no chance of succour since none know of our plight yield or strive to escape through the darkness  not yield i think answered cicely choking back a sob if we yield certainly they will separate us and that merciless abbot will bring you to your death and me to a nunnery  that may happen in any case muttered christopher turning his head aside but what say you nurse  i say fight for it answered emlyn boldly it is certain that we cannot stay here for to be plain sir christopher there are some among us whom i do not trust what wonder their stomachs are empty their hands are blue their wives and children are they know not where and the heavy curse of the church hangs over them all of which things may be mended if they play you false let us take what horses remain and slip away at dead of night if we can or if we cannot then let us die as many better folk have done before  so they agreed to try their fortune thinking that it was so bad it could not be worse and spent the rest of that day in getting ready as best they could the seven horses still stood in the stable and although they were stiff from want of exercise had been hayfed and watered on these they proposed to ride but first they must tell the truth to those who had stood by them so about three oclock of the afternoon christopher called all the men together beneath the gateway and sorrowfully set out his tale here he showed them they could bide no longer and to surrender meant that his newwed wife would soon be made a widow therefore they must fly taking with them as many as there were horses for them to ride if they cared to risk such a journey if not he and the two women would go alone  now four of the stoutesthearted of them men who had served him and his father for many years stepped forward saying that evil as these seemed to be they would follow his fortunes to the last he thanked them shortly whereon one of the others asked what they were to do and if he proposed to desert them after leading them into this plight  god knows i would rather die he replied with a swelling heart but my friends consider the case if i bide here what of my wife alas it has come to this that you must choose whether you will slip out with us and scatter in the woods where i think you will not be followed since yonder abbot has no quarrel against you or whether you will wait here and tomorrow at the dawn surrender in either event you can say that i compelled you to stand by us and that you have shed no mans blood also i will give you a writing  so they talked together gloomily and at last announced that when he and their lady went they would go also and get off as best they could but there was a man among them a small farmer named jonathan dicksey who thought otherwise this jonathan who held his land under christopher had been forced to this business of the defence of cranwell towers somewhat against his will namely by the pressure of christophers largest tenant to whose daughter he was affianced he was a sly young man and even during the siege by means that need not be described he had contrived to convey a message to the abbot of blossholme telling him that had it been in his power he would gladly be in any other place therefore as he knew well whatever had happened to others his farm remained unharried now he determined to be out of a bad business as soon as he might for jonathan was one of those who liked to stand upon the winning side  therefore although he said aye aye more loudly than his comrades as soon as the dusk had fallen while the others were making ready the horses and mounting guard jonathan thrust a ladder across the moat at the back of the stable and clambered along its rungs into the shelter of a cattleshed in the meadow and so away  halfanhour later he stood before the abbot in the cottage where he had taken up his quarters having contrived to blunder among his people and be captured to him at first jonathan would say nothing but when at length they threatened to take him out and hang him to save his life as he said he found his tongue and told all  so so said the abbot when he had finished now god is good to us we have these birds in our net and i shall keep st hilarys at blossholme after all for your services master dicksey you shall be my reeve at cranwell towers when they are in my hands  but here it may be said that in the end things went otherwise since so far from getting the stewardship of cranwell when the truth came to be known jonathans maiden would have no more to do with him and the folk in those parts sacked his farm and hunted him out of the country so that he was never heard of among them again  meanwhile all being ready christopher at the towers was closeted with cicely taking his farewell of her in the dark for no light was left to them  this is a desperate venture he said to her nor can i tell how it will end or if ever i shall see your sweet face again yet dearest we have been happy together for some few hours and if i fall and you live on i am sure that you will always remember me till as we are taught we meet again where no enemy has the power to torment us and cold and hunger and darkness are not cicely if that should be so and any child should come to you teach it to love the father whom it never saw  now she threw her arms about him and wept and wept and wept  if you die she sobbed surely i will do so also for although i am but young i find this world a very evil place and now that my father is gone without you husband it would be a hell  nay nay he answered live on while you may for who knows often out of the worst comes the best at least we have had our joy swear it now sweet  aye if you will swear it also for i may be taken and you left in the dark swords do not choose let us promise that we will both endure our lives together or separate until god calls us  so they swore there in the icy gloom and sealed the oath with kisses  now the time was come at last and they crept their way to the courtyard hand in hand taking some comfort because the night was very favourable to their project the snow had melted and a great gale blew from the souwest boisterous but not cold which caused the tall elms that stood about to screech and groan like things alive in such a wind as this they were sure that they would not be heard nor could they be seen beneath that murky starless sky while the rain which fell between the gusts would wash out the footprints of their horses  they mounted silently and with the four menfor by now all the rest had gonerode across the drawbridge which had been lowered in preparation for their flight three hundred yards or so away their road ran through an ancient marlpit worked out generations before in which selfsown trees grew on either side of the path as they drew near this place suddenly in the silence of the night a horse neighed ahead of them and one of their beasts answered to the neigh  halt whispered cicely whose ears were made sharp by fear i hear men moving  they pulled rein and listened yes between the gusts of wind there was a faint sound as of the clanking of armour they strained their eyes in the darkness but could see nothing again the horse neighed and was answered one of their servants cursed the beast beneath his breath and struck it savagely with the flat of his sword whereon being fresh it took the bit between its teeth and bolted another minute and there arose a great clamour from the marlpit in front of thema noise of shoutings of swordstrokes and then a heavy groan as from the lips of a dying man  an ambush exclaimed christopher  can we get round asked cicely and there was terror in her voice  nay he answered the stream is in flood we should be bogged hark they charge us back to the towersthere is no other way  so they turned and fled followed by shouts and the thunder of many horses galloping in two minutes they were there and across the bridgethe women christopher and the three men who were left  up with the bridge cried christopher and they leapt from their saddles and fumbled for the cranks too late for already the abbots horsemen pressed it down  then a fight began the horses of the enemy shrank back from the trembling bridge so their riders dismounting rushed forward to be met by christopher and his three remaining men who in that narrow place were as good as a hundred wild random blows were struck in the darkness and as it chanced two of the abbots people fell whereon a deep voice cried  come back and wait for light  when they had gone dragging off their wounded with them christopher and his servants again strove to wind up the bridge only to find that it would not stir  some traitor has fouled the chains he said in the quiet voice of despair cicely and emlyn get you into the house i and any who will bide with me stay here to see this business out when i am down yield yourself afterwards i think that the king will give you justice if you can come to him  ill not go she wailed ill die with you  nay you shall go he said stamping his foot and as he spoke an arrow hissed between them emlyn drag her hence ere she is shot swift i say swift or gods curse and mine rest on you unclasp your arms wife how can i fight while you hang about my neck what must i strike you then there and there  she loosed her grasp and groaning fell back upon the breast of emlyn who half led half carried her across the courtyard where their scared horses galloped loose  whither go we sobbed cicely  to the central tower answered emlyn it seems safest there  to this tower whence the place took its name they groped their way unlike the rest of the house which for the most part was of wood it was built of stone being part of an older fabric dating from the norman days slowly they stumbled up the steps till at length they reached the roof for some instinct prompted them to find a spot whence they could see should the stars break out here on this lofty perch they crouched them down and waited the end whatever it might bewaited in silence  a while passedthey never knew how longtill at length a sudden flame shot up above the roof of the kitchens at the rear which the wind caught and blew on to the timbers of the main building so that presently this began to blaze also the house had been fired by whom was never known though it was said that the traitor jonathan dicksey had returned and done it either for a bribe or that his own sin might be forgotten in this great catastrophe  the house burns said emlyn in her quiet voice now if you would save your life follow me beneath this tower is a vault where no flame can touch us  but cicely would not stir for by the fierce and evergrowing light she could see what passed beneath and as it chanced the wind blew the smoke away from them there beyond the drawbridge were gathered the abbey guards and there in the gateway stood christopher and his three men with drawn swords while in the courtyard the horses galloped madly screaming in their fear a soldier looked up and saw the two women standing on the top of the tower then called out something to the abbot who sat on horseback near to him he looked and saw also  yield sir christopher he shouted the lady cicely burns yield that we may save her  christopher turned and saw also for a moment he hesitated then wheeled round to run across the courtyard too late for as he came the flames burst through the main roof of the house and the timber front of it blazing furiously fell outwards blocking the doorway so that the place became a furnace into which none might enter and live  now a madness seemed to take hold of him for a moment he stared up at the figures of the two women standing high above the rolling smoke and wrapping flame then with his three men he charged with a roar into the crowd of soldiers who had followed him into the courtyard striving it would seem to cut his way to the abbot who lurked behind it was a dreadful sight for he and those with him fought furiously and many went down presently of the four only christopher was left upon his feet swords and spears smote upon his armour but he did not fall it was those in front of him who fell a great fellow with an axe got behind him and struck with all his might upon his helm the sword dropped from harfletes hand slowly he turned about looked upward then stretched out his arms and fell heavily to earth  the abbot leapt from his horse and ran to him kneeling at his side  dead he cried and began to shrive his passing soul or so it seemed  dead repeated emlyn and a gallant death  dead wailed cicely in so terrible a voice that all below heard it dead dead and sank senseless on emlyns breast  at that moment the rest of the roof fell in hiding the tower in spouts and veils of flame here they might not stay if they would live lifting her mistress in her strong arms as she was wont to do when she was little emlyn found the head of the stair so that when the wind blew the smoke aside for an instant those below saw that both had vanished as they thought withered in the fire  now you can enter on the shefton lands abbot cried a voice from the darkness of the gateway though in the turmoil none knew who spoke but not for all england would i bear that innocent blood  the abbots face turned ghastly and though it was hot enough in that courtyard his teeth chattered  it is on the head of this womanthief he exclaimed with an effort looking down on christopher who lay at his feet take him up that inquest may be held on him who died doing murder can none enter the house his pocket full of gold to him who saves the lady cicely  can any enter hell and live answered the same voice out of the smoke and gloom seek her sweet soul in heaven if you may come there abbot  then with scared faces they lifted up christopher and the other dead and wounded and carried them away leaving cranwell towers to burn itself to ashes for so fierce was the heat that none could bide there longer    two hours had gone by the abbot sat in the little room of a cottage at cranwell that he had occupied during the siege of the towers it was near midnight yet weary as he was he could not rest indeed had the night been less foul and dark he would have spent the time in riding back to blossholme his heart was ill at ease things had gone well with him it is true sir john foterell was deadslain by outlawed men sir christopher harflete was deaddid not his body lie in the neathouse yonder cicely daughter of the one and wife to the other was dead also burned in the fire at the towers so that doubtless the precious gems and the wide lands he coveted would fall into his lap without further trouble for cromwell being bribed who would try to snatch them from the powerful abbot of blossholme and had he not a title to themof a sort  and yet he was very ill at ease for as that voice had saidwhose voice was it he wondered somehow it seemed familiarthe blood of these people lay on his head and there came into his mind the text of holy writ which he had quoted to christopher that he who shed mans blood by man should his blood be shed also although he had paid the vicargeneral to back him monks were in no great favour at the english court and if this story travelled there as it might for even the strengthless dead find friends it was possible that questions would be asked questions hard to answer before heaven he could justify himself for all that he had done but before king henry who would usurp the powers of the very pope if the truth should chance to reach the royal earah that was another matter  the room was cold after the heat of that great fire his southern blood which had been warm enough grew chill loneliness and depression took hold of him he began to wonder how far in the eyes of god above the end justifies the means he opened the door of the place and holding on to it lest the rough wintry gale should tear it from its frail hinges shouted aloud for brother martin one of his chaplains  presently martin arrived emerging from the cattleshed a lantern in his handa tall thin man with perplexed and melancholy eyes long nose and a clever faceand bowing asked his superiors pleasure  my pleasure brother answered the abbot is that you shut the door and keep out the wind for this accursed climate is killing me yes make up the fire if you can but the wood is too wet to burn also it smokes there what did i tell you if this goes on we shall be hams by tomorrow morning let it be for after all we have seen enough of fires tonight and sit down to a cup of winenay i forgot you drink but waterwell then to a bite of bread and meat  i thank you my lord abbot answered martin but i may not touch flesh this is friday  friday or no we have touched fleshthe flesh of menup at the towers yonder this night answered the abbot with an uneasy laugh still obey your conscience brother and eat bread soon it will be midnight and the meat can follow  the lean monk bowed and taking a hunch of bread began to bite at it for he was almost starving  have you come from watching by the body of that bloody and rebellious man who has worked us so much harm and loss asked the abbot presently  the secretary nodded then swallowing a crust said  aye i have been praying over him and the others at least he was brave and it must be hard to see ones newwed wife burn like a witch also now that i come to study the matter i know not what his sin was who did but fight bravely when he was attacked for without doubt the marriage is good and whether he should have waited to ask your leave to make it is a point that might be debated through every court in christendom  the abbot frowned not appreciating this open and judicial tone in matters that touched him so nearly  you have honoured me of late by choosing me as one of your confessors though i think you do not tell me everything my lord abbot therefore i bare my mind to you continued brother martin apologetically  speak on then man what do you mean  i mean that i do not like this business he answered slowly in the intervals of munching at his bread you had a quarrel with sir john foterell about those lands which you say belong to the abbey god knows the right of it for i understand no law but he denied it for did i not hear it yonder in your chamber at blossholme he denied it and accused you of treason enough to hang all blossholme of which again god knows the truth you threatened him in your anger but he and his servant were armed and won out and next day the two of them rode for london with certain papers well that night sir john foterell was killed in the forest though his servant stokes escaped with the papers now who killed him  the abbot looked at him then seemed to take a sudden resolution  our people those menatarms whom i have gathered for the defence of our house and the church my orders to them were to seize him living but the old english bull would not yield and fought so fiercely that it ended otherwiseto my sorrow  the monk put down his bread for which he seemed to have no further appetite  a dreadful deed he said for which one day you must answer to god and man  for which we all must answer corrected the abbot down to the last laybrother and soldieryou as much as any of us brother for were you not present at our quarrel  so be it abbot being innocent i am ready but that is not the end of it the lady cicely on hearing of this murdernay be not wrath i know no other name for itand learning that you claimed her as your ward flies to her affianced lover sir christopher harflete and that very day is married to him by the parish priest in yonder church  it was no marriage due notice had not been given moreover how could my ward be wed without my leave  she had not been served with notice of your wardship if such exists or so she declared replied martin in his quiet obstinate voice i think that there is no court in europe which would void this open marriage when it learned that the parties lived a while as man and wife and were so received by those about themno not the pope himself  he who says that he is no lawyer still sets out the law broke in maldon sarcastically well what does it matter seeing that death has voided it husband and wife if such they were are both dead it is finished  no for now they lay their appeal in the court of heaven to which every one of us is summoned and heaven can stir up its ministers on earth oh i like it not i like it not and i mourn for those two so loving brave and young their blood and that of many more is on our handsfor what a stretch of upland and of marsh which the king or others may seize tomorrow  the abbot seemed to cower beneath the weight of these sad earnest words and for a little while there was silence then he plucked up courage and said  i am glad that you remember that their blood is on your hands as well as mine since now perhaps you will keep them hidden  he rose and walked to the door and the window to see that none were without then returned and exclaimed fiercely  fool do you then think that these deeds were done to win a new estate true it is that those lands are ours by right and we need their revenues but there is more behind the whole church of this realm is threatened by that accursed son of belial who sits upon the throne why what is it now man  only that i am an englishman and love not to hear englands king called a son of belial his sins i know are many and black like those of othersstill son of belial let his highness hear it and that name alone is enough to hang you  well then angel of grace if it suits you better at the least we are threatened against the law of god and man our blessed queen catherine of spain is thrust away in favour of the slut who fills her place even now i have tidings from kimbolton that she lies dying there of slow poison so they say and i believe also i have other tidings fisher and more being murdered parliament next month will be moved to strike at the lesser monasteries and steal their goods and after them our turn will come but we will not bear it tamely for ere this new year is out all england shall be ablaze and i clement maldon ii will light the fire now you have the truth martin will you betray me as that dead knight would have done  nay my lord abbot your secrets are safe with me am i not your chaplain and does not this wilful and rebellious king of ours work much mischief against god and his servants yet i tell you that i like it not and cannot see the end we english are a stiffnecked folk whom you of spain do not understand and will never break and henry is strong and subtle moreover his people love him  i knew that i could trust you martin and the proof of it is that i have spoken to you so openly went on maldon in a gentler voice well you shall hear all the great emperor of germany and spain is on our side as seeing his blood and faith he must be he will avenge the wrongs of the church and of his royal aunt i who know him am his agent here and what i do is done at his bidding but i must have more money than he finds me and that is why i stirred in this matter of the shefton lands also the lady cicely had jewels of vast price though i fear greatly lest they should have been lost in the fire this night  filthy lucrethe root of all evil muttered brother martin  aye and of all good money moneyi must have more money to bribe men and buy arms to defend that stronghold of heaven the church what matters it if lives are lost so that the immortal church holds her own let them go my friend you are fearful these deaths weigh upon your soulaye and on mine i loved that girl whom as a babe i held in my arms and even her rough father i loved him for his honest heart although he always mistrusted me the spaniardand rightly the knight harflete too who lies yonder he was of a brave breed but not one who would have served our turn well they are gone and for these bloodsheddings we must find absolution  if we can  oh we can we can already i have it in my pouch under a seal you know and for our bodies fear not there is such a gale rising in england as will blow out this petty breeze a question of rights some arrows shot a fire and lives lostwhat of that when it agitates betwixt powers temporal and spiritual and which of them shall hold the sceptre in this mighty britain martin i have a mission for you that may lead you to a bishopric ere all is done for thats your mind and aim and if you would put off your doubts and moodiness youve got the brain to rule that ship the great yarmouth which sailed for spain some days ago has been beat back into the river and should weigh anchor again tomorrow morning i have letters for the spanish court and you shall take them with my verbal explanations which i will give you presently for they would hang us and may not be trusted to writing she is bound for seville but you will follow the emperor wherever he may be you will go wont you and he glanced at him sideways  i obey orders answered martin though i know little of spaniards or of spanish  in every town the benedictines have a monastery and in every monastery interpreters and you shall be accredited to them all who are of that great brotherhood well tis settled go make ready as best you can i must write stay the sooner this harflete is under ground the better bid that sturdy fellow bolle find the sexton of the church and help dig his grave for we will bury him at dawn now go go i tell you i must write come back in an hour and i will give you money for your faring also my secret messages  brother martin bowed and went  a dangerous man muttered the abbot as the door closed on him too honest for our game and too much an englishman that native spirit peeps beneath his cowl a monk should have no country and no kin well he will learn a trick or two in spain and ill make sure they keep him there a while now for my letters and he sat down at the rude table and began to write  halfanhour later the door opened and martin entered  what is it now asked the abbot testily i said come back in an hour  aye you said that but i have good news for you that i thought you might like to hear  out with it then man its scarce nowadays have they found those jewels no how could they the place still flares and he glanced through the windowplace whats the news  better than jewels christopher harflete is not dead while i was praying over him he turned his head and muttered i think he is only stunned you are skilled in medicine come look at him  a minute later and the abbot knelt over the senseless form of christopher where it lay on the filthy floor of the neathouse by the light of the lanterns with deft fingers he felt his wounded head from which the shattered casque had been removed and afterwards his heart and pulse  the skull is cut but not broken he said my judgment is that though he may lie unsensed for days if fed and tended this man will live being so young and strong but if left alone in this cold place he will be dead by morning and perhaps he is better dead and he looked at martin  that would be murder indeed answered the secretary come let us bear him to the fire and pour milk down his throat we may save him yet lift you his feet and i will take his head  the abbot did so not very willingly as it seemed to martin but rather as one who has no choice  halfanhour later when the hurts of christopher had been dressed with ointment and bound up and milk poured down his throat which he swallowed although he was so senseless the abbot looking at him said to martin  you gave orders for this harfletes burial did you not  the monk nodded  then have you told any that he needs no grave at present  no one except yourself  the abbot thought a while rubbing his shaven chin  i think the funeral should go forward he said presently look not so frightened i do not purpose to inter him living but there is a dead man lying in that shed andrew woods my servant the scotch soldier whom harflete slew he has no friends here to claim him and these two were of much the same height and breadth shrouded in a blanket none would know one body from the other and it will be thought that andrew was buried with the rest let him be promoted in his death and fill a knights grave  to what purpose would you play so unholy a trick which must moreover be discovered in a day seeing that sir christopher lives asked martin staring at him  for a very good purpose my friend it is well that sir christopher harflete should seem to die who if he is known to be alive has powerful kin in the south who will bring much trouble on us  do you mean if so before god i will have no hand in it  i saidseem to die where are your wits tonight answered the abbot with irritation sir christopher travels with you to spain as our sick brother luiz who like myself is of that country and desires to return there as we know but is too ill to do so you will nurse him and on the ship he will die or recover as god wills if he recovers our brotherhood will show him hospitality at seville notwithstanding his crimes and by the time that he reaches england again which may not be for a long while men will have forgotten all this fray in a greater that draws on nor will he be harmed seeing that the lady whom he pretends to have married is dead beyond a doubt as you can tell him should he find his understanding  a strange game muttered martin  strange or no it is my game which i must play therefore question not but be obedient and silent also on your oath replied the abbot in a cold hard voice that covered litter which was brought here for the wounded is in the next chamber wrap this man in blankets and a monks robe and we will place him in it then let him be borne to blossholme as one of the dead by brethren who will ask no questions and ere dawn on to the ship great yarmouth if he still lives it lies near the quay not halfamile from the abbey gate be swift now and help me i will overtake you with the letters and see that you are furnished with all things needful from our store also i must speak with the captain ere he weighs anchor waste no more time in talking but obey and be secret  i obey and i will be secret as is my duty answered brother martin bowing his head humbly but what will be the end of all this business god and his angels know alone i say that i like it not  a very dangerous man muttered the abbot as he watched martin go he also must bide a while in spain a long while ill see to it    chapter vi  emlyns curse  just before the wild dawn broke on the morrow of the burning of the towers a corpse roughly shrouded was borne from the village into the churchyard of cranwell where a shallow grave had been dug for its last home  whom do we bury in such haste asked the tall thomas bolle who had delved the grave alone in the dark for his orders were urgent and the sexton was fled away from these tumults  that man of blood sir christopher harflete who has caused us so much loss said the old monk who had been bidden to perform the office as the clergyman father necton had gone also fearing the vengeance of the abbot for his part in the marriage of cicely a sad story a very sad story wedded by night and now buried by night both of them one in the flame and one in the earth truly o god thy judgments are wonderful and woe to those who lift hands against thine anointed ministers  very wonderful answered bolle as standing in the grave he took the head of the body and laid it down between his straddled feet so wonderful that a plain man wonders what will be the wondrous end of them also why this noble young knight has grown so wondrously lighter than he used to be trouble and hunger in those burnt towers i suppose why did they not set him in the vault with his ancestors it would have saved me a lonely job among the ghosts that haunt this place what do you say father because the stone is cemented down and the entrance bricked up and there is no mason to be found then why not have waited till one could be fetched oh it is wonderful all wonderful but who am i that i should dare to ask questions when the lord abbot orders the laybrother obeys for he also is wonderfula wonderful abbot  there he is tidy nowstraight on his back and his feet pointing to the east at least i hope so for i could take no good bearings in the dark and the whole wonderful story comes to its wonderful end so give me your hand out of this hole father and say your prayers over the sinful body of this wicked fellow who dared to marry the maid he loved and to let out the souls of certain holy monks or rather of their hired rufflers for monks dont fight because they wished to separate those whom godi mean the devilhad joined together and to add their temporalities to the estate of mother church  then the old priest who was shivering with cold and understood little of this dark talk began to mumble his ritual skipping those parts of it which he could not remember so another grain was planted in the cornfields of death and immortality though when and where it should grow and what it should bear he neither knew nor cared who wished to escape from fears and fightings back to his accustomed cell  it was done and he and the bearers departed beating their way against the rough raw wind and leaving thomas bolle to fill in the grave which so long as they were in sight or rather hearing he did with much vigour when they were gone however he descended into the hole under pretence of trampling the loose soil and there to be out of the wind sat himself down upon the feet of the corpse and waited full of reflections  sir christopher dead he muttered to himself i knew his grandfather when i was a lad and my grandfather told me that he knew his grandfathers greatgrandfathersay three hundred years of themand now i sit on the cold toes of the last of the lot butchered like a mad ox in his own yard by a spanish priest and his hirelings to win his wifes goods oh yes it is wonderful all very wonderful and the lady cicely dead burnt like a common witch and emlyn deademlyn whom i have hugged many a time in this very churchyard before they whipped her into marrying that fat old grieve and made a monk of me  well i had her first kiss and by the saints how she cursed old stower all the way down yonder path i stood behind that tree and heard her she said he would die soon and he did and his brat with him she said she would dance on his grave and she did i saw her do it in the moonlight the night after he was buried dressed in white she danced on his grave she always kept her promises did emlyn thats her blood if her mother had not been a gypsy witch she wouldnt have married a spaniard when every man in the place was after her for her beautiful eyes emlyn is a witch too or was for they say she is dead but i cant think it she isnt the sort that dies still she must be dead and thats good for my soul oh miserable man what are you thinking get behind me satan if you can find room a grave is no place for you satan but i wish you were in it with me emlyn you must have been a witch since after you i could never fancy any other woman which is against nature for alls fish that comes to a mans net evidently a witch of the worst sort but my darling witch or no i wish you werent dead and ill break that abbots neck for you yet if it costs me my soul oh emlyn my darling my darling do you remember how we kissed in the copse by the river never was there a woman who could love like you  so he moaned on rocking himself to and fro on the legs of the corpse till at length a wild ray from the red risen sun crept into the darksome hole lighting first of all upon a mouldering skull which bolle had thrown back among the soil he rose up and pitched it out with a word that should not have passed the lips of a laybrother even as such thoughts should not have passed his mind then he set himself to a task which he had planned in the intervals of his amorous meditationsa somewhat grizzly task  drawing his knife from its sheath he cut the rough stitching of the graveclothes and with numb hands dragged them away from the bodys head  the light went out behind a cloud but not to waste time he began to feel the face  sir christophers nose wasnt broken he muttered to himself unless it were in that last fray and then the bone would be loose and this is stiff no no he had a very pretty nose  the light came again and thomas peered down at the dead face beneath him then suddenly burst into a hoarse laugh  by all the saints heres another of our spaniards tricks it is drunken andrew the scotchman turned into a dead english knight christopher killed him and now he is christopher but wheres christopher  he thought a little while then jumping out of the grave began to fill it in with all his might  youre christopher he said well stop christopher until i can prove youre andrew goodbye sir andrew christopher i am off to seek your betters if you are dead who may not be alive emlyn herself perhaps after this oh the devil is playing a merry game round old cranwell towers tonight and thomas bolle will take a hand in it  he was right the devil was playing a merry game at least so thought others beside thomas for instance that misguided but honest bigot martin as he contemplated the still senseless form of christopher who rechristened brother luiz had been safely conveyed aboard the great yarmouth and now whether dead or living which he was not sure lay in the little cabin that had been allotted to the two of them almost did martin as he looked at him and shook his bald head seem to smell brimstone in that close place which as he knew well was the fiends favourite scent  the captain also a sourfaced mariner with a squint known in dunwich whence he hailed as miser goody because of his earnestness in pursuing wealth and his skill in hoarding it seemed to feel the unhallowed influence of his satanic majesty so far everything had gone wrong upon this voyage which already had been delayed six weeks that is till the very worst period of the year while he waited for certain mysterious letters and cargo which his owners said he must carry to seville then he had sailed out of the river with a fair wind only to be beaten back by fearful weather that nearly sank the ship  item six of his best men had deserted because they feared a trip to spain at that season and he had been obliged to take others at hazard among them was a broadshouldered blackbearded fellow clad in a leather jerkin with spurs upon his heelsbloody spursthat he seemed to have found no time to take off this hard rider came aboard in a skiff after the anchor was up and having cast the skiff adrift offered good money for a passage to spain or any other foreign port and paid it down upon the nail he goody had taken the money though with a doubtful heart and given a receipt to the name of charles smith asking no questions since for this gold he need not account to the owners afterwards also the man having put off his spurs and soldiers jerkin set himself to work among the crew some of whom seemed to know him and in the storm that followed showed that he was stouthearted and useful though not a skilled sailor  still he mistrusted him of charles smith and his bloody spurs and had he not been so shorthanded and taken the knaves broad pieces would have liked to set him ashore again when they were driven back into the river especially as he heard that there had been manslaying about blossholme and that sir john foterell lay slaughtered in the forest perhaps this charles smith had murdered him well if so it was no affair of his and he could not spare a hand  now when at length the weather had moderated just as he was hauling up his anchor comes the abbot of blossholme on whose will he had been bidden to wait with a leanfaced monk and another passenger said to be a sick religious wrapped up in blankets and to all appearance dead  why wondered that astute mariner goody should a sick monk wear harness for he felt it through the blankets as he helped him up the ladder although monks shoes were stuck upon his feet and why as he saw when the covering slipped aside for a moment was his crown bound up with bloody cloths  indeed he ventured to question the abbot as to this mysterious matter while his lordship was paying the passage money in his cabin only to get a very sharp answer  were you not commanded to obey me in all things captain goody and does obedience lie in prying out my business another word and i will report you to those in spain who know how to deal with mischiefmakers if you would see dunwich again hold your peace  your pardon my lord abbot said goody but things go so upon this ship that i grow afraid that is an ill voyage upon which one lifts anchor twice in the same port  you will not make them go better captain by seeking to nose out my affairs and those of the church do you desire that i should lay its curse upon you  nay your reverence i desire that you should take the curse off answered goody who was very superstitious do that and ill carry a dozen sick priests to spain even though they choose to wear chain shirtsfor penance  the abbot smiled then lifting his hand pronounced some words in latin which as he did not understand them goody found very comforting as they passed his lips the great yarmouth began to move for the sailors were hoisting up her anchor  as i do not accompany you on this voyage fare you well he said the saints go with you as shall my prayers since you will not pass the gibraltar straits where i hear many infidel pirates lurk given good weather your voyage should be safe and easy again farewell i commend brother martin and our sick friend to your keeping and shall ask account of them when we meet again  i pray it may not be this side of hell for i do not like that spanish abbot and his passengers dead or living thought goody to himself as he bowed him from the cabin  a minute later the abbot after a few earnest hurried words with martin began to descend the ladder to the boat that manned by his own people was already being drawn slowly through the water as he did so he glanced back and in the clinging mist of dawn which was almost as dense as wool caught sight of the face of a man who had been ordered to hold the ladder and knew it for that of jeffrey stokes who had escaped from the slaying of sir johnescaped with the damning papers that had cost his masters life yes jeffrey stokes no other his lips shaped themselves to call out something but before ever a syllable had passed them an accident happened  to the abbot it seemed as though the whole ship had struck him violently behindso violently that he was propelled headfirst among the rowers in the boat and lay there hurt and breathless  what is it called the captain who heard the noise  the abbot slipped or the ladder slipped i know not which answered jeffrey gruffly staring at the toe of his seaboot at least he is safe enough in the boat now and turning he vanished aft into the mist muttering to himself  a very good kick though a little high yet i wish it had been off another kind of ladder that murdering rogue would look well with a rope round his neck still i dared do no more and it served to stop his lying mouth before he betrayed me oh my poor master my poor old master    bruised and sore as he wasand he was very sorewithin little over an hour abbot maldon was back at the ruin of cranwell towers it seemed strange that he should go there but in truth his uneasy heart would not let him rest his plans had succeeded only far too well sir john foterell was deada crime no doubt but necessary for had the knight lived to reach london with that evidence in his pocket his own life and those of many others might have paid the price of it since who knows what truths may be twisted from a victim on the rack maldon had always feared the rack it was a nightmare that haunted his sleep although the ambitious cunning of his nature and the cause he served with heart and soul prompted him to put himself in continual danger of that fate  in an unguarded moment when his tongue was loosed with wine he had placed himself in the power of sir john foterell hoping to win him to the side of spain and afterwards forgetting it made of him a dreadful enemy therefore this enemy must die for had he lived not only might he himself have died in place of him but all his plans for the rebellion of the church against the crown must have come to nothing yes yes that deed was lawful and pardon for it assured should the truth become known till this morning he had hoped that it never would be known but now jeffrey stokes had escaped upon the ship great yarmouth  oh if only he had seen him a minute earlier if only somethingcould it have been that impious knave jeffrey he wonderedhad not struck him so violently in the back and hurled him to the boat where he lay almost senseless till the vessel had glided from them down the river well she was gone and jeffrey in her he was but a common servingman after all who if he knew anything would never have the wit to use his knowledge although it was true he had been wise enough to fly from england  no papers had been discovered upon sir johns body and no money without doubt the old knight had found time to pass them on to jeffrey who now fled the kingdom disguised as a sailor oh what ill chance had put him on board the same vessel with sir christopher harflete  well sir christopher would probably die were brother martin a little less of a fool he would certainly die but the fact remained that this monk though able in such matters was a fool with a conscience that would not suit itself to circumstances if christopher could be saved martin would save him as he had already saved him in the shed even if he handed him over to the inquisition afterwards still he might slip through his fingers or the vessel might be lost as was devoutly to be prayed and seemed not unlikely at this season of the year also the first opportunity must be taken to send certain messages to spain that might result in hampering the activities of brother martin and of sir christopher harflete if he lived to reach that land  meanwhile reflected maldon other things had gone wrong he had wished to proclaim his wardship over cicely and to immure her in a nunnery because of her great possessions which he needed for the cause but he had not wished her death indeed he was fond of the girl whom he had known from a child and her innocent blood was a weight that he ill could bear he who at heart always shrank from the shedding of blood still heaven had killed her not he and the matter could not now be mended also as she was dead her inheritance would he thought fall into his hands without further trouble for hea mitred abbot with a seat among the lords of the realmhad friends in london who for a fee could stifle inquiry into all this faroff business  no no he must not be fainthearted who after all had much for which to be thankful meanwhile the cause went onthat great cause of the threatened church to which he had devoted his life henry the heretic would fall the spanish emperor whose spy he was and who loved him well would invade and take england he would yet live to see the holy inquisition at work at westminster and himselfyes himself had it not been hinted to himenthroned at canterbury the cardinals red hat he coveted upon his head andoh glorious thoughtperhaps afterwards wearing the triple crown at rome    rain was falling heavily when the abbot with his escort of two monks and halfadozen menatarms rode up to cranwell the house was now but a smoking heap of ashes mingled with charred beams and burnt clay in the midst of which scarcely visible through the clouds of steam caused by the falling rain rose the grim old norman tower for on its stonework the flames had beat vainly  why have we come here asked one of the monks surveying the dismal scene with a shudder  to seek the bodies of the lady cicely and her woman and give them christian burial answered the abbot  after bringing them to a most unchristian death muttered the monk to himself then added aloud you were ever charitable my lord abbot and though she defied you such is that noble ladys due as for the nurse emlyn she was a witch and did but come to the end that she deserved if she be really dead  what mean you asked the abbot sharply  i mean that being a witch the fire may have turned from her  pray god then that it turned from her mistress also but it cannot be only a fiend could have lived in the heat of that furnace look even the tower is gutted  no it cannot be answered the monk so since we shall never find them let us chant the burial office over this great grave of theirs and begonethe sooner the better for yon place has a haunted look  not till we have searched out their bones which must be beneath the tower yonder whereon we saw them last replied the abbot adding in a low voice remember brother the lady cicely had jewels of great price which if they were wrapped in leather the fire may have spared and these are among our heritage at shefton they cannot be found therefore they must be here and the seeking of them is no task for common folk that is why i hurried hither so fast do you understand  the monk nodded his head having dismounted they gave their horses to the servingmen and began to make an examination of the ruin the abbot leaning on his inferiors arm for he was in great pain from the blow in the back that jeffrey had administered with his seaboot and the bruises which he had received in falling to the boat  first they passed under the gatehouse which still stood only to find that the courtyard beyond was so choked with smouldering rubbish that they could make no entryfor it will be remembered that the house had fallen outwards here however lying by the carcass of a horse they found the body of one of the men whom christopher had killed in his last stand and caused it to be borne out then followed by their people leaving the dead man in the gateway they walked round the ruin keeping on the inner side of the moat till they came to the little pleasaunce garden at its back  look said the monk in a frightened voice pointing to some scorched bushes that had been a bower  the abbot did so but for a while could see nothing because of the wreaths of steam presently a puff of wind blew these aside and there standing hand in hand he beheld the figures of two women his men beheld them also and called aloud that these were the ghosts of cicely and emlyn as they spoke the figures still hand in hand began to walk towards them and they saw that they were cicely and emlyn indeed but in the flesh quite unharmed  for a moment there was deep silence then the abbot asked  whence come you mistress cicely  out of the fire she answered in a small cold voice  out of the fire how did you live through the fire  god sent his angel to save us she answered again in that small voice  a miracle muttered the monk a true miracle  or mayhap emlyn stowers witchcraft exclaimed one of the men behind and maldon started at his words  lead me to my husband my lord abbot lest thinking me dead his heart should break said cicely  now again there was silence so deep that they could hear the patter of every drop of falling rain twice the abbot strove to speak but could not but at the third effort his words came  the man you call your husband but who was not your husband but your ravisher was slain in the fray last night cicely foterell  she stood quite quiet for a while as though considering his words then said in the same unnatural voice  you lie my lord abbot you were ever a liar like your father the devil for the angel told me so in the midst of the fire also he told me that though i seemed to see him fall christopher is alive upon the earthyes and other things many other things and she passed her hand before her eyes and held it there as though to shut out the sight of her enemys face  now the abbot trembled in his terror he who knew that he lied though at that time none else there knew it it was as though suddenly he had been haled before the judgmentseat where all secrets must be bared  some evil spirit has entered into you he said huskily  she dropped her hand pointing at him  nay nay i never knew but one evil spirit and he stands before me  cicely he went on cease your blaspheming alas that i must tell it you sir christopher harflete is dead and buried in yonder churchyard  what so soon and all uncoffined he who was a noble knight then you buried him living and living in a day to come he shall rise up against you hear my words all christopher harflete shall rise up living and give testimony against this devil in a monks robe and afterwardsafterwards and she laughed shrilly then suddenly fell down and lay still  now emlyn the dark and handsome as became her spanish or perhaps gypsy blood who all this while had stood silent her arms folded upon her high bosom leaned down and looked at her then she straightened herself and her face was like the face of a beautiful fiend  she is dead she screamed my dove is dead she whom these breasts nursed the greatest lady of all the wolds and all the vales the lady of blossholme of cranwell and of shefton in whose veins ran the blood of mighty nobles aye and of old kings is dead murdered by a beggarly foreign monk who not ten days gone butchered her father also yonder by kings graveyonder by the mere oh the arrow in his throat the arrow in his throat i cursed the hand that shot it and today that hand is blue beneath the mould so too i curse you maldonado evilgifted one abbot consecrated by satan you and all your herd of butchers and she broke into the stream of spanish imprecations whereof the abbot knew the meaning well  presently emlyn paused and looked behind her at the smouldering ruins  this house is burned she cried well mark emlyns words even so shall your house burn while your monks run squeaking like rats from a flaming rick you have stolen the lands they shall be taken from you and yours also every acre of them not enough shall be left to bury you in for priest youll need no burial the fowls of the air shall bury you and thats the nearest you will ever get to heavenin their filthy crops murderer if christopher harflete is dead yet he shall live as his lady swore for his seed shall rise up against you oh i forgot how can it how can it seeing that she is dead with him and their bridal coverlet has become a pall woven by the black monks yet it shall it shall christopher harfletes seed shall sit where the abbots of blossholme sat and from father to son tell the tale of the last of themthe spaniard who plotted against englands king and overshot himself  her rage veered like a hurricane wind forgetting the abbot she turned upon the monk at his side and cursed him then she cursed the hired menatarms those present and those absent many by name and lastlygreatest crime of allshe cursed the pope and the king of spain and called to god in heaven and henry of england upon earth to avenge her lady cicelys wrongings and the murder of sir john foterell and the murder of christopher harflete on each and all of them individually and separately  so fierce and fearful was her onslaught that all who heard her were reduced to utter silence the abbot and the monk leaned against each other the soldiers crossed themselves and muttered prayers while one of them running up fell upon his knees and assured her that he had had nothing to do with all this business having only returned from a journey last night and been called thither that morning  emlyn who had paused from lack of breath listened to him and said  then i take the curse off you and yours john athey now lift up my lady and bear her to the church for there we will lay her out as becomes her rank though not with her jewels her great and priceless jewels for which she was hunted like a doe she must lie without her jewels her pearls and coronet and rings her stomacher and necklets of bright gems that were worth so much more than those beggarly acresthose that once a sultans woman wore they are lost though perhaps yonder abbot has found them sir john foterell bore them to london for safe keeping and good sir john is dead footpads set on him in the forest and an arrow shot from behind pierced his throat those who killed him have the jewels and the dead bride must lie without them adorned in the naked beauty that god gave to her lift her john athey and you monks set up your funeral chant well to the church the bride who knelt before the altar shall lie there before the altarclement maldonados last offering to god first the father then the husband and now the wifethe sweet newmade wife  so she raved on while they stood before her dumbfounded and the man lifted up cicely then suddenly this same cicely whom all thought dead opened her eyes and struggled from his arms to her feet  see screamed emlyn did i not tell you that harfletes seed should live to be avenged upon all your tribe and she stands there who will bear it now where shall we shelter till england hears this tale cranwell is down though it shall rise again and shefton is stolen where shall we shelter  thrust away that woman said the abbot in a hoarse voice for her witchcrafts poison the air set the lady cicely on a horse and bear her to our nunnery of blossholme where she shall be tended  the men advanced to do his bidding though very doubtfully but emlyn hearing his words ran to the abbot and whispered something in his ear in a foreign tongue that caused him to cross himself and stagger back from her  i have changed my mind he said to the servants mistress emlyn reminds me that between her and her lady there is the tie of fostermotherhood they may not be separated as yet take them both to the nunnery where they shall dwell and as for this womans words forget them for she was mad with fear and grief and knew not what she said may god and his saints forgive her as i do    chapter vii  the abbots offer  the nunnery at blossholme was a peaceful place a long greygabled house set under the shelter of a hill and surrounded by a high wall within this wall lay also the great gardenneglected enoughand the chapel a building that still was beautiful in its decay  once indeed blossholme priory which was older than the abbey had been rich and famous its foundress in the time of the first edward a certain lady matilda one of the plantagenets who retired from the world after her husband had been killed in the crusade being childless endowed it with all her lands other noble ladies who accompanied her there or sought its refuge in after days had done likewise so that it grew in power and in wealth till at its most prosperous time over twenty nuns told their beads within its walls then the proud abbey rose upon the opposing hill and obtained some royal charter that the pope confirmed under which the priory of blossholme was affiliated to the abbey of blossholme and the abbot of blossholme became the spiritual lord of its religious from that day forward its fortunes began to decline since under this pretext and that the abbots filched away its lands to swell their own estates  so it came about that at the date of our history the total revenue of this nunnery was but £130 a year of the money of the day and even of this sum the abbot took tithe and toll now in all the great house that once had been so full there dwelt but six nuns one of whom was in fact a servant while an aged monk from the abbey celebrated mass in the fair chapel where lay the bones of so many who had gone before also on certain feasts the abbot himself attended confessed the nuns and granted them absolution and his holy blessing on these days too he would examine their accounts and if there were money in hand take a share of it to serve his necessities for which reason the prioress looked forward to his coming with little joy  it was to this ancient home of peace that the distraught cicely and her servant emlyn were conveyed upon the morrow of the great burning indeed cicely knew it well enough already since as a child during three years or more she had gone there daily to be taught by the prioress matilda for every head of the priory took this name in turn to the honour of their foundress and in accordance with the provisions of her will happy years they were as these old nuns loved her in her youth and innocence and she too loved them every one now by the workings of fate she was borne back to the same quiet room where she had played and studieda newmade wife a newmade widow  but of all this poor cicely knew nothing till three weeks or more had gone by when at length her wandering brain cleared and she opened her eyes to the world again at the moment she was alone and lay looking about her the place was familiar she recognized the deep windows the faded tapestries of abraham cutting isaacs throat with a butchers knife and jonah being shot into the very gateway of a castle where his family awaited him from the mouth of a gigantic carp with goggle eyes for the simple artist had found his whales model in a stewpond well she remembered those delightful pictures and how often she had wondered whether isaac could escape bleeding to death or jonahs wife with the outspread arms withstand the sudden shock of her husbands unexpected arrival out of the interior of the whale there also was the splendid fireplace of wrought stone and above it cunningly carved in gilded oak gleamed many coatsofarms without crests for they were those of sundry noble prioresses  yes this was certainly the great guestchamber of the blossholme priory which since the nuns had now few guests and many places in which to put them had been given up to her sir john foterells heiress as her schoolroom there she lay thinking that she was a child again a happy careless child or that she dreamed till presently the door opened and mother matilda appeared followed by emlyn who bore a tray on which stood a silver bowl that smoked there was no mistaking mother matilda in her black benedictine robe and her white whimple wearing the great silver crucifix which was her badge of office and the golden ring with an emerald bezel whereon was cut st catherine being broken on the wheelthe ancient ring which every prioress of blossholme had worn from the beginning moreover who that had ever seen it could forget her sweet old highbred face with the fine lips the arched nose and the quick kind grey eyes  cicely strove to rise and to do her reverence as had been her custom during those childish years only to find that she could not for lo she fell back heavily upon her pillow thereon emlyn setting down the tray with a clatter upon a table ran to her and putting her arms about her began to scold as was her fashion but in a very gentle voice and mother matilda kneeling by her bed gave thanks to jesus and his blessed saintsthough why she thanked him at first cicely did not understand  am i ill reverend mother she asked  not now daughter but you were very ill answered the prioress in her sweet low voice now we think that god has healed you  how long have i been here she asked  the mother began to reckon counting her beads one for every dayfor in such places time slips bybut long before she had finished emlyn replied quickly  cranwell towers was burned three weeks yesternight  then cicely remembered and with a bitter groan turned her face to the wall while the mother reproached emlyn saying she had killed her  i think not answered the nurse in a low voice i think she has that which will not let her diea saying that puzzled the prioress at this time  emlyn was right cicely did not die on the contrary she grew strong and well in her body though it was long before her mind recovered indeed she glided about the place like a ghost in her black mourning robe for now she no longer doubted that christopher was dead and she the wife of a week widowed as well as orphaned  then in her utter desolation came comfort a light broke on the darkness of her soul like the moon above a tortured midnight sea she was no longer quite alone the murdered christopher had left his image with her if she lived a child would be born to him and therefore she would surely live one evening on her knees she whispered her secret to the prioress matilda whereat the old nun blushed like a girl yet after a moments silent prayer laid a thin hand upon her head in blessing  the lord abbot declares that your marriage was no true marriage my daughter though why i do not understand since the man was he whom your heart chose and you were wed to him by an ordained priest before gods altar and in presence of the congregation  i care not what he says answered cicely in a stubborn voice if i am not a true wife then no woman ever was  dear daughter answered mother matilda it is not for us unlearned women to question the wisdom of a holy abbot who doubtless is inspired from on high  if he is inspired it is not from on high mother would god or his saints teach him to murder my father and my husband to seize my heritage or to hold my person in this gentle prison such inspirations do not come from above mother  hush hush said the prioress glancing round her nervously your woes have crazed you besides you have no proof in this world there are so many things that we cannot understand being an abbot how could he do wrong although to us his acts seem wrong but let us not talk of these matters of which indeed i only know from that roughtongued emlyn of yours who i am told was not afraid to curse him terribly i was about to say that whatever may be the law of it i hold your marriage good and true and its issue should such come to you pure and holy and night by night i will pray that it shall be crowned with heavens richest blessings  i thank you dear mother answered cicely as she rose and left her  when she had gone the prioress rose also and with a troubled face began to walk up and down the refectory for it was here that they had spoken together truly she could not understand for unless all these tales were falseand how could they be falsethis abbot whom her highbred english nature had always mistrusted this dark able spanish monk was no saint but a wicked villain there must be some explanation it was only that she did not understand  soon the news spread throughout the nunnery and if the sisters had loved cicely before now they loved her twice as well of the doubts as to the validity to her marriage like their prioress they took no heed for had it not been celebrated in a church but that a child was to be born among themah that was a joyful thing a thing that had not happened for quite two hundred years when alasso said tradition and their recordsthere had been a dreadful scandal which to this day was spoken of with bated breath for be it known at once this nunnery whatever may or may not have been the case with some others was one of which no evil could be said  beneath their black robes however these old nuns were still as much women as the mothers who bore them and this news of a child stirred them to the marrow among themselves in their hours of recreation they talked of little else and even their prayers were largely occupied with this same matter indeed poor weakwitted old sister bridget who hitherto had been secretly looked down upon because she was the only one of the seven who was not of gentle birth now became very popular for sister bridget in her youth had been married and borne two children both of whom had been carried off by the smallpox after she was widowed whereon as her face was seamed by this same disease so that she had no hope of another husband as her neighbours said or because her heart was broken as she said she entered into religion  now she constituted herself cicelys chief attendant and although that lady was quite well and strong persecuted her with advice and with noxious mixtures which she brewed till emlyn descending on her like a storm hunted her from the room and cast her medicines through the window  that these sisters should be thus interested in so small a matter was not indeed wonderful seeing that if their lives had been secluded before since the lady cicely came amongst them they were ten times more so soon they discovered that she and her servant emlyn stower were in fact prisoners which meant that they her hostesses were prisoners also none were allowed to enter the nunnery save the silent old monk who confessed them and celebrated the mass nor by an order of the abbot were they suffered to go abroad upon any business whatsoever  for the rest as their only means of communication with those who dwelt beyond was the surly gardener who was deaf and set there to spy on them little news ever reached them they were almost dead to the world which had they known it was busy enough just then with matters that concerned them and all other religious houses  at length one day when cicely and emlyn were seated in the garden beneath a flowering hawthorntreefor now june had come and with it warm weatherof a sudden sister bridget hurried up saying that the abbot of blossholme desired their presence at this tidings cicely turned faint and emlyn rated bridget asking if her few wits had left her or if she thought that name was so pleasant to her mistress that she should suddenly bawl it in her ear  thereon the poor old soul who was not too strongbrained and much afraid of emlyn since she had thrown her medicines out of the window began to weep protesting that she had meant no harm till cicely recovering soothed her and sent her back to say that she would wait upon his lordship  are you afraid of him mistress asked emlyn as they prepared to follow  a little nurse he has shown himself a man to be afraid of has he not my father and my husband are in his net and will he spare the last fish in the poola very narrow pool and she glanced at the high walls about her i fear lest he should take you from me and wonder why he has not done so already  because my father was a spaniard and through him i know that which would ruin him with his friends the pope and the emperor also he believes that i have the evil eye and dreads my curse still one day he may try to murder me who knows only then the secret of the jewels will go with me for that is mine alone not yours even for if you had it they would squeeze it out of you meanwhile he will try to profess you a nun but push him off with soft words say that you will think of it after your child is born till then he can do nothing and if mother matildas fresh tidings are true by that time perchance there will be no more nuns in england  now very quietly and by the side door they were entering the old receptionhall that was only used for the entertainment of visitors and on other great occasions and close to them saw the abbot seated in his chair while the prioress stood before him rendering her accounts  whether you can spare it or no they heard him say sharply i must have the halfyears rent the times are evil we servants of the lord are threatened by that adulterous king and his proud ministers who swear they will strip us to the shirt and turn us out to starve im but just from london and although our enemy anne boleyn has lost her wanton head i tell you the danger is great money must be had to stir up rebellion for who can arm without it and but little comes from spain i am in treaty to sell the foterell lands for what they will fetch but as yet can give no title either that stiffnecked girl must sign a release or she must profess for otherwise while she lives some lawyer or relative might upset the sale is she yet prepared to take her first vows if not i shall hold you much to blame  nay answered the prioress there are reasons you have been away and have not heardshe hesitated and looked about her nervously to see cicely and emlyn standing behind them what do you there daughter she asked with as much asperity as she ever showed  in truth i know not mother answered cicely sister bridget told us that the lord abbot desired our presence  i bid her say that you were to wait him in my chamber said the prioress in a vexed voice  well broke in the abbot it would seem that you have a fool for a messenger if it is that pockmarked hag her brain has been gone for years ward cicely i greet you though after the sorrows that have fallen on you whereof by your leave we will not speak since there is no use in stirring up such memories i grieve to see you in that worldly garb who thought you would have changed it for a better but ere you entered the holy mother here spoke of some obstacle that stood between you and god what is it perchance my counsel may be of service not this woman as i trust and he frowned at emlyn who at once answered in her steady voice  nay my lord abbot i stand not between her and god and his holiness but between her and man and his iniquity still i can tell you of that obstaclewhich comes from godif you so need  now the old prioress blushing to her white hair bent forward and whispered in the abbots ear words at which he sprang up as though a wasp had stung him  pest on it it cannot be he said well well there it is and must be swallowed with the rest pity though he added with a sneer on his dark face since many a year has gone by since these walls have seen a bastard and as things are that may pull them down about your ears  i know such brats are dangerous interrupted emlyn looking maldon full in the eyes my father told me of a young monk in spaini forget his namewho brought certain ladies to the torture in some such matter but who talks of bastards in the case of dame cicely harflete widow of sir christopher harflete slain by the abbot of blossholme  silence woman where there is no lawful marriage there can be no lawful child  to take that lawful inheritance that it lawfully inherits say my lord abbot did sir christopher make you his heir also  then before he could answer cicely who had been silent all this while broke in  heap what insults you will on me my lord abbot and having robbed me of my father my husband and my heart rob me of my goods also if you can in my case it matters little but slander not my child if one should be born to me nor dare to touch its rights think not that you can break the mother as you broke the girl for there you will find that you have a shewolf by the ear  he looked at her they all looked at her for in her eyes was something that compelled theirs clement maldon who knew the world and how a shewolf can fight for its cub read in them a warning which caused him to change his tone  tut tut daughter he said what is the good of vapouring of a child that is not and may never be when it comes i will christen it and we will talk  when it comes you will not lay a finger on it id rather that it went unbaptized to its grave than marked with your cross of blood  he waved his hand  there is another matter or rather two of which i must speak to you my daughter when do you take your first vows  we will talk of it after my child is born tis a child of sin you say and i am unrepentant a wicked woman not fit to take a holy vow to which moreover you cannot force me she replied with bitter sarcasm  again he waved his hand for the shewolf showed her teeth  the second matter is he went on that i need your signature to a writing it is nothing but a form and one i fear you cannot read nor in faith can i and with a somewhat doubtful smile he drew out a crabbed indenture and spread it before her on the table  what she laughed brushing aside the parchment have you remembered that yesterday i came of age and am therefore no more your ward if such i ever was you should have sold my inheritance more swiftly for now the title you can give is rotten as last years apples and ill sign nothing bear witness mother matilda and you emlyn stower that i have signed and will sign nothing clement maldon abbot of blossholme i am a free woman of full age even though as you say i am a wanton where is your right to chain up a wanton who is no religious unlock these gates and let me go  now he felt the wolfs fangs and they were sharp  whither would you go he asked  whither but to the king to lay my cause before him as my father would have done last christmastime  it was a bold speech but foolish the shewolf had loosed her hold to growlto growl at a hunter with a bloody sword  i think your father never reached his grace with his sack of falsehoods nor might you cicely foterell the times are rough rebellion is in the air and many wild men hunt the woods and roads no no for your own sake you bide here in safety till  till you murder me oh it is in your mind do you remember the angel who spoke with me in the fire and told me my husband was not dead  a lying spirit then no angel  i am not so sure and again she passed her hand across her eyes as she had done in that dreadful dawn at cranwell well i prayed to god to help me and last night that angel came again and spoke in my sleep he told me to fear you not at all my lord abbot however sore my case and however near my death might seem since god had shaped a stone to drop upon your head he showed it me it was like an axe  now the old prioress held up her hands and gasped in horror but the abbot leapt from his seat in rageor was it fear  wanton you named yourself he exclaimed but i name you witch also who if you had your deserts should die the death of a witch by fire mother matilda i command you on your oath keep this witch fast and make report to me of all her sorceries it is not fitting that such a one should walk abroad to bring evil on the innocent witch and wanton begone to your chamber  cicely listened then without another word broke into a little scornful laugh and turning left the room followed by the prioress  but emlyn did not go she stayed behind a smile on her dark handsome face  youve lost the throw though all your dice were loaded she said boldly  the abbot turned on her and reviled her  woman he said if she is a witch youre the familiar and certainly you shall burn even though she escape it is you who taught her how to call up the devil  then you had best keep me living my lord abbot that i may teach her how to lay him nay threaten not why the rack might make me speak and the birds of the air carry the matter  his face paled then suddenly he asked  where are those jewels i need them give me the jewels and you shall go free and perchance your accursed mistress with you  i told you she answered sir john took them to london and if they were not found upon his body then either he threw them away or jeffrey stokes carried them to wherever he has gone drag the mere search the forest find jeffrey and ask him  you lie woman when you and your mistress fled from shefton a servant there saw you with the box that held those jewels in your hand  true my lord abbot but it no longer held them only my mistresss loveletters which she would not leave behind  then where is the box and where are those letters  we grew short of fuel in the siege and burned both when a woman has her man she doesnt want his letters surely maldonado she added with meaning you should know that it is not always wise to keep old letters what i wonder would you give for some that i have seen and that are not burned  accursed spawn of satan hissed the abbot how dare you flaunt me thus when cicely was wed to christopher she wore those very gems i have it from those who saw her decked in themthe necklace on her bosom the priceless rosebud pearls hanging from her ears  oho oho said emlyn so you own that she was wed the pure soul whom but now you called a wanton look you sir abbot we will fence no more she wore the jewels jeffrey took nothing hence save your deathwarrant  then where are they he asked striking his fist upon the table  where why where youll never follow themgone up to heaven in the fire thinking we might be robbed i hid them behind a secret panel in her chamber purposing to return for them later go rake out the ashes you might find a cracked diamond or two but not the pearls they fly in fire there thats the truth at last and much good may it do to you  the abbot groaned like most spaniards he was emotional and could not help it his bitterness burst from his heart  emlyn laughed at him  see how the wise and mighty of this world overshoot themselves she said clement maldonado i have known you for some twenty years and when i was called the beauty of blossholme and the abbot who went before you made me the churchs ward though i ever hated you who hunted down my father you had softer words for me than those you name me by today well i have watched you rise and i shall watch you fall and i know your heart and its desires money is what you lust for and must have for otherwise how will you gain your end it was the jewels that you needed not the shefton lands which are worth little nowadays and will soon be worth less why one of those pink pearls placed among the jews would buy three parishes with their halls thrown in for the sake of those jewels you have brought death on some and misery on some and on your own soul damnation without end though had you but been wise and consulted mewhy they or some of them might have been yours sir john was no fool he would have parted with a pearl or two of which he did not know the value to end a feud against the church and safeguard his title and his daughter and now in your madness youve burnt themburnt a kings ransom or what might have pulled down a king oh had you but guessed it youd have hacked off the hand that put a torch to cranwell towers for now the gold you need is lacking to you and therefore all your grand schemes will fail and youll be buried in their ruin as you thought we were in cranwell  the abbot who had listened to this long and bitter speech in patience groaned again  you are a clever woman he said we understand each other coming from the same blood you know the case what is your counsel to me now  that which you will not take being foredoomed for your sins still ill give it honestly set the lady cicely free restore her lands confess your evil doings fly the kingdom before cromwell turns on you and henry finds you out taking with you all the gold that you can gather and bribe the emperor charles to give you a bishopric in granada or elsewherenot near seville for reasons that you know so shall you live honoured and one day after you have been dead a long while and many things are forgotten perchance be beatified as saint clement of blossholme  the abbot looked at her reflectively  if i sought safety only and old age comforts your counsel might be good but i play for higher stakes  you set your head against them broke in emlyn  not so woman for in any case that head must win if it stays upon my shoulders it will wear an archbishops mitre or a cardinals hat or perhaps something nobler yet and if it parts from them why then a heavenly crown of glory  your head your head exclaimed emlyn with a contemptuous laugh  why not he answered gravely you chance to know of some errors of my youth but they are long ago repented of and for such there is plentiful forgiveness and he crossed himself were it not so who would escape  emlyn who had been standing all this while sat herself down set her elbows on the table and rested her chin upon her clenched hands  true she said looking him in the eyes none of us would escape but clement maldon how about the unrepented errors of your age sir john foterell for instance sir christopher harflete for instance my lady cicely for instance to say nothing of black treason and a few other matters  even were all these charges true which i deny they are no sins seeing that they would have been done every one of them not for my own sake but for that of the church to overset her enemies to rebuild her tottering walls to secure her eternally in this realm  and to lift you clement maldon to the topmost pinnacle of her temple whence satan shows you all the kingdoms of the world swearing that they shall be yours  apparently the abbot did not resent this bold speech indeed emlyns apt illustration seemed to please him only he corrected her gently saying  not satan but satans lord then he paused a while looked round the chamber to see that the doors were shut and make sure that they were alone and went on emlyn stower you have great wits and couragemore than any woman that i know also you have knowledge both of the world and of what lies beyond it being what superstitious fools call a witch but i a prophetess or a seer these things come to you with your blood i suppose seeing that your mother was of a gypsy tribe and your father a highbred spanish gentleman very learned and clever though a pestilent heretic for which cause he fled for his life from spain  to find his dark death in england the holy inquisition is patent and has a long arm if i remember right also it was this business of the heresy of my father that first brought you to blossholme where after his vanishing and the public burning of that book of his you so greatly prospered  you are always right emlyn and therefore i need not tell you further that we had been old enemies in spain which is why i was chosen to hunt him down and how you come to know certain things  she nodded and he went on  so much for the heretic fathernow for the gypsy mother she died by her own hand it is said to escape the punishment of the law  no need to beat about the bush abbot lets have truth between old friends you mean to escape being burnt by you as a witch because she had the letters which were not burned and threatened to use themas i do  why rake up such tales emlyn he interposed blandly at least she died but not until she had taught you all she knew the rest of the history is short you fell in love with old yeoman bolles son or said you didthat same great silly thomas who is now a laybrother at the abbey  or said i did she repeated at least he fell in love with me and perhaps i wished an honest man to protect me who in those days was young and fair moreover he was not silly then that came upon him after he fell into your hands oh have done with it she went on in a voice of suppressed passion the witchs fair daughter was the churchs ward and you ruled the abbot of that time and he forced me into marriage with old peter stower as his third wife i cursed him and he died as i warned him that he would and i bore a child and it died then with what was left to me i took refuge with sir john foterell who ever was my friend and became fostermother to his daughter the only creature save one that i have loved in this wide wicked world thats all the story and now what more do you want of me clement maldonadoevilgifted one  emlyn i want what i always wanted and you always refusedyour help your partnership i mean the partnership of that brain of yoursthe help of the knowledge that you haveno more at cranwell towers you called down evil on me take off that ban for ill speak truth it weighs heavy on my mind let us bury the past let us clasp hands and be friends you have the true vision do you remember that when you thought cicely dead you said that her seed should rise up against me and now it seems that it will be so  what would you give me asked emlyn curiously  i will give you wealth i will give you what you love morepower and rank too if you wish it the whole church shall listen to you what you desire shall be done in this realmyes and across the world i speak no lie i pledge my soul on it and the honour of those i serve which i have authority to do in return all i ask of you is your wisdomthat you should read the future for me that you should show me which way to walk  nothing more  yes two thingsthat you should find me those burned jewels and with them the old letters that were not burned and that this child of the lady cicely shall not chance to live to take what you promised to it her life i give you for a nun more or less can matter little  a noble offer and in this case i am sure you will pay what you promiseshould you live but what if i refuse  then answered the abbot dropping his fist upon the table then death for both of youthe witchs death for i dare not let you go to work my ruin remember i am master here you are my prisoners few know that you live in this place except a handful of weakbrained women who will fear to speakpuppets that must dance when i pull the stringand ill see that no soul shall come near these walls choose then between death and all its terrors or life and all its hopes  on the table there stood a wooden bowl filled with roses emlyn drew it to her and taking the roses into her hands threw them to the floor then she waited for the water to steady saying  the riddle is hard perhaps if in truth i have such power i shall find its answer here presently as he gazed at her fascinated she breathed upon the water and stared into it for a long while at length she looked up and said  death or life that was the choice you gave me well clement maldonado on behalf of myself and the lady cicely and her husband sir christopher and the child that shall be born and of god who directs all these things i choosedeath  there was a solemn silence then the abbot rose and said  good on your own head be it  again there was a silence and as she made no answer he turned and walked towards the door leaving her still staring into the bowl  good she repeated as he laid his hand upon the latch i have told you that i choose death but i have not told you whose death it is i choose play your game my lord abbot and ill play mine remembering that god holds the stakes meanwhile i confirm the words i spoke in my rage at cranwell expect evil for i see now that it shall fall on you and all with which you have to do  then with a sudden movement she upset the bowl upon the table and watched him go    chapter viii  emlyn calls her man  one by one the weeks passed over the heads of cicely and emlyn in their prison and brought them neither hope nor tidings indeed although they could not see its cords they felt that the evil net which held them was drawing ever tighter there were fear and pity as well as love in the eyes of mother matilda when she looked at cicely which she did only if she thought that no one observed her the nuns also were afraid though it was clear that they knew not of what one evening emlyn finding the prioress alone sprang questions on her asking what was in the wind and why her lady a free woman of full age was detained there against her will  the old nuns face grew secret she answered that she did not know of anything unusual and that as regarded the detention she must obey the commands of her spiritual superior  then burst out emlyn i tell you that you do so at your peril i tell you that whether my lady lives or dies there are those who will call you to a strict account aye and those who will listen to the prayer of the helpless mother matilda england is not the land it was when as a girl they buried you in these mouldy walls where does god say that you have the right to hold free women like felons in a jail tell me  i cannot moaned mother matilda wringing her thin hands the right is very hard to find this place is strictly guarded and whatever i may think i must do what i am bid lest my soul should suffer  your soul you cloistered women think always of your miserable souls but of those of other folk aye and of their bodies too nothing then youll not help me  i cannot i cannot who am myself in bonds she replied again  so be it mother then ill help myself and when i do god help you all and with a contemptuous shrug of her broad shoulders she walked away leaving the poor old prioress almost in tears  emlyns threats were bold as her own heart but how could she execute even a tenth of them the right was on their side indeed but as many a captive has found in those and other days right is no joshuas trumpet to cause high walls to fall moreover cicely would not aid her now that her husband was dead she took interest in one thing onlyhis child who was to be  for the rest she seemed to care nothing since she had no friends with whom she could communicate and her wealth as she understood had been taken from her what better place she asked could there be for that child to see the light than in this quiet nunnery when it was born and she was well again she would consider other matters meanwhile she was languid and why was emlyn always prating to her of freedom if she were free what should she do and whither should she go the nuns were very kind to her they loved her as she did them  so she talked on and emlyn listening did not dare to tell her the truth that here she feared for the life of her child dreading lest that news might bring about the death of both of them so she let her be and fell back on her own wits  first she thought of escape only to abandon the idea for her mistress was in no state to face its perils moreover whither should they go then rescue came into her mind but alas who would rescue them the great men in london perhaps as a matter of policy but great men are hard to come at even for the free if she were free she might find means to make them listen but she was not nor could she leave her lady at such a time what remained then so to contrive that they should be set free  perhaps it might be done at a pricethat of cicelys jewels of which she alone knew the hidingplace and with them a deed of indemnity against her persecutors emlyn was not minded to give either moreover she guessed that it might be in vain once outside those walls they knew too much to be allowed to live and yet within those walls cicelys child would not be allowed to livethe child that was heir to all what then could loose them and make them safe  terror perhapssuch terror as that through which the israelites escaped from bondage oh if she could but find a moses to call down the plagues of egypt upon this pharaoh of an abbotthose plagues with which she had threatened himbut although she believed that they would fall why did she believe it she wondered she was as yet impotent to fulfil  now thomas bolle if only she could have words with that faithful thomas bolle the fierce and cunning man whom they thought foolish  this idea of thomas bolle took possession of emlyns mindthomas bolle who had loved her all his life who would die to serve her she strove in vain to get in touch with him the old gardener was so deaf that he could not or would not understand the silly bridget gave the letter that she wrote to him to the prioress by mistake who burnt it before her eyes and said nothing the monks who brought provisions to the nunnery were always received by three of the sisters set to spy on each other and on them so that she could not come near to them alone the priest who celebrated mass was an old enemy of hers with him she could do nothing and no one else was allowed to approach the place except once or twice the abbot who was closeted for hours with the prioress but spoke to her no more  why wondered emlyn should less than halfamile of space be such a barrier between her and thomas bolle if he stood within twenty yards of her she could make him understand why not then when he stood within five hundred this idea possessed her these limitations of nature made her mad she refused to accept them night by night lying brooding in her bed while cicely slept in peace at her side she threw out her strong soul towards the soul of her old lover thomas bolle commanding him to listen to obey to come  at first nothing happened afterwards she had a vague sense of being answered although she could not see or hear him she felt his presence then one afternoon looking from an upper dormer window she saw a scuffle going on outside the gateway and heard angry voices thomas bolle was trying to force his way in at the door whence he was repelled by the abbots men who always watched there  in the evening she gathered the truth from the nuns who did not know that she was listening to what they said it seemed that thomas whom they spoke of as a madman or as drunk had tried to break into the nunnery when he was asked what he wanted he answered that he did not know but he must speak with emlyn stower at this tidings she smiled to herself for now she knew that he had heard her and that in this way or in that he would obey her summons and come  two days later thomas camethus  the september evening was fading into night and emlyn leaving cicely resting on her bed which now she often did for a while before the supperhour had gone into the garden to enjoy the pleasant air there she walked until she wearied of its sameness then entered the old chapel by a side door and sat herself down to think in the chancel not far from a lifesized statue of the virgin in painted oak which stood here because of its peculiarities for the back half of it seemed to be built into the masonry also the eyesockets were empty which suggested to the observant emlyn either that they had once held jewels or that this was no likeness of the holy mother but rather one of the blind st lucy  while emlyn mused there quite alonefor at this hour none entered the place nor would until the next morningshe thought that she heard strange noises as of some one stirring which came from the neighbourhood of the statue now many would have been scared and departed but not so emlyn who only sat still and listened presently without moving her head she looked also as it happened the light of the setting sun pouring through the west window fell almost full upon the figure and by it she saw or thought she saw that the eyesockets were no longer empty there were eyes in them which moved and flashed  now for a moment even emlyn was frightened then she reasoned with herself reflecting that a priest or one of the nuns was watching her from behind the statue which they might do for as long as they pleased or perhaps this was a miracle such as she had heard so much of but never seen well why should she fear spies or miracles she would sit where she was and see what happened nor had she long to wait for presently a voice a hoarse manly voice whispered  emlyn emlyn stower  yes she answered also in a whisper who speaks  who do you think asked the voice with a chuckle a devil perhaps  well if it be a friendly devil i dont know that i mind who need company in this lone place so appear man or devil answered emlyn stoutly but in secret she crossed herself beneath her cape for in those days folk believed in the appearance of devils for no good purposes  the statue began to creak then opened like a door though very unwillingly as though its hinges had been fixed for a long long time and rusted in the damp which was indeed the case inside of it like a corpse in an upright coffin appeared a figure a square strong figure clad in a tattered monks robe surmounted by a large head with fiery red hair and beetling brows beneath which shone two wild grey eyes emlyn whose heart had stood stillfor after all satan is awkward company for a mortal womanwaited till it gave a jump in her breast and went on again as usual then she said quietly  what are you doing here thomas bolle  that is what i want to know emlyn night and day for weeks you have been calling me and so i came  yes i have been calling you but how did you come  by the old monks road they have forgotten it long ago but my grandfather told me of it when i was a boy and at last a fox showed me where it ran its a dark road and when first i tried it i thought i should be poisoned but now the air is none so bad it ran to the abbey once and may still but my door and mrs foxs is in the copse by the park wall where none would ever look for it if you would like a cub to play with i will bring you one or perhaps you want something more than cubs he added with his cunning laugh  aye thomas i want much more man she said fiercely will you do what i tell you  that depends mistress emlyn have i not done what you told me all my life and for no reward  she moved across the chancel and sat herself down against him pushing the image door almost to and speaking to him through the crack  if you have had no reward thomas she said in a gentle voice whose fault was it not mine i think i loved you once when we were young did i not i would have given myself to you body and soul would i not well who came between us and spoiled our lives  the monks groaned thomas the accursed monks who married you to stower because he paid them  yes the accursed monks and now our youth has gone and loveof that sortis behind us i have been another mans wife thomas who might have been yours think of ityour loving wife the mother of your children and youthey have tamed you and made you their servant their cattleherd the strong fellow to fetch and carry the halfwit as they call you who can still be trusted to run an errand and hold his tongue the abbey mule that does not dare to kick the grieve of your own stolen landsyou whose father was almost a gentleman thats what they have done for you thomas and for me the churchs wardwell i will not speak of it now if you had your will what would you do for them  do for them do for them gasped thomas worked up to fury by this recital of his wrongs why if i dared id cut their throats every one and grallock them like deer and he ground his strong white teeth but i am afraid they have my soul and month by month i must confess you remember emlyn i warned you when you and the lady would have ridden to london before the siege well afterwardi must confess itthe abbot heard it himself and oh sore sore was my penance before i had done with it my ribs showed through my skin and my back was like a red osier basket theres only one thing i didnt tell them because after all it is no sin to grub the earth off the face of a corpse  ah said emlyn looking at him youre not to be trusted well i thought as much goodbye thomas bolle you coward ill find me a man for a friend not a whimpering priestridden hound who sets a latin blessing which he does not understand above his honour god in heaven to think i should ever have loved such a thing oh i am shamed i am shamed ill go wash my hands shut your trap and get you gone down your ratrun thomas bolle and living or dead never dare to speak to me again also forget not to tell your monks how i called you to my sidefor thats witchcraft you know and i shall burn for it and your soul gain benefit god in heaven to think that once you were thomas bolle and she made as though to go away  he stretched out his great arm and caught her by the robe exclaiming  what would you have me do emlyn i cant bear your scorn take it off me or i go kill myself  thats what you had best do youll find the devil a better master than a foreign abbot farewell for ever  nay nay whats your will soul or no soul ill work it  will you will you indeed if so stay a moment and she ran down the chapel bolting the doors then returned to him saying  now come forth thomas and since you are once more a man kiss me as you used to do twenty years ago and more youll not confess to that will you there now kneel before the altar here and swear an oath nay listen to it before you swear for it is wide  emlyn said the oath to him it was a great and terrible oath under it he bound himself to be her slave and join himself with her in working woe to the monks of blossholme and especially to their abbot clement maldon in payment of the wrongs that these had done to them both in payment for the murder of sir john foterell and of christopher harflete and of the imprisonment and robbery of cicely harflete the daughter of the one and the wife of the other he bound himself to do those things which she should tell him he bound himself neither in the confessional nor should it come to that on the bed of torture or the scaffold to breathe a word of all their counsel he prayed that if he did so his soul might pay the price in everlasting torment and of all these things he took heaven to be his witness  now said emlyn when she had finished setting out this fearful vow will you be a man and swear and thereby avenge the dead and save the innocent from death or will you who have my secret be a crawling monk and go back to blossholme abbey and betray me  he thought a moment rubbing his red head for the thing frightened him as well it might the scales of the balance of his mind hung evenly and emlyn knew not which way they would turn she saw and put out all her womans strength resting her hand upon his shoulder she leaned forward and whispered into his ear  do you remember thomas how first we told our young love that spring day down in the copse by the water and how sweet the daffodils bloomed about our feetthe daffodils and the woodlilies do you remember how we swore ourselves each to each for all our lives aye and all the lives that were to come and how for us two the earth was turned to heaven and thendo you remember how that monk walked byit was this clement maldonand froze us with his cruel eyes and said what do you with the witchs daughter she is not for you andoh thomas i can no more of it and she broke down and sobbed then added swear nothing get you gone and betray me if you will ill bear you no malice even when i die for it for after more than twenty years of monkcraft how could i hope that you would still remain a man come get you gone swiftly ere they take us together and your fair fame is besmirched quick now and leave me and my lady and her unborn child to the doom maldon brews for us alas for the copse by the river alas for the withered lilies  thomas heard the big blue veins stood out upon his forehead his great breast heaved his utterance choked at length the words came in a thick torrent  ill not go dearie ill swear what you will by your eyes and by your lips by the flowers on which we trod by all the empty years of aching woe and shame by god upon his throne in heaven and by the devil in his fires in hell come come and he ran to the altar and clasped the crucifix that stood there say the words again or any others that you will and ill repeat them and take the oath and may fiery worms eat me living for ever and ever if i break a letter of it  with a little smile of triumph in her dark eyes emlyn bent over the kneeling man and whisperedwhispered through the gathering bloom while he whispered after her and kissed the rood in token  it was done and they drew away from the altar back to the painted saint  so you are a man after all she said laughing aloud now manmy manwho if we live through this shall be my husband if you willyes my husband for ill pay and be proud of itlisten to my commands see you i am moses and yonder in the abbey sits pharaoh with a hardened heart and you are the angelthe destroying angel with the sword of the plagues of egypt tonight there will be fire in the abbeysuch fire as fell on cranwell towers nay nay i know the church will not burn nor all the great stone halls but the dormitories and the storehouses and the hayricks and the cattlebyres theyll flame bravely after this time of drought and if the wains are ashes how will they draw in their harvest will you do it my man  surely have i not sworn  then away to the work and afterwardstomorrow or next daycome back and make report just now i am much moved to solitary prayer so wait till you see me here alone upon my knees stay wrap yourself in graveclothes for then if you are seen they will think you are a ghost such as they say haunt this place fear not by then i will have more work for you have you mastered it  he nodded his head all all especially your promise oh ill not die now ill live to claim it  good theres on account and again she kissed him go  he reeled in the intoxication of his joy then said  one word my head swims i forgot sir christopher is not dead or wasnt  what do you mean she almost hissed at him in christs name be quick i hear voices without  they buried another man for christopher i scraped him up and saw christopher was sent foreign sore wounded on the shippest i have forgotten its namethe same ship that took jeffrey stokes  blessings on your head for that tidings exclaimed emlyn in a strange low voice away they are coming to the door  the wooden figure creaked to and stared at her blandly as it had stared for generations for a moment emlyn stood still her hand upon her heart then she walked swiftly down the chapel unlocked the door and in the porch just entering it met the prioress matilda another nun and old bridget who was chattering  oh it is you mistress stower said mother matilda with evident relief sister bridget here swore that she heard a man talking in the chapel when she came to shut the outer window at sunset  did she answered emlyn indifferently then her lucks better than my own who long for the sound of a mans voice in this home of babbling women nay be not shocked good mother i am no nun and god did not create the world all female or we should none of us be here but now you speak of it i think theres something strange about that chapel it is a place where some might fear to be alone for twice when i knelt there at my prayers i have heard odd sounds and once when there was no sun a cold shadow fell upon me some ghost of the dead i suppose of whom so many lie about well ghosts i never feared and now i must away to fetch my ladys supper for she eats in her room tonight  when she had gone the prioress shook her head and remarked in her gentle fashion  a strange woman and a rough but my sisters we must not judge her harshly for she is of a different world to ours and i fear has met with sorrows there such as we are protected from by our holy office  yes answered the sister but i think also that she has met with the ghost that haunts the chapel of which there are many records and that once i saw myself when i was a novice the prioress matildai mean the fourth of that name she who was mixed up with edward the lame the monk and died suddenly after the  peace sister let us have no scandal about that departedwoman who left the earth two hundred years ago also if her unquiet spirit still haunts the place as many say i know not why it should speak with the voice of a man  perhaps it was the monk edwards voice that bridget heard replied the sister for no doubt he still hangs about her skirts as he did in life if all tales are true well mistress emlyn says that she does not mind ghosts and i can well believe it for she is a witchs daughter and has a strange look in her eyes did you ever see such bold eyes mother however it may be i hate ghosts and rather would i pass a month on bread and water than be alone in that chapel at or after sundown my back creeps to think of it for they say that the unhallowed babe walks too and gibbers round the font seeking baptismugh and she shuddered  peace sister peace to your goblin talk said mother matilda again let us think of holier things lest the foul fiend draw near to us    that night about one in the morning the foul fiend drew very near to blossholme and he came in the shape of fire suddenly the nuns were aroused from their beds by the sound of bells tolling wildly running to the windowplaces they saw great sheets of flame leaping from the abbey roofs they threw open the casements and stared out terrified sister bridget was sent even to wake the deaf gardener and his wife who lived in the gateway and command them to go forth and learn what passed and the meaning of the shouts they heard for they feared that blossholme was attacked by some army  a long while went by and bridget returned with a confused tale which as it had been gathered by an imbecile from a deaf gardener was not easy to understand meanwhile the shoutings went on and the fire at the abbey burnt ever more fiercely so that the nuns thought that their last hour had come and knelt down to pray at the casement  just then cicely and emlyn appeared among them and stared at the great fire  suddenly cicely turned round and fixing her large blue eyes on emlyn said in the hearing of them all  the abbey burns why nurse they told me that you said it would be so yonder amid the ashes of cranwell towers surely you are foresighted  fire calls for fire answered emlyn grimly and the nuns around looked at her with doubtful eyes  it was a very fierce fire which appeared to have begun in the dormitories whence even at that distance they saw halfclad monks escaping through the windows some by means of bedcoverings tied together and some by jumping notwithstanding the height presently the roof of the building fell in sending up showers of glowing embers which lit upon the thatch of the farm byres and sheds and upon the ricks built and building in the stackyard so that all these caught also and before dawn were utterly consumed  one by one the watchers in the nunnery wearied of the lamentable sight and muttering prayers departed terrified to their beds but emlyn sat on at the open casement till the rim of the splendid september sun showed above the hills there she sat her head resting on her hand her strong face set like that of a statue only her dark eyes in which the flames were reflected seemed to smile hardly  thomas is a great tool she muttered to herself at length and the first cut has bitten to the bone well there shall be worse to come you will live to beg emlyns mercy yet clement maldonado    chapter ix  the blossholme witchings  on the afternoon of that day the abbot came again to visit the nunnery and sent for cicely and emlyn they found him alone in the guesthall walking up and down its length with a troubled face  cicely foterell he said without any form of greeting when last we met you refused to sign the deed which i brought with me well it matters nothing for that purchaser has gone back upon his bargain  saying that he liked not the title suggested cicely  aye though who taught you of titles and the ins and outs of law but what need to ask and he glowered at emlyn well let it pass for now i have a paper with me that you must sign read it if you will it is harmlessonly an instruction to the tenants of the lands your father held to pay their rents to me this michaelmas as warden of that property  do they refuse then seeing that you hold it all my lord abbot  aye some one has been at work among them and the stubborn churls will not without instruction under your hand and seal the farms your father worked himself i have reaped but last night every grain of corn and every fleece of wool were burned in the fire  then i pray you keep account of them my lord that you may pay me their value when we come to settle our score seeing that i never gave you leave to shear my sheep and harvest my corn  you are pleased to be saucy girl he replied biting his lip i have no time to bandy wordssign and do you witness emlyn stower  cicely took the document glanced at it then slowly tore it into four pieces and threw it to the floor  rob me and my unborn child if you can and will at least ill be no thiefs partner she said quietly now if you want my name go forge it for i sign nothing  the abbots face grew very evil  do you remember woman he asked that here you are in my power do you not know that rebellious sinners such as you are can be shut in a dark dungeon and fed on the bread and water of affliction and beaten with the rods of penance will you do my bidding or shall these things fall on you  cicelys beautiful face flushed up and for a moment her blue eyes filled with the tears of shame and terror then they cleared again and she looked at him boldly and answered  i know that a murderer can be a torturer also why should not he who butchered the father scourge the daughter too but i know also that there is a god who protects the innocent though sometimes he is slow to lift his hand and to him i appeal my lord abbot i know moreover that i am foterell and carfax and that no man or woman of my blood has ever yet yielded to fear or pain i sign nothing and turning she left the room  now the abbot and emlyn were alone suddenly before she could speak for her tongue was tied with rage he began to rate and curse her and to threaten horrible things against her and her mistress such things as only a cruel spaniard could imagine at length he paused for breath and she broke in  peace wicked man lest the roof fall on you for i am sure that every cruel word you speak shall become a snake to strike you will you not take warning by what befell you last night or must there be more such lessons  oho he answered so you know of that do you as i thought your witchcraft was at work there  how can i help knowing what the whole sky blazoned the fat monks of blossholme must draw their girdles tight this winter those stolen lands bring no luck it seems and john foterells blood has turned to fire be warned i say be warned nay ill hear no more of your foul tongue lay a finger on that poor lady if you dare and pay the price and she too turned and went  ere he left the nunnery the abbot had an interview with mother matilda  cicely must be disciplined he said gently at first afterwards with roughness even to scourging if need werefor her souls sake also her servant emlyn must be kept away from herfor her souls sake since without doubt she was a dangerous witch also when the time of the birth of the child came on he would send a wise woman to wait upon her one who was accustomed to such casesfor her bodys sake and that of her child in the midst of the great trouble that had fallen upon them through the terrible fire at the abbey which had cost them such fearful loss to say nothing of the lives of two of the servants and others burned and maimed he had not much time to talk of such small things but did she understand  then it was that mother matilda the meek and gentle brought pain and astonishment to the heart of the lord abbot her spiritual superior  she did not understand in the least such discipline as he suggested whatever might be her faults and frailty was she declared with vigour entirely unsuited to the case of the lady cicely who in her opinion had suffered much for a small cause and who moreover was about to become a mother and therefore should be treated with every gentleness for her part she washed her hands of the whole business and rather than enforce such commands would lay the case before the vicargeneral in london who she understood was ready to look into such matters or at least she would set the lady harflete and her servant outside the gates and call upon the charitable to assist them of course however if his lordship chose to send a skilled woman to wait upon her in her trouble she could have no objection provided that this woman were a person of good repute but in the circumstances it was idle to talk to her of bread and water and dark cells and scourgings such things should never happen while she was prioress before they did she and her sisters would walk out of the nunnery and leave the kings courts to judge of the matter  now the state of the abbot was very like to that of a terrier dog which being accustomed to worry and torment a certain ewesheep comes upon the same after it has lambed and finds a new creatureone that instead of running in affright turns upon it and with head and hood and all its weight of mutton butts and leaps and tramples then what chance has that dog against the terrible and unsuspected fury of the sheep born as it thought for it to tear then what can it do but run panting and discomfited to its kennel so it was with the abbot at the onslaught of mother matilda in the defence of her lambcicely with emlyn he had been prepared to exchange bite for bitebut mother matilda his own pet quarry it was too much he could only go away cursing all women and their infinite variety on which no man might build who would have thought it of mother matilda of all people on the earth  so it came to pass that at the nunnery notwithstanding these terrible threats things went on much as they had done before since the times were such that even an allpowerful and remote lord abbot with right of gallows could not drive matters to an extremity cicely was not shut into the dungeon and fed on bread and water much less was she scourged nor was she separated from her nurse emlyn although it is true that the prioress reproved her for her resistance to established authority and when she had finished her lecture kissed and blessed her and called her her sweet child her dove and joy  but if there was sameness at the nunnery at the abbey there was constant change and excitement only three days after the fire the great flock of eight hundred lambs rushed one night over the red cliff on the fell where as all shepherds in that country know there is a sheer drop of forty feet never was lambs flesh so cheap in blossholme and the country round as on the morrow of that night while every hind within ten miles could have a winter coat for the skinning moreover it was said and sworn to by the shepherds that the devil himself with horns and hoofs and mounted on a jackass had been seen driving the same lambs  next the ghost of sir john foterell appeared clad in armour sometimes mounted and sometimes afoot but always at nighttime first this dreadful spirit was perceived walking in the gardens of shefton hall where it met the abbots caretakerfor the place was now shut upas he went to set a springe for hares he was a man advanced in years yet few horses ever covered the distance between shefton and blossholme abbey more quickly than he did that night  nor would he or any other return to his charge so that henceforth shefton was left as a dwelling for the ghost which as all might see from time to time shone in the windowplaces like a candle moreover the said ghost travelled far and wide for on dark windy nights it knocked upon the doors of those that in its lifetime had been its tenants and in a hollow voice declared that it had been murdered by the abbot of blossholme and his underlings who held its daughter in durance and under threats of unearthly vengeance commanded all men to bring him to justice and to pay him neither fees nor homage  so much terror did this ghost cause that thomas bolle the swift of foot was set to watch for it and returned announcing that he had seen it and that it called him by his name whereon he being a bold fellow and believing that it was but a man sent an arrow straight through it at which it laughed and forthwith vanished away more in proof of these things he led the abbot and his monks to the very place and showed them where he had stood and where the ghost stoodyes and the arrow of which all the feathers had been mysteriously burnt off and the wood seared as though by fire sunk deep into a tree beyond then as this thing had become a scandal and a dread the abbot in his robes solemnly laid the ghost thomas bolle showing him exactly where it had passed  this spirit being well and truly laid like a foundationstone the abbot and his monks returned homeward through the wood but as they went a dreadful voice which all recognized as that of sir john foterell called these words from the shadows of an impenetrable thicketfor now the night was falling  clement maldonado abbot of blossholme i whom thou didst murder summon thee to meet me within a year before the throne of god  thereon all fled yes even the abbot fled or rather as he said his horse did thomas bolle who had lagged behind outrunning them every one and getting home the first saying aves as he went  after this although the whole countryside hunted for it sir johns ghost was seen no more doubtless its work was done but the abbot explained matters differently other and worse things were seen however  one moonlight night a disturbance was heard among the cows that bellowed and rushed about the field into which they had been turned after milking thinking that dogs had got amongst them the herd and a watchmanfor now no man would stir alone after sunset at blossholmewent to see what was happening and presently fell down half dead with fright for there leaning over the gate and laughing at them was the foul fiend himselfthe fiend with horns and tail and in his hand an instrument like a pitchfork  how the pair got home again they never knew but this is certain that after that night no one could milk those cows moreover some of them slipped their calves and became so wild that they must be slaughtered  next came rumours that even the nunnery itself was haunted especially the chapel here voices were heard talking and emlyn stower who was praying there came out vowing that she had seen a ball of fire which rolled up and down the aisle and in the centre of it a mans head that seemed to try to talk to her but could not  into this matter inquiry was held by the abbot himself who asked emlyn if she knew the face that was in the ball of fire she answered that she thought so it seemed very like to one of his own guards named andrew woods or more commonly drunken andrew a scotchman whom sir christopher harflete was said to have killed on the night of the great burning at least his lordship would remember that this andrew had a broken nose and so had the head in the fire but as it appeared to have changed a great deal since death she could not be quite certain all she was sure of was that it seemed to be trying to give her some message  now recalling the trick that had been played with the said andrews body the abbot was silent only he asked shrewdly if emlyn had seen so terrible a thing there how it came about that she was not afraid to be alone in the chapel which he was informed she frequented much she answered with a laugh that it was men she dreaded not spirits good or ill  no he exclaimed with a burst of rage you do not dread them woman because you are a witch and summon them nor shall we be free from these wizardries until the fire has you and your company  if so replied emlyn coolly i will ask dead andrew for his message to you next time we meet unless he chooses to deliver it to you himself  so they parted but that very night there happened the worst thing of all it was about one in the morning when the abbot whose window was set open was wakened by a voice that spoke with a scotch accent and repeatedly called him by his name summoning him to look out and see he and others rose and looked but could see nothing for the night was very dark and rain fell when the dawn came however their search was rewarded for there set upon a pinnacle of the abbey church and staring straight into the window of his lordships sleepingroom from which it was but a few yards distant was the dreadful head of andrew woods  furiously the abbot asked who had done this horrible thing but the monks who were sure that it was the same being that had bewitched the cows only shrugged their shoulders and suggested that the grave of andrew should be opened to see if he had lost his head this was done at length although for his own reasons the abbot forbade it talking of the violation of the dead  well the grave was opened when maldon was away on one of his mysterious journeys and lo no andrew was there but only a beam of oakwood stuffed out with straw to the shape of a man and sewn up in a blanket for the real andrew or rather what was left of him lay it may be remembered in another grave that was supposed to be filled by sir christopher harflete  from this day forward the whole countryside for fifty miles round rang with the tales of what were known as the blossholme witchings of which a proof was still to be seen by all men in the withered head of andrew perched upon its pinnacle whence none could be found to remove it for love or money only it was noted that the abbot changed his sleepingchamber after which except for a sickness which struck the monksit was thought from the drinking of sour beerthese bedevilments were abated  indeed at that time men had other things to think of since the air was thick with rumours of impending change the king threatened the church and the church prepared to resist the king there was talk of the suppression of the monasteriessome in fact had already been suppressedand more talk of a rising of the faithful in the shires of york and lincoln high matters which called abbot maldon much away from home  one day he returned weary but satisfied from a long journey and amongst the news that awaited him found a message from the prioress over which he pondered while he ate his food also there was a letter from spain which he studied eagerly  some nine months had passed since the ship great yarmouth sailed and during this time all that had been heard of her was that she had never reached seville so that like every one else the abbot believed she had foundered in the deep seas this was a sad event which he had borne with resignation seeing that although it meant the loss of his letters which were of importance she had aboard of her several persons whom he wished to see no more especially sir christopher harflete and sir john foterells servingman jeffrey stokes who was said to carry with him certain inconvenient documents even his secretary and chaplain brother martin could be spared being maldon felt a character better suited to heaven than to an earth where the best of men must be prepared sometimes to compromise with conscience  in short the vanishing of the great yarmouth was the wise decree of a farseeing providence that had removed certain stumblingblocks from his feet which of late had been forced to travel over a rough and thorny road for the dead tell no tales although it was true that the ghost of sir john foterell and the grinning head of drunken andrew on his pinnacle seemed to be instances to the contrary christopher harflete and jeffrey stokes at the bottom of the bay of biscay could bring no awkward charges and left him none to deal with save an imprisoned and forgotten girl and an unborn child  now things were changed again however for the spanish letter in his hand told him that the great yarmouth had not sunk since two members of her crew who escapedhow it was not saiddeclared that she had been captured by turkish or other infidel pirates and taken away through the straits of gibraltar to some place unknown therefore if he had survived the voyage christopher harflete might still be living and so might jeffrey stokes and brother martin yet this was not likely for probably they would have perished in the fight being hotheaded englishmen all three of them or at the best have been committed to the turkish galleys whence not one man in a thousand ever returned  on the whole then he had little cause to fear them who were dead or as good as dead especially in the midst of so many more pressing dangers all he had to fear all that stood between him or rather the church and a very rich inheritance was the girl in the nunnery and an unborn child andyes emlyn stower well he was sure that the child would not live and probably the mother would not live as for emlyn as she deserved she would be burned for a witch ere long too now that he had time to see to it and if she survived her sickness although he grieved for her cicely her accomplice should justly accompany her to the stake meanwhile as mother matildas message told him this matter of the child was urgent  the abbot called a monk who was waiting on him and bade him send word to a woman known as goody megges bidding her come at once within ten minutes she entered having as she explained been warned to be close at hand  this goody megges who had some local repute as a wise woman was a person of about fifty years of age remarkable for her enormous size a flat face with small oblong eyes and a little twisted mouth which had caused her to be nicknamed the flounder she greeted the abbot with much reverence curtseying till he thought she would fall backwards and having received his fatherly blessing sank into a chair that seemed to vanish beneath her bulk  you will wonder why i summon you here friend since this is no place for the services of those of your trade began the abbot with a smile  oh no my lord answered the woman ive heard it is to wait upon sir christopher harfletes wife in her trouble  i wish that i could call her by the honoured name of wife said the abbot with a sigh but a mockmarriage does not make a wife mistress megges and alas the poor babe if ever it should be born will be but a bastard marked from its birth with the brand of shame  now the flounder who was no fool began to take her cue  it is sad very sad your holinessno thats wrong but never mind it will be right before alls done and a good omen i say coming so sudden and chancyyour lordship i meannot but what theres lots of the sort about here as is generally the case round ai mean everywhere moreover they generally grow up bad and ungrateful as i know well from my own threenot but what of course i was married fast enough well what i was going to say was that when things is so sometimes it is a true blessing if the little innocents should go off at the first and so be spared the finger of shame and the sniff of scorn and she paused  yes mistress megges or at least in such a case it is not for us to rail at the decree of heavenprovided of course that the infant has lived long enough to be baptized he added hastily  no your eminence no thats just what i said to that smith girl last spring when being a heavy sleeper i happened to overlie her brat and woke up to find it flat and blue when she saw it she took on bellowing like a heifer that has lost its first calf and i said to her mary this isnt me its heaven mary you should be very thankful since my burden has rid you of your burden and you can bury such a tiny one for next to nothing mary cry a little if you like for thats natural with the first but dont come here flying in the face of heaven with your railings and gates and postsespecially the rails for heaven hates em  ah asked the abbot with mild interest and pray what did mary do then  do the graceless wench why she said is it rails youre talking of you pigsmothering old sow then heres a rail for you and she pulled the top bar off my own fencefor we were talking by the dooroak it was and three by twoand knocked me flatheres the scar of it on my headsinging out is that enough or will you have the gate and the posts too oh if theres one thing i hate it is railing specially if made of hard oak and held edgeways  so the wicked old hag babbled on after her hideous fashion while the abbot stared at the ceiling  enough of these sad stories of vice and violence such mischances will happen and of course you were not to blame now good mistress megges will you undertake this case which cannot be left to ignorant nuns though times are hard here since of late many losses have fallen on our house your skill shall be well paid  the woman shuffled her big feet and stared at the floor then looked up suddenly with a glance that seemed to bore to his heart like a bradawl and asked  and if perchance the blessed babe should fly to heaven through my fingers as in my time i have known dozens of them do should i still get that pay  then the abbot answered with a smilea somewhat sickly smilethen i think mistress you should have double pay to console you for your sorrow and for any doubts that might be thrown upon your skill  now thats noble trading she replied with an evil leer such as one might hope for from an abbot but my lord they say the nunnery is haunted and i cant face ghosts man or woman with rails or without em mother flounder doesnt mind but ghostsno also mistress stower is a witch and might lay a curse on me and those nuns are full of crinks and cranks and can pray an honest soul to death  come come my time is short what is it you want woman out with it  the inn there at the fordyour lordship will need a tenant next month its a good paying house for those who know how to keep their mouths shut and to look the other way and through vile scandal and evil slanderers such as the smith girl my business isnt what it was now if i could have it without rent for the first two years till i had time to work up the trade  the abbot who could bear no more of the creature rose from his chair and said sharply  i will remember yes i will promise go now the reverent mother is advised of your coming and report to me night and morning of the progress of the case why woman what are you doing for she had suddenly slid to her knees and grasped his robes with her thick filthy hands  absolution holy lordship i ask absolution and blessingpax meggiscum and the rest of it  absolution there is nothing to absolve  oh yes my lord there is plenty though i am wondering who will absolve you for your half also there are rows of little angels that sometimes wont let me sleep and thats why i cant stomach ghosts id rather sup in winter on cold small ale and halfcooked pork than face even a stillborn ghost  begone said the abbot in such a voice that she scrambled to her feet and went unblessed and unabsolved  when the door had closed behind her he went to the window and flung it wide although the night was foul  by all the saints he muttered that beastly murderess poisons the air why i wonder does god allow such filthy things to live cannot she ply her helltrade less grossly oh clement maldonado how low are you sunk that you must use tools like these and on such a business and yet there is no other way not for myself but for the church o lord the great plot thickens and all men clamour to me its head and spring for money give me money and within six months yorkshire and the north will be up and without a year henry the antichrist will be dead and the princess mary fast upon the throne with the emperor and the pope for watchdogs that stiffnecked cicely must die and her babe must die and then ill twist the secret of the jewels out of the witch emlynon the rack if need be those jewelsive seen them so often why they would feed an army but while cicely or her brat lives where is my claim to them so alas they must die but oh the hag is right who shall give me absolution for a deed i hate not for me not for me o my patron but for the church and flinging himself to the floor before the holy image of his chosen saint he rested his head upon its feet and wept    chapter x  mother megges and the ghost  flounder megges with all the paraphernalia of her trade was established as nurse to cicely at the nunnery this establishment it is true had not been easy since emlyn who knew something of the womans repute and suspected more resisted it with all her strength but here the prioress intervened in her gentle way she herself she explained did not like this person who looked so odd drank so much beer and talked so fast yet she had made inquiries and found that she was extraordinarily skilled in matters of that nature indeed it was said that she had succeeded in cases that were wonderfully difficult which the leech had abandoned as hopeless though of course there had been other cases where she had not succeeded but these she was informed were generally those of poor people who did not pay her well now in this instance her pay would be ample for she mother matilda had promised her a splendid fee out of her private store and for the rest since no man doctor might enter there who else was competent not she or the other nuns for none of them had been married save old bridget who was silly and had long ago forgotten all such things not emlyn even who was but a girl when her own child was born and since then had been otherwise employed therefore there was no choice  to this reasoning emlyn agreed perforce though she mistrusted her of the fat wretch whose appearance poor cicely also disliked still for very fear emlyn was humble and civil to her for if she were not who could know if she would put out all her skill upon behalf of her mistress therefore she did her bidding like a slave and spiced her beer and made her bed and even listened to her foul jests and talk unmurmuringly    the business was over at length and the child a noble boy born into the world had not the flounder produced it in triumph laid upon a little basket covered with a lambskin and had not emlyn and mother matilda and all the nuns kissed and blessed it had it not also for fear of accident such was the fatherly forethought of the abbot been baptized at once by a priest who was waiting under the names of john christopher foterell john after its grandfather and christopher after its father with foterell for a surname since the abbot would not allow that it should be called harflete being as he averred baseborn  so this child was born and mother megges swore that of all the two hundred and three that she had issued into the world it was the finest nine and a half pounds in weight at the very least also as its voice and movements testified it was lusty and like to live for did not the flounder in sight of all the wondering nuns hold it up hanging by its hands to her two fat forefingers and afterwards drink a whole quart of spiced ale to its health and long life  but if the babe was like to live cicely was like to die indeed she was very very ill and perhaps would have passed away had it not been for a device of emlyns for when she was at her worst and the flounder shaking her head and saying that she could do no more had departed to her eternal ale and a nap emlyn crept up and took her mistresss cold hand  darling she said hear me but cicely did not stir darling she repeated hear me i have news for you of your husband  cicelys white face turned a little on the pillow and her blue eyes opened  of my husband she whispered why he is gone as i soon shall be what news of him  that he is not gone that he lives or so i believe though heretofore i have hid it from you  the head was lifted for a moment and the eyes stared at her with wondering joy  do you trick me nurse nay you would never do that give me the milk i want it now ill listen i promise you ill not die till you have told me if christopher lives why should i die who only hoped to find him  so emlyn whispered all she knew it was not much only that christopher had not been buried in the grave where he was said to be buried and that he had been taken wounded aboard the ship great yarmouth of the fate of which ship fortunately she had heard nothing still slight as they might be to cicely these tidings were a magic medicine for did they not mean the rebirth of hope hope that for nine long months had been dead and buried with christopher from that moment she began to mend  when the flounder having slept off her drink returned to the sickbed she stared at her amazed and muttered something about witchcraft she who had been sure that she would die as in those days so many women did who fell into hands like hers indeed she was bitterly disappointed knowing that this death was desired by her employer who now after all might let the ford inn to another moreover the child was no waster but one who was set for life well that at least she could mend and if it were done quickly the shock might kill the mother yet the thing was not so easy as it looked for there were many loving eyes upon that babe  when she wished to take it to her bed at night emlyn forbade her fiercely and on being appealed to the prioress who knew the creatures drunken habits and had heard rumours of the fate of the smith infant and others gave orders that it was not to be so since the mother was too weak to have it with her the boy was laid in a little cot at her side and always day and night one or more of the sweetfaced nuns stood at the head of that cot watching as might a guardian angel also it took only natures food since from the first cicely would nurse it so that she could not mix any drug with its milk that would cause it to sleep itself away  so the days went on bringing black wrath despair almost to the heart of mother megges till at length there came the chance she sought one fine evening when the nuns were gathered at vespers but as it happened not in the chapel because since the tale of the hauntings they shunned the place after high noon cicely whose strength was returning to her asked emlyn to change her garments and remake her bed meanwhile the babe was given to sister bridget who doted on it with instructions to take it to walk in the garden for a time since the rain had passed off and the afternoon was now very soft and pleasant so she went and there presently was met by the flounder who was supposed to be asleep but had followed her a person of whom the halfwitted bridget was much afraid  what are you doing with my babe old fool she screeched at her thrusting her fat face to within an inch of the nuns youll let it fall and i shall be blamed give me the angel or i will twist your nose for you give it me i say and get you gone  in her fear and flurry old bridget obeyed and departed at a run then recovering herself a little or drawn by some instinct she returned hid herself in a clump of lilac bushes and watched  presently she saw the flounder after glancing about to make sure that she was alone enter the chapel carrying the child and heard her bolt the door after her now bridget as she said afterwards grew very frightened she knew not why and acting on impulse ran to the chancel window and climbing on to a wheelbarrow that stood there looked through it this is what she saw  mother megges was kneeling in the chancel as she thought at first to say her prayers till she perceived for a ray from the setting sun showed it all that on the paving before her lay the infant and that this shedevil was thrusting her thick forefinger down its throat for already it grew black in the face and as she thrust muttering savagely so horrorstruck was bridget that she could neither move nor cry  then while she stood petrified suddenly there appeared the figure of a man in rusty armour the flounder looked up saw him and withdrawing her finger from the mouth of the child let out yell after yell the man who said nothing drew a sword and lifted it whereon the murderess screamed  the ghost the ghost spare me sir john i am poor and he paid me spare me for christs sake and so saying she rolled on to the floor in a fit and there turned and twisted until she lay still  then the man or the ghost of a man having looked at her sheathed his sword and lifting up the babe which now drew its breath again and cried marched with it down the aisle the next thing of which bridget became aware was that he stood before her the infant in his arms holding it out to her his face she could not see for the vizor was down but he spoke in a hollow voice saying  this gift from heaven to the lady harflete bid her fear nothing for one devil i have garnered and the others are ripe for reaping  bridget took the child and sank down on to the ground and at that moment the nuns alarmed by the awful yells rushed through the side door headed by mother matilda they too saw the figure and knew the foterell cognizance upon its helm and shield but it waited not to speak to them only passed behind some trees and vanished  their first care was for the infant which they thought the man was stealing then after they were sure that it had taken no real hurt they questioned old bridget but could get nothing from her for all she did was to gibber and point first to the barrow and next to the chancel window at length mother matilda understood and climbing on to the barrow looked through the window as bridget had done she looked she saw and fell back fainting    an hour had gone by the child unhurt save for a little bruising of its tender mouth was asleep upon its mothers breast bridget having recovered at length had told all her tale to every one of them save cicely who as yet knew nothing for she and emlyn did not hear the screams their rooms being on the other side of the building the abbot had been sent for and accompanied by monks arrived in the midst of a thunderstorm and pouring rain he too had heard the tale heard it with a pale face while his monks crossed themselves at length he asked of the woman megges they replied that living or dead she was as they supposed still in the chapel which none of them had dared to enter  come let us see said the abbot and they went there to find the door locked as bridget had said  smiths were sent for and broke it in while all stood in the pouring rain and watched it was open at last and they entered with torches and tapers for now the darkness was dense the abbot leading them they came to the chancel where something lay upon the floor and held down the torches to look then they saw that which caused them all to turn and fly calling on the saints to protect them in her life mother megges had not been lovely but in the death that had overtaken her    it was morning the lord abbot and his monks were assembled in the guestchamber and opposite to them were the lady prioress and her nuns and with them emlyn  witchcraft shouted the abbot smiting his fist upon the table black witchcraft satan himself and his foulest demons walk the countryside and have their home in this nunnery last night they manifested themselves  by saving a babe from a cruel death and bringing a hateful murderess to doom broke in emlyn  silence sorceress shouted the abbot get thee behind me satan i know you and your familiars and he glared at the prioress  what may you mean my lord abbot asked mother matilda bridling up my sisters and i do not understand emlyn stower is right do you call that witchcraft which works so good an end the ghost of sir john foterell appeared herewe admit it who saw that ghost but what did the spirit do it slew the hellish woman whom you sent among us and it rescued the blessed babe when her finger was down its throat to choke out its pure life if that be witchcraft i stand by it tell us what did the wretch mean when she cried out to the spirit to spare her because she was poor and had been bribed for her iniquity who bribed her my lord abbot none in this house ill swear and who changed sir john foterell from flesh to spirit why is he a ghost today  am i here to answer riddles woman and who are you that you dare put such questions to me i depose you i set your house under ban the judgment of the church shall be pronounced against you all dare not to leave your doors until the court is composed to try you think not you shall escape your english land is sick and heresy stalks abroad but he added slowly fire can still bite and there is store of faggots in the woods prepare your souls for judgment now i go  do as it pleases you answered the enraged mother matilda when you set out your case we will answer it but meanwhile we pray that you take what is left of your dead hireling with you for we find her ill company and here she shall have no burial my lord abbot the charter of this nunnery is from the monarch of england whatever authority you and those that went before you have usurped it was granted by the first edward and the appointment of every prioress since his day has been signed by the sovereign and no other i hold mine under the manual of the eighth henry you cannot depose me for i appeal from the abbot to the king fare you well my lord and followed by her little train of aged nuns she swept from the room like an offended queen  after the terrible death of the childmurderess and the restoration of her babe to her unharmed cicelys recovery was swift within a week she was up and walking and within ten days as strong or stronger than ever she had been nothing more had been heard of the abbot and though all knew that danger threatened them from this quarter they were content to enjoy the present hour of peace and wait till it was at hand  but in cicelys awakened mind there arose a keen desire to learn more of what her nurse had hinted to her when she lay upon the very edge of death day by day she plied emlyn with questions till at length she knew all namely that the tidings came from thomas bolle and that he dressed in her fathers armour was the ghost who had saved her boy from death now nothing would serve her but that she must see thomas herself as she said to thank him though truly as emlyn knew well to draw from his own lips every detail and circumstance that she could gather concerning christopher  for a while emlyn held out against her for she knew the dangers of such a meeting but in the end being able to refuse her lady nothing she gave way  at length at the appointed hour of sunset emlyn and cicely stood in the chapel whither the latter told the nuns she wished to go to return thanks for her deliverance from many dangers they knelt before the altar and while they made pretence to pray there heard knocks which were the signal of the presence of thomas bolle emlyn answered them with other knocks which told that all was safe whereon the wooden image turned and thomas appeared dressed as before in sir john foterells armour so like did he seem to her dead father in this familiar mail that for a moment cicely thought it must be he and her knees trembled until he knelt before her kissing her hand asking after her health and that of the infant and whether she were satisfied with his service  indeed and indeed yes she answered and oh friend all that i have henceforth is yours should i ever have anything again who am but a prisoned beggar meanwhile my blessing and that of heaven rest upon you you gallant man  thank me not lady answered the honest thomas to speak truth it was emlyn whom i served for though monks parted us we have been friends for many a year as for the matter of the child and that spawn of hell the flounder be grateful to god not to me for it was by mere chance that i came here that evening which i had not intended to do i was going about my business with the cattle when something seemed to tell me to arm and come it was as though a hand pushed me and the rest you know and so i think by now does mother megges he added grimly  yes yes thomas and in truth i do thank god whose finger i see in all this business as i thank you his instrument but there are other things whereof emlyn has spoken to me she saidah she said my husband whom i thought slain and buried in truth was only wounded and not buried but shipped oversea tell me that story friend omitting nothing but swiftly for our time is short i thirst to hear it from your own lips  so in his slow wandering way he told her word by word all that he had seen all that he had learned and the sum of it was that sir christopher had been shipped abroad upon the great yarmouth sorely wounded but not dead and that with him had sailed jeffrey stokes and the monk martin  thats ten months gone said cicely has naught been heard of this ship by now she should be home again  thomas hesitated then answered  no tidings came of her from spain then although i said nothing of it even to emlyn she was reported lost with all hands at sea then came another story  ah that other story  lady two of her crew reached the wash i did not see them and they have shipped again for marseilles in france but i spoke with a shepherd who is halfbrother to one of them and he told me that from him he learned that the great yarmouth was set upon by two turkish pirates and captured after a brave fight in which the captain goody and others were killed this man and his comrade escaped in a boat and drifted to and fro till they were picked up by a homewardbound caravel which landed them at hull thats all i knowsave one thing  one thing oh what thing thomas that my husband is dead  nay nay the very opposite that he is alive or was for these men saw him and jeffrey stokes and martin the priest no craven as i know fighting like devils till the turks overwhelmed them by numbers and having bound their hands carried them all three unwounded on board one of their ships wishing doubtless to make slaves of such brave fellows  now although emlyn would have stopped her still cicely plied him with questions which he answered as best he could till suddenly a sound caught his ear  look at the window he exclaimed  they looked and saw a sight that froze their blood for there staring at them through the glass was the dark face of the abbot and with it other faces  betray me not or i shall burn he whispered say only that i came to haunt you and silently as a shadow he glided to his niche and was gone  what now emlyn  one thing onlythomas must be saved a bold face and stand to it is it our fault if your fathers ghost should haunt this chapel remember your fathers ghost no other ah here they come  as she spoke the door was thrown wide and through it came the abbot and his rout of attendants within two paces of the women they halted hanging together like bees for they were afraid while a voice cried seize the witches  cicelys terror passed from her and she faced them boldly  what would you with us my lord abbot she asked  we would know sorceress what shape was that which spoke with you but now and whither has it gone  the same that saved my child and called the sword of god down upon the murderess it wore my fathers armour but its face i did not see it has gone whence it came but where that is i know not discover if you can  woman you trifle with us what said the thing  it spoke of the slaughter of sir john foterell by kings grave mount and of those who wrought it and she looked at him steadily until his eyes fell before hers  what else  it told me that my husband is not dead neither did you bury him as you put about but shipped him hence to spain whence it prophesied he will return again to be revenged upon you it told me that he was captured by the infidel moors and with him jeffrey stokes my fathers servant and the priest martin your secretary then it looked up and vanished or seemed to vanish though perhaps it is among us now  aye answered the abbot satan with whom you hold converse is always among us cicely foterell and emlyn stower you are foul witches selfconfessed the world has borne your sorceries too long and you shall answer for them before god and man as i the lord abbot of blossholme have right and authority to make you do seize these witches and let them be kept fast in their chamber till i constitute the court ecclesiastic for their trial  so they took hold of cicely and emlyn and led them to the nunnery as they crossed the garden they were met by mother matilda and the nuns who for a second time within a month ran out to see what was the tumult in the chapel  what is it now cicely asked the prioress  now we are witches mother she answered with a sad smile  aye broke in emlyn and the charge is that the ghost of the murdered sir john foterell was seen speaking to us  why why exclaimed the prioress if the spirit of a womans father appears to her is she therefore to be declared a witch then is poor sister bridget a witch also for this same spirit brought the child to her  aye said the abbot i had forgotten her she is another of the crew let her be seized and shut up also greatly do i hope when it comes to the hour of trial that there may not be found to be more of them and he glanced at the poor nuns with menace in his eye  so cicely and emlyn were shut within their room and strictly guarded by monks but otherwise not illtreated indeed save for their confinement there was little change in their condition the child was allowed to be with cicely the nuns were allowed to visit her  only over both of them hung the shadow of great trouble they were aware and it seemed to them purposely suffered to be aware that they were about to be tried for their lives upon monstrous and obscene charges namely that they had consorted with a dim and awful creature called the enemy of mankind whom it was supposed human beings had power to call to their counsel and assistance to them who knew well that this being was thomas bolle the thing seemed absurd yet it could not be denied that the said thomas at emlyns instigation had worked much evil on the monks of blossholme paying them or rather their abbot back in his own coin  yet what was to be done to tell the facts would be to condemn thomas to some fearful fate which even then they would be called upon to share although possibly they might be cleared of the charge of witchcraft  emlyn set the matter before cicely urging neither one side nor the other and waited her judgment it was swift and decisive  this is a coil that we cannot untangle said cicely let us betray no one but put our trust in god i am sure she added that god will help us as he did when mother megges would have murdered my boy i shall not attempt to defend myself by wronging others i leave everything to him  strange things have happened to many who trusted in god to that the whole evil world bears witness said emlyn doubtfully  may be answered cicely in her quiet fashion perhaps because they did not trust enough or rightly at least there lies my path and i will walk in itto the fire if need be  there is some seed of greatness in you to what will it grow i wonder replied emlyn with a shrug of her shoulders  on the morrow this faith of cicelys was put to a sharp test the abbot came and spoke with emlyn apart this was the burden of his song  give me those jewels and all may yet be well with you and your mistress vile witches though you are if not you burn  as before she denied all knowledge of them  find me the jewels or you burn he answered would you pay your lives for a few miserable gems  now emlyn weakened not for her own sake and said she would speak with her mistress  he bade her do so  i thought that those jewels were burned emlyn do you then know where they are asked cicely  aye i have said nothing of it to you but i know speak the word and i give them up to save you  cicely thought a while and kissed her child which she held in her arms then laughed aloud and answered  not so that abbot shall never be richer for any gem of mine i have told you in what i trust and it is not jewels whether i burn or whether i am saved he shall not have them  good said emlyn that is my mind also i only spoke for your sake and she went out and told the abbot  he came into cicelys chamber and raged at them he said that they should be excommunicated then tortured and then burned but cicely whom he had thought to frighten never winced  if so so let it be she replied and i will bear all as best i can i know nothing of these jewels but if they still exist they are mine not yours and i am innocent of any witchcraft do your work for i am sure that the end shall be far other than you think  what said the abbot has the foul fiend been with you again that you talk thus certainly well sorceress soon you will sing another tune and he went to the door and summoned the prioress  put these women upon bread and water he said and prepare them for the rack that they may discover their accomplices  mother matilda set her gentle face and answered  it shall not be done in this nunnery my lord abbot i know the law and you have no such power moreover if you move them hence who are my guests i appeal to the king and meanwhile raise the country on you  said i not that they had accomplices sneered the abbot and went his way  but of the torture no more was heard for that appeal to the king had an ill sound in his ears    chapter xi  doomed  it was the day of trial from dawn cicely and emlyn had seen people hurrying in and out of the gates of the nunnery and heard workmen making preparation in the guesthall below their chamber about eight one of the nuns brought them their breakfast her face was scared and white she only spoke in whispers looking behind her continually as though she knew she was being watched  emlyn asked who their judges were and she answered  the abbot a strange blackfaced prior and the old bishop oh god help you my sisters god help us all and she fled away  now for a moment emlyns heart failed her since before such a tribunal what chance had they the abbot was their bitter enemy and accuser the strange prior no doubt one of his friends and kindred while the ecclesiastic spoken of as the old bishop was well known as perhaps the cruelest man in england a scourge of hereticsthat is before heresy became the fashiona hunterout of witches and wizards and a timeserver to boot but to cicely she said nothing for what was the use seeing that soon she would learn all  they ate their food knowing both of them that they would need strength then cicely nursed her child and placing it in emlyns arms knelt down to pray while she was still praying the door opened and a procession appeared first came two monks then six armed men of the abbots guard then the prioress and three of her nuns at the sight of the beautiful young woman kneeling at her prayers the guards rough men though they were stopped as if unwilling to disturb her but one of the monks cried brutally  seize the accursed hypocrite and if she will not come drag her with you at the same time stretching out his hand as though to grasp her arm  but cicely rose and faced him saying  do not touch me i follow emlyn give me the child and let us go  so they went in the midst of the armed men the monks preceding the nuns with bowed heads following after presently they entered the large hall but on its threshold were ordered to pause while way was made for them cicely never forgot the sight of it as it appeared that day the lofty arched roof of rich chestnutwood set there hundreds of years before by hands that spared neither work nor timber amongst the beams of which the bright light of morning played so clearly that she could see the spiders webs and in one of them a sleepy autumn wasp caught fast the mob of people gathered to watch her public trialfaces many of them that she had known from childhood  how they stared at her as she stood there by the head of the steps her sleeping child held in her arms they were a packed audience and had been prepared to condemn herthat she could see and hear for did not some of them point and frown and set up a cry of witch as they had been told to do but it died away the sight of her the daughter of one of their great men and the widow of another standing in her innocent beauty the slumbering babe upon her breast seemed to quell them till the hardest faces grew pitifulfull of resentment too some of them but not against her  then the three judges on the bench behind the table at which sat the monkish secretaries the hardfaced hooknosed old bishop in his gorgeous robes and mitre his crozier resting against the panelling behind him peering about him with beady eyes the sullen heavyjawed prior from some distant county on his left clad in a simple black gown with a girdle about his waist and on the right clement maldon abbot of blossholme and enemy of her house suave olivefaced foreignlooking his black uneasy eyes observing all his keen ears catching every word and murmur as he whispered something to the bishop that caused him to smile grimly lastly placed already in the roped space and guarded by a soldier poor old bridget the halfwitted who was gabbling words to which no one paid any heed  the path was clear now and they were ordered to walk on halfway up the hall something red attracted cicelys attention and glancing round she saw that it was the beard of thomas bolle their eyes met and his were full of fear in an instant she understood that he dreaded lest he should be betrayed and given over to some awful doom  fear nothing she whispered as she passed and he heard her or perhaps emlyns glance told him that he was safe at least a sign of relief broke from him  now they had entered the roped space and stood there  your name asked one of the secretaries pointing to cicely with the feather of his quill  all know it it is cicely harflete she answered gently whereon the clerk said roughly that she lied and the old wrangle began again as to the validity of her marriage the abbot maintaining that she was still cicely foterell the mother of a baseborn child  into this argument the bishop entered with some zest asking many questions and seeming more or less to take her side since where matters of religion were not concerned he was a keen lawyer and just enough at length however he swept the thing away remarking brutally that if half he had heard were true soon the name by which she had last been called in life would not concern her and bade the clerks write her down as cicely harflete or foterell  then emlyn gave her name and sister bridgets was written without question next the charge against them was read it was long and technical mixed up with latin words and phrases and all that cicely made out of it was that they were accused of many horrible crimes and of having called up the devil and consorted with him in the shape of a monster with horns and hoofs and of her fathers ghost when it was finished they were commanded to answer and pleaded not guilty or rather cicely and emlyn did for bridget broke into a long tale that could not be followed she was ordered to be silent after which no one took any more heed of what she said  now the bishop asked whether these women had been put to the question and when he was told no said that it seemed a pity as evidently they were stubborn witches and some discipline of the sort might have saved trouble again he asked if the witchs marks had been found on themthat is the spot where the devil had sealed their bodies on which as was well known his chosen could feel no pain he even suggested that the trial should be adjourned until they had been pricked all over with a nail to find this spot but ultimately gave up the point to save time  a last question was raised by the beetlebrowed prior who submitted that the infant ought also to be accused since he too was said to have consorted with the devil having according to the story been rescued from death by him and afterwards been carried in his arms and given to the nun bridget which was the only evidence against the said bridget if she was guilty why then was the infant innocent ought not they to burn together since a babe that had been nursed by the evil one was obviously damned  the legalminded bishop found this argument interesting but ultimately decided that it was safer to overrule it on account of the tender age of the criminal he added that it did not matter since doubtless the foul fiend would claim his own ere long  lastly before the witnesses were called emlyn asked for an advocate to defend them but the bishop replied with a chuckle that it was quite unnecessary since already they had the best of all advocatessatan himself  true my lord said cicely looking up we have the best of all advocates only you have misnamed him the god of the innocent is our advocate and in him i trust  blaspheme not sorceress shouted the old man and the evidence commenced  to follow it in detail is not necessary and indeed would be long for it took many hours first of all emlyns early life was set out much being made of the fact that her mother was a gypsy who had committed suicide and that her father had fallen under the ban of the inquisition an heretical work of his having been publicly burned then the abbot himself gave evidence since where the charge was sorcery no one seemed to think it strange that the same man should both act as judge and be the principal witness for the prosecution he told of cicelys wild words after the burning of cranwell towers from which burning she and her familiar emlyn had evidently escaped by magic without the aid of which it was plain they could not have lived he told of emlyns threats to him after she had looked into the bowl of water of all the dreadful things that had been seen and done at blossholme which no doubt these witches had brought abouthere he was rightthough how he knew not he told of the death of the midwife and of the appearance which she presented afterwardsa tale that caused his audience to shudder and lastly he told of the vision of the ghost of sir john foterell holding converse with the two accused in the chapel of the nunnery and its vanishing away  when at length he had finished emlyn asked leave to crossexamine him but this was refused on the ground that persons accused of such crimes had no right to crossexamine  then the court adjourned for a while to eat some food being brought for the prisoners who were forced to take it where they stood worse still cicely was driven to nurse her child in the presence of all that audience who stared and gibed at her rudely and were angry because emlyn and some of the nuns stood round her to form a living screen  when the judges returned the evidence went on though most of it was entirely irrelevant its volume was so great that at length the old bishop grew weary and said he would hear no more then the judges went on to put first to cicely and afterwards to emlyn a series of questions of a nature so abominable that after denying the first of them indignantly they stood silent refusing to answerproof positive of their guilt as the blackbrowed prior remarked in triumph lastly these hideous queries being exhausted cicely was asked if she had anything to say  somewhat she answered but i am weary and must be brief i am no witch i do not know what it means the abbot of blossholme who sits as my judge is my grievous enemy he claimed my fathers landswhich lands i believe he now holdsand cruelly murdered my said father by kings grave mount in the forest as he was riding to london to make complaint of him and reveal his treachery to his grace the king and his council  it is a lie witch broke in the abbot but taking no heed cicely went on  afterwards he and his hired soldiers attacked the house of my husband sir christopher harflete and burnt it slaying or striving to slayi know not whichmy said husband who has vanished away then he imprisoned me and my servant emlyn stower in this nunnery and strove to force me to sign papers conveying all my own and my childs property to him this i refused to do and therefore it is that he puts me on my trial because as i am told those who are found guilty of witchcraft are stripped of all their possessions which those take who are strong enough to keep them lastly i deny the authority of this court and appeal to the king who soon or late will hear my cry and avenge my wrongs and maybe my murder upon those who wrought them good people all hear my words i appeal to the king and to him under god above i entrust my cause and should i die the guardianship of my orphan son whom the abbot sent his creature to murderhis vile creature upon whose head fell the almightys justice as it will fall on yours you slaughterers of the innocent  so spoke cicely and having spoken worn out with fatigue and misery sank to the floorfor all these hours there had been no stool for her to sit onand crouched there still holding her child in her armsa piteous sight indeed which touched even the superstitious hearts of the crowd who watched her  now this appeal of hers to the king seemed to scare the fierce old bishop who turned and began to argue with the abbot cicely listening caught some of his words such as  on your head be it then i judge only of the cause ecclesiastic and shall direct it to be so entered upon the records of the execution of the sentence or the disposal of the property i wash my hands see you to it  so spoke pilate broke in cicely lifting her head and looking him in the eyes then she let it fall again and was silent  now emlyn opened her lips and from them burst a fierce torrent of words  do you know she began who and what is this spanish priest who sits to judge us of witchcraft well i will tell you years ago he fled from spain because of hideous crimes that he had committed there ask him of isabella the nun who was my fathers cousin and her end and that of her companions ask him of  at this point a monk to whom the abbot had whispered something slipped behind emlyn and threw a cloth over her face she tore it away with her strong hands and screamed out  he is a murderer he is a traitor he plots to kill the king i can prove it and thats why foterell diedbecause he knew  the abbot shouted something and again the monk a stout fellow named ambrose got the cloth over her mouth once more she wrenched herself loose and turning towards the people called  have i never a friend who have befriended so many is there no man in blossholme who will avenge me of this brute ambrose aye i see some  then this ambrose and others aiding him fell upon her striking her on the head and choking her till at length she sank half stunned and gasping to the ground  now after a hurried word or two with his colleagues the bishop sprang up and as darkness gathered in the hallfor the sun had setpronounced the sentence of the court  first he declared the prisoners guilty of the foulest witchcraft next he excommunicated them with much ceremony delivering their souls to their master satan then incidentally he condemned their bodies to be burnt without specifying when how or by whom out of the gloom a clear voice spoke saying  you exceed your powers priest and usurp those of the king beware  a tumult followed in which some cried aye and some nay and when at length it died down the bishop or it may have been the abbotfor none could see who spokeexclaimed  the church guards her own rights let the king see to his  he will he will answered the same voice the pope is in his bag monks your day is done  again there was tumult a very great tumult in truth the scene or rather the sounds were strange the bishop shrieking with rage upon the bench like a hen that has been caught upon her perch at night the blackbrowed prior bellowing like a bull the populace surging and shouting this and that the secretary calling for candles and when at length one was brought making a little star of light in that huge gloom putting his hand to his mouth and roaring  what of this bridget does she go free  the bishop made no answer it seemed as though he were frightened at the forces which he had let loose but the abbot hallooed back  burn the hag with the others and the secretary wrote it down upon his brief  then the guards seized the three of them to lead them away and the frightened babe set up a thin piercing wail while the bishop and his companions preceded by one of the monks bearing the candleit was that ambrose who had choked emlynmarched in procession down the hall to gain the great door  ere ever they reached it the candle was dashed from the hand of ambrose and a fearful tumult arose in the dense darkness for now all light had vanished there were screams and sounds of fighting and cries for help these died away the hall emptied by degrees for it seemed that none wished to stay there torches were lit and showed a strange scene  the bishop the abbot and the foreign prior lay here and there buffeted bleeding their robes torn off them so that they were almost naked while by the bishop was his crozier broken in two apparently across his own head worse of all the monk ambrose leaned against a pillar his feet seemed to go forward but his face looked backward for his neck was twisted like that of a michaelmas goose  the bishop looked about him and felt his hurts then he called to his people  bring me my cloak and a horse for i have had enough of blossholme and its wizardries settle your own matters henceforth abbot maldon for in them i find no luck and he glanced at his broken staff  thus ended the great trial of the blossholme witches    cicely had sunk to sleep at last and emlyn watched her for since there was nowhere else to put them they were back in their own room but guarded by armed men lest they should escape of this as emlyn knew well there was little chance for even if they were once outside the priory walls how could they get away without friends to help or food to eat or horses to carry them they would be run down within a mile moreover there was the child which cicely would never leave and after all she had undergone she herself was not fit to travel therefore it was that emlyn sat sleepless full of bitter wrath and fear for she could see no hope all was black as the night about them  the door opened and was shut and locked again then from behind the curtain appeared the tall figure of the prioress carrying a candle that made a star of light upon the shadows as she stood there holding it up and looking about her something came into emlyns mind perhaps she would help she who loved cicely did she not look like a figure of hope with her sweet face and her taper in the gloom emlyn advanced to meet her her finger on her lips  she sleeps wake her not she said have you come to tell us that we burn tomorrow  nay emlyn the old bishop has commanded that it shall not be for a week he would have time to get across england first indeed had it not been for the beating of him in the dark and the twisting of the neck of brother ambrose i believe that he would not have suffered it at all for fear of trouble afterwards but now he is full of rage and swears that he was set upon by evil spirits in the hall and that those who loosed them shall not live emlyn who killed father ambrose was it men or  men i think mother the devil does not twist necks except in monkish dreams is it wonderful that my ladythe greatest lady of all these parts and the most foully treatedshould have friends left to her why if they were not curs ere now her people would have pulled that abbey stone from stone and cut the throat of every man within its walls  emlyn said the prioress again in the name of jesus and on your soul tell me true is there witchcraft in all this business and if not what is its meaning  as much witchcraft as dwells in your gentle heart no more a man did these things ill not give you his name lest it should be wrung from you a man wore foterells armour and came here by a secret hole to take counsel with us in the chapel a man burnt the abbey dormers and the stacks and harried the beasts with a goatskin on his head and dragged the skull of drunken andrew from his grave doubtless it was his hand also that twisted ambroses neck because he struck me  the two women looked each other in the eyes  ah said the prioress i think i can guess now but emlyn you choose rough tools well fear not your secret is safe with me she paused a moment then went on oh i am glad who feared lest the fiends finger was in it all as in truth they believe now i see my path clear and will follow it to the death yes yes i will save you all or die  what path mother  emlyn you have heard no tidings for these many months but i have listen there is much afoot the king or the lord cromwell or both make war upon the lesser houses dissolving them seizing their goods turning the religious out of them upon the world to starve his grace sends royal commissioners to visit them and be judge and jury both they were coming here but i have friends and some fortune of my own who was not born meanly or illdowered and i found a way to buy them off one of these commissioners thomas legh as i heard only today makes inquisition at the monastery of bayfleet in yorkshire some eighty miles away of which my cousin alfred stukley whose letter reached me this morning is the prior emlyn ill go to this rough manfor rough he is they say old and feeble as i am ill seek him out and offer up the ancient house i rule to save your life and cicelysyes and bridgets also  you will go mother oh gods blessing be on you but how will you go they will never suffer it  the old nun drew herself up and answered  who has the right to say to the prioress of blossholme that she shall not travel whither she will no spanish abbot i think why but now that proud priests servants would have forbidden me to enter your chamber in my own house but i read them a lesson they will not forget also i have horses at my command but it is true i need an escort who am not too strong and little versed in the ways of the outside world where i have scarcely strayed for many years now i have bethought me of that redhaired laybrother thomas bolle i am told that though foolish he is a valiant man whom few care to face moreover that he understands horses and knows all roads do you think emlyn stower that thomas bolle will be my companion on this journey with leave from the abbot or without it and again she looked her in the eyes  he might he might he is a venturous man or so i remember him in my youth answered emlyn moreover his forefathers have served the harfletes and the foterells for generations in peace and war and doubtless therefore he loves my lady yonder but the trouble is to get at him  no trouble at all emlyn he is one of the watch outside the gate but woman what token  emlyn thought for a moment then drew a ring off her finger in which was set a cornelian heart  give him this she said and say that the wearer bade him follow the bearer to the death for the sake of that wearers life and anothers he is a simple soul and if the abbot does not catch him first i believe that he will go  mother matilda took the ring and set it on her own finger then she walked to where cicely lay sleeping looked at her and the boy upon her breast stretching out her thin hands she called down the blessing and protection of almighty god upon them both then turned to depart  emlyn caught her by the robe  stay she said you think i do not understand but i do you are giving up everything for us even if you live through it this house which has been your charge for many years will be dissolved your sheep will be scattered to starve in their toothless age the fold that has sheltered them for four hundred years will become a home of wolves i understand full well and shepointing to the sleeping cicelywill understand also  say nothing to her murmured mother matilda i may fail  you may fail or you may succeed if you fail and we burn god shall reward you if you succeed and we are saved on her behalf i swear that you shall not suffer there is wealth hidden awaywealth worth many priories you and yours shall have your share of it and that commissioner shall not go lacking tell him that there is some small store to pay him for his trouble and that the abbot of blossholme would rob him of it now my lady margaretfor that i think used to be your name and will be again when you have done with priests and nunsbless me also and begone and know that living or dead i hold you great and holy  so the prioress blessed her ere she glided thence in her stately fashion and the oaken door opened and shut behind her    three days later the abbot visited them alone  foul and accursed witches he said i come to tell you that next monday at noon you burn upon the green in front of the abbey gate who were it not for the mercy of the church should have been tortured also till you discovered your accomplices of whom i think that you have many  show me the kings warrant for this slaughter said cicely  i will show you nothing save the stake witch repent repent ere it be too late hell and its eternal fires yawn for you  do they yawn for my child also my lord abbot  your brat will be taken from you ere you enter the flames and laid upon the ground since it is baptized and too young to burn if any have pity on it good if not where it lies there it will be buried  so be it answered cicely god gave it god save it in god i put my trust murderer leave me to make my peace with him and she turned and walked away  now the abbot and emlyn were face to face  do we really burn on monday she asked  without doubt unless faggots will not take fire yet he added slowly if certain jewels should chance to be found and handed over the case might be remitted to another court  and the torment prolonged my lord abbot i fear that those jewels will never be found  well then you burnslowly perhaps for much rain has fallen of late and the wood is green they say the death is dreadful  doubtless one day you will find it so clement maldonado here or hereafter but of that we will talk together when all is doneof that and many other things i mean before the judgmentseat of god nay nay i do not threaten after your fashionit shall be so meanwhile i ask the boon of a dying woman there are two whom i would seethe prioress matilda in whose charge i desire to leave a certain secret and thomas bolle a laybrother in your abbey a man who once engaged himself to me in marriage for your own sake deny me not these favours  they should be granted readily enough were it in my power but it is not answered the abbot looking at her curiously for he thought that to them she might tell what she had refused to himthe hidingplace of the jewels which afterwards he could wring out  why not my lord abbot  because the prioress has gone hence secretly upon some journey of her own and thomas bolle has vanished away i knew not where if they or either of them return ere monday you shall see them  and if they do not return i shall see them afterwards replied emlyn with a shrug of her shoulders what does it matter fare you well till we meet at the fire my lord abbot    on the sundaythat is the day before the burningthe abbot came again  three days ago he said addressing them both i offered you a chance of life upon certain conditions but obstinate witches that you are you refused to listen now i offer you the last boon in my powernot life indeed it is too late for thatbut a merciful death if you will give me what i seek the executioner shall dispatch you both before the fire bitesnever mind how if notwell as i have told you there has been much rain and they say the faggots are somewhat green  cicely paled a littlewho would not even in those cruel daysthen asked  and what is it that you seek or that we can give a confession of our guilt to cover up your crime in the eyes of the world if so you shall never have it though we burn by inches  yes i seek that but for your own sakes not for mine since those who confess and repent may receive absolution also i seek morethe rich jewels which you have in hiding that they may be used for the purposes of the church  then it was that cicely showed the courage of her blood  never never she cried turning on him with eyes ablaze torture and slay me if you will but my wealth you shall not thieve i know not where these jewels are but wherever they may be there let them lie till my heirs find them or they rot  the abbots face grew very evil  is that your last word cicely foterell he asked  she bowed her head and he repeated the question to emlyn who answered  what my mistress says i say  so be it he exclaimed doubtless you sorceresses put your trust in the devil well we shall see if he will help you tomorrow  god will help us replied cicely in a quiet voice remember my words when the time comes  then he went    chapter xii  the stake  it was an awful night let those who have followed this history think of the state of these two women one of them still but a girl who on the morrow amidst the jeers and curses of superstitious men were to suffer the cruelest of deaths for no crime at all unless the traffickings of emlyn with thomas bolle in which cicely had small share could be held a crime well thousands quite as blameless were called on to undergo that and even worse fates in the days which some name good and old the days of chivalry and gallant knights when even little children were tormented and burned by holy and learned folk who feared a visible or at least a tangible devil and his works  doubtless their cruelty was that of terror doubtless although he had other ends to gain which to him were sacred the abbot maldon did believe that cicely and emlyn had practised horrible witchcraft that they had conversed with satan in order to revenge themselves upon him and therefore were too foul to live the old bishop believed it also and so did the blackbrowed prior and the most of the ignorant people who lived around and knew of the terrible things which had happened in blossholme had not some of them actually seen the fiend with horns and hoofs and tail driving the abbey cattle and had not others met the ghost of sir john foterell which doubtless was but that fiend in another shape oh these women were guilty without doubt they were guilty and deserved the stake what did it matter if the husband and father of one of them had been murdered and the other had suffered grievous but forgotten wrongs compared to witchcraft murder was but a light and homely crime one that would happen when mens passions and needs were involved quite a familiar thing  it was an awful night sometimes cicely slept a little but the most of it she spent in prayer the fierce emlyn neither slept nor prayed except once or twice that vengeance might fall upon the abbots head for her whole soul was up in arms and it galled her to think that she and her beloved mistress must die shamefully while their enemy lived on triumphant and in honour even the infant seemed nervous and disturbed as though some instinct warned it of terror at hand for although it was well enough against its custom it woke continually and wailed  emlyn said cicely towards morning but before the light had come after at length she had soothed it to rest do you think that mother matilda will be able to help us  no no put it from your mind dearie she is weak and old the road is rough and long and mayhap she has never reached the place it was a great venture for her to try such a journey and if she came there why perhaps the commissioner man had gone or perhaps he will not listen or perhaps he cannot come what would he care about the burning of two witches a hundred miles away this leech who is sucking himself full upon the carcass of some fat monastery no no never count on her  at least she is brave and true emlyn and has done her best for which may heavens blessing rest upon her always now what of thomas bolle  nothing except that he is a redheaded jackass that can bray but darent kick answered emlyn viciously never speak to me of thomas bolle had he been a man long ago hed have broken the neck of that rogue abbot instead of dressing himself up like a hegoat and hunting his cows  if what they say is true he did break the neck of father ambrose replied cicely with a faint smile perhaps he made a mistake in the dark  if so it is like thomas bolle who ever wished the right thing and did the wrong talk no more of him since i would not meet my end in a bad spirit thomas bolle who lets us die for his elfish pranks a pest on the halfwitted cur say i and after i had kissed him too  cicely wondered vaguely to what she referred then thinking it well not to inquire said  not so a blessing on him say i who saved my child from that hateful hag  then there was silence for a while the matter of poor thomas bolle and his conduct being exhausted between them who indeed were in no mood for argument about people whom they would never see again at last cicely spoke once more through the darkness  emlyn i will try to be brave but once do you remember i burnt my hand as a child when i stole the sweetmeats from the cooling pot and ah it hurt me i will try to die as those who went before me would have died but if i should break down think not the less of me for the spirit is willing though the flesh be weak  emlyn ground her teeth in silence and cicely went on  but that is not the worst of it emlyn a few minutes and it will be over and i shall sleep as i think to awake elsewhere only if christopher should really live how he will mourn when he learns  i pray that he does broke in emlyn for then ere long there will be a spanish priest the less on earth and one the more in hell  and the child emlyn the child she went on in a trembling voice not heeding the interruption what will become of my son the heir to so much if he had his rights and yet so friendless theyll murder him also emlyn or let him die which is the same thing since how otherwise will they get title to his lands and goods  if so his troubles will be done and he will be better with you in heaven emlyn answered with a dry sob the boy and you in heaven midst the blessed saints and the abbot and i in hell settling our score there with the devil for company thats all i ask there there i blaspheme for injustice makes me mad it clogs my heart and i throw it up in bitter words for your sake dear and his not my own child you are good and gentle to such as you the ear of god is open call to him ask for light he will not refuse do you remember in the fire at the towers when we crouched in that vault and the walls crumbled overhead you said you saw his angel bending over us and heard his speech call to him cicely and if he will not listen hear me i have a means of death about me ask not what it is but if at the end i turn on you and strike blame me not here or hereafter for it will be loves blow my last service  it seemed as though cicely did not understand those heavy words at the least she took no heed of them  ill pray again she whispered though i fear that heavens doors are closed to me no light comes through and she knelt down  for long long she prayed till at length weariness overcame her and emlyn heard her breathing softly like one asleep  let her sleep she murmured to herself oh if i were sureshe should never wake again to see the dawn i have half a mind to do it but there it is i am not sure if there is a god he will never suffer such a thing id have paid the jewels but whats the use they would have killed her all the same for else wheres their title no my heart bids me wait    cicely awoke  emlyn she said in a low thrilling voice do you hear me emlyn that angel has been with me again he spoke to me and she paused  well well what did he say  i dont know emlyn she answered confused it has gone from me but emlyn have no fear all is well with us and not only with us but with christopher and the babe also oh yes with christopher and the babe also and she let her fair head fall upon the couch and burst into a flood of happy tears then rising she took up the child and kissed it laid herself down and slept sweetly  just then the dawn broke a glorious dawn and emlyn held out her arms to it in an ecstasy of gratitude for with that light her terror passed away as the darkness passed she believed that god had spoken to cicely and for a while her heart was at peace    when about eight oclock that morning the door was opened to allow a nun to bring them their food she saw a sight which filled her with amazement her own eyes poor woman were red with tears for like all in the priory she loved cicely whom as a child she had nursed on her knee and with the other sisters had spent a sleepless night in prayer for her for emlyn and for bridget who was to be burned with them she had expected to find the victims prostrate and perhaps senseless with fear but behold there they sat together in the windowplace dressed in their best garments and talking quietly indeed as she entered one of themit was cicelylaughed a little at something that the other had said  goodmorning to you sister mary said cicely tell me now has the prioress returned  nay nay we know not where she is no word has come from her well at least she will be spared a dreadful sight have you any message for her ear if so give it swiftly ere the guard call me  i thank you said cicely but i think that i shall be the bearer of my own messages  what do you then mean that our mother is dead must we suffer woe upon woe oh who could have told you these sorrowful tidings  no sister i think that she is alive and that i yet living shall talk with her again  sister mary looked bewildered for how she wondered could close prisoners know these things staring round to see that she was not observed she thrust two little packets into cicelys hand  wear these at the last both of you she whispered whatever they say we believe you innocent and for your sake we have done a great crime yes we have opened the reliquary and taken from it our most precious treasure a fragment of the cord that bound st catherine to the wheel and divided it into three one strand for each of you perhaps if you are really guiltless it will work a miracle perhaps the fire will not burn or the rain will extinguish it or the abbot may relent  that last would be the greatest miracle of all broke in emlyn with grim humour still we thank you from our hearts and will wear the relics if they do not take them from us hark they are calling you farewell and all blessings be on your gentle heads  again the loud voices of the guards called and sister mary turned and fled wondering if these women were not witches how it came about that they could be so brave so different from poor bridget who wailed and moaned in her cell below  cicely and emlyn ate their food with good appetite knowing that they would need support that day and when it was done sat themselves again by the windowplace through which they could see hundreds of people mounted and on foot passing up the slope that led to the green in front of the abbey though this green they could not see because of a belt of trees  listen said emlyn presently it is hard to say but it may be that your vision of the night was but a merciful dream and if so within a few hours we shall be dead now i have the secret of the hidingplace of those jewels which without me none can ever find shall i pass it on if i get the chance to one whom i can trust some good soulthe nuns perhapswill surely shelter your boy and he might need them in days to come  cicely thought a while then answered  not so emlyn i believe that god has spoken to me by his angel as he spoke to peter in the prison to do this would be to tempt god showing that we have no trust in him let that secret lie where it is in your breast  great is your faith said emlyn looking at her with admiration well i will stand or fall by it for i think there is enough for two  the convent bell chimed ten and they heard a sound of feet and voices below  they come for us said emlyn the burning is set for eleven that after the sight folk may get away in comfort to their dinners now summon that great faith of yours and hold him fast for both our sakes since mine grows faint  the door opened and through it came monks followed by guards the officer of whom bade them rise and follow they obeyed without speaking cicely throwing her cloak about her shoulders  youll be warm enough without that witch said the man with a hideous chuckle  sir she answered i shall need it to wrap my child in when we are parted give me the babe emlyn there now we are ready nay no need to lead us we cannot escape and shall not vex you  gods truth the girl has spirit muttered the officer to his companions but one of the priests shook his head and answered  witchcraft satan will leave them presently  a few more minutes and for the first time during all those weary months they passed the gate of the priory here the third victim was waiting to join them poor old halfwitted bridget clad in a kind of sheet for her habit had been stripped off she was wildeyed and her grey locks hung loose about her shoulders as she shook her ancient head and screamed prayers for mercy cicely shivered at the sight of her which indeed was dreadful  peace good bridget she said as they passed being innocent what have you to fear  the fire the fire cried the poor creature i dread the fire  then they were led to their place in the procession and saw no more of bridget for a while although they could not escape the sound of her lamentations behind them  it was a great procession first went the monks and choristers singing a melancholy latin dirge then came the victims in the midst of a guard of twelve armed men and after these the nuns who were forced to be present while behind and about were all the folk for twenty miles round a crowd without number they crossed the footbridge where stood the ford inn for which the flounder had bargained as the price of murder they walked up the rise by the right of way muddy now with the autumn rains and through the belt of trees where thomas bolles secret passage had its exit and so came at last to the green in front of the towering abbey portal  here a dreadful sight awaited them for on this green were planted three fourteeninch posts of newfelled oak six feet or more in height such as no fire would easily burn through and around each of them a kind of bower of faggots open to the front moreover to the posts hung new wagon chains and near by stood the village blacksmith and his apprentice who carried a hand anvil and a sledge hammer for the cold welding of those chains  at a distance from these stakes the procession was halted then out from the gate of the abbey came the abbot in his robes and mitre preceded by acolytes and followed by more monks he advanced to where the condemned women stood and halted while a friar stepped forward and read their sentence to them of which being in latin or in crabbed legal words they understood nothing at all then in sonorous tones he adjured them for the sake of their sinful souls to make full confession of their guilt that they might receive pardon before they suffered in the flesh for their hideous crime of sorcery  to this invitation cicely and emlyn shook their heads saying that being innocent of any sorceries they had nothing to confess but old bridget gave another answer she declared in a high screaming voice that she was a witch as her mother and grandmother had been before her she described while the crowd listened with intense interest how emlyn stower had introduced her to the devil who was clad in red hose and looked like a black boy with a hump on his back and a tuft of red hair hanging from his nose also many unedifying details of her interviews with this same fiend  asked what he said to her she answered that he told her to bewitch the abbot of blossholme because he was such a holy man that god had need of him and he did too much good upon the earth also he prevented emlyn stower and cicely foterell from working his the devils will and enabled them to keep alive the baby who would be a great wizard he told her moreover that midwife megges was an angel here the crowd laughed sent to kill the said infant who really was his own child as might be seen by its black eyebrows and cleft tongue also its webbed feet and that he would appear in the shape of the ghost of sir john foterell to save it and give it to her which he did saying the lords prayer backwards and that she must bring it up in the faith of the pentagon  thus the poor crazed thing raved on while sentence by sentence a scribe wrote down her gibberish causing her at last to make her mark to it all of which took a very long time at the end she begged that she might be pardoned and not burnt but this she was informed was impossible thereon she became enraged and asked why then had she been led to tell so many lies if after all she must burn a question at which the crowd roared with laughter on hearing this the priest who was about to absolve her changed his mind and ordered her to be fastened to her stake which was done by the blacksmith with the help of his apprentice and his portable anvil  still her confession was solemnly read over to cicely and emlyn who were asked whether after hearing it they still persisted in a denial of their guilt by way of answer cicely lifted the hood from her boys face and showed that his eyebrows were not black but lightcoloured also she bared his feet passing her little finger between his toes and asking them if they were webbed some of them answered no but a monk roared what of that cannot satan web and unweb then he snatched the infant from cicelys arms and laid it down upon the stump of an oak that had been placed there to receive it crying out  let this child live or die as god pleases  some brute who stood by aimed a blow at it with a stick yelling death to the witchs brat but a big man whom emlyn recognized as one of old sir johns tenants caught the falling stick from his hand and dealt him such a clout with it that he fell like a stone and went for the rest of his life with but one eye and the nose flattened on the side of his face thenceforward no one tried to harm the babe who as all know because of what befell him on this day went in after life by the nickname of christopher oakstump  the abbots men stepped forward to tie cicely to her stake but ere they laid hands on her she took off her woollined cloak and threw it to the yeoman who had struck down the fellow with his own stick saying  friend wrap my boy in this and guard him till i ask him from you again  aye lady answered the great man bending his knee i have served the grandsire and the sire and so ill serve the son and throwing aside the stick he drew a sword and set himself in front of the oak boll where the infant lay nor did any venture to meddle with him for they saw other men of a like sort ranging themselves about him  now slowly enough the smith began to rivet the chain round cicely  man she said to him i have seen you shoe many of my fathers nags who could have thought that you would live to use your honest skill upon his daughter  on hearing these words the fellow burst into tears cast down his tools and fled away cursing the abbot his apprentice would have followed but him they caught and forced to complete the task then emlyn was chained up also so that at length all was ready for the last terrible act of the drama  now the head executionerhe was the abbey cookplaced some pine splinters to light in a brazier that stood near by and while waiting for the word of command remarked audibly to his mate that there was a good wind and that the witches would burn briskly  the spectators were ordered back out of earshot and went at last some of them muttering sullenly to each other for here the company could not be picked as it had been at the trial and the abbot noted anxiously that among them the victims had many friends it was time the deed was done ere their smouldering love and pity flowed out into bloody tumult he thought to himself so advancing quickly he stood in front of emlyn and asked her in a low voice if she still refused to give up the secret of the jewels seeing that there was yet time for him to command that they should die mercifully and not by the fire  let the mistress judge not the maid answered emlyn in a steady voice  he turned and repeated the question to cicely who replied  have i not told younever get you behind me o evil man and go repent your sins ere it be too late  the abbot stared at her feeling that such constancy and courage were almost superhuman he had an acute imaginative mind which could fancy himself in like case and what his state would be though he was in such haste a great curiosity entered into him to know whence she drew her strength which even then he tried to satisfy  are you mad or drugged cicely foterell he asked do you not know how fire will feel when it eats up that delicate flesh of yours  i do not know and i shall never know she answered quietly  do you mean that you will die before it touches you building on some promise of your master satan  yes i shall die before the fire touches me but not here and now and i build upon a promise from the master of us all in heaven  he laughed a shrill nervous laugh and called out loud to the people around  this witch says that she will not burn for heaven has promised it to her do you not witch  yes i say so bear witness to my words good people all replied cicely in clear and ringing tones  well well see shouted the abbot man bring flame and let heavenor hellhelp her if it can  the cookexecutioner blew at his brands but he was nervous or clumsy and a minute or more went by before they flamed at length one was fit for the task and unwillingly enough he stooped to lift it up  then it was that in the midst of the intense silence for of all that multitude none seemed even to breathe and old bridget who had fainted cried no more a bulls voice was heard beyond the brow of the hill roaring  in the kings name stay in the kings name stay  all turned to look and there between the trees appeared a white horse its sides streaked with blood that staggered rather than galloped towards them and on the horse a huge redbearded man clad in mail and holding in his hand a woodmans axe  fire the faggots shouted the abbot but the cook who was not by nature brave had already let fall his torch which went out on the damp ground  by now the horse was rushing through them treading them under foot with great convulsive bounds it reached the ring and as the rider leapt from its back rolled over and lay there panting for its strength was done  it is thomas bolle exclaimed a voice while the abbot cried again  fire the faggots fire the faggots and a soldier ran to fetch another brand  but thomas was before him snatching up the brazier by its legs he smote downwards with it so that the burning charcoal fell all about the soldier and the iron cage remained fixed upon his head shouting as he smote  you sought firetake it  the man rolled upon the ground screaming in pain and terror till some one dragged the cage off his head leaving his face barred like a grilled herring none took further heed of what became of him for now thomas bolle stood in front of the stakes waving his great axe and repeating in the kings name stay in the kings name stay  what mean you knave exclaimed the furious abbot  what i say priest one step nearer and ill split your crown  the abbot fell back and thomas went on  a foterell a foterell a harflete a harflete o ye who have eaten their bread come scatter these faggots and save their flesh wholl stand with me against maldon and his butchers  i answered voices and i and i and i  and i too hallooed the yeoman by the oak stump only i watch the child nay by god ill bring it with me and snatching up the screaming babe under his left arm he ran to him  on came the others also hurling the faggots this way and that  break the chains roared bolle again and somehow those strong hands did it indeed the only hurt that cicely took that day was from their hacking at these chains they were loose cicely snatched the child from the yeoman who was glad enough to be rid of it having other work to do for now the abbots menatarms were coming on  ring the women round roared bolle and strike home for foterell strike home for harflete ah priests dog in the kings namethis and the axe sank up to the haft into the breast of the captain who had told cicely that she would be warm enough that day without her cloak  then there began a great fight the party of foterell of whom there may have been a score captained by bolle made a circle round the three green oak stakes within which stood cicely and emlyn and old bridget still tied to her post for no one had thought or found time to cut her loose these were attacked by the abbots guard thirty or more of them urged on by maldon himself who was maddened by the rescue of his victims and full of fear lest cicelys words should be fulfilled and she herself set down henceforth not as a witch but as a prophetess favoured by god  on came the soldiers and were beaten back thrice they came on and thrice they were beaten back with loss for bolles axe was terrible to face and now that they had found a leader and their courage the yeoman lads who stood with him were sturdy fighters also tumult broke out among the hundreds who watched some of them taking one side and some the other so that they fell upon each other with sticks and stones and fists even the women joining in the fray biting and tearing like bagged cats the scene was hideous and the sounds those of a sacked city for many were hurt and all gave tongue while shrill and clear above this hateful music rose the yells of bridget who had awakened from her faint and imagined all was over and that she fathomed hell  thrice the attackers were rolled back but of those who defended a third were down and now the abbot took another counsel  bring bows he cried and shoot them for they have none and men ran off to do his bidding  then it was that emlyns wit came to their aid for when bolle shook his red head and gasped out that he feared they were lost since how could they fight against arrows she answered  if so why stand here to be spitted fool come let us cut our way through ere the shafts begin to fly and take refuge among the trees or in the nunnery  womens counsel is good sometimes said bolle form up foterells and march  nay broke in cicely loose bridget first lest they should burn her after all ill not stir else  so bridget was hacked free and together with the wounded men of whom there were several dragged and supported thence then began a running fight but one in which they still held their own yet they would have been overwhelmed at last for the women and the wounded hampered them had not help come for as they hewed their path towards the belt of trees with the abbots fierce fellows some of whom were french or spanish hanging on their flanks suddenly in the gap where the roadway ran appeared a horse galloping and on it a woman who clung to its mane with both hands and after her many armed men  look emlyn look exclaimed cicely who is that for she could not believe her eyes  who but mother matilda answered emlyn and by the saints she is a strange sight  a strange sight she was indeed for her hood was gone her hair that was ever so neat flew loose her robe was ruckled up about her knees the rosary and crucifix she wore streamed on the air behind her and beat against her back and her garb had burst open at the front in short never was holy aged prioress seen in such a state before down she came on them like a whirlwind for her frightened horse scented its blossholme stable clinging grimly to her unaccustomed seat and crying as she sped  for gods love stop this mad beast  bolle caught it by the bridle and threw it to its haunches so that its rider speeding on flew over its head on to the broad breast of the yeoman who had watched the child and there rested thankfully for as mother matilda said afterwards with her gentle smile never before did she know what comfort there was to be found in man  when at length she loosed her arms from about his neck the yeoman stood her on her feet saying that this was worse than the baby and her wandering eyes fell upon cicely  so i am in time oh never more will i revile that horse she exclaimed and sinking to her knees then and there she gasped out some prayer of thankfulness meanwhile those who followed her had reined up in front and the abbots soldiers with the accompanying crowd had halted behind not knowing what to make of these strangers so that bolle and his party with the women were now between the two  from among the newcomers rode out a fat coarse man with a pompous air as of one who is accustomed to be obeyed who inquired in a laboured voice for he was breathless from hard riding what all this turmoil meant  ask the abbot of blossholme said some one for it is his work  abbot of blossholme thats the man i want puffed the fat stranger appear abbot of blossholme and give account of these doings and you fellows he added to his escort range up and be ready lest this said priest should prove contumacious  now the abbot stepped forward with some of his monks and looking the horseman up and down said  who may it be that demands account so roughly of a consecrated abbot  a consecrated abbot a consecrated peacock a tumultuous turbulent traitorous priest a spanish rogue ruffler who i am told keeps about him a band of bloody mercenaries to break the kings peace and slay loyal english folk well consecrated abbot ill tell you who i am i am thomas legh his graces visitor and royal commissioner to inspect the houses called religious and i am come hither upon complaint made by yonder prioress of blossholme nunnery as to your dealings with certain of his highnesss subjects whom she says you have accused of witchcraft for purposes of revenge and unlawful gain that is who i am my fine fowl of an abbot  now when he heard this pompous speech the rage in maldons face was replaced by fear for he knew of this doctor legh and his mission and understood what thomas bolle had meant by his cry of in the kings name    chapter xiii  the messenger  who makes all this tumult shouted the commissioner why do i see blood and wounds and dead men and how were you about to handle these women one of whom by her mien is of no low degree and he stared at cicely  the tumult answered the abbot was caused by yonder fool thomas bolle a laybrother of my monastery who rushed among us armed and shouting in the kings name stay  then why did you not stay sir abbot is the kings name one to be mocked at know that i sent on the man  he had no warrant sir commissioner unless his bulls voice and great axe are a warrant and i did not stay because we were doing justice upon the three foulest witches in the realm  doing justice whose justice and what justice say had you a warrant for your justice if so show it me  these witches have been condemned by a court ecclesiastic the judges being a bishop a prior and myself and in pursuance of that judgment were about to suffer for their sins by fire replied maldon  a court ecclesiastic roared dr legh can courts ecclesiastic then toast free english folk to death if you would not stand your trial for attempted murder show me your warrant signed by his grace the king or by his justices of assize what you do not answer have you none i thought as much oho clement maldon you hangfaced spanish dog learn that eyes have been on you for long and now it seems that you would usurp the kings prerogative besides and he checked himself then went on seize that priest and keep him fast while i make inquiry of this business  now some of the commissioners guard surrounded maldon nor did his own men venture to interfere with them for they had enough of fighting and were frightened by this talk about the kings warrant  then the commissioner turned to cicely and said  you are sir john foterells only child are you not who allege yourself to be wife to sir christopher harflete or so says yonder prioress now what was about to happen to you and why  sir answered cicely i and my waitingwoman and the old sister bridget were condemned to die by fire at those stakes upon a charge of sorcery although it is true she added that i knew we should not perish thus  how did you know that lady by all tokens your bodies and hot flame were near enough together and he glanced towards the stakes and the scattered faggots  sir i knew it because of a vision that god sent to me in my sleep last night  aye she swore that at the stake exclaimed a voice and we thought her mad  now can you deny that she is a witch broke in maldon if she were not one of satans own how could she see visions and prophecy her own deliverance  if visions and prophecies are proof of witchcraft then priest all holy writ is but a seething pot of sorcery answered legh then the blessed virgin and st elizabeth were witches and paul and john should have been burnt as wizards continue lady leaving out your dreams until a more convenient time  sir went on cicely we have worked no sorcery and my crime is that i will not name my child a bastard and sign away my lands and goods to yonder abbot the murderer of my father and perhaps of my husband oh listen listen you and all folk here and briefly as i may i will tell my tale have i your leave to speak  the commissioner nodded and she set out her story from the beginning so sweetly so simply and with such truth and earnestness that the concourse of people packed close about her hung upon her every word and even dr leghs coarse face softened as he heard for the half of an hour or more she spoke telling of her fathers death of her flight and marriage of the burning of cranwell towers and her widowing if such it were of her imprisonment in the priory and the abbots dealings with her and emlyn of the birth of her child and its attempted murder by the midwife his creature of their trial and condemnation they being innocent and of all they had endured that day  if you are innocent shouted a priest as she paused for breath what was that thing dressed in the livery of satan which worked evil at blossholme did we not see it with our eyes  just then some one uttered an exclamation and pointed to the shadow of the trees where a strange form was moving another moment and it came out into the light one more and all that multitude scattered like frightened sheep rushing this way and that yes even the horses took the bits between their teeth and bolted for there visible to all satan himself strolled towards them on his head were horns behind his back hung down a tail his body was shaggy like a beasts and his face hideous and of many colours while in his hand he held a pronged fork with a long handle this way and that rushed the throng only the commissioner who had dismounted stood still perhaps because he was too afraid to stir and with him the women and some of the nuns including the prioress who fell upon their knees and began to utter prayers  on came the dreadful thing till it reached the kings visitor bowing to him and bellowing like a bull then very deliberately untied some strings and let its horrid garb fall off revealing the person of thomas bolle  what means this mummery knave gasped dr legh  mummery do you call it sir answered thomas with a grin well if so tis on the faith of such mummery that priests burn women in merry england come good people come he roared in his great voice come see satan in the flesh here are his horns and he held them up once they grew upon the head of widow johnsons billygoat heres his tail many a fly has it flicked off the belly of an abbey cow heres his ugly mug begotten of parchment and the paintbox heres his dreadful fork that drives the damned to some hotter corner it has been death to whole stones of eels down in the marshfleet yonder i have some hellfire too among the bag of tricks youll make the best of brimstone and a little oil dried out upon the hearth come see the devil all complete and naught to pay  back trooped the crowd a little fearfully taking the properties which he held and handling them till first one and then all of them began to laugh  laugh not shouted bolle is it a matter of laughter that noble ladies and others whose lives are as dear to some and he glanced at emlyn should grill like herrings because a poor fool walks about clad in skins to keep out the cold and frighten villains hark you i played this trick i am beelzebub also the ghost of sir john foterell i entered the priory chapel by a passage that i know and saved yonder babe from murder and scared the murderess down to hell yes from the sham devil to the true why did i do it well to protect the innocent and scourge the wicked in his pride but the wicked seized the innocent and the innocent said nothing fearing lest i should suffer with them ando god you know the rest  it was a near thing a very near thing but im not the halfwit ive feigned to be for years moreover i had a good horse and a heavy axe and there are still true hearts round blossholme the dead men that lie yonder show it heaven has still its angels on the earth though they wear strange shapes there stands one of them and there another and he pointed first to the fat and pompous visitor and next to the dishevelled prioress adding and now sir commissioner for all that i have done in the cause of justice i ask pardon of you who wear the kings grace and majesty as i wore old nicks horns and hoofs since otherwise the abbot and his hired butchers who hold themselves masters of king and people will murder me for this as they have done by better men therefore pardon your mightiness pardon and he kneeled down before him  you have it bolle in the kings name you have it replied legh who was more flattered by the titles and attributes poured upon him by the cunning thomas than a closer consideration might have warranted for all that you have done or left undone i the commissioner of his grace declare that you shall go scot free and that no action criminal or civil shall lie against you and this my secretary shall give to you in writing now good fellow rise but steal satans plumes no more lest you should feel his claws and beak for he is an ill fowl to mock bring hither that spaniard maldon i have somewhat to say to him  now they looked this way and that but no abbot could they see the guards swore that they had never taken eye off him even when they all ran before the devil yet certainly he was gone  the knave has given us the slip bellowed the commissioner who was purple with rage search for him seize him for which my command shall be your warrant draw the wood ill to the abbey where perchance the fox has gone to earth five golden crowns to the man who nets the slimy traitor  now every one burning with zeal to show their loyalty and to win the crowns scattered on the search so that presently the three witches thomas bolle mother matilda and the nuns were left standing almost alone and staring at each other and the dead and wounded men who lay about  let us to the priory said mother matilda for by the sun i judge that it is time for evening prayer and there seem to be none to hinder us  thomas went to her horse which grazed close at hand and led it up  nay good friend she exclaimed with energy while i live no more of that evil beast for me henceforth ill walk till i am carried keep it thomas as a gift it is bought and paid for sister your arm  have i done well emlyn bolle asked as he tightened the girths  i dont know she answered looking at him sideways you played the cur at first leaving us to burn for your sins but afterwards well you found the wits you say you never lost also your manners mended and yonder captain knave learned that you can handle an axe so well say no more about it lad for doubtless that abbot and his spies were sore taskmasters and broke your spirit with their penances and talk of hell to come here lift my lady on to this horse for she is spent and let me lean upon your shoulder thomas its weary work standing at a stake    cicelys recollections of the remainder of that day were always shadowy and tangled she remembered a prayer of thanksgiving in which she took small part with her lips she whose heart was one great thanksgiving she remembered the good sister who had given them the relics of st catherine assuring her as she received them back with care that these and these alone had worked the miracle and saved their lives she remembered eating food and straining her boy to her breast and then she remembered no more till she woke to see the morning sun streaming into that same room whence on the previous day they had been led out to suffer the most horrible of deaths  yes she woke and see near by was emlyn making ready her garments as she had done these many years and at her side lay the boy crowing in the sunlight and waving his little arms the blessed boy who knew not the terrors he had passed at first she thought that she had dreamed a very evil dream till by degrees all the truth came back to her and she shivered at its memory yes even as the weight of it rolled off her heart she shivered and whitened like an aspen in the wind then she rose and thanked god for his mercies which were great  oh if the strength of that horse of thomas bolles had failed one short five minutes sooner she in whom the red blood still ran so healthily would have been but a handful of charred bones or if her faith had left her so that she had yielded to the abbot and shortened all his talk at the place of burning then bolle would have come too late but it proved sufficient to her need and for this also truly she should be thankful to its giver  after they had eaten a message came to them from the prioress who desired to see them in her chamber thither they went rejoiced to find that they were no longer prisoners but had liberty to come and go and found her seated in a tall chair for she was too stiff to walk cicely ran to her knelt down and kissed her and she laid her left hand upon her head in blessing for the right was cut with the chafing of the reins  surely cicely she said smiling it is i who should kneel to you were i in any state to do so for now i have heard all the tale and it seems that we have a prophetess among us one favoured with visions from on high which visions have been most marvellously fulfilled  that is so mother she answered briefly for this was a matter of which she would never talk at length either then or thereafter but the fulfilment came through you  my daughter i was but the minister you were the chosen seer still let the holy business lie a while perhaps you will tell me of it afterwards and meantime the world and its affairs press us hard your deliverance has been bought at no small cost my daughter for know that yonder coarse and ungodly man the kings visitor told me as we rode that this nunnery must be dissolved its house and revenues seized and i and my sisters turned out to starve in our old age indeed to bring him here at all i was forced to petition that it might be so in a writing that i signed see then how great is my love for you dear cicely  mother she answered it cannot be it shall not be  alas child how will you prevent it these visitors and those who commission them are hungry folk i hear they take the lands and goods of poor religious such as we are and if these are fortunate give one or two of them a little pittance to get bread once i had moneys of my own but i spent them to buy back the valley farm which the abbot had seized and of late to satisfy his extortions and she wept a little  mother listen i have wealth hidden away i know not where exactly but emlyn knows it is my very own the carfax jewels that came to me from my mother it was because of these that we were brought to the stake since the abbot offered us life in return for them and when it was too late to save us a more merciful death than that by fire but i forbade emlyn to yield the secret something in my heart told me to do so now i know why mother the price of those gems shall buy back your lands and mayhap buy also permission from his grace the king for the continuance of your house where you and yours shall worship as those who went before you have done for many generations i swear it in my own name and in that of my child and of my husband alsoif he lives  your husband if he lives might need this wealth sweet cicely  then mother except to save his life or liberty or honour i tell you i will refuse it to him who when he learns what you have done for me and our son would give it you and all else he has besidesnay would pay it as an honourable debt  well cicely in gods name and my own i thank you and well see well see only be advised lest dr legh should learn of this treasure but where is it emlyn fear not to tell me who can be secret for it is well that more than one should know and i think that your danger is past  yes speak emlyn said cicely for though i never asked before fearing my own weakness i am curious none can hear us here  then mistress i will tell you you remember that on the day of the burning of cranwell we sought refuge on the central tower whence i carried you senseless to the vault now in that vault we lay all night and while you swooned i searched with my fingers till i found a stone that time and damp had loosened behind which was a hollow in that hollow i hid the jewels that i carried wrapt in silk in the bosom of my robe then i filled up the hole with dust scraped from the floor and replaced the stone wedging it tight with bits of mortar it is the third stone counting from the eastern angle in the second course above the floor line there i set them and there doubtless they lie to this day for unless the tower is pulled down to its foundations none will ever find them in that masonry  at this moment there came a knocking on the door when it was opened by emlyn a nun entered saying that the kings visitor demanded to speak with the prioress  show him here since i cannot come to him said mother matilda and you cicely and emlyn bide with me for in such company it is well to have witnesses  a minute later dr legh appeared accompanied by his secretaries gorgeously attired and puffing from the stairs  to business to business he said scarcely stopping to acknowledge the greetings of the prioress your convent is sequestrated upon your own petition madam therefore i need not stop to make the usual inquiries and indeed i will admit that from all i hear it has a good repute for none allege scandal against you perhaps because you are all too old for such follies produce now your deeds your terrier of lands and your rentrolls that i may take them over in due form and dissolve the sisterhood  i will send for them sir answered the prioress humbly but meanwhile tell us what we poor religious are to do i am turned sixty years of age and have dwelt in this house for forty of them none of my sisters are young and some of them are older than myself whither shall we go  into the world madam which you will find a fine large place cease snuffling prayers and from all vulgar superstitionsby the way forget not to hand over any reliquaries of value or any papistical emblems in precious metals that you may possess including images of which my secretaries will take accountand go out into the world marry there if you can find husbands follow useful trades there do what you will there and thank the king who frees you from the incumbrance of silly vows and from the circle of a convents walls  to give us liberty to starve outside of them sir do you understand your work for hundreds of years we have sat at blossholme and during all those generations have prayed to god for the souls of men and ministered to their bodies we have done no harm to any creature and what wealth came to us from the earth or from the benefactions of the pious we have dispensed with a liberal hand taking nothing for ourselves the poor by multitudes have fed at our gates their sick we have nursed their children we have taught often we have gone hungry that they might be full now you drive us forth in our age to perish if that is the will of god so be it but what must chance to englands poor  that is englands business madam and the poors meanwhile i have told you that i have no time to waste since i must away to london to make report concerning this abbot of yours a veritable rogue of whose villainous plots i have discovered many things i pray you send a messenger to bid them hurry with the deeds  just then a nun entered bearing a tray on which were cakes and wine emlyn took it from her and pouring the wine into cups offered them to the visitor and his secretaries  good wine he said after he had drunk a very generous wine you nuns know the best in liquor be careful i pray you to include it in your inventory why woman are you not one of those whom that abbot would have burnt yes and there is your mistress dame foterell or dame harflete with whom i desire a word  i am at your service sir said cicely  well madam you and your servant have escaped the stake to which as near as i can judge you were sentenced upon no evidence at all still you were condemned by a competent ecclesiastical court and under that condemnation you must therefore remain until or unless the king pardons you my judgment is then that you stay here awaiting his command  but sir said cicely if the good nuns who have befriended me are to be driven forth how can i dwell on in their house alone yet you say i must not leave it and indeed if i could whither should i go my husbands hall is burnt my own the abbot holds moreover if i bide here in this way or in that he will have my life  the knave has fled away said dr legh rubbing his fat chin  aye but he will come back again or his people will and sir you know these spaniards are good haters and i have defied him long oh sir i crave the protection of the king for my childs sake and my own and for emlyn stower also  the commissioner went on rubbing his chin  you can give much evidence against this maldon can you not he asked at length  aye broke in emlyn enough to hang him ten times over and so can i  and you have large estates which he has seized have you not  i have sir who am of no mean birth and station  lady he said with more deference in his voice step aside with me i would speak with you privately and he walked to the window where she followed him now tell me what was the value of these properties of yours  i know not rightly sir but i have heard my father say about £300 a year  his manner became more deferential still since for those days such wealth was great  indeed my lady a large sum a very comfortable fortune if you can get it back now i will be frank with you the kings commissioners are not well paid and their costs are great if i so arrange your matters that you come to your own again and that the judgment of witchcraft pronounced against you and your servant is annulled will you promise to pay me one years rent of these estates to meet the various expenses i must incur on your behalf  now it was cicelys turn to think  surely she answered at length if you will add a conditionthat these good sisters shall be left undisturbed in their nunnery  he shook his fat head  it is not possible now the thing is too public why the lord cromwell would say i had been bribed and i might lose my office  well then went on cicely if you will promise that one year of grace shall be given to them to make arrangements for their future  that i can do he answered nodding on the ground that they are of blameless life and have protected you from the kings enemy but this is an uncertain world i must ask you to sign an indenture and its form will be that you acknowledge to have received from me a loan of £300 to be repaid with interest when you recover your estates  draw it up and i will sign sir  good madam and now that we may get this business through you will accompany me to london where you will be safe from harm well not ride today but tomorrow morning at the light  then my servant emlyn must come also sir to help me with the babe and thomas bolle too for he can prove that the witchcraft upon which we were condemned was but his trickery  yes yes but the costs of travel for so many will be great have you perchance any money  yes sir about £50 in gold that is sewn up in one of emlyns robes  ah a sufficient sum too much indeed to be risked upon your persons in these rough times you will let me take charge of half of it for you  with pleasure sir trusting you as i do keep to your bargain and i will keep to mine  good when thomas legh is fairly dealt with thomas legh deals fairly no man can say otherwise this afternoon i will bring the deed and youll give me that £25 in charge  then followed by cicely he returned to where the prioress sat and said  mother matilda for so i understand you are called in religion the lady harflete has been pleading with me for you and because you have dealt so well by her i have promised in the kings name that you and your nuns shall live on here undisturbed for one year from this day after which you must yield up peaceable possession to his majesty whom i will beg that you shall be pensioned  i thank you sir the prioress answered when one is old a year of grace is much and in a year many things may happenfor instance my death  thank me nota plain man who but follows after justice and duty the documents for your signature shall be ready this afternoon and by the way the lady harflete and her servant also that stout shrewd fellow thomas bolle ride with me to london tomorrow she will explain all at three of the clock i wait upon you  the visitor and his secretaries bustled out of the room as pompously as they had entered and when they had gone cicely explained to mother matilda and emlyn what had passed  i think that you have done wisely said the prioress when she had listened that man is a shark but better give him your little finger than your whole body certainly you have bargained well for us for what may not happen in a year also dear cicely you will be safer in london than at blossholme since with the great sum of £300 to gain that commissioner will watch you like the apple of his eye and push your cause  unless some one promises him the greater sum of £1000 to scotch it interrupted emlyn well there was but one road to take and paper promises are little though i grudge the good £25 in gold meanwhile mother we have much to make ready i pray you send some one to find thomas bolle who will not be far away for since we are no longer prisoners i wish to go out walking with him on an errand of my own that perchance you can guess wealth may be useful in london town for all our sakes also horses and a packbeast must be got and other things    in due course thomas bolle was found fast asleep in a neighbours house for after his adventures and triumph he had drunk hard and rested long when she discovered the truth emlyn rated him well calling him a beertub and not a man and many other hard names till at last she provoked him to answer that had it not been for the said beertub she would be but ashdust this day thereon she turned the talk and told them their needs and that he must ride with them to london to this he replied that good horses should be saddled by the dawn for he knew where to lay hands on them since some were left in the abbots stables that wanted exercise further that he would be glad to leave blossholme for a while where he had made enemies on the yesterday whose friends yet lay wounded or unburied after this emlyn whispered something in his ear to which he nodded assent saying that he would bustle round and be ready  that afternoon emlyn went out riding with thomas bolle who was fully armed as she said to try two of the horses that should carry them on the morrow and it was late when she returned out of the dark night  have you got them asked cicely when they were together in their room  aye she answered every one but some stones have fallen and it was hard to win an entrance to that vault indeed had it not been for thomas bolle who has the strength of a bull i could never have done it moreover the abbot has been there before us and dug over every inch of the floor but the fool never thought of the wall so alls well ill sew half of them into my petticoat and half into yours to share the risk in case of thieves the money that hungry visitor has left to us for i paid him over half when you signed the deeds we will carry openly in pouches upon our girdles theyll not search further oh i forgot ive something more besides the jewels here it is and she produced a packet from her bosom and laid it on the table  whats this asked cicely looking suspiciously at the worn sailcloth in which it was wrapped  how can i tell cut it and see all i know is that when i stood at the nunnery door as thomas led away the horses a man crept on me out of the rain swathed in a great cloak and asked if i were not emlyn stower i said yea whereon he thrust this into my hand bidding me not fail to give it to the lady harflete and was gone  it has an overseas look about it murmured cicely as with eager trembling fingers she cut the stitches at length they were undone and a sealed inner wrapping also revealing amongst other documents a little packet of parchments covered with crabbed unreadable writing on the back of which however they could decipher the names of shefton and blossholme by reason of the larger letters in which they were engrossed also there was a writing in the scrawling hand of sir john foterell and at the foot of it his name and amongst others those of father necton and of jeffrey stokes cicely stared at the deeds then said  emlyn i know these parchments they are those that my father took with him when he rode for london to disprove the abbots claim and with them the evidence of the traitorous words he spoke last year at shefton yes this inner wrapping is my own i took it from the store of worn linen in the passagecupboard but how come they here  emlyn made no answer only lifted the wrappings and shook them whereon a strip of paper that they had not seen fell to the table  this may tell us she said read if you can it has words on its inner side  cicely snatched at it and as the writing was clear and clerkly read with ease save for the chokings of her throat it ran   my lady harflete  these are the papers that jeffrey stokes saved when your father fell they were given for safekeeping to the writer of these words far away across the sea and he hands them on unopened your husband lives and is well again also jeffrey stokes and though they have been hindered on their journey doubtless he will find his way back to england whither believing you to be dead as i did he has not hurried there are reasons why i his friend and yours cannot see you or write more since my duty calls me hence when it is finished i will seek you out if i still live if not wait in peace until your joy finds you as i think it will  one who loves your lord well and for his sake you also   cicely laid down the paper and burst into a flood of weeping  oh cruel cruel she sobbed to tell so much and yet so little nay what an ungrateful wretch am i since christopher truly lives and i also live to learn it i whom he deems dead  by my soul said emlyn when she had calmed her that cloaked man is a prince of messengers oh had i but known what he bore id have had all the story if i must cling to him like potiphars wife to joseph well well joseph got away and half a herring is better than no fish also this is good herring moreover you have got the deeds when you most wanted them and what is better a written testimony that will bring the traitor maldon to the scaffold    chapter xiv  jacob and the jewels  cicelys journey to london was strange enough to her who never before had travelled farther than fifty miles from her home and but once as a child spent a month in a town when visiting an aunt at lincoln she went in ease it is true for commissioner legh did not love hard travelling and for this reason they started late and halted early either at some good inn if in those days any such places could be called good or perhaps in a monastery where he claimed of the best that the frightened monks had to offer indeed as she observed his treatment of these poor folk was cruel for he blustered and threatened and inquired accusing them of crimes that they had not committed and finally although he had no mission to them at the time extracted great gifts saying that if these were not forthcoming he would make a note and return later also he got hold of talebearers and wrote down all their scandalous and lying stories told against those whose bread they ate  thus long before they saw charing cross cicely came to hate this proud avaricious and overbearing man who hid a savage nature under a cloak of virtue and whilst serving his own ends mouthed great words about god and the king still she who was schooled in adversity learned to hide her heart fearing to make an enemy of one who could ruin her and forced emlyn much against her will to do the same moreover there were worse things than that since being beautiful some of his companions talked to her in a way she could not misunderstand till at length thomas bolle coming on one of them thrashed him as he had never been thrashed before after which there was trouble that was only appeased by a gift  yet on the whole things went well no one molested the kings visitor or those with him the autumn weather held fine the baby boy kept his health and the country through which they passed was new to her and full of interest  at last one evening they rode from barnet into the great city which she thought a most marvellous place who had never seen such a multitude of houses or of men running to and fro about their business up and down the narrow streets that at night were lit with lamps now there had been a great discussion where they were to lodge dr legh saying that he knew of a house suitable to them but emlyn would not hear of this place where she was sure they would be robbed for the wealth that they carried secretly in jewels bore heavily on her mind remembering a cousin of her mothers of the name of smith a goldsmith who till within a year or two before was alive and dwelling in cheapside she said that they would seek him out  thither then they rode guided by one of the visitors clerks not he whom bolle had beaten but another and at last after some search found a dingy house in a court and over it a sign on which were painted three balls and the name of jacob smith emlyn dismounted and the door being open entered to be greeted by an old whitebearded man with horn spectacles thrust up over his forehead and dark eyes like her own since the same gypsy blood ran strong in both of them  what passed between them cicely did not hear but presently the old man came out with emlyn and looked her and bolle up and down sharply for a long while as though to take their measures at length he said that he understood from his cousin whom he now saw for the first time for over thirty years that the two of them and their man desired lodgings which as he had empty rooms he would be pleased to give them if they would pay the price  cicely asked how much this might be and on his naming a sum ten silver shillings a week for the three of them and their horses that would be stabled close by told emlyn to pay him a pound on account this he took biting the gold to see that it was good but bidding them in to inspect the rooms before he pouched it they did so and finding them clean and commodious if somewhat dark closed the bargain with him after which they dismissed the clerk to take their address to dr legh who had promised to advise them so soon as he could put their business forward  when he was gone and thomas bolle conducted by smiths apprentice had led off the three horses and the packbeast the old man changed his manner and conducting them into a parlour at the back of his shop sent his housekeeper a middleaged woman with a pleasant face to make ready food for them while he produced cordials from squat dutch bottles which he made them drink indeed he was all kindness to them being as he explained rejoiced to see one of his own blood for he had no relations living his wife and their two children having died in one of the london sicknesses also he was blossholme born though he had left that place fifty years before and had known cicelys grandfather and played with her father when he was a boy so he plied them with question after question some of which they thought it was not to answer for he was a merry and talkative old man  aha he said you would prove me before you trust me and who can blame you in this naughty world but perhaps i know more about you all than you think since in this trade my business is to learn many things for instance i have heard that there was a great trying of witches down at blossholme lately whereat a certain abbot came off worst also that the famous carfax jewels had been lost which vexed the said holy abbot they were jewels indeed or so i have heard for among them were two pink pearls worth a kings ransomor so i have heard great pity that they should be lost since my lady there would own them otherwise and much should i have liked who am a little man in that trade to set my old eyes upon them well well perhaps i shall perhaps i shall yet for that which is lost is sometimes found again now here comes your dinner eat eat well talk afterwards  this was the first of many pleasant meals which they shared with their host jacob smith soon emlyn found from inquiries that she made among his neighbours without seeming to do so that this cousin of hers bore an excellent name and was trusted by all  then why should we not trust him also asked cicely who must find friends and put faith in some one  even with the jewels mistress  even with the jewels for such things are his business and they would be safer in his strong chest than tacked into our garments where the thought of them haunts me night and day  let us wait a while said emlyn for once they were in that box how do we know if we should get them out again  on the morrow of this talk the visitor legh came to see them and had no cheerful tale to tell according to him the lord cromwell declared that as the abbot of blossholme claimed these shefton estates the king stood or would soon stand in the shoes of the said abbot of blossholme and therefore the king claimed them and could not surrender them moreover money was so wanted at court just then and here legh looked hard at them that there could be no talk of parting with anything of value except in return for a consideration and he looked at them harder still  and how can my lady give that broke in emlyn sharply for she feared lest cicely should commit herself today she is but a homeless pauper save for a few pounds in gold and even if she should come to her own again as your worship knows her first years profits are all promised  ah said the doctor sadly doubtless the case is hard only he added with cunning emphasis a tale has just reached me that the lady harflete has wealth hidden away which came to her from her mother trinkets of value and such things  now cicely coloured for the mans little eyes pierced her like gintlets and her powers of deceit were very small but this was not so with emlyn who as she said could play thief to catch a thief  listen sir she said with a secret air you have heard true there were some things of valuewhy should we hide it from you our good friend but alas that greedy rogue the abbot of blossholme has them he has stripped my poor lady as bare as a fowl for roasting get them back from him sir and on her behalf i say shell give you half of them will you not my lady  surely said cicely the doctor to whom we owe so much will be most welcome to the half of any movables of mine that he can recover from the abbot maldon and she paused for the fib stuck in her throat moreover she knew herself to be the colour of a peony  happily the commissioner did not notice her blushes or if he did he put them down to grief and anger  the abbot maldon he grumbled always the abbot maldon oh what a wicked thief must be that highstomached spaniard who does not scruple first to make orphans and then to rob them a blackhearted traitor too do you know that at this moment he stirs up rebellion in the north well ill see him on the rack before i have done have you a list of those movables madam  cicely said no and emlyn added that one should be made from memory  good ill see you again tomorrow or the next day and meanwhile fear not ill be as active in your business as a cat after a sparrow oh my rat of a spanish abbot you wait till i get my claws into your fat back farewell my lady harflete farewell mistress stower i must away to deal with other priests almost as wicked and he departed still muttering objurgations on the abbot  now i think the time has come to trust jacob smith said emlyn when the door closed behind him for he may be honest whereas this doctor is certainly a villain also the man has heard something and suspects us ah there you are cousin smith come in if you please since we desire to talk with you for a minute come in and be so good as to lock the door behind you  five minutes later all the jewels whereof not one was wanting lay on the table before old jacob who stared at them with round eyes  the carfax gems he muttered the carfax gems of which i have so often heard those that the old crusader brought from the east having sacked them from a sultan from the east where they talk of them still a sultans wealth unless indeed they came straight from the new jerusalem and were an angels gauds and do you say that you two women have carried these priceless things tacked in your cloaks which as i have seen you throw down here and there and leave behind you oh fools fools even among women incomparable fools fellowtravellers with dr legh also who would rob a baby of its bauble  fools or no exclaimed emlyn tartly we have got them safe enough after they have run some risks as i pray that you may keep them cousin smith  old jacob threw a cloth over the gems and slowly transferred them to his pocket  this is an upper floor he explained and the door is locked yet some one might put a ladder up to the window were i in the street i should know by the glitter in the light that there were precious things here stay they are not safe in my pocket even for an hour and going to the wall he did something to a panel in the wainscot causing it to open and reveal a space behind it where lay sundry wrappedup parcels among which he placed not all but a portion of the gems then he went to other panels that opened likewise showing more parcels and in the holes behind these he distributed the rest of the treasure  there foolish women he said since you have trusted me i will trust you you have seen my big strongboxes in my office and doubtless thought i keep all my little wares there well so does every thief in london for they have searched them twice and gained some store of pewter i remember that some of it was discovered again in the kings household but behind these panels all is safe though no woman would ever have thought of a device so simple and so sure  for a moment emlyn could find no answer perhaps because of her indignation but cicely asked sweetly  do you ever have fires in london master smith it seems to me that i have heard of such things and thenin a hurry you know  smith thrust up his horned spectacles and looked at her in mild astonishment  to think he said that i should live to learn wisdom out of the mouth of babes and sucklers  sucklings suggested cicely  sucklers or sucklings it means the same thingwomen he replied testily then added with a chuckle well well my lady you are right you have caught out jacob at his own game i never thought of fire though it is true we had one next door last year when i ran out with my bed and forgot all about the gold and stones ill have new hidingplaces made in the masonry of the cellar where no fire would hurt ah you women would never have thought of that who carry treasure sewn up in a nightshift  now emlyn could bear it no longer  and how would you have us carry it cousin smith she asked indignantly tied about our necks or hanging from our heels well do i remember my mother telling me that you were always a simple youth and that your saint must have been a very strong one who brought you safe to london and showed you how to earn a living there or else that you had married a woman of excellent intelligencethough it is plain now she has long been dead well well she added with a laugh cling to your mans vanities you son of a woman and since you are so clever give us of your wisdom for we need it but first let me tell you that i have rescued those very jewels from a fire and by hiding them in masonry in a vault  it is the fashion of the female to wrangle when she has the worst of the case said jacob with a twinkle in his eye so daughter of man set out your trouble perchance the wisdom that i have inherited from my mothers straight back to eve may help that which your mothers lacked now have you done with jests i listen if it pleases you to tell me  so having first invoked the curse of heaven on him if ever he should breathe a word emlyn with the help of cicely repeated the whole matter from the beginning and the candles were lighted ere ever her tale was done all this while jacob smith sat opposite to them saying little save now and again to ask a shrewd question at length when they had finished he exclaimed  truly women are fools  we have heard that before master smith replied cicely but this timewhy  not to have unbosomed to me before which would have saved you a week of time although as it happens i knew more of your story than you chose to tell and therefore the days have not been altogether wasted well to be brief this dr legh is a ravenous rogue  o solomon to have discovered that exclaimed emlyn  one whose only aim is to line his nest with your feathers some of which you have promised him as indeed you were right to do now he has got wind of these jewels which is not wonderful seeing that such things cannot be hid if you buried them in a coffin six foot underground still they would shine through the solid earth and declare themselves this is his planto strip you of everything ere his master cromwell gets a hold of you and if you go to him emptyhanded what chance has your suit with vicargeneral cromwell the hungriest shark of allsave one  we understand said emlyn but what is your plan cousin smith  mine i dont know that i have one still here is that which might do though i seem so small and humble i am remembered at courtwhen money is wanted and just now much money is wanted for soon they will be in arms in yorkshireand therefore i am much remembered now if you care to give dr legh the goby and leave your cause to me perhaps i might serve you as cheaply as another  at what charge blurted out emlyn  the old man turned on her indignantly asking  cousin how have i defrauded you or your mistress that you should insult me to my face go to you do not trust me go to with your jewels and seek some other helper and he went to the panelling as though to collect them again  nay nay master smith said cicely catching him by the arm be not angry with emlyn remember that of late we have learned in a hard school with abbot maldon and dr legh for masters at least i trust you so forsake me not who have no other to whom to turn in all my troubles which are many and as she spoke the great tears that had gathered in her blue eyes fell upon the childs face and woke him so that she must turn aside to quiet him which she was glad to do  grieve not said the kindhearted old man in distress tis i should grieve whose brutal words have made you weep moreover emlyn is right even foolish women should not trust the first jack with whom they take a lodging still since you swear that you do in your kindness ill try to show myself not all unworthy my lady harflete now what is it you want from the king justice on the abbot that youll get for nothing if his grace can give it for this same abbot stirs up rebellion against him no need therefore to set out his past misdeeds a clean title to your large inheritance which the abbot claims that will be more difficult since the king claims through him at best money must be paid for it a declaration that your marriage is good and your boy born in lawful wedlock not so hard but will cost something the annulment of the sentence of witchcraft on you both easy for the abbot passed it is there aught more  yes master smith the good nuns who befriended mei would save their house and lands to them those jewels are pledged to do it if it can be done  a matter of money ladya mere matter of money you will have to buy the property that is all now let us see what it will cost if fortune goes with me and he took pen and paper and began to write down figures  finally he rose sighing and shaking his head two thousand pounds he groaned a vast sum but i cant lessen it by a shillingthere are so many to be bought yes £1000 in gifts and £1000 as loan to his majesty who does not repay  two thousand pounds exclaimed cicely in dismay oh how shall i find so much whose first years rents are already pledged  know you the worth of those jewels asked jacob looking at her  nay the half of that perhaps  let us say double that and then right cheap  well if so replied cicely with a gasp where shall we sell them who has so much money  ill try to find it or what is needful now cousin emlyn he added sarcastically you see where my profit lies i buy the gems at half their value and the rest i keep  in your own words go to said emlyn and keep your gibes until we have more leisure  the old man thought a while and said  it grows late but the evening is pleasant and i think i need some air that crackbrained redhaired fellow of yours will watch you while i am gone and for mercys sake be careful with those candles nay nay you must have no fire you must go cold after what you said to me i can think of naught but fire it is for this night only by tomorrow evening ill prepare a place where abbot maldon himself might sit unscorched in the midst of hell but till then make out with clothes i have some furs in pledge that i will send up to you it is your own fault and in my youth we did not need a fire on an autumn day no more no more and he was gone nor did they see him again that night  on the following morning as they sat at their breakfast jacob smith appeared and began to talk of many things such as the badness of the weatherfor it rainedthe toughness of the ham which he said was not to be compared to those they cured at blossholme in his youth and the likeness of the baby boy to his mother  indeed no broke in cicely who felt that he was playing with them he is his fathers self there is no look of me in him  oh answered jacob well ill give my judgment when i see the father by the way let me read that note again which the cloaked man brought to emlyn  cicely gave it to him and he studied it carefully then said in an indifferent voice  the other day i saw a list of christian captives said to have been recovered from the turks by the emperor charles at tunis and among them was one huflit described as an english señor and his servant i wonder now  cicely sprang upon him  oh cruel wretch she said to have known this so long and not to have told me  peace lady he said retreating before her i only learned it at eleven of the clock last night when you were fast asleep yesterday is not this same day and therefore tis the other day is it not  surely you might have woke me but swift where is he now  how can i know not here at least but the writing said  well what did the writing say  i am trying to thinkmy memory fails me at times perhaps you will find the same thing when you have my years should it please heaven  oh that it might please heaven to make you speak what said the writing  ah i have it now it said in a note appended amidst other news fordid i tell you this was a letter from his graces ambassador in spain and oh his is the vilest scrawl to read nay hurry me notit said that this sir huflitthe ambassador has put a query against his nameand his servantyes yes i am sure it said his servant toowell that they both of them being angry at the treatment they had met with from the infidel turksno i forgot to add there were three of them one a priest who did otherwise well as i said being angry they stopped there to serve with the spaniards against the turks till the end of that campaign there that is all  how little is your all exclaimed cicely yet tis something oh why should a married man stop across the seas to be revenged on poor ignorant turks  why should he not interrupted emlyn when he deems himself a widower as does your lord  yes i forgot he thinks me dead who doubtless himself will be dead if he is not so already seeing that those wicked murderous turks will kill him and she began to weep  i should have added said jacob hastily that in a second letter of later date the ambassador declares that the emperors war against the turks is finished for this season and that the englishmen who were with him fought with great honour and were all escaped unharmed though this time he gives no names  all escaped if my husband were dead who could not die meanly or without fame how could he say that they were all escaped nay nay he lives though who knows if he will return perchance he will wander off elsewhere or stay and wed again  impossible said old jacob bowing to her having called you wifeimpossible  impossible echoed emlyn having such a score to settle with yonder maldon a man may forget his love especially if he deems her buried but as he stayed foreign to fight the turk who wronged him so hell come home to fight the abbot who ruined him and slew his bride  there followed a silence which the goldsmith who felt it somewhat painful hastened to break saying  yes doubtless he will come home for aught we know he may be here already but meanwhile we also have our score against this abbot a bad one though think not for his sake that all abbots are bad for i have known some who might be counted angels upon earth and having gone to martyrdom doubtless today are angels in heaven now my lady i will tell you what i have done hoping that it will please you better than it does me last night i saw the lord cromwell with whom i have many dealings at his house in austin friars and told him the case of which as i thought that false villain legh had said nothing to him purposing to pick the plums out of the pudding ere he handed on the suet to his master he read your deeds and hunted up some petition from the abbot with which he compared them then made a note of my demands and asked straight outhow much  i told him £1000 on loan to the king which would not be asked for back again the said loan to be discharged by the grant to methat is to youof all the abbey lands in addition to your own when the said abbey lands are sequestered as they will be shortly to this he agreed on behalf of his grace who needs money much but inquired as to himself i replied £500 for him and his jackals including dr legh of which no account would be asked he told me it was not enough for after the jackals had their pickings nothing would be left for him but the bones i who asked so much must offer more and he made as though to dismiss me at the door i turned and said i had a wonderful pink pearl that he who loved jewels might like to seea pink pearl worth many abbeys he said show it and oh he gloated over it like a maid over her first loveletter if there were two of these now he whispered  two my lord i answered theres no fellow to that pearl in the whole world though it is true that as i said the words the setting of its twin that was pinned to my inner shirt pricked me sorely as if in anger then i took it up again and for the second time began to bow myself out  jacob he said you are an old friend and ill stretch my duty for you leave the pearlhis grace needs that £1000 so sorely that i must keep it against my will and he put out his hand to take it only to find that i had covered it with my own  first the writing then its price my lord here is a memorandum of it set out fair to save you trouble if it pleases you to sign  he read it through then taking a pen scored out the clause as regards acquittal of the witchcraft which he said must be looked into by the king in person or by his officers but all the rest he signed undertaking to hand over the proper deeds under the great seal and royal hand upon payment of £1000 being able to do no better i said that would serve and left him your pearl he promising on his part to move his majesty to receive you which i doubt not he will do quickly for the sake of the £1000 have i done well  indeed yes exclaimed cicely who else could have done half so well  as the words left her lips there came a loud knocking at the door of the house and jacob ran down to open it presently he returned with a messenger in a splendid coat who bowed to cicely and asked if she were the lady harflete on her replying that such was her name he said that he bore to her the command of his grace the king to attend upon him at three oclock of that afternoon at his palace of whitehall together with emlyn stower and thomas bolle there to make answer to his majesty concerning a certain charge of witchcraft that had been laid against her and them which summons she would neglect at her peril  sir i will be there answered cicely but tell me do i come as a prisoner  nay replied the herald since master jacob smith in whom his grace has trust has consented to be answerable for you  and for the £1000 muttered jacob as with many salutations he showed the royal messenger to the door not neglecting to thrust a gold piece into his hand that he waved behind him in farewell    chapter xv  the devil at court  it was halfpast two of the clock when cicely who carried her boy in her arms accompanied by emlyn thomas bolle and jacob smith found herself in the great courtyard of the palace of whitehall the place was full of people waiting there upon one business or another through whom messengers and armed men thrust their way continually crying way in the kings name way so great was the press indeed that for some time even jacob could command no attention till at length he caught sight of the herald who had visited his house in the morning and beckoned to him  i was looking for you master smith and for the lady harflete the man said bowing to her you have an appointment with his grace have you not but god knows if it can be kept the antechambers are full of folk bringing news about the rebellion in the north and of great lords and councillors who wait for commands or money most of them for money in short the king has given order that all appointments are cancelled he can see no one today the lord cromwell told me so himself  jacob took a golden angel from his pouch and began to play with it between his fingers  i understand noble herald he said still do you think that you could find me a messenger to the lord cromwell if so this trifle  ill try master smith he answered stretching out his hand for the piece of money but what is the message  oh say that pink pearl would learn from his lordship where he can lay hands upon £1000 without interest  a strange message to which i will hazard an answernowhere said the herald yet ill find some one to deliver it step within this archway and wait out of the rain fear not i will be back presently  they did as he bid them gladly enough for it had begun to drizzle and cicely was afraid lest her boy with whom london did not agree too well should take cold here then they stood amusing themselves in watching the motley throng that came and went bolle to whom the scene was strange gaped at them with his mouth open emlyn took note of every one with her quick eyes while old jacob smith whispered tales concerning individuals as they passed most of which were little to their credit  as for cicely soon her thoughts were far away she knew that she was at a crisis of her fortune that if things went well with her this day she might look to be avenged upon her enemies and to spend the rest of her life in wealth and honour but it was not of such matters that she dreamed whose heart was set on christopher without whom naught availed where was he she wondered if jacobs tale were true after passing many dangers but a little while ago he lived and had his health yet in those times death came quickly leaping like the lightning from unexpected clouds or even out of a clear sky and who could say besides he believed her gone and that being so would be careless of himself or perchance worst thought of all would take some other wife as was but right and natural oh then indeed  at this moment a sound of altercation woke her to the world again and she looked up to see that thomas bolle was bringing trouble on them a coarse fat lout with a fiery and a knotted nose being somewhat in liquor had amused himself by making mock of his country looks and red hair and asking whether they used him for a scarecrow in his native fields  thomas bore it for a while only answering with another question whether he the fat fellow hired out his nose to london housewives to light their fires the man feeling that the laugh was against him and noticing the child in cicelys arms pointed it out to his friends inquiring whether they did not think it was exactly like its dad then thomass rage burnt up although the jest was silly and aimless enough  you low london gutterhound he exclaimed ill learn you to insult the lady harflete with your ribald japes and stretching out his big fist he seized his enemys purple nose in a grip of iron and began to twist it till the sot roared with pain thereon guards ran up and would have arrested bolle for breaking the peace in the kings palace indeed arrested he must have been notwithstanding all jacob smith could do to save him had not at that moment a man appeared at whose coming the crowd that had gathered separated bowing a man of middle age with a quick clever face who wore rich clothes and a furtrimmed velvet cap and gown  cicely knew him at once for cromwell the greatest man in england after the king and marked him well knowing that he held her fate and that of her child in the hollow of his hand she noted the thinlipped mouth small as a womans the sharp nose the little brownish eyes set close together and surrounded by wrinkled skin that gave them a cunning look and noting was afraid before her stood a man who though at present he seemed to be her friend if he chanced to become her enemy as once he had been bribed to be her fathers would show her no more pity than the spider shows a fly  indeed she was right for many were the flies that had been snared and sucked in the web of cromwell who in his full tide of power and pomp forgot the fate of his master wolsey in his day a greater spider still  what passes here cromwell said in a sharp voice men is this the place to brawl beneath his graces very windows ah master smith is it you explain  my lord answered jacob bowing this is lady harfletes servant and he is not to blame that fat knave insulted her and being quicktempered her man bolle wrang his nose  i see that he wrang it look he is wringing it still friend bolle leave go or presently you will have in your hand that which is of no value to you guard take this beertub and hold his head beneath the pump for five minutes by the clock to wash him and if he comes back again set him in the stocks nay no words fellow you are well served master smith follow me with your party  again the crowd parted as they walked after cromwell to a side door that was near at hand to find themselves alone with him in a small chamber here he stopped and turning surveyed them all narrowly especially cicely  i suppose master smith he said pointing to bolle who was wiping his hands clean with the rushes from the floor this is the man that you told me played the devil yonder at blossholme well he can play the fool also in another minute there would have been a tumult and you would have lost your chance of seeing his grace for months perhaps since he has determined to ride from london tomorrow morning northwards though it is true he may change his mind ere then this rebellion troubles him much and were it not for the loan you promise when loans are needed small hope would you have had of audience now come quickly and be careful that you do not cross the kings temper for it is tetchy today indeed had it not been for the queen who is with him and minded to see this lady harflete that they would have burnt as a witch you must have waited till a more convenient season which may never come stay what is in that great sack you carry bolle  the devils livery may it please your lordship  the devils livery many wear that in london still bring the gear it may make his grace laugh and if so ill give you a gold piece who have had enough of oaths and scoldings aye he added with a sour grin and of blows too now follow me into the presence and speak only when you are spoken to nor dare to answer if he rates you  they went from the room down a passage and through another door where the guards on duty looked suspiciously at bolle and his sack but at a word from cromwell let them through into a large room in which a fire burned upon the hearth at the end of this room stood a huge proudlooking man with a flat and cruel face broad as an oxs skull as thomas bolle said afterwards who was dressed in some rich sombre stuff and wore a velvet cap upon his head he held a parchment in his hand and before him on the other side of an oak table sat an officer of state in a black robe who wrote upon another parchment whereof there were many scattered about on the table and the floor  knave shouted the king for they guessed that it was he you have cast up these figures wrong oh that it should be my lot to be served by none but fools  pardon your grace said the secretary in a trembling voice thrice have i checked them  would you gainsay me you lying lawyer bellowed the king again i tell you they must be wrong since otherwise the sum is short by £1100 of that which i was promised where are the £1100 you must have stolen them thief  i steal oh your grace i steal  aye why not since your betters do only you are clumsy you lack skill ask my lord cromwell there to give you lessons he learned under the best of masters and is a merchant by trade to boot oh get you gone and take your scribblings with you  the poor officer hastened to avail himself of this invitation hurriedly collecting his parchments he bowed himself from the presence of his irate sovereign at the door about twelve feet away however he turned  my gracious liege he began the casting of the count is right upon my honour as a christian soul i can look your majesty in the face with truth in my eye  now on the table there was a massive inkstand made from the horn of a ram mounted with silver feet this henry seized and hurled with all his strength the aim was good for the heavy horn struck the wretched scribe upon the nose so that the ink squirted all over his face and felled him to the floor  now there is more in your eye than truth shouted the king be off ere the stool follows the inkpot  two ladies who stood by the fire talking together and taking no heed for to such rude scenes they seemed to be accustomed looked up and laughed a little then went on talking while cromwell smiled and shrugged his shoulders then in the midst of the silence which followed thomas bolle who had been watching openmouthed ejaculated in his great voice  a bulls eye a noble bull myself cannot throw straighter  silence fool hissed emlyn  who spoke asked the king looking towards them sharply  please my liege it was i thomas bolle  thomas bolle can you sling a stone thomas bolle whoever you may be  aye sire but not better than you i think that was a gallant shot  thomas bolle you are right seeing the hurry and the unhandiness of the missile it was excellent let the knave stand up again and ill bet you a gold noble to a brass nail that youll not do as well within an inch why the fellows gone will you try on my lord cromwell nay this is no time for fooling whats your business thomas bolle and who are those women with you  now cromwell stepped forward and with cringing gestures began to explain something to the king in a low voice meanwhile the two ladies became suddenly interested in cicely and one of them a pale but pretty woman splendidly dressed stepped forward to her saying  are you the lady harflete of whom we have heard she who was to have been burnt as a witch yes and is that your child oh what a beautiful child a boy ill swear come to me sweet and in after years you can tell that a queen has nursed you and she stretched out her arms  as good fortune would have it the child was awake and attracted by the queens pleasant voice or perhaps by the necklace of bright gems that she wore he held out his little hands towards her and went quite contentedly to her breast jane seymour for it was she began to fondle him with delight then followed by her lady ran to the king saying  see harry see what a beautiful boy and how he loves me god send us such a son as this  the king glanced at the child then answered  aye he would do well enow well it rests with you jane nurse him nurse him perhaps the sex is catching i and all england would see you brought to bed of that sickness sweet what said you cromwell  the great minister went on with his explanations till the king wearying of him called out  come here master smith  jacob advanced bowing and stood still  now master smith the lord cromwell tells me that if i sign these papers you on behalf of the lady harflete will loan me £1000 without interest which as it chances i need where then is this £1000for i will have no promises not even from you who are known to keep them master smith  jacob thrust his hand beneath his robe and from various inner pockets drew out bags of gold which he set in a row upon the table  here they are your grace he said quietly if you should wish for them they can be weighed and counted  gods truth i think i had better keep them lest some accident should happen to you on the way home master smith you might fall into the thames and sink  your grace is right the parchments will be lighter to carry even he added meaningly with your highnesss name added  i cant sign said the king doubtfully all the ink is spilt  jacob produced a small inkhorn which like most merchants of the day he carried hung to his girdle drew out the stopper and with a bow set it on the table  in truth you are a good man of business master smith too good for a mere king such readiness makes me pause perhaps we had better meet again at a more leisured season  jacob bowed once more and stretching out his hand slowly lifted the first of the bags of gold as though to replace it in his pocket  cromwell come hither said the king whereon jacob as though in forgetfulness laid the bag back upon the table  repeat the heads of this matter cromwell  my liege the lady harflete seeks justice on the spaniard maldon abbot of blossholme who is said to have murdered her father sir john foterell and her husband sir christopher harflete though rumour has it that the latter escaped his clutches and is now in spain item the said abbot has seized the lands which this dame cicely should have inherited from her father and demands their restitution  by gods wounds justice she shall have and for nothing if we can give it her answered the king letting his heavy fist fall upon the table no need to waste time in setting out her wrongs why tis the same spanish knave maldon who stirs up all this hells broth in the north well he shall boil in his own pot for against him our score is long what more  a declaration sire of the validity of the marriage between christopher harflete and cicely foterell which without doubt is good and lawful although the abbot disputes it for his own ends and an indemnity for the deaths of certain men who fell when the said abbot attacked and burnt the house of the said christopher harflete  it should have been granted the more readily if maldon had fallen also but let that pass what more  the promise your grace of the lands of the abbey of blossholme and of the priory of blossholme in consideration of the loan of £1000 advanced to your grace by the agent of cicely harflete jacob smith  a large demand my lord have these lands been valued  aye sire by your commissioner who reports it doubtful if with all their tenements and timber they would fetch £1000 in gold  our commissioner a fig for his valuing doubtless he has been bribed still if we repay the money we can hold the land and since this dame harflete and her husband have suffered sorely at the hands of maldon and his armed ruffians why let it pass also now is that all i weary of so much talk  but one thing more your grace put in cromwell hastily for henry was already rising from his chair dame cicely harflete her servant emlyn stower and a certain crazed old nun were condemned of sorcery by a court ecclesiastic whereof the abbot maldon was a member the said abbot alleging that they had bewitched him and his goods  then he was pleader and judge in one  that is so your grace already without the royal warrant they were bound to the stake for burning the said maldon having usurped the prerogative of the crown when your commissioner legh arrived and loosed them but not without fighting for certain men were killed and wounded now they humbly crave your majestys royal pardon for their share in this manslaying if any as also does thomas bolle yonder who seems to have done the slaying  well can i believe it muttered the king  and a declaration of the invalidity of their trial and condemning and of their innocence of the foul charge laid against them  innocence exclaimed henry growing impatient and fixing on the last point how do we know they were innocent though it is true that if dame harflete is a witch she is the prettiest that ever we have heard of or seen you ask too much after your fashion cromwell  i crave your graces patience for one short minute there is a man here who can prove that they were innocent yonder redhaired bolle  what he who praised our shooting well bolle since you are so good a sportsman we will listen to you prove and be brief  now all is finished murmured emlyn to cicely for assuredly fool thomas will land us in the mire  your grace said bolle in his big voice i obey in four wordsi was the devil  the devil you were thomas bolle now your meaning  your grace blossholme was haunted i haunted it  how could you do otherwise if you lived there  ill show your grace and without more ado to the horror of cicely thomas tumbled from his sack all his hellish garb and set to work to clothe himself in a minute for he was practised at the game the hideous mask was on his head and with it the horns and skin of the widows billygoat the tail and painted hides were tied about him and in his hand he waved the eel spear shorthandled now thus arrayed he capered before the astonished king and queen shaking the tail that had a wire in it and clattering his hoofs upon the floor  oh good devil most excellent devil exclaimed his majesty clapping his hands if i had met thee id have run like a hare stay jane peep you through yonder door and tell me who are gathered there  the queen obeyed and returned said  there be a bishop and a priest i cannot see which for it grows dark with chaplains and sundry of the lords of council waiting audience  good then well try the devil on these deviltamers friend satan go you to that door slip through it softly and rush upon them roaring driving them through this chamber so that we may see which of them will be bold enough to try to lay you dost understand beelzebub  thomas nodded his horns and departed silently as a cat  now open the door and stand on one side said the king  cromwell obeyed nor had they long to wait presently from the hall beyond there rose a most fearful clamour then through the door shot the bishop panting after him came lords chaplains and secretaries and last of all the priest who being very fat and hampered by his gown could not run so fast although at his back satan leapt and bellowed no heed did they take of the kings majesty or of aught else whose only thought was flight as they tore down the chamber to the farther door  oh noble noble hallooed the king who was shaking with laughter give him your fork devil give him your fork and having the royal command bolle obeyed with zeal  in thirty seconds it was all over the rout had come and gone only thomas in his hideous attire stood bowing before the king who exclaimed  i thank thee thomas bolle thou hast made me laugh as i have not laughed for years little wonder that thy mistress was condemned for witchcraft now he added changing his tone off with that mummery and cromwell go catch one of those fools and tell them the truth ere tales fly round the palace jane cease from merriment there is a time for all things come hither lady harflete i would speak with you  cicely approached and curtseyed leaving her boy in the queens arms where he had gone to sleep for she did not seem minded to part with him  you are asking much of us he said suddenly searching her with a shrewd glance relying doubtless on your wrongs which are deep or your face which is sweet or both well these things move kings mayhap more than others also i knew old sir john your father a loyal man and a brave he fought well at flodden and young harflete your husband if he still lives had a good name like his forebears moreover your enemy maldon is ours a treacherous foreign snake such as england hates for he would set her beneath the heel of spain  now dame harflete doubtless when you go hence you will bear away strange stories of king harry and his doings you will say he plays the fool pelting his servants with inkpots when he is wrath as god knows he has often cause to be and scaring his bishops with sham satans as after all why should he not since it is a dull world youll say too that he takes his teaching from his ministers and signs what these lay before him with small search as to the truth or falsity well thats the lot of monarchs who have but one mans brain and one mans time who needs must trust their slaves until these become their masters and there is naught left here his face grew fierce save to kill them and find more and worse new servants new wives and he glanced at jane who was not listening new friends false false all three of them new foes and at the last old death to round it off such has been the lot of kings from david down and such i think it shall always be  he paused a while brooding heavily then looked up and went on i know not why i should speak thus to a chit like you except it be that young though you are you also have known trouble and the feel of a sick heart well well i have heard more of you and your affairs than you might think and i forget nothingthats my gift dame harflete you are richer than you have been advised to say and i repeat you ask much of me justice is your due from your sovereign and you shall have it but these wide abbey lands this priory of blossholme whose nuns have befriended you and whom you desire to save this embracing pardon for others who had shed blood this cancelling outside of the form of law of a sentence passed by a court duly constituted if unjust all in return for a loan of a pitiful £1000 you huckster well lady harflete one would think that your father had been a chapman not rough john foterell you who can drive so shrewd a bargain with your kings necessities  sire sire broke in cicely in confusion i have no more my lands are wasted by abbot maldon my husbands hall is burnt by his soldiers my first years rents if ever i should receive them are promised  to whom  she hesitated  to whom he thundered answer madam  to your royal commissioner dr legh  ah i thought as much though when he spoke of you he did not tell it the snuffling rogue  the jewels that came to me from my mother are in pawn for that £1000 and i have no more  a palpable lie dame harflete for if so how have you paid cromwell he did not bring you here for nothing  oh my liege my liege said cicely sinking to her knees ask not a helpless woman to betray those who have befriended her in her most sore and honest need i said i have nothing unless those gems are worth more than i know  and i believe you dame harflete we have plucked you bare between us have we not still perchance you will be no loser in the end now master smith there does not work for love alone  sire said jacob that is true i copy my masters i have this ladys jewels in pledge and i hope to make a profit on them still sire there is among them a pink pearl of great beauty that it might please the queen to wear here it is and he laid it upon the table  oh what a lovely thing said jane never have i seen its like  then study it well wife for you look your last upon it when we cannot pay our soldiers to keep our crown upon our head and preserve the liberties of england against the spaniard and the pope of rome it is no time to give you gems that i have not bought take that gaud and sell it master smith for whatever it will fetch among the jews and add the price to the £1000 lessened by one tenth for your trouble now dame harflete you have bought the favour of your king for whoever else may ill not lie ah here comes cromwell my lord you have been long  your grace yonder priest is in a fit from fright and thinks himself in hell i had to tarry with him till the doctor came  doubtless hell get better now that you are gone poor man if a sham devil frights him so what will he do at last now cromwell i have made examination of this business and i will sign your papers all of them dame harflete here tells me how hard you have worked for her all for nothing cromwell and that pleases me who at times have wondered how you grew so rich as your learner wolsey did before you he took bribes cromwell  my liege he answered in a low voice this case was cruel it moved my pity  as it has ours leaving us the richer by £1000 and the price of a pearl there five are they all signed take them master smith as the lady harflete is your client and study them tonight if aught be wrong or omitted you have our royal word that we will set it straight this is our commandnote it cromwellthat all things be done quickly as occasion shall arise to give effect to these precepts pardons and patents which you cromwell shall countersign ere they leave this room also that no further fee secret or declared shall be taken from the lady harflete whom henceforth in token of our special favour we create and name the lady of blossholme from her husband or her child as to any of these matters and that commissioner legh on receipt thereof shall pay into our treasury any sum or sums that dame harflete may have promised to him write it down my lord cromwell and see that our words are carried out lest it be the worse for you  the vicargeneral hastened to obey for there was something in the kings eye that frightened him meanwhile the queen after she had seen the coveted pearl disappear into jacobs pocket thrust back the child into cicelys arms and without any word of adieu or reverence to the king followed by her lady departed from the room slamming the door behind her  her grace is cross because that gemyour gem lady harfletewas refused to her said henry then added in an angry growl fore god does she dare to play off her tempers upon me and so soon when i am troubled about big matters oho jane seymour is the queen today and shed let the world know it well what makes a queen a kings fancy and a crown of gold which the hand that set it on can take off again head and all if it stick too tight and then wheres your queen pest upon women and the whims that make us seek their company dame harflete youd not treat your lord so would you you have never been to court i think or i should have known your eyes again well perhaps it is well for you and thats why you are gentle and loving  if i am gentle sire it is trouble that has gentled me who have suffered so much and know not even now whether after one week of marriage i am wife or widow  widow should that be so come to me and i will find you another and a nobler spouse with your face and possessions it will not be difficult nay do not weep for your sake i trust that this lucky man may live to comfort you and serve his king at least hell be no spaniards tool and popes plotter  well will he serve your grace if god gives him the chance as my murdered father did  we know it lady cromwell will you never have finished with those writings the council waits us and so does supper and a word or two with her grace ere bedtime you thomas bolle you are no fool and can hold a sword tell me shall i go up north to fight the rebels or bide here and let others do it  bide here your grace answered thomas promptly twixt wash and humber is a wild land in winter and arrows fly about there like ducks at night none knowing whence they come also your grace is overheavy for a horse on forest roads and moorland and if aught should chance why theyd laugh in spain and rome or nearer and who would rule england with a girl child on its throne and he stared hard at cromwells back  truth at last and out of the lips of a redhaired bumpkin muttered the king also staring at the unconscious cromwell who was engaged on his writing and either feigned deafness or did not hear thomas bolle i said that you were no fool although some may have thought you so is there aught you would have in payment for your counselsave money for that we have none  aye sire freedom from my oath as a laybrother of the abbey of blossholme and leave to marry  to marry whom  her sire and he pointed to emlyn  what the other handsome witch see you not that she has a temper nay woman be silent it is written in your face well take your freedom and her with it but thomas bolle why did you not ask otherwise when the chance came your way i thought better of you like the rest of us you are but a fool after all farewell to you fool thomas and to you also my fair lady of blossholme    chapter xvi  the voice in the forest  the four were back safe in their lodging in cheapside whither after the deeds had been sealed three soldiers escorted them by command  have we done well have we done well asked jacob rubbing his hands  it would seem so master smith replied cicely thanks to you that is if all the king said is really in those writings  it is there sure enough said jacob for know that with the aid of a lawyer and three scriveners i drafted them myself in the lord cromwells office this morning and oh i drew them wide hard hard we worked with no time for dinner and that was why i was ten minutes late by the clock for which emlyn here chided me so sharply still ill read them through again and if aught is left out we will have it righted though these are the same parchments for i set a secret mark upon them  nay nay said cicely leave well alone his graces mood may change or the queenthat matter of the pearl  ah the pearl it grieved me to part with that beautiful pearl but there was no way out it must be sold and the money handed over our honour is on it had i refused who knows yes we may thank god for if the most of your jewels are gone the wide abbey lands have come and other things nothing is forgot bolle is unfrocked and may wed cousin stower has got a husband  then emlyn who until now had been strangely silent burst out in wrath  am i then a beast that i should be given to this man like a heriot at yonder kings bidding she exclaimed pointing with her finger at bolle who stood in the corner who gave you the right thomas to demand me in marriage  well since you ask me emlyn it was you yourself once many years ago down in the mead by the water and more lately in the chapel of blossholme priory before i began to play the devil  play the devil aye you have played the devil with me there in the kings presence i must stand for an hour or more while all talked and never let a word slip between my lips and at last hear myself called by his grace a woman of temper and you a fool for wishing to marry me oh if ever we do marry ill prove his words  then perhaps emlyn we who have got on a long while apart had best stay so answered thomas calmly yet why you should fret because you must keep your tongue in its case for an hour or because i asked leave to marry you in all honour i do not know i have worked my best for you and your mistress at some hazard and things have not gone so ill seeing that now we are quit of blame and in a fair way to peace and comfort if you are not content why then the king was right and im a fool and so goodbye ill trouble you no more in fair weather or in foul i have leave to marry and there are other women in the world should i need one  tread on their tails and even worms will turn soliloquized jacob while emlyn burst into tears  cicely ran to console her and bolle made as though he would leave the room  just then there came a great knocking on the street door and the sound of a voice crying  in the kings name in the kings name open  thats commissioner legh said thomas i learned the cry from him and it is a good one at a pinch as some of you may remember  emlyn dried her tears with her sleeve cicely sat down and jacob shovelled the parchments into his big pockets then in burst the commissioner to whom some one had opened  whats this i hear he cried addressing cicely his face as red as a turkey cocks that you have been working behind my back that you have told falsehoods of me to his grace who called me knave and thief that i am commanded to pay my fees into the treasury oh ungrateful wench would to god that i had let you burn ere you disgraced me thus  if you bring so much heat into my poor house learned doctor surely all of us will soon burn said jacob suavely the lady harflete said nothing that his highness did not force her to say as i know who was present and among so many pickings cannot you spare a single dole come come drink a cup of wine and be calm  but dr legh who had already drunk several cups of wine would not be calm he reviled first one of them and then the other but especially emlyn whom he conceived to be the cause of all his woes till at length he called her by a very ill name then came forward thomas bolle who all this while had been standing in the corner and took him by the neck  in the kings name he said nay complain not tis your own cry and i have warrant for it and he knocked leghs head against the doorpost in the kings name get out of this and he gave him such a kick as never royal commissioner had felt before shooting him down the passage for the third time in the kings name and he hurled him out in a heap into the courtyard begone and know if ever i see your pudding face again in the kings name ill break your neck  thus did visitor legh depart out of the life of cicely though in due course she paid him her first years rent nor ever asked who took the benefit  thomas said emlyn when he returned smiling at the memory of that farewell kick the king was right i am quicktempered at times no ill thing for it has helped me more than once forget and so will i and she gave him her hand which he kissed then went to see about the supper  while they ate which they did heartily who needed food there came another knock  go thomas said jacob and say we see none tonight  so thomas went and they heard talk then he reentered followed by a cloaked man saying  here is a visitor whom i dare not deny whereon they all rose thinking in their folly that it was the king himself and not one almost as mighty in england for a whilethe lord cromwell  pardon me said cromwell bowing in his courteous manner and if you will let me be seated with you and give me a bite and a sup for i need them who have been hardworked today  so he sat down among them and ate and drank talking pleasantly of many things and telling them that the king had changed his mind at the council as he thought because of the words of thomas bolle which he believed had stuck there and would not go north to fight the rebels after all but would send the duke of norfolk and other lords then when he had done he pushed away his cup and platter looked at his hosts and said  now to business my lady harflete fortune has been your friend this day for all you asked has been granted to you which as his graces temper has been of late is a wondrous thing moreover i thank you that you did not answer a certain question as to myself which i learn he put to you urgently  my lord said cicely you have befriended me still had he pressed me further god knows commissioner legh did not thank me tonight and she told him of the visit they had just received and of its ending  a rough man and a greedy who doubtless henceforth will be your enemy replied cromwell still you were not to blame for who can reason with a bull in his own yard well while i have power ill not forget your faithfulness though in truth my lady of blossholme i sit upon a slippery height and beneath waits a gulf that has swallowed some as great and greater therefore i will not deny it i lay by while i may not knowing who will gather  he brooded a while then went on with a sigh  the times are uncertain thus you who have the promise of wealth may yet die a beggar the lands of blossholme abbey on which you hold a bond that will never be redeemed are not yet in the kings hands to give a black storm is bursting in the north and i say this in secret the fury of it may sweep henry from the throne if it should be so away with you to any land where you are not known for then after this days work here a rope will be your only heritage more this queen unlike anne who is gone is a friend to the party of the church and though she affects to care little for such things is bitter about that pearl and therefore against you its owner have you no jewel left that you could spare which i might take to her as for the pearl itself which master smith here swore to me was not to be found in the whole world when he showed me its fellow it must be sold as the king commanded and he looked at jacob somewhat sourly  now cicely spoke with jacob who went away and returned presently with a brooch in which was set a large white diamond surrounded by five small rubies  take her this with my duty my lord said cicely  i will i will oh fear not it shall reach her for my own sake as well as yours you are a wise giver lady harflete who know when and where to cast your bread upon the waters and now i have a gift for you that perchance will please you more than gems your husband christopher harflete accompanied by a servant has landed in the north safe and well  oh my lord she cried then where is he now  alas the rest of the tale is not so pleasing for as he journeyed from hull i think he was taken prisoner by the rebels who have him fast at lincoln wishing to make him whose name is of account one of their company but he being a wise and loyal man contrived to send a letter to the kings captain in those parts which has reached me this night here it is do you know the writing  aye aye gasped cicely staring at the scrawl that was ill writ and worse spelt for christopher was no scholar  then ill read it to you and afterwards certify a copy to multiply the evidence   to the captain of the kings forces outside lincoln  this to give notice to you his grace and his ministers and all others that we christopher harflete knight and jeffrey stokes his servant when journeying from the seaport whither we had come from spain were taken by rebels in arms against the king and brought here to lincoln these men would win me to their party because the name of harflete is still strong and known so violent were they that we have taken some kind of oath yet this writing advises you that so i only did to save my life having no heart that way who am a loyal man and understand little of their quarrel life in sooth is of small value to me who have lost wife lands and all yet ere i die i would be avenged upon the murderous abbot of blossholme and therefore i seek to keep my breath in me and to escape  i learn that the said abbot is afoot with a great following within fifty miles of here pray god he does not get his claws in me again but if so say to the king that harflete died faithful  christopher harflete  jeffrey stokes x his mark  my lord said cicely what shall i do my lord  there is naught to be done save trust in god and hope for the best doubtless he will escape and at least his grace shall see this letter tomorrow morning and send orders to help him if may be copy it master smith  jacob took the letter and began to write swiftly while cromwell thought  listen he said presently round blossholme there are no rebels all of that colour have drawn off north now foterell and harflete are good names yonder cannot you journey thither and raise a company  aye aye that i can do broke in bolle in a week i will have a hundred men at my back give commission and money to my lady there and name me captain and youll see  the commission and the captaincy under the privy signet shall be at this house by nine of the clock tomorrow answered cromwell the money you must find for there is none outside the coffers of jacob smith yet pause lady harflete there is risk and here you are safe  i know the risk she answered but what do i care for risks who have taken so many when my husband is yonder and i may serve him  an excellent spirit let us trust that it comes from on high remarked cromwell but old jacob as he wrote vera copia for his lordships signature at the foot of the transcript of christophers letter shook his head sadly  in another minute cromwell had signed without troubling to compare the two and with some gentle words of farewell was gone having bigger matters waiting his attention  cicely never saw him again indeed with the exception of jacob smith she never saw any of those folk again including the king who had been concerned in this crisis of her life yet notwithstanding his cunning and his extortion she grieved for cromwell when some four years later the duke of suffolk and the earl of southampton rudely tore the garter and his other decorations off his person and he was haled from the council to the tower and thence after abject supplications for mercy to perish a criminal upon the block at least he had served her well for he kept all his promises to the letter one of his last acts also was to send her back the pink pearl which he had received as a bribe from jacob smith with a message to the effect that he was sure it would become her more than it had him and that he hoped it would bring her a better fortune    when cromwell had gone jacob turned to cicely and inquired if she were leaving his house upon the morrow  have i not said so she asked with impatience knowing what i know how could i stay in london why do you ask  because i must balance our account i think you owe me a matter of twenty marks for rent and board also it is probable that we shall need money for our journey and this day has left me somewhat bare of coin  our journey said cicely do you then accompany us master smith  with your leave i think so lady times are bad here i have no shilling left to lend yet if i do not lend i shall never be forgiven also i need a holiday and ere i die would once again see blossholme where i was born should we live to reach it but if we start tomorrow i have much to do this night for instance your jewels which i hold in pawn must be set in a place of safety also these deeds whereof copies should be made and that pearl must be left in trusty hands for sale so at what hour do we ride on this mad errand  at eleven of the clock answered cicely if the kings safeconduct and commission have come by then  so be it then i bid you goodnight come with me worthy bolle for therell be no sleep for us i go to call my clerks and you must go to the stable lady harflete and you cousin emlyn get you to bed  on the following morning cicely rose with the dawn nor was she sorry to do so who had spent but a troubled night for long sleep would not come to her and when it did at length she was tossed upon a sea of dreams dreams of the king who threatened her with his great voice of cromwell who took everything she had down to her cloak of commissioner legh who dragged her back to the stake because he had lost his bribe  but most of all she dreamed of christopher her beloved husband who was so near and yet as far away as he had ever been a prisoner in the hands of the rebels her husband who deemed her dead  from all these phantasies she awoke weeping and oppressed by fears could it be that when at length the cup of joy was so near her lips fate waited to dash it down again she knew not who had naught but faith to lean on that faith which in the past had served her well meanwhile she was sure that if christopher lived he would make his way to cranwell or to blossholme and whatever the risk thither she would go also as fast as horses could carry her  hurry as they would midday was an hour gone ere they rode out of cheapside there was so much to do and even then things were left undone the four of them travelled humbly clad giving out that they were a party of merchant folk returning to cambridge after a visit to london as to an inheritance in which they were interested especially cicely who posed as a widow named johnson this was their story which they varied from time to time according to circumstances in some ways their minds were more at ease than when they travelled to the great city for now at least they were clear of the horrid company of commissioner legh and his people nor were they haunted by the knowledge that they had about them jewels of great price all these jewels were left behind in safe keeping as were also the writings under the kings hand and seal of which they only took attested copies and with them the commission that cromwell had duly sent to cicely addressed to her husband and herself and bolles certificate of captaincy these they hid in their boots or the linings of their vests together with such money as was necessary for the costs of travel  thus riding hard for their horses were good and fresh they came unmolested to cambridge on the night of the second day and slept there beyond cambridge they were told the country was so disturbed that it would not be safe for them to journey but just when they were in despair for even bolle said that they must not go on a troop of the kings horse arrived on their way to join the duke of norfolk wherever he might lie in lincolnshire  to their captain one jeffreys jacob showed the kings commission revealing who they were seeing that it commanded all his graces officers and servants to do them service this captain jeffreys said that he would give them escort until their roads separated so next day they went on again the company was not pleasant for the men of whom there were about a hundred proved rough fellows still having been warned that he who insulted or laid a finger on them should be hanged they did them no harm it was well indeed that they had their protection for they found the country through which they passed up in arms and were more than once threatened by mobs of peasants led by priests who would have attacked them had they dared  for two days they travelled thus with captain jeffreys coming on the evening of the second to peterborough where they found lodgings at an inn when they rose the next morning however it was to discover that jeffreys and his men had already gone leaving a message to say that he had received urgent orders to push on to lincoln  now once more they told their old tale declaring that they were citizens of boston and having learned that the fens were peaceful perhaps because so few people lived in them started forward by themselves under the guidance of bolle who had often journeyed through that country buying or selling cattle for the monks an ill land was it to travel in also in that wet autumn seeing that in many places the floods were out and the tracks were like a quagmire the first night they spent in a marshmans hut listening to the pouring rain and fearing fever and ague especially for the boy the next day by good fortune they reached higher land and slept at a tavern  here they were visited by rude men who being of the party of rebellion sought to know their business for a while things were dangerous but bolle who could talk their own dialect showed that they were scarcely to be feared who travelled with two women and a babe adding that he was a laybrother of blossholme abbey disguised as a servingman for dread of the kings party jacob smith also called for ale and drank with them to the success of the pilgrimage of grace as their revolt was named  in this way they disarmed suspicion with one tale and another moreover they heard that as yet the country round blossholme remained undisturbed although it was said that the abbot had fortified the abbey and stored it with provisions he himself was with the leaders of the revolt in the neighbourhood of lincoln but he had done this that he might have a strong place to fall back on  so in the end the men went away full of strong beer and that danger passed by  next morning they started forward early hoping to reach blossholme by sunset though the days were shortening much this however was not to be for as it chanced they were badly bogged in a quagmire that lay about two miles off their inn and when at length they scrambled out had to ride many miles round to escape the swamp so it happened that it was already well on in the afternoon when they came to that stretch of forest in which the abbot had murdered sir john foterell following the woodland road towards sunset they passed the mere where he had fallen weary as she was cicely looked at the spot and found it familiar  i know this place she said where have i seen it oh in the ill dream i had on that day i lost my father  that is not wonderful answered emlyn who rode beside her carrying the child seeing that thomas says it was just here they butchered him look yonder lie the bones of meg his mare i know them by her black mane  aye lady broke in bolle and there he lies also where he fell they buried him with never a christian prayer and he pointed to a little careless mound between two willows  jesus have mercy on his soul said cicely crossing herself now if i live i swear that i will move his bones to the chancel of blossholme church and build a fair monument to his memory  this as all visitors to the place know she did for that monument remains to this day representing the old knight lying in the snow with the arrow in his throat between the two murderers whom he slew while round the corner of the tomb jeffrey stokes gallops away  while cicely stared back at this desolate grave muttering a prayer for the departed thomas bolle heard something which caused him to prick his ears  what is it asked jacob smith who saw the change in his face  horses gallopingmany horses master he answered yes and riders on them listen  they did so and now they also heard the thud of horses hoofs and the shouts of men  quick quick said bolle follow me i know where we may hide and he led them off to a dense thicket of thorn and beech scrub which grew about two hundred yards away under a group of oaks at a place where four tracks crossed owing to the beech leaves which when the trees are young as every gardener knows cling to the twigs through autumn and winter this place was very close and hid them completely  scarcely had they taken up their stand there when in the red light of the sunset they saw a strange sight along not that road they had followed but another which led round the farther side of kings grave mount now seen and now hidden by the forest trees a tall man in armour mounted on a grey horse accompanied by another man in a leathern jerkin mounted on a black horse galloped towards them whilst at a distance of not more than a hundred yards behind them appeared a motley mob of pursuers  escaped prisoners being run down muttered bolle but cicely took no heed there was something about the appearance of the rider of the grey horse that seemed to draw her heart out of her  she leaned forward on her beasts neck staring with all her eyes now the two men were almost opposite the thicket and the man in mail turned his face to his companion and called cheerily  we gain well slip them yet jeffrey  cicely saw the face  christopher she cried christopher  another moment and they had swept past but christopherfor it was hehad caught the sound of that remembered voice with eyes made quick by love and fear she saw him pulling on his rein she heard him shout to jeffrey and jeffrey shout back to him in tones of remonstrance they halted confusedly in the open space beyond he tried to turn then perceived his pursuers drawing nearer and when they were already at his heels with an exclamation pulled round again to gallop away too late up the slope they sped for another hundred yards or so now they were surrounded and now at the crest of it they fought for swords flashed in the red light the pursuers closed in on them like hounds on an outrun fox they went downthey vanished  cicely strove to gallop after them for she was crazed but the others held her back  at length there was silence and thomas bolle dismounting crept out to look ten minutes later he returned  all have gone he said  oh he is dead wailed cicely this fatal place has robbed me of father and of husband  i think not answered bolle i see no bloodstains nor any signs of a man being carried he went living on his horse still would to heaven that women could learn when to keep silent    chapter xvii  between doom and honour  the day was about to break when at last utterly worn out in body and mind cicely and her party rode their stumbling horses up to the gates of blossholme priory  pray god the nuns are still here said emlyn who held the child for if they have been driven out and my mistress must go farther i think that she will die knock hard thomas that old gardener is deaf as a wall  bolle obeyed with good will till presently the grille in the door was opened and a trembling womans voice asked who was there  thats mother matilda said emlyn and slipping from her horse she ran to the bars and began to talk to her through them then other nuns came and between them they opened one of the large gates for the gardener either could not or would not be aroused and passed through it into the courtyard where when it was understood that cicely had really come again there was a great welcoming but now she could hardly speak so they made her swallow a bowl of milk and took her to her old room where sleep of some kind overcame her when she awoke it was nine of the clock emlyn looking little the worse was already up and stood talking with mother matilda  oh cried cicely as memory came back to her has aught been heard of my husband  they shook their heads and the prioress said  first you must eat sweet and then we will tell you all we know which is little  so she ate who needed food sadly and while emlyn helped her to dress herself hearkened to the news it was of no great account only confirming that which they had learnt from the fenmen that the abbey was fortified and guarded by strange soldiers rebellious men from the north or foreigners and the abbot supposed to be away  bolle who had been out reported also that a man he met declared that he had heard a troop of horsemen pass through the village in the night but of this no proof was forthcoming since if they had done so the heavy rain that was still falling had washed out all traces of them moreover in those times people were always moving to and fro in the dark and none could know if this troop had anything to do with the band they had seen in the forest which might have gone some other way  when cicely was ready they went downstairs and in mother matildas private room found jacob smith and thomas bolle awaiting them  lady harflete said jacob with the air of a man who has no time to lose things stand thus as yet none know that you are here for we have the gardener and his wife under ward but as soon as they learn it at the abbey there will be risk of an attack and this place is not defensible now at your hall of shefton it is otherwise for there it seems is a deep moat with a drawbridge and the rest to shefton therefore you must go at once unobserved if may be indeed thomas has been there already and spoken to certain of your tenants whom he can trust who are now hard at work preparing and victualling the place and passing on the word to others by nightfall he hopes to have thirty strong men to defend it and within three days a hundred when your commission and his captaincy are made known come then for there is no time to tarry and the horses are saddled  so cicely kissed mother matilda who blessed and thanked her for all she had done or tried to do on behalf of the sisterhood and within five minutes once more they were on the backs of their weary beasts and riding through the rain to shefton which happily was but three miles away keeping under the lee of the woods they left the priory unobserved for in that wet few were stirring and the sentinels at the abbey if there were any had taken shelter in the guardhouse so thankfully enough they came unmolested to walled and wooded shefton which cicely had last seen when she fled thence to cranwell on the day of her marriage oh years and years ago or so it seemed to her tormented heart  it was a strange and a sad homecoming she thought as they rode over the drawbridge and through the sodden and weedsmothered pleasaunce to the familiar door yet it might have been worse for the tenants whom bolle had warned had not been idle for two hours past and more a dozen willing women had swept and cleaned the fires had been lit and there was plenteous food of a sort in the kitchen and the storeroom  moreover in all the big hall were gathered about a score of her people who welcomed her by raising their bonnets and even tried to cheer to these at once jacob read the kings commission showing them the signet and the seal and that other commission which named thomas bolle a captain with wide powers the sight and hearing of which writings seemed to put a great heart into them who so long had lacked a leader and the support of authority one and all they swore to stand by the king and their lady cicely harflete and her lord sir christopher or if he were dead his child then about half of them took horse and rode off this way and that to gather men in the kings name while the rest stayed to guard the hall and work at its defences  by sunset men were riding up from all sides some of them driving carts loaded with provisions arms and fodder or sheep and beasts that could be killed for sustenance while as they came jacob enrolled their names upon a paper and by virtue of his commission thomas bolle swore them in indeed that night they had forty men quartered there and the promise of many more  by now however the secret was out for the story had gone round and the smoke from the shefton chimneys told its own tale first a single spy appeared on the opposite rise watching then he galloped away to return an hour later with ten armed and mounted men one of whom carried a banner on which were embroidered the emblems of the pilgrimage of grace these men rode to within a hundred paces of shefton hall apparently with the object of attacking it then seeing that the drawbridge was up and that archers with bent bows stood on either side halted and sent forward one of their number with a white flag to parley  who holds shefton shouted this man and for what cause  the lady harflete its owner and captain thomas bolle for the cause of the king called old jacob smith back to him  by what warrant asked the man the abbot of blossholme is lord of shefton and thomas bolle is but a laybrother of his monastery  by warrant of the kings grace said jacob and then and there at the top of his voice he read to him the royal commission which when the envoy had heard he went back to consult with his companions for a while they hesitated apparently still meditating attack but in the end rode away and were seen no more  bolle wished to follow and fall on them with such men as he had but the cautious jacob smith forbade it fearing lest he should tumble into some ambush and be killed or captured with his people leaving the place defenceless  so the afternoon went by and ere evening closed in they had so much strength that there was no more cause for fear of an attack from the abbey whose garrison they learned amounted to not over fifty men and a few monks for most of these had fled  that night cicely with emlyn and old jacob were seated in the long upper room where her father sir john foterell had once surprised christopher paying his court to her when bolle entered followed by a man with a hangdog look who was wrapped in a sheepskin coat which seemed to become him very ill  who is this friend asked jacob  an old companion of mine your worship a monk of blossholme who is weary of grace and its pilgrimages and seeks the kings comfort and pardon which i have made bold to promise to him  good said jacob ill enter his name and if he remains faithful your promise shall be kept but why do you bring him here  because he bears tidings  now something in bolles voice caused cicely who was brooding apart to look up sharply and say  speak and be swift  my lady began the man in a slow voice i who am named basil in religion have fled the abbey because although a monk i am true to the king and moreover have suffered much from the abbot who has just returned raging having met with some reverse out lincoln way i know not what my news is that your lord sir christopher harflete and his servant jeffrey stokes are prisoners in the abbey dungeons whither they were brought last night by a company of the rebels who had captured them and afterwards rode on  prisoners exclaimed cicely then he is not dead or wounded at least he is whole and safe  aye my lady whole and safe as a mouse in the paws of a cat before it is eaten  the blood left cicelys cheeks in her minds eye she saw abbot maldon turned into a great cat with a monks head and patting christopher with his claws  my fault my fault she said in a heavy voice oh if i had not called him he would have escaped would that i had been stricken dumb  i dont think so answered brother basil there were others watching for him ahead who when he was taken went away and that is how you came to get through so neatly at least there he lies and if you would save him you had best gather what strength you can and strike at once  does he know that i live asked cicely  how can i tell lady the abbey dungeons are no good place for news yet the monk who took him his food this morning said that sir christopher told him that he had been undone by some ghost which called to him with the voice of his dead wife as he rode near kings grave mount  now when cicely heard this she rose and left the room accompanied by emlyn for she could bear no more  but jacob smith and bolle remained questioning the man closely upon many matters and having learned all he could tell them sent him away under guard and sat there till midnight consulting and making up their plans with the farmers and yeomen whom they called to them from time to time  next morning early they sought out cicely and told her that to them it seemed wise that the abbey should be attacked without delay  but my husband lies there she answered in distress and then they will kill him  so i fear they may if we do not attack replied jacob moreover lady to tell the truth there are other things to be thought of for instance the kings cause and honour which we are bound to forward and the lives and goods of all those who through us have declared themselves for him if we lie idle abbot maldon will send messengers to the north and within a few days bring down thousands upon us against whom we cannot hope to stand indeed it is probable that he has already sent but if they hear that the abbey has fallen the rebels will scarcely come for revenge alone lastly if we sit with folded hands our own people may grow cold with doubts and fears and melt away who now are hot as fire  if it must be so let it be in gods hands i leave his life said cicely in a heavy voice    that day the kings men under the captaincy of bolle advanced and invested the abbey setting their camp in blossholme village cicely who would not be left behind came with them and once more took up her quarters in the priory which on a formal summons opened its gates to her its only guard the deaf gardener surrendering at discretion he was set to work as a camp servant and never in his life did he labour so hard before since emlyn who owed him many a grudge saw to it that he did not lack for tasks that were mean and heavy  now that day thomas and others spied out the abbey and returned shaking their heads for without cannonand as yet they had nonethe great building of hewn stone seemed almost impregnable at but one spot indeed was attack possible from the back where once stood the dormers and farm steadings which emlyn had egged on thomas to burn these had been built up to the inner edge of the moat making as it were part of the abbey wall but the fierce fire had so cracked and crumbled their masonry that several rods of it had fallen forward into the water  for purposes of defence the gap this formed was now closed by a double palisade of stout stakes filled in with faggots the charred beams of the old buildings and other rubbish yet to carry this palisade protected as it was by the broad and deep moat and commanded from the windows and the corner tower was more than they dared try since if it could be done at all it would certainly cost them very many lives one thing they had learned however from the monk basil and others that in the abbey there was but small store of food to feed so many three days supply said basil and none put it at over four  that evening then they held another council at which it was determined to starve the place out and only attempt an onslaught if their spies reported to them that the rebels were marching to its relief  but urged cicely then my lord and jeffrey stokes will starve also whereon they went away sadly saying there was no choice seeing that they were but two men and the lives of many lay at stake  the siege began just such a siege as cicely had suffered at cranwell towers the first day the garrison of the abbey scoffed at them from the walls the second day they scoffed no longer noting that the force of the besiegers increased which it did hourly the third day suddenly they let down the drawbridge and poured out on to it as though for a sortie but when they perceived the scores of bolles men waiting bow in hand and arrow on string changed their minds and drew the bridge up again  they grow hungry and desperate said the shrewd jacob soon we shall have some message from them  he was right since just before sunset a postern gate was opened and a man holding a white flag above his head was seen swimming across the moat he scrambled out on the farther side shook himself like a dog and advanced slowly to where bolle and the women stood upon the abbey green out of arrowshot from the walls indeed cicely who was weak with dread and wretchedness leaned against the oaken stake that had never been removed to which once she was tied to be burned for witchcraft  who is that man said emlyn to her  cicely scanned the gaunt bearded figure who walked haltingly like one that is sick  i know notyes yes he puts me in mind of jeffrey stokes  jeffrey it is and no other said emlyn nodding her head now what news does he bear i wonder  cicely made no reply only clung to her stake and waited with just such a heart as once she had waited there while the abbey cook blew up his brands to fire her faggots jeffrey was opposite to her now his sunken eyes fell upon her and at the sight his bearded chin dropped making his face look even more long and hollow than it had before  ah he said speaking to himself many wars and journeyings months in an infidel galley three days with not enough food to feed a rat and a bath in november water well such things to say nothing of a worse turn mens brains yet to think that i should live to see a daylight ghost in homely blossholme who never met with one before  still staring he shook the water from his beard then added laybrother or captain thomas bolle whichever you may be nowadays if youre not a ghost also give me a quart of strong ale and a loaf of bread for im empty as a gutted herring and floating heavenward so to speak who would stick upon this scurvy earth  jeffrey jeffrey broke in cicely what news of your master emlyn tell him that we still live he does not understand  oh you still live do you he added slowly so the fire could not burn you after all or emlyn either well then theres hope for every one and perhaps hunger and abbot maldons knives cannot kill christopher harflete  he lives then and is well  he lives and is as well as a man may be after a three days fast in a black dungeon that is somewhat damp heres a writing on the matter for the captain of this company and taking a letter from the folds of the white flag in which it had been fastened he handed it to bolle who as he could not read passed it on to jacob smith just then a lad brought the ale for which jeffrey had asked and with it a platter of cold meat and bread on which he fell like a famished hound drinking in great gulps and devouring the food almost without chewing it  by the saints you are starved jeffrey said a yeoman who stood by come with me and shift those wet clothes of yours or you will take harm and he led him off still eating to a tent that stood near by  meanwhile jacob having studied the letter with bent and anxious brows read it aloud it ran thus   to the captain of the kings men from clement abbot of blossholme  by what warrant i know not you besiege us here threatening this abbey and its religious with fire and sword i am told that cicely foterell is your leader say then to that escaped witch that i hold the man she calls her husband and who is the father of her baseborn child a prisoner unless this night she disperses her troop and sends me a writing signed and witnessed promising indemnity on behalf of the king for me and those with me for all that we may have done against him and his laws or privately against her and freedom to go where we will without pursuit or hindrance or loss of land or chattels know that tomorrow at the dawn we put to death christopher harflete knight in punishment of the murders and other crimes that he has committed against us and in proof thereof his body shall be hung from the abbey tower if otherwise we will leave him unharmed here where you shall find him after we have gone for the rest ask his servant jeffrey stokes whom we send to you with this letter  clement abbot   jacob finished reading and a silence fell upon all who listened  let us go to some private place and consider this matter said emlyn  nay broke in cicely it is i who in my lords absence hold the kings commission and i will be heard thomas bolle first send a man under flag to the abbot saying that if aught of harm befalls sir christopher harflete ill put every living soul within the abbey walls to death by sword or rope and stand answerable for it to the king set it in writing master smith and send with it copy of the kings commission for my warrant at once let it be done at once  so they went to a cottage near by which bolle used as a guardhouse where this stern message was written down copied out fair signed by cicely and by bolle as captain with jacob smith for witness this paper together with a copy of the kings commissions cicely with her own hand gave to a bold and trusty man charged to ask an answer who departed carrying the white flag and wearing a steel shirt beneath his doublet for fear of treachery  when he had gone they sent for jeffrey who arrived clad in dry garments and still eating for his hunger was that of a wolf  tell us all said cicely  it will be a long story if i begin at the beginning lady when your worshipful father sir john and i rode away from shefton on the day of his murder  nay nay interrupted cicely that may stand we have no time my lord and you escaped from lincoln did you not and as we saw were taken in the forest  aye lady some tricksy spirit called out with your voice and he heard and pulled rein and so they came on to us and overwhelmed us though without hurt as it chanced then they brought us to the abbey and thrust us into that accursed dungeon where save for a little bread and water we have starved for three days in the dark that is all the tale  how then did you come out jeffrey  thus my lady something over an hour ago a monk and three guards unlocked the dungeon door while we blinked at his lantern like owls in the sunlight the monk said that the abbot purposed to send me to the camp of the kings party to offer christopher harfletes life against the lives of all of them he told him harflete also that he had brought ink and paper and that if he wished to save himself he would do well to write a letter praying that this offer might be accepted since otherwise he would certainly die at dawn  and what said my husband asked cicely leaning forward  what said he why he laughed in their faces and told them that first he would cut off his hand on this they haled me out of the dungeon roughly enough for i would have stayed there with him to the end but as the door closed he shouted after me tell the kings officers to burn this rats nest and take no heed of christopher harflete who desires to die  why does he desire to die asked cicely again  because he thinks his wife dead mistress as i did and believes that in the forest he heard her voice calling him to join her  oh god oh god moaned cicely i shall be his death  not so answered jeffrey do you know so little of christopher harflete that you think he would sell the kings cause to gain his own life why if you yourself came and pleaded with him he would thrust you away saying get thee behind me satan  i believe it and i am proud muttered cicely if need be let harflete die well keep his honour and our own lest he should live to curse us go on  well they led me to the abbot who gave me that letter which you have and bade me take it and tell the case to whoever commanded here then he lifted up his hand and laying it on the crucifix about his neck swore that this was no idle threat but that unless his terms were taken harflete should hang from the tower top at tomorrows dawn adding though i knew not what he meant i think youll find one yonder who will listen to that reasoning now he was dismissing me when a soldier said  is it wise to free this stokes you forget my lord abbot that he is alleged to have witnessed a certain slaying yonder in the forest and will bear evidence aye answered maldon i had forgotten who in this press remembered only that no other man would be believed still perhaps it would be best to choose a different messenger and to silence this fellow at once write down that jeffrey stokes a prisoner strove to escape and was killed by the guards in selfdefence take him hence and let me hear no more  now my blood went cold although i strove to look as careless as a man may on an empty stomach after three days in the dark and cursed him prettily in spanish to his face then as they were haling me off brother martindo you remember him he was our companion in some troubles overseasstepped forward out of the shadow and said of what use is it abbot to stain your soul with so foul a murder since john foterell died the king has many things to lay to your account and any one of them will hang you should you fall into his hands hell not hark back to foterells death if indeed you were to blame in that matter  you speak roughly brother answered the abbot and acts of war are not murder though perchance afterwards you might say they were to save your own skin or others might well if so theres wisdom in your words touch not the man give him the letter and thrust him into the moat to swim it his lies can make no odds in the count against us  well they did so and i came here as you saw to find you living and now i understand why maldon thought that harfletes life is worth so much and having done his tale once more jeffrey began to eat  cicely looked at him they all looked at himthis gaunt fierce man who after many other sorrows and strivings had spent three days in a black dungeon with the rats fed upon water and a few fingers of black bread yes with the crawling rats and another man so dear to one of them who still sat in that horrid hole waiting to be hung like a felon at the dawn the silence with only jeffreys munching to break it grew painful so that all were glad when the door opened and the messenger whom they had sent to the abbey appeared he was breathless having run fast and somewhat disturbed perhaps because two arrows were sticking in his back or rather in his jerkin for the mail beneath had stopped them  speak said old jacob smith what is your answer  look behind me master and you will find it replied the man they set a ladder across the moat and a board on that over which a priest tripped to take my writing i waited a while till presently i heard a voice hail me from the gateway tower and looking up saw abbot maldon standing there with a face like that of a black devil  hark you knave he said to me get you gone to the witch cicely foterell and to the recreant monk bolle whom i curse and excommunicate from the fellowship of holy church and tell them to watch for the first light of dawn for by it somewhat high up theyll see christopher harflete hanging black against the morning sky  on hearing this i lost my caution and hallooed back  if so ere tomorrows nightfall you shall keep him company every one of you black against the evening sky except those who go to be quartered at tower hill and tyburn then i ran and they shot at me hitting once or twice but though old the mail was good and here am i unhurt except for bruises    a while later cicely jacob smith thomas bolle jeffrey stokes and emlyn stower sat together taking counselvery earnest counsel for the case was desperate plan after plan was brought forward and set aside for this reason or for that till at length they stared at each other emptily  emlyn exclaimed cicely at last in past days you were wont to be full of comfortable words have you never a one in this extreme for all the while emlyn had sat silent  thomas said emlyn looking up do you remember when we were children where we used to catch the big carp in the abbey moat  aye woman he answered but what time is this for fishing stories of many years ago as i was saying of that tunnel underground there is no hope beyond the grove it is utterly caved in and blockedive tried it if we had a week perhaps  let her be broke in jacob she has something to tell us  and do you remember went on emlyn that you told me that there the carp were so big and fat because just at this place neath the drawbridge the abbey sewerthe big abbey sewer down which all foul things are pouredempties itself into the moat and that therefore i would eat none of those fish even in lent  aye i remember what of it  thomas did i hear you say that the powder you sent for had come  yes an hour ago six kegs by the carriers van of a hundredweight each not so much as we hoped for but something though as the cannon has not comefor the kings folk had noneit is of no use  a dark night a ladder with a plank on it a brick arched drain two hundredweight or better still four of powder set beneath the gate a slowmatch and a brave man to fire ittaken together with gods blessing these things might do much mused emlyn as though to herself  now at length they took her point  theyd be listening like a cat for a mouse said bolle  i think the wind rises she answered i hear it in the trees i think presently it will blow a gale also lanterns might be shown at the back where the breach is and men might shout there as though preparing to attack that would draw them off meanwhile jeffrey stokes and i would try our luck with the ladder and the kegs of powderhe to roll and i to fire when the time came for being as you have heard a witch i understand how to humour brimstone    ten minutes later and their plans were fixed two hours later and in the midst of a raving gale hidden by the pitchy darkness and the towering screen of the lifted drawbridge emlyn and the strong jeffrey rolled the kegs of powder over planks laid across the moat into the mouth of the big drain and twenty feet down it till they lay under the gateway towers then lying there in the stinking filth they drew the spigots out of holes that they had made in them and in their place set the slowmatches jeffrey struck a flint blew the tinder to a glow and handed it to emlyn  now get you gone she said i follow at this job one is better than two  a minute later she joined him on the farther bank of the moat run she said run for your life theres death behind  he obeyed but emlyn turned and screamed till hearing her through the gale all the guard hurried up the towers flashing lanterns to see what passed  storm storm she cried up with the ladders for the kind and harflete storm storm  then she too turned and fled    chapter xviii  out of the shadows  through the black night sudden and red there shot a sheet of fire illumining all things as lightning does above the roaring of the gale there echoed a dull and heavy noise like to that of muffled thunder then after a moments pause and silence the sky rained stones and with them the limbs of men  the gateways gone shouted a great voice it was that of bolle out with the ladders  men who were waiting ran up with them and thrust them four in all athwart the moat by the planks that were lashed along their staves they scrambled across and over the piles of shattered masonry into the courtyard beyond where none waited them for all who watched here were dead or maimed  light the lanterns shouted bolle again for it will be dark in yonder and a man who followed with a torch obeyed him  then they rushed across the courtyard to the door of the refectory which stood open here in the wide highroofed hall they met the mass of maldons people pouring back from the faggoted breach where they had been gathered expecting attack some of them also bearing lanterns for a moment the two parties stood staring at each other then followed a wild and savage scene with shouts and oaths and battlecries they fought furiously the massive oaken tables were overthrown by the red flicker of the poleborne lanterns men grappled and fell and slew each other upon the floor a priest struck down a yeoman with a brazen crucifix and next moment himself was brained with its broken shaft  for god and grace shouted some for the king and harflete answered others  keep line keep line roared bolle and sweep them out  the lanterns were dashed down and extinguished till but one remained a red and wavering star hoarse voices shouted for light for none knew friend from foe it came some one had fired the tapestries and the blaze ran up them to the roof then fearing lest they should be roasted the abbots folk gave way and fled to the farther door followed by their foes here it was that most of them fell for they jammed in the doorway and were cut down there are on the stair beyond  while bolle still plied his axe fiercely some one caught his arm and screamed into his ear  let be let be the wretch is sped  in his red wrath he turned to strike the speaker and saw by the flare that it was cicely  what do you here he cried get gone  fool she answered in a low fierce voice i seek my husband show me the path ere it be too late you know it alone come jeffrey stokes a lantern a lantern  jeffrey appeared sword in one hand and lantern in the other and with him emlyn who also held a sword which she had plucked from a fallen man emlyn still foul with the filth of the sewer and the mud of the moat  i may not leave muttered thomas bolle i seek maldon  on to the dungeons shrieked emlyn or i will stab you i heard them give word to kill harflete  then he snatched the light from jeffreys hand and crying follow me rushed along a passage till they came to an open door and beyond it to stairs they descended the stairs and passed other passages which ran underground till a sudden turn to the right brought them to a little walledin place with a vaulted roof two torches flared in iron holders in the masonry and by the light of them they saw a strange and fearful sight  at the end of the open place a heavy nailstudded door stood wide revealing a cell or rather a little cave beyondthose who are curious can see it to this day fastened by a chain to the wall of this dungeon was a man who held in his hand a threelegged stool and tugged at his chain like a maddened beast in front of him holding the doorway stood a tall lank priest his robe tucked up into his girdle he was wounded for blood poured from his shaven crown and he plied a great sword with both hands striking savagely at four men who tried to cut him down as bolle and his party appeared one of these men fell beneath the priests blows and another took his place shouting  out of the way traitor we would kill harflete not you  we die or live together murderers answered the priest in a thick gasping voice  at this moment one of them it was he who had spoken heard the sound of the rescuers footsteps and glanced back in an instant he turned and was running past them like a hare as he went the light from the lantern fell upon his face and emlyn knew it for that of the abbot she struck at him with the sword she held but the steel glanced from his mail he also struck but at the lantern dashing it to the ground  seize him screamed emlyn seize maldon jeffrey and at the words stokes bounded away only to return presently having lost him in the dark passages then with a roar bolle leaped upon the two remaining menatarms as they faced about and very soon between his axe and the sword of the priest behind they sank to the ground and died still fighting who knew they had no hope of quarter  it was over and done and dreadful silence fell upon the place the silence of the dead broken only by the heavy breathing of those who remained alive there the wounded monk leaned against the doorpost his red sword drooping to the floor there harflete the stool still lifted rested his weight against the chain and peered forward in amazement swaying as though from weakness and lastly there lay the three slain men one of whom still moved a little  cicely crept forward over the dead she went and past the priest till she stood face to face with the prisoner  come nearer and i will dash out your brains he said in a hoarse voice for such light as there was came from behind her whom he thought to be but another of the murderers  then at length she found her voice  christopher she cried christopher  he hearkened and the stool fell from his hand  the voice again he muttered well tis time tarry a while wife i come i come and he fell back against the wall shutting his eyes  she leapt to him and throwing her arms about him kissed his lips his poor bloodless lips the shut eyes opened  death might be worse he said but so i knew that we would meet  now emlyn seeing some change in his face snatched one of the torches from its iron and ran forward holding it so that the light fell full on cicely  oh christopher she cried i am no ghost but your living wife  he heard he stared he stared again then lifted his thin hand and stroked her hair  oh god he exclaimed the dead live and down he fell in a heap at her feet  they thrust cicely aside cicely who stood there shivering she who thought he had gone again and this time for ever with difficulty they broke the chain whereby he had been held like a kennelled hound and bore him still senseless up the long passages bolle going ahead as guard and jeffrey stokes following after behind them came emlyn supporting the wounded monk martin for it was he and no other who had saved the life of christopher  as they went up towards the stairs they heard a roaring noise  fire said cicely who knew that sound well and next instant the light of it burst upon them and its smoke wrapped them round the abbey was ablaze and its wide hall in front looked like the mouth of hell  did i not prophesy that it would be soyonder at cranwell burning asked emlyn with a fierce laugh  follow me shouted bolle be swift now ere the roof falls and traps us  on they went desperately leaving the hall on their left and well for them was it that thomas knew the way one little chamber through which they passed had already caught for flakes of fire fell among them from above and here the smoke was very thick they were through it who even a minute later could never have walked that path and lived they were through it and out into the open air by the cloister door which those who fled before them had left wide they reached the moat just where the breach had been mended with faggots and mounting on them bolle shouted till one of his own men heard him and dropped the bow that he had raised to shoot him as a rebel then planks and ladders were brought and at last they escaped from danger and the intolerable heat    thus it was that cicely who lost her love in fire in fire found him once again  for christopher was not dead as at first they feared they carried him to the priory and there emlyn having felt his heart and found that it still beat though faintly sent mother matilda to fetch some of that portugal wine of hers which commissioner legh had praised spoonful by spoonful she poured it down his throat till at length he opened his eyes though only to shut them again in natural sleep for the wine had taken a hold of his starved body and weakened brain for hour after hour cicely sat by him only rising from time to time to watch the burning of the great abbey church as once she had watched that of its dormers and farmsteading  about three in the morning the lead ceased to pour down in a silvery molten shower its roofs fell in and by dawn it was nothing but a fireblackened shell much as it remains today just before daybreak emlyn came to her saying  there is one who would speak with you  i cannot see him she answered i bide by my husband  yet you should said emlyn since but for him you would now have no husband the monk martin who held off the murderers is dying and desires to bid you farewell  then cicely went to find the man still conscious but fading away with the flow of his own blood which could not be stayed by any skill they had  i have come to thank you she murmured who knew not what else to say  thank me not he answered faintly pausing often between his words who did but strive to repay part of a great debt last winter i shared in awful sin in obedience not to my heart but to my vows i who was set to watch the body of your husband found that he lived and by my help he was borne away upon a ship that ship was taken by the infidels and afterwards he and i and jeffrey served together upon their galleys there i fell sick and your husband nursed me back to life it was i who brought you the deeds and wrote the letter which i gave to emlyn stower my vows still held me fast and i did no more this night i broke their bonds for when i heard the order given that he should be slain i ran down before the murderers and fought my best forgetting that i was a priest till at length you came let this atone my crimes against my country my king and you that i died for my friend at last as i am glad to do who find this worldtoo difficult  i will tell him if he lives sobbed cicely  he opened his eyes which had shut and answered  oh hell live hell live you have had many troubles but save for the creep of age and death they are over i can see and know  again he shut his eyes and the watchers thought that all was done till of a sudden once more he opened them and added in broken tones  the abbotshow him mercyif you can he is wicked and cruel but i have been his confessor and know his heart he strove for a good endby an evil road queen catherine was the kings lawful wife to seize the monasteries is shameless theft also his blood is not english he sees otherwise and serves the pope as i do and spain as i do not as i have helped you help him judge not that ye be not judged promise and he raised himself a little on the bed and looked at her earnestly  i promise answered cicely and as she spoke martin smiled then his face turned quite grey all the light went out of his eyes and a moment later emlyn threw a linen cloth over his head it was finished  cicely returned to christopher to find him sitting up in bed drinking a bowl of broth  oh my husband my husband she said casting her arms about him then she took her son and laid him upon his fathers breast   three days had gone by and christopher and cicely were walking in the shrubbery of shefton hall by now although still weak he was almost recovered whose only sickness had been grief and famine for which joy and plenty are wonderful medicines it was evening a pleasant and beautiful early winter evening just fading into night seated on a bench he had been telling her his adventures and they were a moving tale worthy as cicely wrote afterwards in a letter to old jacob smith that is still extant in her fine quaint handwriting to be recorded in a book though this it would seem was never done  he told her of the great fight on the ship great yarmouth when they were taken by the two turkish pirates and of how bravely father martin bore himself afterwards when they came to the galleys by good fortune martin jeffrey and he served on the same bench then martin fell sick of some southern fever and being in port at tunis at the time where they could get fruit they nursed him back to life and strength four months later the emperor charles attacked tunis and when it fell through gods mercy they were rescued with the other christian slaves after which martin returned to england taking old sir johns writings to be delivered to his next heir for they all believed cicely to be dead  but christopher and jeffrey having nothing to seek at home stayed to fight with the spaniards against the turks who had oppressed them so sorely when that war was over they made their way back to england not knowing where else to go and having a score to settle against the spanish abbot of blossholme andwell she knew the rest  aye answered cicely she knew it and never would forget it but it was chill for him sitting on that bench he must come in christopher laughed at her and answered  sweetheart if you could have seen the bench on which it was my lot to sit yonder off the coast of africa but new recovered from the wound which i had of maldons men at cranwell towers you would not be anxious for me here there for six long months chained to jeffrey and to father martin for it pleased those heathen devils to keep the three of us together perhaps that they might watch us better through the hot days that scorched us and the chill wet nights we laboured at our oars while infidel overseers ran up and down the boards and thrashed us with their whips of hide yes he added slowly they thrashed us as though we were oxen in a yoke you have seen the scars upon my back  oh god to think of it she murmured you a noble englishman beaten by those savage wretches like a brute how did you bear it christopher  i know not wife i think that had it not been for that angel in mans form the priest martinpeace be to his noble soulthat angel who thrice at least has saved my life i should have dashed out my brains against the thwarts or starved myself to death or provoked the moors to kill me i who thinking you dead had no hope to live for but martin taught me otherwise he preached patience and submission saying that i did not suffer for nothingof his own miseries he never spokeand that he was sure that fearful as was my lot all things worked together for good to me  and therefore it was that you lived on husband oh ill build a shrine to that saint martin  not altogether dear ill tell you true i lived for vengeancevengeance on clement maldon the man or the devil who wrought me all this ill and being yet young made me old with grief and pain and he pointed to his scarred forehead and the hair above that was now grizzled with white and vengeance too upon those worshippers of mohammed my masters yes though martin reproved me when i made confession to him i think it was for that i lived and the saints know he added grimly afterwards at the sack and elsewhere i took it on the turks oh you should have seen the last meeting of jeffrey and myself with the captain of that galley and his officers who had so often beaten us no i am glad you did not see it for it was fierce and bloody even the hardhearted spaniards stared  he paused and perhaps to change the current of his mindfor during all his afterlife when christopher brooded on these things he grew gloomy for hours and even dayscicely said hurriedly  i wonder what has chanced to our enemy the abbot the search has been close the roads are watched and we know that he had none with him for all his foreign soldiers are slain or taken i think he must be dead in the fire christopher  he shook his head  a devil does not die in fire he is away somewhere to plot fresh murdersperhaps our own and our boys oh he added savagely till my hands are about his throat and my dagger is in his heart theres no peace for me who have a score to pay and you both to guard  cicely knew not what to answer indeed when this mood was on him it was hard to reason with christopher who had suffered so fearfully and like herself been saved but by a miracle or the mandate of heaven  of a sudden a hush fell upon the place the blackbirds ceased their winter chatter in the laurels it grew so still that they heard a dead leaf drop to the ground the night was at hand one last red ray from the set sun struck across the frosty sky and was reflected to the earth in the light of that ray christophers trained eyes caught the gleam of something white that moved in the shadow of the beech tree where they sat like a tiger he sprang at it and the next moment haled out a man  look he said twisting the head of his captive so that the glow fell on it look i have the snake ah wife you saw nothing but i saw him and here he is at lastat last  the abbot gasped cicely  the abbot it was indeed but oh how changed his plump olivecoloured countenance had shrunk to that of a skeleton still covered by yellow skin in which the dark eyes rolled bloodshot and unnaturally large his tonsure and jaws showed a growth of stubbly grey hair his frame had become weak and small his soft and delicate hands resembled those of a woman dead of some wasting disease and like his garments were clogged with dirt the mail shirt he wore hung loose upon him one of his shoes was gone and the toes peeped through his stockinged foot he was but a living misery  deliver your arms growled christopher shaking him as a terrier shakes a rat or you die do you yield answer  how can he broke in cicely when you have him by the throat  christopher loosed his grip of the mans windpipe and instead seized his wrists whereon the abbot drew a great breath for he was almost choked and fell to his knees in weakness not in supplication  i came to you for mercy he said presently but having overheard your talk know that i can hope for none indeed why should i who showed none and whose great cause seems dead that cause for which i fought and lived let me die with it i ask no more still you are a gentleman and therefore i beg a favour of you do not hand me over to be drawn hanged and quartered by your bruteking kill me now you can say that i attacked you and that you did it in selfdefence i have no arms but you may set a dagger in my hand  christopher looked down at the poor creature huddled at his feet and laughed  who would believe me he asked though indeed who would question seeing that your life is forfeit to me or any who can take it yet that is a matter of which the kings justices shall judge  maldon shivered drawn hanged and quartered he repeated beneath his breath drawn hanged and quartered as a traitor to one i never served  why not asked christopher you have played a cruel game and lost  he made no answer indeed it was cicely who spoke saying  how came you in such a case we thought you fled  lady he answered ive starved for three days and nights in a hole in the ground like an earthedup fox a culvert in your garden hid me at last i crept out to see the light and die and heard you talking and thought that i would ask for mercy since mortal extremity has no honour  mercy said cicely of your treasons i say nothing for you are not english and serve your own king who years ago sent you here to plot against england but look on this man my husband did he not starve for three days and nights in your strong dungeon ere you came thither to massacre him did you not strive to burn him in his hall and ship him wounded across the seas to doom did you not send your assassin to kill my babe who stood between you and the wealth you needed for your plots and bind me the mother to the stakea food for fire did you not shoot down my father in the wood fearing lest he should prove you traitor and after rob me of my heritage did you not compel your monks to work evil and bring some of them to their deaths oh have done worm dressed up as gods priest how can you writhe there and ask for mercy  i said i came to seek for mercy because the agony of sleepless hunger drove me who now seek only death insult not the fallen cicely foterell but take the vengeance that is your due and kill replied the abbot looking up at her with his hollow eyes adding with a laugh that sounded like a groan come sir christopher you have got a sword and it is time you went to supper the air is cold your wifeif such she besaid it but now  cicely said christopher go to the hall and summon jeffrey stokes emlyn will know where to find him  emlyn groaned the abbot give me not over to emlyn shed torture me  nay said christopher this is not blossholme abbey though what may chance in london i know not go now wife  but cicely did not stir she only stared at the wretched creature at her feet  i bid you go repeated christopher  and ill not obey she answered do you remember what i promised martin ere he died  martin dead is martin who saved your husband dead exclaimed the abbot lifting his face and letting it fall again happy martin to be dead  i was not there and i am not bound by your promises cicely  but i am and you and i are one i vowed mercy to this man if he should fall into our power and mercy he shall have  then you spare him to destroy us the wheels go round quick in england wife  so be it what i vowed i vowed with god be the rest he has watched us well heretofore and i think she added with one of her bursts of triumphant faith will do so to the end abbot maldon sinful fallen abbot maldon you are as you were made and martin the saint said that there is good in your heart though you have shown none of it to me or mine now look you yonder is a wooden summerhouse thatched and warm get you there and ill send you food and wine and new clothing by one who will not talk also a pass to lincoln by tomorrows dawn you will be refreshed and then you will find a good horse tied to yonder tree and so away to sanctuary at lincoln and if aught of ill befalls you afterwards know it is not our doing but that of some other enemy or of god with whom i pray you make your peace may he forgive you as i do who knows all hearts which i do not now farewell nay say nothing there is nothing to be said come christopher for this once you obey me not i you  so they went and the wretched man raised himself upon his hands and looked after them but what passed in his heart at that moment none will ever learn    some months had gone by and blossholme with all the country round was once more at peace the tide of trouble had rolled away northward whence came rumours of renewed rebellion abbot maldon had been seen no more and for a while it was believed that although he never took sanctuary at lincoln he had done a wiser thing and fled to spain then emlyn who heard everything got news that this was not so but that he was foremost among those who stirred up sedition and war along the scottish border  i can well believe it said cicely the sow must to its wallowing in the mire nature made him a plotter and he will follow his heart to the end  ere long he may find it hard to follow his head answered emlyn grimly oh to think that you had that wolf caged and turned him loose again to prey on england and on us  i did but show mercy to the fallen nurse  mercy i call it madness why when jeffrey and thomas heard of it i thought they would burst with rage especially jeffrey who loved your father well and loved not the infidel galleys answered the fierce emlyn  vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord murmured cicely in a gentle voice  the lord also said that whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed why ive heard this maldon quote it to your husband at cranwell towers  so will it be emlyn if so it is to be only let others shed that cruel blood i would not have it on my hands or on those of any of my house for after all he is an ordained priest of my own faith moreover i had promised still talk not of the matter lest it should bring trouble on us all who had no right to loose him also these are ill thoughts for your wedding day go deck yourself in those fine clothes which jacob smith has sent from london since the clergyman will be at blossholme church by four and i think that thomas has waited long enough for you  emlyn smiled a little and shrugged her broad shoulders muttering something that would have angered thomas if he could have heard it as cicely went off to join christopher who called to her from another room  she found him adding up figures on paper a very different christopher to the broken man they had rescued from the dungeon though still much aged by the terrors of the past year and just now looking rueful  see sweet he said we should give a marriage portion to emlyn who has earned it if ever woman did but where it is to come from i know not those abbey lands jacob smith bought from the king are not yours yet nor henrys either though doubtless he will have them soon neither have any rents been paid to you from your own estates and when they come they are promised up in london while the abbots razor has shaved my own poor parsimony bare as a churchyard skull also mother matilda and her nuns must be kept till we can endow them with their lands again one day we or our boy yonder may be rich but till it comes there are hard times for all of us  not so hard as some we have known husband she answered laughing for at least we are free and have food to eat and for the rest we will borrow from jacob smith on the jewels that remain over indeed i have written to him and he will not refuse  aye but how about thomas and emlyn  they must do as their betters do though there is little stock on it thomas has the manor farm at low rent which he may pay when he can while jacob put a present in the pocket of emlyns wedding dress whats more i think he will make her his heir and if so she will be rich indeed so rich that i shall have to curtsey to her now go make ready for this marriage and as you have no fine doublet bid jeffrey put on your mail for you look best in that or so at least i think who to my mind look best in anything you chance to wear  then while he demurred saying that there was now no need to bear arms in blossholme also that jeffrey was away settling himself as landlord of the ford inn the same that the abbot had once promised to flounder megges she kissed him and seizing her boy who lay crowing in the sunlight danced with him from the room for oh cicelys heart was merry    there were many folk at the marriage of emlyn stower and thomas bolle for of late blossholme had been but a sorry place and this wedding came to it like the breath of spring to the woods and meads around a hint of happiness after the miseries of winter the story of the pair had got about also how they had been pledged in youth and separated by scheming men for their own purposes how emlyn had been married off against her will to an aged partner whom she hated and thomas who was set down as a fool forced to serve the monastery as a laybrother a strong hind skilled in the management of cattle and such matters but half crazy as indeed it had suited him to feign himself to be  people knew the end of the thing also that emlyn had cursed the abbot and that her curse had been fulfilled that thomas bolle had shaken off his superstitious fears and risen up against him and at last been given the commission of the king and as his graces officer shown himself no fool but a man of mettle who had taken the abbey by storm and rescued sir christopher harflete from its dungeons emlyn also like her mistress had been bound to the stake as a witch and saved from burning by this same thomas who with her had been concerned in many remarkable events whereof the countryside was full of tales true or false now at last after all these adventures they came together to be wed and who was there for ten miles round that would not see it done  the monks being gone father roger necton the old vicar of cranwell he who had united christopher and his wife cicely in strange circumstances and for that deed been obliged to fly for his life when the last abbot of blossholme burned cranwell towers came to tie the knot before his great congregation notwithstanding that they were both of middle age emlyn in her grand gown and the brawny redhaired thomas in his yeomans garb of green such as he had worn when he wooed her many years before he put on the monks russet robe made a fine and handsome pair at the altar or so folk thought though some friend of the monks remembering bolles devils livery and emlyns repute as a sorceress cried out from the shadow that satan was marrying a witch and for his pains got his head broken by jeffrey stokes  so the whitehaired and gentle father necton having first read the kings order releasing thomas from his vows tied them fast according to the ancient rites and blessed them both at length it was finished and the pair walked from the old church to the manor farm where they were to dwell followed as was the custom by a company of their friends and wellwishers as they went they passed through a little stretch of woodland by the stream where on this spring day the wild daffodils and lilies of the valley were abloom making sweet the air here emlyn paused a moment and said to her husband captain bolle  do you remember this place  aye wife he answered it was here that we plighted our troth in youth and looked up to see maldon passing us just beyond that same oak and felt the shadow of him strike cold to our hearts you spoke of it yonder in the priory chapel when i came up by the secret way and its memory made me mad  yes thomas i spoke of it answered emlyn in a rich and gentle voice a new voice to him well now let its memory make you happy as notwithstanding all my faults i will if i can and swiftly she bent towards him and kissed him adding come on husband they press behind us and i hope that we have done with perils and plottings  amen answered bolle and as he spoke certain strange men who wore the kings colours and carried a long ladder went by them at a distance wondering what was their business at blossholme the pair passed through the last of the woodland and reached the rise whence they could see the gaunt skeleton of the burntout abbey that appeared within fifty paces of them at this they paused to look and presently were joined there by christopher and cicely mother matilda and her good nuns jeffrey stokes and others the place seemed grim and desolate in the evening light and all of them stood staring at it filled with their separate thoughts  what is that said cicely with a start pointing to a round black object new set over the ruin of the gateway tower  just then a red ray from the sunset struck upon the thing  it was the severed head of clement maldon the spaniard
