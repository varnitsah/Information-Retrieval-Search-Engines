  xxv witham rides away    xxvi reinstation     the impostor     chapter i  rancher witham   it was a bitter night for although there was no snow as yet the frost had bound the prairie in its iron grip when rancher witham stood shivering in a little canadian settlement in the great lonely land which runs north from the american frontier to athabasca there was no blink of starlight in the murky sky and a stinging wind that came up out of the great waste of grass moaned about the frame houses clustering beside the trail that led south over the limited levels to the railroad and civilization it chilled witham through his somewhat tattered furs and he strode up and down glancing expectantly into the darkness and then across the unpaved street where the ruts were ploughed a foot deep in the prairie sod towards the warm red glow from the windows of the wooden hotel he knew that the rest of the outlying farmers and ranchers who had ridden in for their letters were sitting snug about the stove but it was customary for all who sought shelter there to pay for their share of the six oclock supper and the halfdollar witham had then in his pocket was required for other purposes  he had also retained through all his struggles a measure of his pride and because of it strode up and down buffeted by the blasts until a beat of horsehoofs came out of the darkness and was followed by a rattle of wheels it grew steadily louder a blinking ray of brightness flickered across the frame houses and presently dark figures were silhouetted against the light on the hotel veranda as a lurching wagon drew up beneath it two dusky objects shapeless in their furs sprang down and one stumbled into the post office close by with a bag while the other man answered the questions hurled at him as he fumbled with stiffened fingers at the harness  late well you might be thankful youve got your mail at all he said we had to go round by willow bluff and didnt think wed get through the ford ice an inch thick anyway and charley talked that much hes not said anything since even when the near horse put his foot into a badger hole  rude banter followed this but witham took no part in it hastening into the post office he stood betraying his impatience by his very impassiveness while a sallowfaced woman tossed the letters out upon the counter at last she took up two of them and the mans fingers trembled a little as he stretched out his hand when she said  thats all there are for you  witham recognized the writing on the envelopes and it was with difficulty he held his eagerness in check but other men were waiting for his place and he went out and crossed the street to the hotel where there was light to read by as he entered it a girl bustling about a long table in the big stovewarmed room turned with a little smile  its only you she said now i was figuring it was lance courthorne  witham impatient as he was stopped and laughed for the hotelkeepers daughter was tolerably wellfavoured and a friend of his  and youre disappointed he said i havent lances good looks or his ready tongue  the room was empty for the guests were thronging about the post office then and the girls eyes twinkled as she drew back a pace and surveyed the man there was nothing in his appearance that would have aroused a strangers interest or attracted more than a passing glance and he stood before her in a very old fur coat with a fur cap that was in keeping with it in his hand his face had been bronzed almost to the colour of a blackfoot indians by frost and wind and sun and it was of english type from the crisp fair hair above the broad forehead to the somewhat solid chin the mouth was hidden by the bronzetinted moustache and the eyes alone were noticeable they were grey and there was a steadiness in them which was almost unusual even in that country where men look into long distances for the rest he was of average stature and stood impassively straight looking down upon the girl without either grace or awkwardness while his hard brown hands suggested as his attire did strenuous labour for a very small reward  well said the girl with western frankness theres a kind of stamp on lance that you havent got i figure he brought it with him from the old country still one might take you for him if you stood with the light behind you and youre not quite a badlooking man its a kind of pity youre so solemn  witham smiled i dont fancy thats astonishing after losing two harvests in succession he said you see theres nobody back there in the old country to send remittances to me  the girl nodded with quick sympathy oh yes the times are bad she said well you read your letters im not going to worry you  witham sat down and opened the first envelope under the big lamp it was from a land agent and mortgagebroker and his face grew a trifle grimmer as he read in the present condition of the money market your request that we should carry you over is unreasonable and we regret that unless you can extinguish at least half the loan we will be compelled to foreclose upon your holding  there was a little more of it but that was sufficient for witham who knew it meant disaster and it was with the feeling of one clinging desperately to the last shred of hope he tore open the second envelope the letter it held was from a friend he had made in a western city and once entertained for a month at his ranch but the man had evidently sufficient difficulties of his own to contend with  very sorry but it cant be done he wrote im loaded up with wheat nobody will buy and couldnt raise five hundred dollars to lend any one just now  witham sighed a little but when he rose and slowly straightened himself nobody would have suspected he was looking ruin in the face he had fought a slow losing battle for six weary years holding on doggedly though defeat appeared inevitable and now when it had come he bore it impassively for the struggle which though he was scarcely twentysix had crushed all mirth and brightness out of his life had given him endurance in place of them just then a man came bustling towards him with the girl who bore a tray close behind  what are you doing with that coat on he said get it off and sit down right there the boys are about through with the mail and suppers ready  witham glanced at the steaming dishes hungrily for he had passed most of the day in the bitter frost eating very little and there was still a drive of twenty miles before him  it is time i was taking the trail he said  he was sensible of a pain in his left side which as other men have discovered not infrequently follows enforced abstinence from food but he remembered what he wanted the halfdollar in his pocket for the hotelkeeper had possibly some notion of the state of affairs for he laughed a little  youve got to sit down he said now after the way you fixed me up when i stopped at your ranch you dont figure id let you go before you had some supper with me  witham may have been unduly sensitive but he shook his head youre very good but its a long ride and im going now he said goodnight nettie  he turned as he spoke with the swift decision that was habitual with him and when he went out the girl glanced at her father reproachfully  you always get spoiling things when you put your hand in she said now that mans hungry and id have fixed it so hed have got his supper if you had left it to me  the hotelkeeper laughed a little im kind of sorry for witham because theres grit in him and hes never had a show he said still i figure hes not worth your going out gunning after nettie  the girl said nothing but there was a little flush in her face which had not been there before when she busied herself with the dishes  in the meanwhile witham was harnessing two bronco horses to a very dilapidated wagon they were vicious beasts but he had bought them cheap from a man who had some difficulty in driving them while the wagon had been given him when it was apparently useless by a neighbour the team had however already covered thirty miles that day and started homewards at a steady trot without the playful kicking they usually indulged in here and there a man sprang clear of the rutted road but witham did not notice him or return his greeting he was abstractedly watching the rude frame houses flit by and wondering while the pain in his side grew keener when he would get his supper for it happens not infrequently that the susceptibilities are dulled by a heavy blow and the victim finds a distraction that is almost welcome in the endurance of a petty trouble  witham was very hungry and weary alike in body and mind the sun had not risen when he left his homestead and he had passed the day under a nervous strain hoping although it seemed improbable that the mail would bring him relief from his anxieties now he knew the worst he could bear it as he had borne the loss of two harvests and the disaster which followed in the wake of the blizzard that killed off his stock but it seemed unfair that he should endure cold and hunger too and when one wheel sank in a rut and the jolt shook him in every stiffened limb he broke out with a hoarse expletive it was his first protest against the fate that was too strong for him and almost as he made it he laughed  pshaw theres no use kicking against what has to be and ive got to keep my head just now he said  there was no great comfort in the reflection but it had sustained him before and withams head was a somewhat exceptional one though there was as a rule nothing in any way remarkable about his conversation and he was apparently merely one of the many quietlyspoken bronzefaced men who are even by their blunders building up a great future for the canadian dominion he accordingly drew his old rug tighter round him and instinctively pulled his fur cap lower down when the lights of the settlement faded behind him and the creaking wagon swung out into the blackness of the prairie it ran back league beyond league across three broad provinces and the wind that came up out of the great emptiness emphasized its solitude a man from the cities would have heard nothing but the creaking of the wagon and the drumming fall of hoofs but witham heard the grasses patter as they swayed beneath the bitter blasts stiff with frost and the moan of swinging boughs in a faroff willow bluff it was these things that guided him for he had left the rutted trail and here and there the swishen beneath the wheels told of taller grass while the bluff ran black athwart the horizon when that had gone then twigs crackled beneath them as the horses picked their way amidst the shadowy trees stunted by a ceaseless struggle with the wind and witham shook the creeping drowsiness from him when they came out into the open again for he knew it is not advisable for any man with work still to do to fall asleep under the frost of that country  still he grew a trifle dazed as the miles went by and because of it indulged in memories he had shaken off at other times they were blurred recollections of the land he had left eight years ago pictures of sheltered england halfforgotten music the voices of friends who no longer remembered him and the smiles in a girls bright eyes then he settled himself more firmly in the drivingseat and with numbed fingers sought a tighter grip of the reins as the memory of the girls soft answer to a question he had asked brought his callow ambitions back  he was to hew his way to fortune in the west and then come back for her but the girl who had clung to him with wet cheeks when he left her had apparently grown tired of waiting and witham sent back her letters in return for a silverprinted card that was six years ago and now none of the dollars he had brought into the country remained to him he realized dispassionately and without egotism that this was through no fault of his for he knew that better men had been crushed and beaten  it was however time he had done with these reflections for while he sat halfdazed and more than halffrozen the miles had been flitting by and now the team knew they were not very far from home little by little their pace increased and witham was almost astonished to see another bluff black against the night ahead of him as usual in that country the willows and birches crawled up the sides and just showed their heads above the sinuous crest of a river hollow it was very dark when the wagon lurched in among them and it cost the man an effort to discern the winding trail which led down into the blackness of the hollow in places the slope was almost precipitous and it behoved him to be careful of the horses which could not be replaced without them he could not plough in spring and his life did not appear of any especial value in comparison with theirs just then  the team however were evidently bent on getting home as soon as possible and withams fingers were too stiff to effectively grasp the reins a swinging bough also struck one of the horses and when it plunged and flung up its head the man reeled a little in his seat before he recovered the team were going downhill at a gallop witham flung himself bodily backwards with tense muscles and the reins slipping a trifle in his hands knowing that though he bore against them with all his strength the team were leaving the trail then the wagon jolted against a tree one horse stumbled picked up its stride and went on at a headlong gallop the man felt the wind rush past him and saw the dim trees whirl by but he could only hold on and wonder what would take place when they came to the bottom the bridge the trail went round by was some distance to the right and because the frost had just set in he knew the ice on the river would not bear the load even if the horses could keep their footing  he had not however long to wonder once more a horse stumbled there was a crash and a branch hurled witham backwards into the wagon which came to a standstill suddenly when he rose something warm was running down his face and there was a red smear on the hand he lighted the lantern with when that was done he flung himself down from the wagon dreading what he would find the flickering radiance showed him that the pole had snapped and while one bronco still stood trembling on its feet the other lay inert amidst a tangle of harness the mans face grew a trifle grimmer as he threw the light upon it and then stooping glanced at one doubled leg it was evident that fate which did nothing by halves had dealt him a crushing blow the last faint hope he clung to had vanished now  he was however a humane man and considerate of the beasts that worked for him and accordingly thrust his hand inside the old fur coat when he had loosed the uninjured horse and drew out a longbladed knife then he knelt and setting down the lantern felt for the place to strike when he found it his courage almost deserted him and meeting the eyes that seemed to look up at him with dumb appeal turned his head away still he was a man who would not shirk a painful duty and shaking off the sense of revulsion turned again and stroked the beasts head  its all i can do for you he said  then his arm came down and a tremor ran through the quivering frame while witham set his lips tightly as his hand grew warm the thing was horrible to him but the life he led had taught him the folly of weakness and he was too pitiful to let his squeamishness overcome him  still he shivered when it was done and rubbing the knife in the withered leaves rose and made shift to gird a rug about the uninjured horse then he cut the reins and tied them and mounting without stirrups rode towards the bridge the horse went quietly enough now and the man allowed it to choose its way he was going home to find shelter from the cold because his animal instincts prompted him but otherwise almost without volition in a state of dispassionate indifference nothing more he fancied could well befall him     chapter ii  lance courthorne   it was late when witham reached his logbuilt house but he set out once more with his remaining horse before the lingering daylight crept out of the east to haul the wagon home he also spent most of the day in repairing it because occupation of any kind that would keep him from unpleasant reflections appeared advisable and to allow anything to fall out of use was distasteful to him although as the wagon had been built for two horses he had little hope of driving it again it was a bitter grey day with a low smoky sky and seemed very long to witham but evening came at last and he was left with nothing between him and his thoughts  he lay in a dilapidated chair beside the stove and the little bare room through which its pipe ran was permeated with the smell of fresh shavings hot iron and the fumes of indifferent tobacco a carpenters bench ran along one end of it and was now occupied by a new wagon pole the man had fashioned out of a slender birch a marlin rifle an axe and a big saw hung beneath the head of an antelope on the wall above the bench and all of them showed signs of use and glistened with oil opposite to them a few shelves were filled with simple crockery and cooking utensils and these also shone spotlessly there was a pair of knee boots in one corner with a patch partly sewn on to one of them and the harness in another showed traces of careful repair a bookcase hung above them and its somewhat tattered contents indicated that the man who had chosen and evidently handled them frequently possessed tastes any one who did not know that country would scarcely have expected to find in a prairie farmer a table and one or two rude chairs made by their owners hands completed the furniture but while all hinted at poverty it also suggested neatness industry and care for the room bore the impress of its occupiers individuality as rooms not infrequently do  it was not difficult to see that he was frugal though possibly from necessity rather than taste not sparing of effort and had a keen eye for utility and if that suggested the question why with such capacities he had not attained to greater comfort the answer was simple witham had no money and the seasons had fought against him he had done his uttermost with the means at his disposal and now he knew he was beaten  a doleful wind moaned about the lonely building and set the roof shingles rattling overhead now and then the stove crackled or the lamp flickered and any one unused to the prairie would have felt the little loghouse very desolate and lonely there was no other human habitation within a league only a great waste of whitened grass relieved about the homestead by the raw clods of the fall ploughing for while his scattered neighbours for the most part put their trust in horses and cattle witham had been among the first to realize the capacities of that land as a wheatgrowing country  now clad in wellworn jean trousers and an old deerskin jacket he looked down at the bundle of documents on his knee accounts unpaid a bankers intimation that no more cheques would be honoured and a mortgage deed they were not pleasant reading and the mans face clouded as he pencilled notes on some of them but there was no weakness or futile protest in it defeat was plain between the lines of all he read but he was going on stubbornly until the struggle was ended as others of his kind had done there at the western limit of the furrows of the plough and in the great province further east which is one of the worlds granaries they went under and were forgotten but they showed the way and while their guerdon was usually six feet of prairie soil the wheatfields mills and railroads came for it is written plainly on the new northwest that no man may live and labour for himself alone and there are many who realizing it instinctively ask very little and freely give their best for the land that but indifferently shelters them  presently however there was a knocking at the door and though this was most unusual witham only quietly moved his head when a bitter blast came in and a man wrapped in furs stood in the opening  ill put my horse in the stable while ive got my furs on its a bitter night he said  witham nodded you know where the lantern is he said theres some chop in the manger and you neednt spare the oats in the bin at present prices it doesnt pay to haul them in  the man closed the door silently and it was ten minutes before he returned and sloughing off his furs dropped into a chair beside the stove i got supper at broughtons and dont want anything but shelter tonight he said shake that pipe out and try one of these instead  he laid a cigar case on the table and though well worn it was of costly make with a good deal of silver about it while witham who lighted one knew that the cigars were good he had no esteem for his visitor but men are not censorious upon the prairie and western hospitality is always free  where have you come from courthorne he said quietly  the other man laughed a little the long trail he said the dakotas colorado montana cleaned up one thousand dollars at regent and might have got more but some folks down there seemed tired of me the play was quite regular but they have apparently been getting virtuous lately  and now said witham with polite indifference  courthorne made a little gesture of deprecation  im back again with the rustlers  withams nod signified comprehension for the struggle between the great rangeholders across the frontier and the smaller settlers who with legal right invaded their cattle runs was just over it had been fought out bitterly with dynamite and rifles and when at last with the aid of the united states cavalry peace was made sundry broken men and mercenaries who had taken the pay of both parties seeing their occupation gone had found a fresh scope for their energies in smuggling liquor and on opportunity transferring cattle without their owners sanction across the frontier that was then a prohibition country and the profits and risks attached to supplying it and the blackfeet on the reserves with liquor were heavy  business this way said witham  courthorne appeared to consider a moment and there was a curious little glint which did not escape his companions attention in his eyes but he laughed  yes were making a big run he said then stopped and looked straight at the rancher did it ever strike you witham that you were not unlike me  witham smiled but made a little gesture of dissent as he returned the others gaze they were about the same height and had the same english type of face while withams eyes were grey and his companions an indefinite blue that approached the former colour but there the resemblance which was not more than discernible ended witham was quietlyspoken and somewhat grim a plain prairie farmer in appearance while a vague but recognizable stamp of breeding and distinction still clung to courthorne he would have appeared more in place in the states upon the southern atlantic seaboard where the characteristics the cavalier settlers brought with them are not extinct than he did upon the canadian prairie his voice had even in his merriment a little imperious ring his face was refined as well as sensual and there was a languid gracefulness in his movements and a hint of pride in his eyes they however lacked the steadiness of withams and there were men who had seen the wild devil that was born in courthorne look out of them witham knew him as a pleasant companion but surmised from stories he had heard that there were men and more women who bitterly rued the trust they had placed in him  no he said dryly i scarcely think i am like you although only last night nettie at the settlement took me for you you see the kind of life ive led out here has set its mark on me and my folks in the old country were distinctly middleclass people there is something in heredity  courthorne did not parry the unexpressed question oh yes he said with a little sardonic smile i know the backbone of the nationsolemn virtuous and slow youre like them but my folks were different as you surmise i dont think they had many estimable qualities from your point of view but if they all didnt go quite straight they never went slow and they had a few prejudices which is why i found it advisable to leave the old country still ive had my fill of all that life can offer most folks out here while you scarcely seem to have found virtue pay you they told me at the settlement things were bad with you  witham who was usually correct in his deductions surmised that his companion had an object and expected something in return for this confidence there was also no need for reticence when every farmer in the district knew all about his affairs while something urged him to follow courthornes lead  yes he said quietly they are you see when i lost my cattle in the blizzard i had to sell out or mortgage the place to the hilt and during the last two years i havent made the interest the loan falls due in august and theyre going to foreclose on me  then said courthorne what is keeping you here when the result of every hours work you put in will go straight into anothers mans pocket  witham smiled a little in the first place ive nowhere else to go and theres something in the feeling that one has held on to the end besides until a few days ago i had a vague hope that by working double tides i might get another crop in somebody might have advanced me a little on it because the mortgage only claims the house and land  courthorne looked at him curiously no we are not alike he said theres a slow stubborn devil in you witham and i think id be afraid of you if i ever did you an injury but go on  theres very little more my team ran away down the ravine and i had to put one beast out of its misery i cant do my ploughing with one horse and that leaves me stranded for the want of the dollars to buy another with its usually a very little thing that turns the scale but now the end has come i dont know that im sorry ive never had a good time you see and the struggle was slowly crushing the life out of me  witham spoke quietly without bitterness but courthorne who had never striven at all but stretched out his hand and taken what was offered the more willingly when it was banned alike by judicial and moral law dimly understood him he was a fearless man but he knew his courage would not have been equal to the strain of that six years struggle against loneliness physical fatigue and adverse seasons during which disaster followed disaster he looked at the bronzed farmer as he said still you would do a little in return for a hundred dollars that would help you to go on with the fight  a faint sparkle crept into withams eyes it was not hope but rather the grim anticipation of the man offered a better weapon when standing with his back to the wall  yes he said slowly i would do almost anything  even if it was against the law  witham sat silent for almost a minute but there was no indecision in his face which slightly perplexed courthorne yes he said though i kept it while i could the law was made for the safeguarding of prosperous men but with such as i am it is every man for his own hand and the devil to care for the vanquished still there is a reservation  courthorne nodded its unlawful but not against the unwritten code  well said witham quietly when you tell me what you want i should have a better opinion  courthorne laughed a little though there was something unpleasant in his eyes when i first came out to this country i should have resented that he said now it seems to me that im putting too much in your hands if i make the whole thing clear before you commit yourself in any way  witham nodded in fact you have got to trust me you can do so safely  the assurance of the guileless is astonishing and occasionally hard to bear said courthorne why not reverse the position  withams gaze was steady and free from embarrassment i am he said waiting for your offer  then said courthorne dryly here it is we are running a big load through to the northern settlements and the reserves tomorrow and while theres a good deal of profit attached to the venture i have a notion that sergeant stimson has had word of it now the sergeant knows just how i stand with the rustlers though he can fasten no charge on me and he will have several of his troopers looking out for me well i want one of them to see and follow me south along the montana trail theres no horse in the government service can keep pace with that black of mine but it would not be difficult to pull him and just keep the trooper out of carbine shot behind when he finds he cant overtake the black hell go off for his comrades and the boys will run our goods across the river while theyre picking up the trail  you mentioned the horse but not yourself said witham quietly  courthorne laughed yes he said i will not be there im offering you one hundred dollars to ride the black for me you can put my furs on and anybody who saw you and knew the horse would certify it was me  and where will you be  here said courthorne dryly the boys will have no use for me until they want a guide but theyll leave an unloaded packhorse handy and as it wouldnt suit any of us to make my connexion with them too plain it will be a night or two later when i join them in the meanwhile your parts quite easy no trooper could ride you down unless you wanted him to and youll ride straight on to montanaive a route marked out for you youll stop at the places i tell you and the testimony of anybody who saw you on the black would be quite enough to clear me if stimsons men are too clever for the boys  witham sat still a moment and it was not avarice which prompted him when he said considering the risk one hundred dollars is very little  of course said courthorne still it isnt worth any more to me and there will be your expenses if it doesnt suit you i will do the thing myself and find the boys another guide  he spoke indifferently but witham was not a fool and knew that he was lying  turn your face to the light he said sharply  a little ominous glint became visible in courthornes eyes and there was just a trace of darker colour in his forehead but witham saw it and was not astonished still courthorne did not move  what made you ask me that he said  witham watched him closely but his voice betrayed no special interest as he said i fancied i saw a mark across your cheek it seemed to me that it had been made by a whip  the deeper tint was more visible on courthornes forehead where the swollen veins showed a trifle and he appeared to swallow something before he spoke arent you asking too many questions what has a mark on my face to do with you  nothing said witham quietly will you go through the conditions again  courthorne nodded i pay you one hundred dollarsnow he said you ride south tomorrow along the montana trail and take the risk of the troopers overtaking you you will remain away a fortnight at my expense and pass in the meanwhile for me then you will return at night as rancher witham and keep the whole thing a secret from everybody  witham sat silent and very still again for more than a minute he surmised that the man who made the offer had not told him all and there was more behind but that was after all of no great importance he was prepared to do a good deal for one hundred dollars and his bare life of effort and selfdenial had grown almost unendurable he had now nothing to lose and while some impulse urged him to the venture he felt that it was possible fate had in store for him something better than he had known in the past in the meanwhile the cigar he held went out and the striking of a match as courthorne lighted another roused him suddenly from the retrospect he was sinking into the bitter wind still moaned about the ranch emphasizing its loneliness and the cedar shingles rattled dolefully overhead while it chanced that as witham glanced towards the roof his eyes rested on the suspended piece of rancid pork which with a little flour and a few potatoes had during the last few months provided him with a sustenance it was of course a trifle but it tipped the beam as trifles often do and the man who was tired of all it symbolized straightened himself with a little mirthless laugh  on your word of honour there is nothing beyond the risk of a few days detention which can affect me he said  no said courthorne solemnly knowing that he lied on my honour the troopers could only question you is it a deal  yes said witham simply stretching out his hand for the roll of bills the other flung down on the table and while one of the contracting parties knew that the other would regret it bitterly the bargain was made  then courthorne laughed in his usual indolent fashion as he said well its all decided and i dont even ask your word tomorrow will see the husk sloughed off and for a fortnight youll be lance courthorne i hope you feel equal to playing the rôle with credit because i wouldnt entrust my good fame to everybody  witham smiled dryly i fancy i shall he said and long afterwards recalled the words you see i had ambitions in my callow days and its not my fault that hitherto ive never had a part to play  rancher witham was however wrong in this he had played the part of an honest man with a courage which had brought him to ruin but there was now to be a difference     chapter iii  trooper shannons quarrel   there was bitter frost in the darkness outside when two young men stood talking in the stables of a little outpost lying a long ride back from the settlement in the lonely prairie one leaned against a manger with a pipe in his hand while the spotless softlygleaming harness hung up behind him showed what his occupation had been the other stood bolt upright with lips set and a faint greyness which betokened strong emotion showing through his tan the lantern above them flickered in the icy draughts and from out of the shadows beyond its light came the stamping of restless horses and the smell of prairie hay which is pungent with the odours of wild peppermint  the two lads and they were very little more were friends in spite of the difference in their upbringing for there are few distinctions between caste and caste in that country where manhood is still esteemed the greatest thing and the primitive virtues count for more than wealth or intellect courage and endurance still command respect in the new northwest and that both the lads possessed them was made evident by the fact that they were troopers of the northwest police a force of splendid cavalry whose duty it is to patrol the wilderness at all seasons and in all weathers under scorching sun and in blinding snow  the men who keep the peace of the prairie are taught what heat and thirst are when they ride in couples through a desolate waste wherein there is only bitter water parched by pitiless sunrays and whitened by the intolerable dust of alkali they also discover just how much cold the human frame can endure when they lie down with only the stars above them long leagues from the nearest outpost in a trench scooped in the snow and they know how near one may come to suffocation and yet live through the grassfires blinding smoke it happens now and then that two who have answered to the last roster in the icy darkness do not awaken when the lingering dawn breaks across the great white waste and only the coyote knows their restingplace but the watch and ward is kept and the lonely settler dwells as safe in the wilderness as he would in an english town  trooper shannon was an irishman from the bush of ontario trooper payne english and a scion of a somewhat distinguished family in the old country but while he told nobody why he left it suddenly nobody thought of asking him he was known to be a bold rider and careful of his beast and that was sufficient for his comrades and the keeneyed sergeant stimson he glanced at his companion thoughtfully as he said she was a pretty girl you knew her in ontario  shannons hands trembled a little sure he said larrys place was just a mile beyont our clearing an there was never a bonnier thing than ailly blake came out from the old countrybut is it need there is for talking when yeve seen her there was once i watched her smile at ye with the black eyes that would have melted the heart out of any man waking and sleeping theyre with me still  three generations of the shannons had hewn the lonely clearing further into the bush of ontario and married the daughters of the soil but the celtic strain it was evident had not run out yet payne however came of english stock and expressed himself differently  it was ashame he said of course he flung her over i think you saw him pat  shannons face grew greyer and he quivered visibly as his passion shook him while payne felt his own blood pulse faster as he remembered the graceful darkeyed girl who had given him and his comrade many a welcome meal when their duty took them near her brothers homestead that was however before one black day for ailly and larry blake when lance courthorne also rode that way  yes said the lad from ontario i was driving in for the stores when i met him in the willow bluff an courthorne pulls his divil of a black horse up with a little ugly smile on the lips of him when i swung the wagon right across the trail  thats not civil trooper says he  im wanting a word says i with the black hate choking me at the sight of him what have ye done with ailly  is it anything to you says he  its everything says i and if ye will not tell me ill tear it out of ye  courthorne laughs a little but i saw the divil in his eyes i dont think youre quite man enough says he sitting very quiet on the big black horse anyway i cant tell you where she is just now because she left the dancing saloon she was in down in montana when i last saw her  i had the big whip that day and i forgot everything as i heard the hiss of it round my shoulder it came home across the ugly face of him and then i flung it down and grabbed the carbine as he swung the black round with one hand fumbling in his jacket it came out empty an we sat there a moment the two of us courthorne white as death his eyes like burning coals and the fingers of me trembling on the carbine sorrow on the man that he hadnt a pistol or id have sent the black soul of him to the divil it came from  the lad panted and payne who had guessed at his hopeless devotion to the girl who had listened to courthorne made a gesture of disapproval that was tempered by sympathy it was for her sake he fancied shannon had left the ontario clearing and followed larry blake to the west  im glad he hadnt pat said payne what was the end of it  i remembered said the other with a groan remembered i was trooper shannon an dropped the carbine into the wagon courthorne wheels the black horse round an i saw the red line across the face of him  youll be sorry for this my lad says he  hes a dangerous man payne said thoughtfully pat you came near being aass that day anyway its time we went in and as larrys here i shouldnt wonder if we saw courthorne again before the morning  the icy cold went through them to the bone as they left the stables and it was a relief to enter the loghouse which was heated to fustiness by the glowing stove a lamp hung from a rough birch beam and its uncertain radiance showed motionless figures wrapped in blankets in the bunks round the walls two men were however dressing and one already in uniform sat at a table talking to another swathed in furs who was from his appearance a prairie farmer the man at the table was lean and weatherbronzed with grizzled hair and observant eyes they were fixed steadily upon the farmer who knew that very little which happened upon the prairie escaped the vigilance of sergeant stimson  its straight talk youre giving me larry what do you figure on making by it he said  the farmer laughed mirthlessly not much anyway beyond the chance of getting a bullet in me back or me best steer lifted one dark night tis not forgiving the rustlers are and courthornes the divil he said but listen now sergeant ive told ye where he is and if yere not fit to corral him ill ride him down meself  sergeant stimson wrinkled his forehead if anybody knows what theyre after it should be you he said watching the man out of the corner of his eyes still im a little worried as to why when youll get nothing for it youre anxious to serve the state  the farmer clenched a big hand sergeant you that knows everything will ye drive me mad an to  with the state he said sure its gospel im telling ye an as youre knowing well its me could tell where the boys who ride at midnight drop many a keg well if ye will have your reason it was courthorne who put the black shame on me an mine  sergeant stimson nodded for he had already suspected this  then he said dryly well give you a chance of helping us to put the handcuffs on him now because they wouldnt risk the bridge and the ice is not thick yet everywhere there are just two ways they could bring the stuff across and i figure wed be near the thing if we fixed on grahams pool still courthornes no kind of fool and just because that crossing seems the likeliest he might try the other one youre ready for duty trooper payne  the lad stood straight i can turn out in ten minutes sir he said  then and sergeant stimson raised his voice a trifle you will ride at once to the rise a league outside the settlement and watch the montana trail courthorne will probably be coming over from withams soon after you get there riding the big black and youll keep out of sight and follow him if he heads for carsons crossing ride for grahams at a gallop where youll find me with the rest if he makes for the bridge you will overtake him if you can and find out what hes after its quite likely hell tell you nothing and you will not arrest him but bearing in mind that every minute he spends there will be a loss to the rustlers youll keep him so long as you can trooper shannon youll ride at once to the bluff above grahams pool and watch the trail stop any man who rides that way and if its courthorne keep him until the rest of the boys come up with me youve got your duty quite straight both of you  the lads saluted and went out while the sergeant smiled a little as he glanced at the farmer and the men who were dressing  its steep chances well have mr courthornes company tomorrow boys he said fill up the kettle tom and serve out a pint of coffee there are reasons why we shouldnt turn out too soon well saddle in an hour or so  two of the men went out and the stinging blast that swept in through the open door smote a smoky smear across the blinking lamp and roused a sharper crackling from the stove then one returned with the kettle and there was silence when the fusty heat resumed its sway now and then a tired trooper murmured in his sleep or there was a snapping in the stove while the icy wind moaned about the building and the kettle commenced a soft sibilation but nobody moved or spoke three shadowy figures in uniform sat just outside the light soaking in the grateful warmth while they could for they knew that they might spend the next night unsheltered from the arctic cold of the wilderness the sergeant sat with thoughtful eyes and wrinkled forehead where the flickering radiance forced up his lean face and silhouetted his spare outline on the rough boarding behind him and close by the farmer sucked silently at his pipe waiting with a stony calm that sprang from fierce impatience the reckoning with the man who had brought back shame upon him  it was about this time when witham stood shivering a little with the bridle of a big black horse in his hand just outside the door of his homestead a valise and two thick blankets were strapped to the saddle and he had donned the fur cap and coat courthorne usually wore courthorne himself stood close by smiling at him sardonically  if you keep the cap down and ride with your stirrups long as ive fixed them anybody would take you for me said he go straight through the settlement and let any man you come across see you his testimony would come in useful if stimson tries to fix a charge on me you know your part of the bargain youre to be lance courthorne for a fortnight from today  yes said witham dryly i wish i was equally sure of yours  courthorne laughed im to be rancher witham until tomorrow night anyway dont worry about me ill borrow those books of yours and improve my mind possible starvation is the only thing that threatens me and its unfortunate youve left nothing fit to eat behind you  witham swung himself into the saddle a trifle awkwardly for courthorne rode with longer stirrup leathers than he was accustomed to then he raised one hand and the other man laughed a little as he watched him sink into the darkness of the shadowy prairie when the drumming of hoofs was lost in the moaning of the wind he strode towards the stable and taking up the lantern surveyed withams horse thoughtfully  the thing cuts with both edges and the farmer only sees one of them he said that beasts about as difficult to mistake as my black is  then he returned to the loghouse and presently put on withams old fur coat and tattered fur cap had witham seen his unpleasant smile as he did it he would probably have wheeled the black horse and returned at a gallop but the farmer was sweeping across the waste of whitened grass at least a league away by this time now and then a halfmoon blinked down between wisps of smoky cloud but for the most part grey dimness hung over the prairie and the drumming of hoofs rang stridently through the silence witham knew a good horse and had bred several of thembefore a blizzard which swept the prairie killed off his finest yearlings as well as their pedigree sireand his spirits rose as the splendid beast swung into faster stride beneath him  for two weeks at least he would be free from anxiety and the monotony of his life at the lonely homestead had grown horribly irksome witham was young and now when for a brief space he had left his cares behind the old love of adventure which had driven him out from england once more awakened and set his blood stirring for the first time in six years of struggle he did not know what lay before him and he had a curious halfinstinctive feeling that the trail he was travelling would lead him farther than montana it was borne in upon him that he had left the old hopeless life behind and stirred by some impulse he broke into a little song he had sung in england long and forgotten he had a clear voice and the words which were filled with the hope of youth rang bravely through the stillness of the frozen wilderness until the horse blundered and witham stopped with a little smile  its four long years since i felt as i do tonight he said  then he drew bridle and checked the horse as the lights of the settlement commenced to blink ahead for the trail was rutted deep and frozen into the likeness of adamant but when the first frame houses flung tracks of yellow radiance across the whitened grass he dropped his left arm a trifle and rode in at a canter as he had seen courthorne do witham did not like courthorne but he meant to keep his bargain  as he passed the hotel more slowly a man who came out called to him hello lance taking the trail he said well it kind of strikes me its time you did one of stimsons boys was down here and he seemed quite anxious about you  witham knew the man and was about to urge the horse forward but in place of it drew bridle and laughed with a feeling that was wholly new to him as he remembered that his neighbours now and then bantered him about his english and that courthorne only used the western colloquialism when it suited him  sergeant stimson is an enterprising officer but there are as keen men as he is he said you will in case he questions you remember when you met me  oh yes said the other still i wouldnt fool too much with himand where did you get those mittens from thats the kind of outfit that would suit witham  witham nodded for though he had turned his face from the light the hand he held the bridle with was visible and his big fur gloves were very old  they are his the fact is ive just come from his place he said well you can tell stimson you saw me starting out on the montana trail  he shook the bridle laughed softly as the frame houses flitted by and then grew intent when the darkness of the prairie once more closed down it was he knew probable that some of stimsons men would be looking out for him and he had not sufficient faith in courthornes assurances to court an encounter with them  the lights had faded and the harsh grass was crackling under the drumming hoofs when the blurred outline of a mounted man showed up on the crest of a rise and a shout came down  hallo pull up there a moment stranger  there was nothing alarming in the greeting but witham recognized the ring of command as well as the faint jingle of steel which had preceded it and pressed his heels home the black swung forward faster and witham glancing over his shoulder saw the dusky shape was now moving down the incline then the voice rose again more commandingly  pull up i want a talk with you  witham turned his head a moment and remembering courthornes english flung back the answer sorry i havent time  the faint musical jingle grew plainer there was a thud of hoofs behind and the curious exhilaration returned to witham as the big black horse stretched out at a gallop the soil was hard as granite but the matted grasses formed a covering that rendered fast riding possible to a man who took the risks and witham knew there were few horses in the government service to match the one he rode still it was evident that the trooper meant to overtake him and recollecting his compact he tightened his grip on the bridle it was a long way to the ranch where he was to spend the night and he knew that the further he drew the trooper on the better it would suit courthorne  so they swept on through the darkness over the empty waste the trooper who was riding hard slowly creeping up behind still witham held the horse in until a glance over his shoulder showed him that there was less than a hundred yards between them and he fancied he heard a portentous rattle as well as the thud of hoofs it was not unlike that made by a carbine flung across the saddle this suggested unpleasant possibilities and he slackened his grip on the bridle then a breathless shout rang out pull up or ill fire  witham wondered if the threat was genuine or what is termed bluff in that country but as he had decided objections to being shot in the back to please courthorne sent his heels home the horse shot forward beneath him and though no carbine flashed the next backward glance showed him that the distance between him and the pursuer was drawing out while when he stared ahead again the dark shape of willows or birches cut the skyline as they came back to him the drumming of hoofs swelled into a staccato roar while presently the trail grew steep and dark boughs swayed above him in another few minutes something smooth and level flung back a blink of light and the timbers of a wooden bridge rattled under his passage then he was racing upwards through the gloom of winddwarfed birches on the opposite side listening for the rattle behind him on the bridge and after a struggle with the horse pulled him up smoking when he did not hear it  there was a beat of hoofs across the river but it was slower than when he had last heard it and grew momentarily less audible and witham laughed as he watched the steam of the horse and his own breath rise in a thin white cloud  the trooper has given it up and now for montana he said     chapter iv  in the bluff   it was very dark amidst the birches where trooper shannon sat motionless in his saddle gazing down into the denser blackness of the river hollow the stream ran deep below the level of the prairie as the rivers of that country usually do and the trees which there alone found shelter from the winds straggled gnarled and stunted up either side of the steep declivity close behind the trooper a sinuous trail seamed by ruts and the print of hoofs stretched away across the empty prairie it forked on the outskirts of the bluff and one arm dipped steeply to the river where because the stream ran slow just there and the bottom was firm a horseman might cross when the water was low and heavy sledges make the passage on the ice in winter time the other arm twisted in and out among the birches towards the bridge but that detour increased the distance to any one travelling north or south by two leagues or so  the ice however was not very thick as yet and shannon who had heard it ring hollowly under him surmised that while it might be possible to lead a laden horse across there would be some risk attached to the operation for that very reason and although his opinion had not been asked he agreed with sergeant stimson that the whiskyrunners would attempt the passage they were men who took the risks as they came and that route would considerably shorten the journey it was especially desirable for them to make at night while it would shannon fancied appear probable to them that if the police had word of their intentions they would watch the bridge between it and the frozen ford the stream ran faster and the trooper decided that no mounted man could cross the thinner ice  it was very cold as well as dark for although the snow which usually precedes the frost in that country had not come as yet it was evidently not far away and the trooper shivered in the blasts from the pole which cut through fur and leather with the keenness of steel the temperature had fallen steadily since morning and now there was a presage of a blizzard in the moaning wind and murky sky if it broke and scattered its blinking whiteness upon the roaring blast there would be but little hope for any man or beast caught shelterless in the empty wilderness for it is beyond the power of anything made of flesh and blood to withstand that cold  already a fine haze of snow swirled between the birch twigs every now and then and stung the few patches of the troopers unprotected skin as though they had been pricked with redhot needles it however seldom lasted more than a minute and when it whirled away a halfmoon shone down for a moment between smoky clouds the uncertain radiance showed the thrashing birches rising from the hollow row on row struck a faint sparkle from the ice beneath them and then went out leaving the gloom intensified it was evident to shannon that his eyes would not be much use to him that night for which reason he kept his ears uncovered at the risk of losing them but though he had been born in the bush and all the sounds of the wilderness had for him a meaning hearing did not promise to be of much assistance the dim trees roared about him with a great thrashing of twigs and when the wilder gusts had passed there was an eery moaning through which came the murmur of leagues of tormented grasses the wind was rising rapidly and it would he fancied drown the beat of approaching hoofs as well as any cry from his comrades  four of them were hidden amidst the birches where the trail wound steeply upwards through the bluff across the river two on the nearer side not far below and trooper shannons watch would serve two purposes he was to let the rustlers pass him it they rode for the ford and then help to cut off the retreat of any who escaped the sergeant while if they found the ice too thin for loaded beasts or rode towards the bridge a flash from his carbine would bring his comrades across in time to join the others who were watching that trail it had as usual with stimsons schemes all been carefully thought out and the plan was eminently workable but unfortunately for the grizzled sergeant a better brain than his had foreseen the combination  in the meanwhile the lad felt his limbs grow stiff and almost useless and a lethargic numbness blunt the keenness of his faculties as the heat went out of him he had more than usual endurance and utter cold thirst and the hunger that most ably helps the frost are not infrequently the portion of the wardens of the prairie but there is a limit to what man can bear and the troopers who watched by the frozen river that night had almost reached it shannon could not feel the stirrups with his feet one of his ears was tingling horribly as the blood that had almost left it resumed its efforts to penetrate the congealing flesh while the mittened hands he beat upon his breast fell solidly on his wrappings without separate motion of the fingers once or twice the horse stamped fretfully but a touch of hand and heel quieted him for though the frozen flesh may shrink unwavering obedience is demanded equally from man and beast enrolled in the service of the northwest police  stiddy now said the lad partly to discover if he still retained the power of speech sure ye know the order that was given me and if its a funeral that comes of it the government will bury ye  he sighed as he beat his hands upon his breast again and when a flicker of moonlight smote a passing track of brightness athwart the tossing birches his young face was very grim like many another trooper of the northwest police shannon had his story and he remembered the one trace of romance that had brightened his hard bare life that night as he waited for the man who had dissipated it  when larry blake moved west from ontario shannon drawn by his sisters dark eyes followed him and took up a government grant of prairie sod his dollars were few but he had a stout heart and two working oxen and nothing seemed impossible while ailly blake smiled on him and she smiled tolerably frequently for shannon was a wellfavoured lad he had worked harder than most grown men could do won one good harvest and had a few dollars in the bank when courthorne rode up to blakes homestead on his big black horse after that all shannons hopes and ambitions came down with a crash and the day he found blake grey in face with shame and rage he offered sergeant stimson his services now he was filled with an unholy content that he had done so for he came of a race that does not forget an injury and had sufficient cause for a jealous pride in the virtue of its women he and larry might have forgiven a pistol shot but they could not forget the shame  suddenly he stiffened to attention for though a man of the cities would probably have heard nothing but the wailing of the wind he caught a faint rhythmic drumming which might have been made by a galloping horse it ceased and he surmised probably correctly that it was trooper payne returning it was however his business to watch the forking of the trail and when he could only hear the thrashing of the birches he moved his mittened hand from the bridle and patted the restive horse just then the bluff was filled with sound as a blast that drove a haze of snow before it roared down it was followed by a sudden stillness that was almost bewildering and when a blink of moonlight came streaming down trooper shannon grabbed at his carbine for a man stood close beside him in the trail the lad who had neither seen nor heard him come looked down on the glinting barrel of a marlin rifle and saw a set white face behind it  hands up said a hoarse voice throw that thing down  trooper shannon recognized it and all the fierce hate he was capable of flamed up it shook him with a gust of passion and it was not fear that caused his stiffened fingers to slip upon the carbine it fell with a rattle and while he sat still almost breathless and livid in face the man laughed a little  thats better get down he said  trooper shannon swung himself from the saddle and alighted heavily as a flungoff sack would have done for his limbs refused to bend still it was not from lack of courage that he obeyed and during one moment he had clutched the bridle with the purpose of riding over his enemy he had however been taught to think for himself swiftly and shrewdly from his boyhood up and realized instinctively that if he escaped scathless the ringing of the rifle would warn the rustlers who he surmised were close behind he was also a police trooper broken to the iron bond of discipline and if a bullet from the marlin was to end his career he determined it should if possible also terminate his enemys liberty the gust of rage had gone and left him with the cold vindictive cunning the celt who has a grievous injury to remember is also capable of and there was contempt in his voice as he turned to courthorne quietly  sure its your turn now he said the last time i put my mark on the divils face of ye  courthorne laughed wickedly it was a bad days work for you i havent forgotten yet he said im only sorry youre not a trifle older but it will teach sergeant stimson the folly of sending a lad to deal with me well walk straight into the bush and remember that the muzzle of the rifle is scarcely three feet behind you  trooper shannon did so with black rage in his heart and his empty hands at his sides he was a police trooper and a bushman born and knew that the rustlers laden horses would find some difficulty in remounting the steep trail and could not escape to left or right once they were entangled amidst the trees then it would be time to give the alarm and go down with a bullet in his body or by some contrivance evade the deadly rifle and come to grips with his enemy he also knew lance courthorne and remembering how the lash had seamed his face expected no pity one of them it was tolerably certain would have set out on the long trail before the morning but they breed grim men in the bush of ontario and no other kind ride very long with the wardens of the prairie  stop where you are said courthorne presently now then turn round move a finger or open your lips and ill have great pleasure in shooting you in the meanwhile you can endeavour to make favour with whatever saint is honoured by the charge of you  shannon smiled in a fashion that resembled a snarl as once more a blink of moonlight shone down upon them and in place of showing apprehension his young white face from which the bronze had faded was venomous  and my folks were orange but what does that matter now said he therell be one of us intomorrow but for the shame ye put on larry yell carry my mark there with ye  courthorne looked at him with a little glow in his eyes you havent felt mine yet he said you will probably talk differently when you do  it may have been youthful bravado but trooper shannon laughed in the meanwhile he said im wondering why youre wearing an honest mans coat and cap faith if he saw them on ye witham would burn them  courthorne returned no answer and the moonlight went out but they stood scarcely three feet apart and one of them knew that any move he made would be followed by the pressure of the others finger on the trigger he however did not move at all and while the birches roared about them they stood silently face to face the man of birth and pedigree with a past behind him and blood already upon his head and the raw lad from the bush his equal before the tribunal that would presently judge their quarrel  in the meanwhile trooper shannon heard a drumming of hoofs that grew steadily louder before courthorne apparently noticed the sound and his trained ears told him that the rustlers horses were coming down the trail now they had passed the forking and when the branches ceased roaring again he knew they had floundered down the first of the declivity and it would be well to wait a little until they had straggled out where the trail was narrow and deeply rutted no one could turn them hastily there and the men who drove them could scarcely escape the troopers who waited them if they blundered on through the darkness of the bush so five breathless minutes passed trooper shannon standing tense and straight with every nerve tingling as he braced himself for an effort courthorne stooping a little with forefinger on the trigger and the marlin rifle at his hip then through a lull there rose a clearer thud of hoofs it was lost in the thrashing of the twigs as a gust roared down again and trooper shannon launched himself like a panther upon his enemy  he might have succeeded and the effort was gallantly made but courthorne had never moved his eyes from the shadowy object before him and even as it sprang his finger contracted further on the trigger there was a red flash and because he fired from the hip the trigger guard gashed his mitten he sprang sideways scarcely feeling the bite of the steel for the lads hand brushed his shoulder then there was a crash as something went down heavily amidst the crackling twigs courthorne stooped a little panting in the smoke that blew into his eyes jerked the marlin lever and as the moon came through again had a blurred vision of a white drawn face that stared up at him still with defiance in its eyes he looked down into it as he drew the trigger once more  shannon quivered a moment and then lay very still and it was high time for courthorne to look to himself for there was a shouting in the bluff and something came crashing through the undergrowth even then his cunning did not desert him and flinging the marlin down beside the trooper he slipped almost silently in and out among the birches and swung himself into the saddle of a tethered horse unlooping the bridle from a branch he pressed his heels home realizing as he did it that there was no time to lose for it was evident that one of the troopers was somewhat close behind him and others were coming across the river he knew the bluff well and having no desire to be entangled in it was heading for the prairie when a blink of moonlight showed him a lad in uniform riding at a gallop between him and the crest of the slope it was trooper payne and courthorne knew him for a very bold horseman  now it is possible that had one of the rustlers who were simple men with primitive virtues as well as primitive passions been similarly placed he would have joined his comrades and taken his chance with them but courthorne kept faith with nobody unless it suited him and was equally dangerous to his friends and enemies trooper shannon had also been silenced for ever and if he could cross the frontier unrecognized nobody would believe the story of the man he would leave to bear the brunt in place of him accordingly he headed at a gallop down the winding trail while sharp orders and a drumming of hoofs grew louder behind him and hoarse cries rose in front trooper payne was it seemed at least keeping pace with him and he glanced over his shoulder as he saw something dark and shadowy across the trail it was apparently a horse from which two men were struggling to loose its burden  courthorne guessed that the trail was blocked in front of it by other loaded beasts and he could not get past in time for the halfseen trooper was closing with him fast and another still rode between him and the edge of the bluff cutting off his road to the prairie it was evident he could not go on while the crackle of twigs roar of hoofs and jingle of steel behind him made it plain that to turn was to ride back upon the carbines of men who would be quite willing to use them there alone remained the river it ran fast below him and the ice was thin and for just a moment he tightened his grip on the bridle  weve got you a hoarse voice reached him youre taking steep chances if you go on  courthorne swung off from the trail there was a flash above him something whirred through the twigs above his head and the horse plunged as he drove his heels in  one of them gone for the river another shout rang out and courthorne was crashing through the undergrowth straight down the declivity while thin snow whirled about him and now and then he caught the faint glimmer flung back by the ice beneath  swaying boughs lashed him his fur cap was whipped away and he felt that his face was bleeding but there was another crackle close behind him for trooper payne was riding as daringly and he carried a carbine had he desired it courthorne could not turn the bronco he bestrode was madly excited and less than half broken and it is probable no man could have pulled him up just then it may also have been borne in upon courthorne that he owed a little to those he had left behind him in the old country and he had not lost his pride there was it seemed no escape but he had at least a choice of endings and with a little breathless laugh he rode straight for the river  it was with difficulty trooper payne pulled his horse up on the steep bank a minute later a white haze was now sliding down the hollow between the two dark walls of trees and something seemed to move in the midst of it while the ice rang about it then as the trooper pitched up his carbine there was a crash that was followed by a horrible floundering and silence again payne sat still shivering a little in his saddle until the snow that whirled about him blotted out all the birches and a roaring blast came down  he knew there was now nothing that he could do the current had evidently sucked the fugitive under and dismounting he groped his way up the slope leading the horse by the bridle and only swung himself into the saddle when he found the trail again a carbine flashed in front of him two dim figures went by at a gallop and a third one flung an order over his shoulder as he passed  go back the sergeants hurt and shannon has got a bullet in him  trooper payne had surmised as much already and went back as fast as he could ride while the beat of hoofs grew fainter down the trail ten minutes later he drew bridle close by a man who held a lantern and saw sergeant stimson sitting very grim in face on the ground it transpired later that his horse had fallen and thrown him and it was several weeks before he rode again  you lost your man he said get down  payne dismounted yes sir i fancy he is dead he said he tried the river and the ice wouldnt carry him i saw him ride away from here just after the first shot and fancied he fired at shannon have you seen him sir  the other trooper moved his lantern and payne gasped as he saw a third man stooping with the white face of his comrade close by his feet shannon appeared to recognize him for his eyes moved a little and the grey lips fell apart then payne turned his head aside while the other trooper nodded compassionately in answer to his questioning glance  ive sent one of the boys to grahams for a wagon said the sergeant you saw the man who fired at him  yes sir said trooper payne  you knew him and there was a ring in the sergeants voice  yes sir said the trooper at least he was riding withams horse and had on the old long coat of his  sergeant stimson nodded and pointed to the weapon lying with blackened muzzle at his feet and i think you could recognize that rifle theres f witham cut on the stock of it  payne said nothing for the trooper signed to him  i fancy shannon wants to talk to you he said  the lad knelt down slipped one arm about his comrades neck and took the mittened hand in his own shannon smiled up at him feebly  withams horse and his cap he said and then stopped gasping horribly  you will remember that boys said the sergeant  payne could say nothing trooper shannon and he had ridden through icy blizzard and scorching heat together and he felt his manhood melting as he looked down into his dimming eyes there was a curious look in them which suggested a strenuous endeavour and an appeal and the lips moved again  it was said shannon and moved his head a little on paynes arm apparently in an agony of effort  then the birches roared about them and drowned the feeble utterance while when the gust passed all three who had not heard what preceded it caught only one wordwitham  trooper shannons eyes closed and his head fell back while the snow beat softly in to his upturned face and there was a very impressive silence intensified by the moaning of the wind until the rattle of wheels came faintly down the trail     chapter v  miss barrington comes home   the long train was slackening speed and two whistles rang shrilly through the roar of wheels when miss barrington laid down the book with which she had beguiled her journey of fifteen hundred miles and rose from her seat in a corner of the big firstclass car the car was sumptuously upholstered and its decorations tasteful as well as lavish but just then it held no other passenger and miss barrington smiled curiously as she stood swaying a little in front of the mirror at one end of it wrapping her furs about her there was however a faint suggestion of regret in the smile and the girls eyes grew grave again for the soft cushions dainty curtains gleaming gold and nickel and equable temperature formed a part of the sheltered life she was about to leave behind her and there would she knew be a difference in the future still she laughed again as drawing a little fur cap well down upon her broad white forehead she nodded at her own reflection  one cannot have everything and you might have stayed there and revelled in civilization if you had liked she said  crossing to the door of the portico she stood a moment with fingers on its handle and once more looked about her the car was very cosy and maud barrington had all the average young womans appreciation of the smoother side of life although she had also the capacity which is by no means so common for extracting the most it had to give from the opposite one still it was with a faint regret she prepared to complete what had been a deed of renunciation montreal with its gaieties and luxuries had not seemed so very far away while she was carried west amid all the comforts artizans who were also artists could provide for the traveller but once that door closed behind her she would be cut adrift from it all and left face to face with the simple strenuous life of the prairie  maud barrington had however made her mind up some weeks ago and when the lock closed with a little clack that seemed to emphasize the fact that the door was shut she had shaken the memories from her and was quietly prepared to look forward instead of back it also needed some little courage for as she stood with the furs fluttering about her on the lurching platform the cold went through her like a knife and the roofs of the little prairie town rose up above the willows the train was now crawling through the odours that greeted her nostrils were the reverse of pleasant and glancing down with the faintest shiver of disgust her eyes rested on the litter of empty cans discarded garments and other even more unsightly things which are usually dumped in the handiest bluff by the citizens of a springing western town they have for the most part but little appreciation of the picturesque and it would take a good deal to affect their health  then the dwarfed trees opened out and flanked by two huge wheat elevators and a great water tank the prairie city stood revealed it was crude and repellent devoid of anything that could please the most lenient eye for the bare frame houses rose with their rough boarding weathered and cracked by frost and sun hideous almost in their simplicity from the white prairie paint was apparently an unknown luxury and pavement there was none though a rude plank platform straggled some distance above the ground down either side of the street so that the citizens might not sink kneedeep in the mire of the spring thawing here and there a dilapidated wagon was drawn up in front of a store but with a clanging of the big bell the locomotive rolled into the little station and maud barrington looked down upon a group of silent men who had sauntered there to enjoy the one relaxation the desolate place afforded them  there was very little in their appearance to attract the attention of a young woman of miss barringtons upbringing they had grave bronzed faces and wore for the most part old fur coats stained here and there with soil nor were their mittens and moccasins in good repair but there was a curious steadiness in their gaze which vaguely suggested the slow stubborn courage that upheld them through the strenuous effort and grim selfdenial of their toilsome lives they were small wheatgrowers who had driven in to purchase provisions or inquire the price of grain and here and there a mittened hand was raised to a wellworn cap for most of them recognized miss barrington of silverdale grange she returned their greetings graciously and then swung herself from the platform with a smile in her eyes as a man came hastily and yet as it were with a certain deliberation in her direction  he was elderly but held himself erect while his furs which were good fitted him in a fashion which suggested a uniform he also wore boots which reached halfway to the knee and were presumably lined to resist the prairie cold which few men at that season would do and scarcely a speck of dust marred their lustrous exterior while as much of his face as was visible beneath the great fur cap was lean and commanding its salient features were the keen and somewhat imperious grey eyes and long straight nose while something in the squareness of the mans shoulders and his pose set him apart from the prairie farmers and suggested the cavalry officer he was in fact colonel barrington founder and autocratic ruler of the english community of silverdale and had been awaiting his niece somewhat impatiently colonel barrington was invariably punctual and resented the fact that the train had come in an hour later than it should have done  so you have come back to us we have been longing for you my dear he said i dont know what we should have done had they kept you in montreal altogether  maud barrington smiled though there was a brightness in her eyes and a faint warmth in her cheek for the sincerity of her uncles welcome was evident  yes she said i have come back it was very pleasant in the city and they were all kind to me but i think henceforward i would sooner stay with you on the prairie  colonel barrington patted the hand he drew through his arm and there was a very kindly smile in his eyes as they left the station and crossed the tract towards a little and by no means very comfortable wooden hotel he stopped outside it  i want to see the horses put in and get our mail he said mrs jasper expects you and will have tea ready  he disappeared behind the wooden building and his niece standing a moment on the veranda watched the long train roll away down the faint blur of track that ran west to the farthest verge of the great white wilderness then with a little impatient gesture she went into the hotel  that is another leaf turned down and there is no use in looking back but i wonder what is written on the rest she said  twenty minutes later she watched colonel barrington cross the street with a bundle of letters in his hand she fancied that his step was slower than it had been and that he seemed a trifle preoccupied and embarrassed but he spoke with quiet kindliness when he handed her into the waiting sleigh and the girls spirits rose as they swung smoothly northwards behind two fast horses across the prairie it stretched away before her ridged here and there with a dusky birch bluff or willow grove under a vault of crystalline blue the sun that had no heat in it struck a silvery glitter from the snow and the trail swept back to the horizon a sinuous bluegrey smear while the keen dry cold and sense of swift motion set the girls blood stirring after all it seemed to her there were worse lives than those the western farmers led on the great levels under the frost and sun  colonel barrington watched her with a little gleam of approval in his eyes you are not sorry to come back to this and silverdale he said sweeping his mittened hand vaguely round the horizon  no said the girl with a little laugh at least i shall not be sorry to return to silverdale it has a charm of its own for while one is occasionally glad to get away from it one is even more pleased to come home again it is a somewhat purposeless life our friends are leading yonder in the cities i of course mean the women  barrington nodded and some of the men well we have room here for the many who are going to the devil in the old country for the lack of something worth while to do though i am afraid there is considerably less prospect than i once fancied there would be of their making money  his niece noticed the gravity in his face and sat thoughtfully silent for several minutes while with the snow hissing beneath it the sleigh nipped into and swung out of a hollow  colonel barrington had founded the silverdale settlement ten years earlier and gathered about him other men with a grievance who had once served their nation and the younger sons of english gentlemen who had no inclination for commerce and found that lack of brains and capital debarred them from either a political or military career he had settled them on the land and taught them to farm while for the community had prospered at first when western wheat was dear it had taken ten years to bring home to him the fact that men who dined ceremoniously each evening and spent at least a third of their time in games and sport could not well compete with the grim bushmen from ontario or the lean dakota ploughmen who ate their meals in ten minutes and toiled at least twelve hours every day  colonel barrington was slow to believe that the race he sprang from could be equalled and much less beaten at anything while his respect for and scrupulous observance of insular traditions had cost him a good deal and left him a poorer man than he had been when he founded silverdale maud barrington had been his ward and he still directed the farming of a good many acres of wheat land which she now held in her own right the soil was excellent and would in all probability have provided one of the ontario men with a very desirable revenue but colonel barrington had no taste for small economies  i want to hear all the news said the girl you can begin at the beginningthe price of wheat i fancied when i saw you it had been declining  barrington sighed a little hard wheat is five cents down and i am sorry i persuaded you to hold your crop i am very much afraid we shall see the balance the wrong side again next halfyear  maud barrington smiled curiously there was no great cause for merriment in the information given her but it emphasized the contrast between the present and the careless life she had lately led when her one thought had been how to extract the greatest pleasure from the day one had frequently to grapple with the problems arising from scanty finances at silverdale  it will go up again she said is there anything else  barringtons face grew a trifle grim as he nodded there is and while i have not much expectation of an advance in prices i have been worrying over another affair lately  his niece regarded him steadily you mean lance courthorne  yes said barrington who flicked the near horse somewhat viciously with the whip he is also sufficient to cause any man with my responsibilities anxiety  maud barrington looked thoughtful you fancy he will come to silverdale  barrington appeared to be repressing an inclination towards vigorous speech with some difficulty and a little glint crept into his eyes if i could by any means prevent it the answer would be no as it is you know that while i founded it silverdale was one of geoffrey courthornes imperialistic schemes and a good deal of the land was recorded in his name that being so he had every right to leave the best farm on it to the man he had disinherited especially as lance will not get a penny of the english property still i do not know why he did so because he never spoke of him without bitterness  yes said the girl while a little flush crept into her face i was sorry for the old man it was a painful story  colonel barrington nodded it is one that is best forgottenand you do not know it all still the fact that the man may settle among us is not the worst as you know there was every reason to believe that geoffrey intended all his property at silverdale for you  i have much less right to it than his own son and the colonial cure is not infrequently efficacious said miss barrington lance may after all quieten down and he must have some good qualities  the colonels smile was very grim it is fifteen years since i saw him at westham and they were not much in evidence then i can remember two little episodes in which he figured with painful distinctness and one was the hanging of a terrier which had in some way displeased him the beast was past assistance when i arrived on the scene but the devilish pleasure in the lads face sent a chill through me in the other the gardeners lad flung a stone at a blackbird on the wall above the vinery and master lance who i fancy did not like the gardeners lad flung one through the glass geoffrey who was angry but had not seen what i did haled the boy before him and lance looked him in the face and lied with the assurance of an ambassador the end was that the gardener who was admonished cuffed the innocent lad these my dear are somewhat instructive memories  i wonder said maud barrington glancing out across the prairie which was growing dusky now why you took the trouble to call them up for me  the colonel smiled dryly i never saw a courthorne who could not catch a womans eye or had any undue diffidence about making the most of the fact and that is partly why they have brought so much trouble on everybody connected with them further it is unfortunate that women are not infrequently more inclined to be gracious to the sinner who repents when it is worth his while than they are to the honest man who has done no wrong nor do i know that it is only pity which influences them some of you take an exasperating delight in picturesque rascality  miss barrington laughed and fearlessly met her uncles glance then you dont believe in penitence  well said the colonel dryly i am i hope a christian man but it would be difficult to convince me that the gambler cattlethief and whiskyrunner who ruined every man and woman who trusted him will be admitted to the same place as cleanlived english gentlemen there are my dear plenty of them still  barrington spoke almost fiercely and then flushed through his tan when the girl looking into his eyes smiled a little yes she said i can believe it because i owe a good deal to one of them  the ring in the girls voice belied the smile and the speech was warranted for dogmatic domineering and vindictive as he was apt to be occasionally the words he had used applied most fitly to colonel barrington his word at least had never been broken and had he not adhered steadfastly to his own rigid code he would have been a good deal richer man than he was then nor did his little shortcomings which were burlesqued virtues and ludicrous now and then greatly detract from the stamp of dignity which for speech was his worst point sat well upon him he was innately conservative to the backbone though since an ungrateful government had slighted him he had become an ardent canadian and in all political questions aggressively democratic  my dear i sometimes fancy i am a hypercritical old fogey he said and sighed a little while once more the anxious look crept into his face just now i wish devoutly i was a better business man  nothing more was said for a little and miss barrington watched the crimson sunset burn out low down on the prairies western rim then the pale stars blinked out through the creeping dusk and a great silence and an utter cold settled down upon the waste the muffled thud of hoofs and the crunching beneath the sliding steel seemed to intensify it and there was a suggestion of frozen brilliancy in the sparkle flung back by the snow then a coyote howled dolefully in a distant bluff and the girl shivered as she shrank down further amidst the furs  forty degrees of frost said the colonel perhaps more this is very different from the cold of montreal still youll see the lights of silverdale from the crest of the next rise  it was however an hour before they reached them and miss barrington was almost frozen when the first square loghouse rose out of the prairie it and others that followed it flitted by and then flanked by a great birch bluff with outlying barns granaries and stables looming black about it against a crystalline sky silverdale grange grew into shape across their way its rows of ruddy windows cast streaks of flickering orange down the trail the baying of dogs changed into a joyous clamour when the colonel reined in his team halfseen men in furs waved a greeting and one who risked frostbite with his cap at his knee handed miss barrington from the sleigh and up the veranda stairway  she had need of the assistance for her limbs were stiff and almost powerless and she gasped a little when she passed into the drowsy warmth and brightness of the great logwalled hall the chilled blood surged back tingling to her skin and swaying with a creeping faintness she found refuge in the arms of a greyhaired lady who stooped and kissed her gently then the door swung to and she was home again in the wooden grange of silverdale which stood far remote from any civilization but its own on the frozen levels of the great white plain     chapter vi  anticipations   it was late at night and outside the prairie lay white and utterly silent under the arctic cold when maud barrington who glanced at it through the double windows flung back the curtains with a little shiver and turning towards the fire sat down on a little velvet footstool beside her aunts knee she had shaken out the coils of lustrous brown hair which flowed about her shoulders glinting in the light of the shaded lamp and it was with a little gesture of physical content she stretched her hands towards the hearth a crumbling birch log still gleamed redly amidst the feathery ashes but its effect was chiefly artistic for no open fire could have dissipated the cold of the prairie and a big tiled stove brought from teutonic minnesota furnished the needful warmth  the girls face was partly in shadow and her figure foreshortened by her pose which accentuated its rounded outline and concealed its willowy slenderness but the broad white forehead and straight nose became visible when she moved her head a trifle and a faintly humorous sparkle crept into the clear brown eyes possibly maud barrington looked her best just then for the lower part of the paletinted face was a trifle too firm in its modelling  no i am not tired aunt and i could not sleep just now she said you see after leaving all that behind one one feels as it were adrift and it is necessary to realize ones self again  the little silverhaired lady who sat in the big basket chair smiled down upon her and laid a thin white hand that was still beautiful upon the gleaming hair  i can understand my dear and am glad you enjoyed your stay in the city because sometimes when i count your birthdays i cant help a fancy that you are not young enough she said you have lived out here with two old people who belong to the past too much  the girl moved a little and swept her glance slowly round the room it was small and scantily furnished though great curtains shrouded door and window and here and there a picture relieved the bareness of the walls which were panelled with roughlydressed britishcolumbian cedar the floor was of redwood diligently polished and adorned not covered by one or two skins brought by some of colonel barringtons younger neighbours from the rockies there were two basketchairs and a plain redwood table but in contrast to them a cabinet of old french workmanship stood in one corner bearing books in dainty bindings and two great silver candlesticks the shaded lamp was also of the same metal and the whole room with its faint resinous smell conveyed in a fashion not uncommon on the prairie a suggestion of taste and refinement held in check by the least comparative poverty colonel barrington was a widower who had been esteemed a man of wealth but the founding of silverdale had made a serious inroad on his finances even yet though he occasionally practised it he did not take kindly to economy  yes said the girl i enjoyed it alland it was so different from the prairie  there was comprehension and a trace of sympathy in miss barringtons nod tell me a little my dear she said there was not a great deal in your letters  her niece glanced dreamily into the sinking fire as though she would call up the pictures there but you know it allthe life i have only had glimpses of well for the first few months i almost lost my head and was swung right off my feet by the whirl of it it was then i was perhaps just a trifle thoughtless  the whilehaired lady laughed softly it is difficult to believe it maud  the girl shook her head reproachfully i know what you mean and perhaps you are right for that was what twoinette insinuated she said she actually told me that i should be thankful i had a brain since i had no heart still at first i let myself go and it was delightfulthe opera the dances and the covered skating rink with the music and the black ice flashing beneath the lights the whirr of the toboggans down the great slide was finer still and the torchlight meets of the snowshoe clubs on the mountain yes i think i was really young while it lasted  for a month said the elder and after  then said the girl slowly it all seemed to grow a trifle purposeless and there was something that spoiled it twoinette was quite angry and i know her mother wrote youbut it was not my fault aunt how was i a guileless girl from the prairie to guess that such a man would fling the handkerchief to me  the evenness of tone and entire absence of embarrassment was significant it also pointed to the fact that there was a closer confidence between maud barrington and her aunt than often exists between mother and daughter and the elder lady stroked the lustrous head that rested against her knee with a little affectionate pride  my dear you know you are beautiful and you have the cachet that all the courthornes wear still you could not like him tell me about him  maud barrington curled herself up further i think i could have liked him but that was all she said he was nice to look at and did all the little things gracefully but he had never done anything else never would and i fancy had never wanted to now a man of that kind would very soon pall on me and i should have lost my temper trying to waken him to his responsibilities  and what kind of man would please you  maud barringtons eyes twinkled but the fact that she answered at all was a proof of the sympathy between herself and the questioner i do not know that i am anxious any of them should she said but since you ask he would have to be a man first a toiling striving animal who could hold his own amidst his fellows wherever he was placed secondly one would naturally prefer a gentleman though i do not like the word and one would fancy the combination a trifle rare because brains and birth do not necessarily tally and the man educated by the struggle for existence is apt to be taught more than he ever would be at oxford or in the army still men of that stamp forget a good deal and learn so much that is undesirable you see in fact i only know one man who would have suited me and he is debarred by age and affinitybut because we are so much alike i cant help fancying that you once knew another  the smile in miss barringtons face which was still almost beautiful as well as patient became a trifle wistful  there are few better men than my brother though he is not clever she said and dropped her voice a little as to the other he died in indiabeside his mountain gunlong ago  and you have never forgotten he must have been worth iti wonder if loyalty and chivalric faith belong only to the past said the girl reaching up a rounded arm and patting her aunts thin hand and now we will be practical i fancied the head of the settlement looked worried when he met me and he is not very proficient at hiding his feelings  miss barrington sighed i am afraid that is nothing very new and with wheat steadily falling and our granaries full he has cause for anxiety then the fact that lance courthorne has divided your inheritance and is going to settle here has been troubling him  the first is the lesser evil said the girl with a little laugh i wore very short frocks when i last saw lance in england and so far as i can remember he had the face of an angel and the temper of a devil but did not my uncle endeavour to buy him off andfor i know you have been finding out thingsi want you to tell me all about him  he would not take the money said miss barrington and sat in thoughtful silence a space then and perhaps she had a reason she quietly recounted courthornes canadian history so far as her brothers agents had been able to trace it not omitting dainty in thought and speech as she was one or two incidents which a mother might have kept back from her daughters ears still it was very seldom that miss barrington made a blunder there was a faint pinkness in her face when she concluded but she was not surprised when with a slow sinuous movement the girl rose to her feet her cheeks were very slightly flushed but there was a significant sparkle in her eyes  oh she said with utter contempt how sickening are there men like that  there was a little silence emphasized by the snapping in the stove and if miss barrington had spoken with an object she should have been contented the girl was imperious in her anger which was caused by something deeper than startled prudery  it is said the little whitehaired lady all quite true still i must confess that my brother and myself were a trifle astonished at the report of the lawyer he sent to confer with lance in montana one would almost have imagined that he had of late been trying to make amends  the girls face was very scornful could a man with a past like that ever live it down  we have a warrant for believing it said miss barrington quietly as she laid her hand on her companions arm my dear i have told you what lance was because i felt it was right that you should know but none of us can tell what he may be and if the man is honestly trying to lead a different life all i ask is that you should not wound him by any manifest suspicion those who have never been tempted can afford to be merciful  maud barrington laughed somewhat curiously you are a very wise woman aunt but you are a little transparent now and then she said at least he shall have a fair trial without prejudice or favourand if he fails as fail he will we shall find the means of punishing him  we said the elder lady a trifle maliciously  the girl nodded as she moved towards the doorway and then turned a moment with the folds of the big red curtain flung behind her it forced up the sweeping lines of a figure so delicately moulded that its slenderness was scarcely apparent for maud barrington still wore a long sombre dress that had assisted in her triumphs in the city it emphasized the clear pallor of her skin and the brightness of her eyes as she held herself very erect in a pose which while assumed in mockery had yet in it something that was almost imperial  yes she said we you know who is the power behind the throne at silverdale and what the boys call me and now good night sleep well dear  she went out and miss barrington sat very still gazing with eyes that were curiously thoughtful into the fire princess of the prairieand it fits her well she said and then sighed a little and if there is a trace of hardness in the girl it may be fortunate we all have our troublesand wheat is going down  in the meanwhile late as it was colonel barrington and his chief lieutenant gordon dane sat in his logwalled smokingroom talking with a man he sold his wheat through in winnipeg the room was big and bare there were a few fine heads of antelope upon the walls and beneath them an armoury of englishmade shot guns and rifles while a row of riding crops silvermounted and some handled with ivory stood in a corner all these represented amusement while two or three treatises on veterinary surgery and agriculture lying amidst english studbooks and racing records presumably stood for industry the comparison was significant and graham the winnipeg wheatbroker noticed it as he listened patiently to the views of colonel barrington who nevertheless worked hard enough in his own fashion unfortunately it was rather the fashion of the english gentleman than that common on the prairie  and now he said with a trace of the anxiety he had concealed in his eyes i am open to hear what you can do for me  graham smiled a little it isnt very much colonel ill take all your wheat off you at three cents down  now barrington did not like the brokers smile it savoured too much of equality and though he had already unbent as far as he was capable of doing he had no great esteem for men of business nor did it please him to be addressed as colonel  that he said coldly is out of the question i would not sell at the last market price besides you have hitherto acted as my broker  graham nodded the market price will be less than what i offered you in a week and i could scarcely sell your wheat at it today i was going to hold it myself because i can occasionally get a little more from one or two millers who like that special grade usual sorts im selling for a fall quite sure the deal wouldnt suit you  barrington lighted a fresh cigar though graham noticed that he had smoked very little of the one he flung away this was of course a trifle but it is the trifles that count in the aggregate upon the prairie as they not infrequently do elsewhere  i fancy i told you so he said  the broker glanced at dane who was a big bronzed man and since barrington could not see him shook his head deprecatingly  you can consider that decided graham he said still can you as a friendly deed give us any notion of what to do as you know farming especially at silverdale costs money and the banks are demanding an iniquitous interest just now while we are carrying over a good deal of wheat  graham nodded he understood why farming was unusually expensive at silverdale and was in recollection of past favours inclined to be disinterestedly friendly  if i were you i would sell right along for forward delivery at a few cents under the market  it is a trifle difficult to see how that would help us said barrington with a little gesture of irritation for it almost seemed that the broker was deriding him  no said the man from winnipeg on the contrary its quite easy now i can predict that wheat will touch lower prices still before you have to make delivery and it isnt very difficult to figure out the profit on selling a thing for a dollar and then buying it when you have to produce it at ninety cents of course there is a risk of the market going against you but you could buy at the first rise and youve your stock to dole out in case anybody cornered you  that said dane thoughtfully appears quite sensible of course its a speculation but presumably we couldnt be much worse off than we are have you any objections to the scheme sir  barrington laid down his cigar and glanced with astonished severity at the speaker unfortunately i have we are wheat growers and not wheat stock jugglers our purpose is to farm and not swindle and lie in the wheat pits for decimal differences i have a distinct antipathy to anything of the kind  but sir said dane and barrington stopped with a gesture  i would he said as soon turn gambler still while it has always been a tradition at silverdale that the head of the settlements lead is to be followed that need not prevent you putting on the gloves with the wheatring blacklegs in winnipeg  dane blushed a little under his tan and then smiled as he remembered the one speculative venture his leader had indulged in for colonel barrington was a somewhat hottempered and vindictive man he made a little gesture of deprecation as he glanced at graham who straightened himself suddenly in his chair  i should not think of doing so in face of your opinion sir he said there is an end to the thing graham  the brokers face was a trifle grim i gave you good advice out of friendship colonel and there are men with dollars to spare who would value a hint from me he said still as it doesnt seem to strike you the right way ive no use for arguing keep your wheatand pay bank interest if you want any help to carry over  thanks said dane quietly they charge tolerably high but ive seen what happens to the man who meddles with the mortgagebroker  graham nodded well as im starting out at six oclock its time i was asleep he said goodnight to you colonel  barrington shook hands with graham and then sighed a little when he went out i believe the man is honest and he is a guest of mine or i should have dressed him down he said i dont like the way things are going dane and the fact is we must find accommodation somewhere because now i have to pay out so much on my wards account to that confounded courthorne it is necessary to raise more dollars than the banks will give me now there was a broker fellow wrote me a very civil letter  dane who was a thoughtful man ventured to lay his hand upon his leaders arm keep yourself and miss barrington out of those fellows clutches at any cost he said  barrington shook off his hand and looked at him sternly are you not a trifle young to adopt that tone he asked  dane nodded no doubt i am but ive seen a little of mortgage jobbing you must try to overlook it i did not mean to offend  he went out and while colonel barrington sat down before a sheaf of accounts sprang into a waiting sleigh its no use weve got to go through he said to the lad who shook the reins graham made a very sensible suggestion but our respected leader came down on him as he did on me you see one simply cant talk to the colonel and its unfortunate miss barrington didnt marry that man in montreal  i dont know said the lad of course there are not many girls like maud barrington but is it necessary she should go outside silverdale  dane laughed none of us would be old enough for miss barrington when we were fifty the trouble is that we spend half our time in play and ive a notion its a man and not a gentleman dilettante shes looking for  isnt that a curious way of putting it asked his companion  dane nodded it may be the right one woman is as she was made and ive had more than a suspicion lately that a little less refinement would not come amiss at silverdale anyway i hope shell find him for its a man with grit and energy who could put a little desirable pressure on the colonel occasionally were all wanting of course im backing my leader though its going to cost me a good deal but its time he had somebody to help him  he would never accept assistance said the lad thoughtfully that is unless the man who offered it was or became by marriage one of the dynasty  of course said dane thats why im inclined to take a fatherly interest in miss barringtons affairs its a misfortune weve heard nothing very reassuring about courthorne     chapter vii  withams decision   farmer witham crossed the frontier without molestation and spent one night in a little wooden town where several people he did not speak to apparently recognized him then he pushed on southwards and passed a week in the especially desolate settlement he had been directed to a few dilapidated frame houses rose out of the white wilderness beside the broad beaten trail and for here the prairie rolled south in long rises like the wakes of a frozen sea a low wooden building on the crest of one cut the skyline a league away it served as outpost for a squadron of united states cavalry and the troopers daily maligned the government which had sent them into that desolation on police duty  there was nothing else visible but a few dusky groves of willows and dazzling snow the ramshackle wooden hotel was rather more than usually badly kept and comfortless and witham who had managed to conciliate his host felt relieved one afternoon when the latter flung down the cards disgustedly  i guess ive had enough he said playing for stakes of this kind isnt good enough for you  witham laughed a little to hide his resentment as he said i dont quite understand  pshaw said the american with a contemptuous gesture three times out of four ive spoiled your hand and if i didnt know that black horse id take you for some blamed canadian rancher you didnt handle the pictures that way when you stripped the boys to the hide at regent mr courthorne  regent said witham  the hotelkeeper laughed oh yes he said i wouldnt go back there too soon anyway the boys seem quite contented and i dont figure they would be very nice to you well now ive no use for fooling with a man whos too proud to take my dollars and ive a pair of horses just stuffed with wickedness in the stable theres not much you dont know about a beast anyway and you can take them out a league or two if you feel like it  witham who had grown very tired of his host was glad of any distraction especially as he surmised that while the man had never seen courthorne he knew rather more than he did himself about his doings accordingly he got into the sleigh that was brought out by and by and enjoyed the struggle with the halftamed team which stood with ears laid back prepared for conflict oats had been very plentiful and prices low that season witham who knew at least as much about a horse as lance courthorne however bent them to his will and the team were trotting quietly through the shadow of a big birch bluff a league from town when he heard a faint clipclop coming down the trail behind him it led straight beneath the leafless branches and was beaten smooth and firm while witham who had noticed already that whenever he strayed any distance from the hotel there was a mounted cavalryman somewhere in the vicinity shook the reins  the team swung into faster stride the cold wind whistled past him and the snow whirled up from beneath the runners but while he listened the rhythmic drumming behind him also quickened a little then a faintly musical jingle of steel accompanied the beat of hoofs and witham glanced about him with a little laugh of annoyance the dusk was creeping across the prairie and a pale star or two growing into brilliancy in the cloudless sweep of indigo  its getting a trifle tiresome ill find out what the fellow wants he said  wheeling the team he drove back the way he came and when a dusky object materialized out of the shadows beneath the birches swung the horses right across the trail the snow lay deep on either side of it just there with a sharp crust upon its surface which rendered it inadvisable to take a horse round the sleigh the mounted man accordingly drew bridle and the jingle and rattle betokened his profession though it was already too dark to see him clearly  hallo he said been buying this trail up stranger  no said witham quietly though he still held his team across the way still ive got the same right as any other citizen to walk or drive along it without anybody prowling after me and just now i want to know if there is a reason i should be favoured with your company  the trooper laughed a little i guess there is its down in the orders that whoevers on patrol near the settlement should keep his eye on you you see if you lit out of here we would want to know just where you were going to  i am said witham a canadian citizen and i came out here for quietness  well said the other youre an american too anyway when you were in a tight place down in regent there you told the boys so now no sensible man would boast of being a britisher unless it was helping him to play out his hand  witham kept his temper i want a straight answer can you tell me what you and the boys are trailing me for  no said the trooper still i guess our commander could if you dont know of any reason you might ask him  witham tightened his grip on the reins ill ride back with you to the outpost now  the trooper shook his bridle and trotted behind the sleigh while as it swung up and down over the billowy rises of the prairie witham became sensible of a curious expectancy the bare hopeless life he had led seemed to have slipped behind him and though he suspected that there was no great difference between his escort and a prisoners guard the old love of excitement he once fancied he had outgrown for ever awoke again within him anything that was different from the past would be a relief and the man who had for eight long years of strenuous toil practised the grimmest selfdenial wondered with a quickening of all his faculties what the future that could not be more colourless might have in store for him  it was dark and very cold when they reached the wooden building but withams step was lighter and his spirits more buoyant than they had been for some months when handing the sleigh over to an orderly he walked into the guardroom where bronzed men in uniform glanced at him curiously then he was shown into a bare logwalled hall where a young man in blue uniform with a weatherdarkened face was writing at a table  ive been partly expecting a visit he said im glad to see you mr courthorne  witham laughed with a very good imitation of the outlaws recklessness and wondered the while because it cost him no effort he who had throughout the last two adverse seasons seldom smiled at all and then but grimly experienced the same delight in an adventure that he had done when he came out to canada  i dont know that i can return the compliment just yet he said i have one or two things to ask you  the young soldier smiled goodhumouredly as he flung a cigar case on the table oh sit down and shake those furs off he said im not a worrying policeman and were white men anyway if youd been twelve months in this forsaken place youd know what im feeling take a smoke and start in with your questions when you feel like it  witham lighted a cigar flung himself down in a hide chair and stretched out his feet towards the stove in the first place i want to know why your boys are shadowing me you see you couldnt arrest me unless our folks in the dominion had got their papers through  the officer nodded no we couldnt lay hands on you and we only had orders to see where you went to when you left this place so the folks there could corral you if they got the papers thats about the size of it at present but as ive sent a trooper over to regent ill know more tomorrow  witham laughed it may appear a little astonishing but i havent the faintest notion why the police in canada should worry about me is there any reason you shouldnt tell me  the officer looked at him thoughtfully bluff im quite smart at it myself he said  no and witham shook his head its a straight question i want to know  well said the other it couldnt do much harm if i told you you were running whisky a little while ago and though the folks didnt seem to suspect it you had a farmer or a rancher for a partnerit appears he has mixed up things for you  witham and the farmer turned to roll the cigar which did not need it between his fingers  thats the man said his companion well though i guess its no news to you the police came down upon your friends at a rivercrossing and farmer witham put a bullet into a young trooper shannon i fancy  witham sat upright and the blood that surged to his forehead sank from it suddenly and left his face grey with anger  good lord he said hoarsely he killed him  yes sir said the officer killings not quite the word because one shot would have been enough to free him of the lad and the rancher fired twice into him they figured from the way the trooper was lying and the footprints that he meant to finish him  the farmers face was very grim as he said they were sure it was witham  yes and the soldier watched him curiously anyway they were sure of his horse and it was withams rifle another trooper nearly got him and he left it behind him it wasnt killing for the trooper dont seem to have had a show at all and im glad to see it makes you kind of sick only that one of the troopers allows he was trailing you at a time which shows you had no hand in the thing you wouldnt be sitting there smoking that cigar  it was almost a minute before witham could trust his voice then he said slowly and what do they want me for  i guess they dont quite know whether they do or not said the officer they crawl slow in canada in the meanwhile they wanted to know where you were so they could take out papers if anything turned up against you  and witham said the farmer  got away with a trooper close behind him the rest of them had headed him off from the prairie and he took to the river went through the ice and drowned himself though as there was a blizzard nobody quite saw the end of him and in case there was any doubt theyve got a warrant out farmer withams dead and if he isnt he soon will be for the troopers have got their net right across the prairie and the canadians dont fool time away as we do when it comes to hanging anybody the tale seems to have worried you  witham sat rigidly still and silent for almost a minute then he rose up with a curious little shake of his shoulders  and farmer withams dead well he had a hard life i knew him rather well he said thank you for the story on my word this is the first time ive heard it and now its time i was going  the officer laughed a little sit right down again now theres something about you that makes me like you and as i cant talk to the boys ill give you the best supper we can raise in the whole forsaken country and you can camp here until tomorrow its an arrangement that will meet the views of everybody because ill know whether the canadians want you or not in the morning  witham did not know what prompted him to agree but it all seemed part of a purpose that impelled him against his reasoning will and he sat still beside the stove while his host went out to give orders respecting supper and the return of the sleigh he was also glad to be alone for a while for now and then a fit of anger shook him as he saw how he had been duped by courthorne he had heard shannons story and remembering it could fancy that courthorne had planned the troopers destruction with a devilish cunning that recognized by what means the blame could be laid upon a guiltless man withams face became mottled with grey again as he realized that if he revealed his identity he had nothing but his word to offer in proof of his innocence  still it was anger and not fear that stirred him for nobody could arrest a man who was dead and there was no reason that would render it undesirable for him to remain so his farm would when sold realize the money borrowed upon it and the holder of the mortgage had received a profitable interest already had the unforeseen not happened witham would have held out to the end of the struggle but now he had no regret that this was out of the question fate had been too strong for him as farmer witham but it might deal more kindly with him as the outlaw courthorne he could also make a quick decision and when the officer returned to say that supper was ready he rose with a smile  they sat down to a meal that was barbaric in its simplicity and abundance for men live and eat in homeric fashion in the northwest while when the green tea was finished and the officer pushed the whisky across his guest laughed as he filled his glass  heres better fortune to farmer witham he said  the officer stared at him no sir he said if the old folks taught me aright withams in  a curious smile flickered in the farmers eyes no he said slowly he was tolerably near it once or twice when he was alive and because of what he went through then there may be something better in store for him  his companion appeared astonished but said nothing further until he brought out the cards they played for an hour beside the snapping stove and then when witham flung a trump away the officer groaned  i guess he said disgustedly youre not well tonight or something is worrying you  witham looked up with a little twinkle in his eyes i dont know that theres very much wrong with me  then said the officer decisively if the boys down at regent know enough to remember what trumps are youre not lance courthorne now after what id heard of you id have put up fifty dollars for the pleasure of watching your gameand its not worth ten cents when ive seen it  witham laughed sit down and talk he said one isnt always in his usual form and there are folks who get famous too easily  they talked until nearly midnight sitting close to the stove while a doleful wind that moaned without drove the dust of snow pattering against the windows and the shadows grew darker in the corners of the great logwalled room each time the icy draughts set the lamp flickering then the officer rising expressed the feelings of his guest as he said its a forsaken country and im thankful one can sleep and forget it  he had however an honourable calling and a welcome from friend and kinsman awaiting him when he went east again to revel in the life of the cities but the man who followed him silently to the sleepingroom had nothing but a halfinstinctive assurance that the future could not well be harder or more lonely than the past had been still farmer witham was a man of courage with a quiet belief in himself and in ten minutes he was fast asleep  when he came down to breakfast his host was already seated with a bundle of letters before him and one addressed to courthorne lay unopened by withams plate the officer nodded when he saw him  the trooper has come in with the mail and your friends in canada are not going to worry you he said now if you feel like staying here a few days it would be a favour to me  witham had in the meanwhile opened the envelope he knew that when once the decision was made there could only be peril in halfmeasures and his eyes grew thoughtful as he read the letter had been written by a winnipeg lawyer from a little town not very far away and requested courthorne to meet and confer with him respecting certain suggestions made by a colonel barrington witham decided to take the risk  im sorry but i have got to go into annerly at once he said  then said the officer ill drive you ive some stores to get down there  they started after breakfast but it was dusk next day when they reached the little town and witham walked quietly into a private room of the wooden hotel where a middleaged man with a shrewd face sat waiting him the big nickelled lamp flickered in the draughts that found their way in and witham was glad of it though he was outwardly very collected the stubborn patience and selfcontrol with which he had faced the loss of his wheat crops and frozen stock stood him in good stead now he fancied the lawyer seemed a trifle astonished at his appearance and sat down wondering whether he had previously spoken to courthorne until the question was answered for him  although i have never had the pleasure of meeting you before i have acted as colonel barringtons legal adviser ever since he settled at silverdale and am therefore well posted as to his affairs which are of course connected with those of your own family said the lawyer we can accordingly talk with greater freedom and i hope without the acerbity which in your recent communications somewhat annoyed the colonel  well said courthorne who had never heard of colonel barrington i am ready to listen  the lawyer drummed on the table it might be best to come to the point at once he said colonel barrington does not deem it convenient that you should settle at silverdale and would be prepared to offer you a reasonable sum to relinquish your claim  my claim said witham who remembered having heard of the silverdale colony which lay several hundred miles away  of course said the lawyer the legacy lately left you by roger courthorne i have brought you a schedule of the wheat in store and amounts due to you on various sales made you will also find the acreage stock and implements detailed at a wellknown appraisers valuation which you could of course confirm and colonel barrington would hand you a cheque for half the total now he however asks four years to pay the balance which would carry bank interest in the meanwhile in  witham who was glad of the excuse spent at least ten minutes studying the paper and realized that it referred to a large and wellappointed farm though it occurred to him that the crop was a good deal smaller than it should have been he noticed this as it were instinctively for his brain was otherwise very busy  colonel barrington seems somewhat anxious to get rid of me he said you see this land is mine by right  yes said the lawyer colonel barrington does not dispute it though i am of opinion that he might have done so under one clause of the will i do not think we need discuss his motives  witham moistened his lips with his tongue and his lips quivered a little he had hitherto been an honest man and now it was impossible for him to take the money it however appeared equally impossible to reveal his identity and escape the halter and he felt that the dead man had wronged him horribly he was entitled at least to safety by way of compensation for by passing as courthorne he would avoid recognition as witham  still i do not know how i have offended colonel barrington he said  i would sooner said the lawyer not go into that it is i fancy fifteen years since colonel barrington saw you but he desired me to find means of tracing your canadian record and did not seem pleased with it nor at the risk of offending you could i deem him unduly prejudiced  in fact said witham dryly this man who has not seen me for fifteen years is desirous of withholding what is mine from me at almost any cost  the lawyer nodded there is nothing to be gained by endeavouring to controvert it colonel barrington is also as you know a somewhat determined gentleman  witham laughed for he was essentially a stubborn man and felt little kindliness towards any one connected with courthorne as the colonel evidently was  i fancy i am not entirely unlike him in that respect he said what you have told me makes me the more determined to follow my own inclinations is there any one else at silverdale prejudiced against me  the lawyer fell into the trap miss barrington of course takes her brothers view and her niece would scarcely go counter to them she must have been a very young girl when she last saw you but from what i know of her character i should expect her to support the colonel  well said witham i want to think over the thing we will talk again tomorrow you would require me to establish my identity anyway  the fact that a famous inquiry agent has traced your movements down to a week or two ago and told me where to find you will render that simple said the lawyer dryly  witham sat up late that night turning over the papers the lawyer left him and thinking hard it was evident that in the meanwhile he must pass as courthorne but as the thought of taking the money revolted him the next step led to the occupation of the dead mans property the assumption of it would apparently do nobody a wrong while he felt that courthorne had taken so much from him that the farm at silverdale would be a very small reparation it was not he saw a great inheritance but one that in the right hands could be made profitable and witham who had fought a plucky fight with obsolete and worthless implements and indifferent teams felt that he could do a great deal with what was as it were thrust upon him at silverdale it was not avarice that tempted him though he knew he was tempted now but a longing to find a fair outlet for his energies and show what once given the chance that most men had he could do he had stinted himself and toiled almost as a beast of burden but now he could use his brains in place of wringing the last effort out of overtaxed muscle he had also during the long struggle lost to some extent his clearness of vision and only saw himself as a lonely man fighting for his own hand with fate against him now when prosperity was offered him it seemed but folly to stand aside when he could stretch out a strong hand and take it  during the last hour he sat almost motionless the issue hung in the balance and he laid himself down still undecided still he had lived long in primitive fashion in close touch with the soil and sank as most men would have done into restful sleep the sun hung red above the rim of the prairie when he awakened and going down to breakfast found the lawyer waiting for him  you can tell colonel barrington im coming to silverdale he said  the lawyer looked at him curiously would there be any use in asking you to consider  witham laughed no he said now i rather like the way you talked to me and if it wouldnt be disloyalty to the colonel i should be pleased if you would undertake to put me in due possession of my property  he said nothing further and the lawyer sat down to write colonel barrington  mr courthorne proves obdurate he said he is however by no means the type of man i expected to find and i venture to surmise that you will eventually discover him to be a less undesirable addition to silverdale than you are at present inclined to fancy     chapter viii  witham comes to silverdale   there were warmth and brightness in the cedarboarded general room of silverdale grange and most of the company gathered there basked in it contentedly after their drive through the bitter night those who came from the homesteads lying farthest out had risked frostnipped hands and feet for when colonel barrington held a levee at the grange nobody felt equal to refusing his invitation neither scorching heat nor utter cold might excuse compliance with the wishes of the founder of silverdale and it was not until dane the big middleaged bachelor had spoken very plainly that he consented to receive his guests in time of biting frost dressed otherwise than as they would have appeared in england  dane was the one man in the settlement who dare remonstrate with its ruler but it was a painful astonishment to the latter when he said in answer to one invitation i have never been frostbitten sir and i stand the cold well but one or two of the lads are weak in the chest and this climate was never intended for bareshouldered women hence if i come i shall dress myself to suit it  colonel barrington stared at him for almost a minute and then shook his head have it your own way he said understand that in itself i care very little for dress but it is only by holding fast to every traditional nicety we can prevent ourselves sinking into western barbarism and i am horribly afraid of the thin end of the wedge  dane having gained his point said nothing further for he was one of the wise and silent men who know when to stop and that evening he sat in a corner watching his leader thoughtfully for there was anxiety in the colonels face barrington sat silent near the ample hearth whose heat would scarcely have kept water from freezing but for the big stove and disdaining the dispensation made his guests he was clad conventionally though the smooth black fabric clung about him more tightly than it had once been intended to do his sister stood with the stamp of a not wholly vanished beauty still clinging to her gentle face talking to one or two matrons from outlying farms and his niece by a little table turning over eastern photographs with a few young girls she too wore black in deference to the colonels taste which was sombre and the garment she had laughed at as a compromise left uncovered a narrow strip of ivory shoulder and enhanced the polished whiteness of her neck a slender string of pearls gleamed softly on the satiny skin but maud barrington wore no other adornment and did not need it she had inherited the courthorne comeliness and the barringtons she sprang from on her fathers side had always borne the stamp of distinction  a young girl sat at the piano singing in a thin reedy voice while an english lad waited with illconcealed jealousy of a too officious companion to turn over the music by her side other men mostly young with weatherbronzed faces picturesque in embroidered deerskin or velvet lounge jackets were scattered about the room and all were waiting for the eightoclock dinner which replaced the usual prairie supper at silverdale they were growers of wheat who combined a good deal of amusement with a little not very profitable farming and most of them possessed a large share of insular english pride and a somewhat depleted exchequer  presently dane crossed over and sat down by colonel barrington you are silent sir and not looking very well tonight he said  barrington nodded gravely for he had a respect for the one man who occasionally spoke plain truth to him the fact is i am growing old he said and then added with what was only an apparent lack of connexion wheat is down three cents and money tighter than ever  dane looked thoughtful and noticed the older mans glance in his nieces direction as he said i am afraid there are difficult times before us  i have no doubt we shall weather them as we have done before said the colonel still i cant help admitting that just now i feela little tiredand am commencing to think we should have been better prepared for the struggle had we worked a trifle harder during the recent era of prosperity i could wish there were older heads on the shoulders of those who will come after me  just then maud barrington glanced at them and dane who could not remember having heard his leader talk in that fashion before and could guess his anxieties was a little touched as he noticed his attempt at sprightliness as it happened one of the lads at the piano commenced a song of dogs and horses that had little to recommend it but the brave young voice  they have the right spirit sir he said  of course said barrington they are english lads but i think a little more is required thank god we have not rated the dollar too high but it is possible we have undervalued its utility and i fear i have only taught them to be gentlemen  that is a good deal sir dane said quietly  it is still a gentleman in the restricted sense is somewhat of an anachronism on the prairie and it is too late to begin again in the usual course of nature i must lay down my charge presently and that is why i feel the want of a more capable successor whom they would follow because of his connexion with mine and me  dane looked thoughtful if i am not taking a libertyyou still consider the one apparently born to fill the place quite unsuitable  yes said barrington quietly i fear there is not a redeeming feature in courthornes character  neither said anything further until there was a tapping at the door and though this was a most unusual spectacle on the prairie a trim english maid in whitebanded dress stood in the opening  mr courthorne miss barrington she said  now silverdale had adopted one western custom in that no chance guest was ever kept waiting and the music ceased suddenly while the stillness was very suggestive when a man appeared in the doorway he wore one of the scandinavian leather jackets which are not uncommon in that country and when his eyes had become accustomed to the light moved forward with a quiet deliberation that was characterized neither by graceful ease nor the restraint of embarrassment his face was almost the colour of a blackfoots his eyes steady and grey but those of the men who watched him were next moment turned upon the colonels sister who rose to receive him slight silverhaired and faded but still stamped with a simple dignity that her ancient silks and lace curiously enhanced then there was a silence that could be felt for all realized that a good deal depended on the strangers first words and the fashion of his reception  witham as it happened felt this too and something more it was eight years since he had stood before an english lady and he surmised that there could not be many to compare with this one while after his grim lonely life an intangible something that seemed to emanate from her gracious serenity compelled his homage then as she smiled at him and held out her hand he was for a moment sensible of an almost overwhelming confusion it passed as suddenly for this was a man of quick perceptions and remembering that courthorne had now and then displayed some of the grace of bygone days he yielded to a curious impulse and stooping kissed the little withered fingers  i have he said to thank you for a welcome that does not match my poor deserts madam  then dane standing beside his leader saw the grimness grow a trifle less marked in his eyes it is in the blood he said half aloud but dane heard him and afterwards remembered it  in the meanwhile miss barrington had turned from the stranger to her niece it is a very long time since you have seen lance maud and though i knew his mother well i am less fortunate because this is our first meeting she said i wonder if you still remember my niece  now witham had been gratified by his first success and was about to venture on the answer that it was impossible to forget but when he turned towards the very stately young woman in the long black dress whose eyes had a sardonic gleam and wondered whether he had ever seen anybody so comely or less inclined to be companionable it was borne in upon him that any speech of the kind would be distinctly out of place accordingly and because there was no hand held out in this case he contented himself with a little bend of his head then he was presented to the colonel who was distantly cordial and witham was thankful when the maid appeared in the doorway again to announce that dinner was ready miss barrington laid her hand upon his arm  you will put up with an old womans company tonight she said  witham glanced down deprecatingly at his attire i must explain that i had no intention of trespassing on your hospitality he said i purposed going on to my own homestead and only called to acquaint colonel barrington with my arrival  miss barrington laughed pleasantly that she said was neither dutiful nor friendly i should have fancied you would also have desired to pay your respects to my niece and me  witham was not quite sure what he answered but he drew in a deep breath for he had made the plunge and felt that the worst was over his companion evidently noticed the gasp of relief  it was somewhat of an ordeal she said  witham looked down upon her gravely and miss barrington noticed a steadiness in his eyes she had not expected to see it was and i feel guilty because i was horribly afraid he said now i only wonder if you will always be equally kind to me  miss barrington smiled a little but the man fancied there was just a perceptible tightening of the hand upon his arm i would like to be for your mothers sake she said  witham understood that while courthornes iniquities were not to be brought up against him the little gentlevoiced lady had but taken him on trial but perhaps because it was so long since any woman had spoken kindly words to him his heart went out towards her and he felt a curious desire to compel her good opinion then he found himself seated near the head of the long table with maud barrington on his other hand and had an uncomfortable feeling that most of the faces were turned somewhat frequently in his direction it is also possible that he would have betrayed himself had he been burdened with selfconsciousness but the long bitter struggle he had fought alone had purged him of petty weaknesses and left him the closer grasp of essential things with the strength of character which is one and the same in all men who possess it whatever may be their upbringing  during a lull in the voices maud barrington who may have felt it incumbent on her to show him some scant civility turned towards him as she said i am afraid our conversation will not appeal to you partly because there is so little else to interest us we talk wheat throughout the year at silverdale  well said witham with a curious little smile wheat as a topic is not quite new to me in fact i know almost more about cereals than some folks would care to do  in the shape of elevator warrants or winnipeg market margins presumably  withams eyes twinkled though he understood the implication no he said the wheat i handled was in 250pound bags and i occasionally grew somewhat tired of pitching them into a wagon while my speculations usually consisted in committing it to the prairie soil in the hope of reaping forty bushels to the acre and then endeavouring to be content with ten it is conceivable that operations on the winnipeg market are less laborious as well as more profitable but i have no opportunity of trying them  miss barrington looked at him steadily and witham felt the blood surge to his forehead as he remembered having heard of a certain venture made by courthorne which brought discredit on one or two men connected with the affairs of a grain elevator it was evident that miss barrington had also heard of it and no man cares to stand convicted of falsification in the eyes of a very pretty girl still he roused himself with an effort  it is neither wise nor charitable to believe all one hears he said  the girl smiled a little but the man still winced inwardly under her clear brown eyes that would he fancied have been very scornful had they been less indifferent  i do not remember mentioning having heard anything she said were you not a trifle premature in face of the proverb  withams face was a trifle grim though he laughed im afraid i was but i am warned he said excuses are after all not worth much and when i make my defence it will be before a more merciful judge  maud barringtons curiosity was piqued lance courthorne outcast and gambler was at least a different stamp of man from the type she had been used to and being a woman the romance that was interwoven with his somewhat iniquitous career was not without its attractions for her  i did not know that you included farming among your talents and should have fancied you would have found itmonotonous she said  i did and the provoking smile still flickered in withams eyes are not all strictly virtuous occupations usually so  it is probably a question of temperament i have of course heard sardonic speeches of the kind before and felt inclined to wonder whether those who made them were qualified to form an opinion  witham nodded but there was a little ring in his voice perhaps i laid myself open to the thrust but have you any right to assume i have never followed a commendable profession  no answer was immediately forthcoming but witham did wisely when in place of waiting he turned to miss barrington he had left her niece irritated but the trace of anger she felt was likely to enhance her interest the meal however was a trial to him for he had during eight long years lived for the most part apart from all his kind a lonely toiler and now was constrained to personate a man known to be almost dangerously skilful with his tongue at first sight the task appeared almost insuperably difficult but witham was a clever man and felt all the thrill of one playing a risky game just then perhaps it was due to excitement that a readiness he had never fancied himself capable of came to him in his need and when at last the ladies rose he felt that he had not slipped perilously still he found how dry his lips had grown when somebody poured him a glass of wine then he became sensible that colonel barrington who had apparently been delivering a lengthy monologue was addressing him  the outlook is sufficient to cause us some anxiety he said we are holding large stocks and i can see no prospect of anything but a steady fall in wheat it is however presumably a little too soon to ask your opinion  well said witham while i am prepared to act upon it i would recommend it to others with some diffidence no money can be made at present by farming but i see no reason why we should not endeavour to cut our losses by selling forward down if caught by a sudden rally we could fall back on the grain we hold  there was a sudden silence until dane said softly that is exactly what one of the cleverest brokers in winnipeg recommended  i think said colonel barrington you heard my answer i am inclined to fancy that such a measure would not be advisable or fitting mr courthorne you however presumably know very little about the practical aspect of the wheat question  witham smiled on the contrary i know a great deal  you do said barrington sharply and while a blunderer would have endeavoured to qualify his statement witham stood by it  you are evidently not aware sir that i have tried my hand at farming though not very successfully  that at least said barrington dryly as he rose is quite credible  when they went into the smaller room witham crossed over to where maud barrington sat alone and looked down upon her gravely one discovers that frankness is usually best he said now i would not like to feel that you had determined to be unfriendly with me  maud barrington fixed a pair of clear brown eyes upon his face and the faintest trace of astonishment crept into them she was a woman with high principles but neither a fool nor a prude and she saw no sign of dissolute living there the mans gaze was curiously steady his skin clear and brown and his sinewy form suggested a capacity for and she almost fancied an acquaintance with physical toil yet he had already denied the truth to her witham on his part saw a very fair face with wholesome pride in it and felt that the eyes which were coldly contemptuous now could if there was a warrant for it grow very gentle  would it be of any moment if i were she said  yes said witham quietly there are two people here it is desirable for me to stand well with and the first of them your aunt has i fancy already decided to give me a fair trial she told me it was for my mothers sake now i can deal with your uncle  the girl smiled a little are you quite sure everybody does not find it easy to get on with colonel barrington his code is somewhat draconic  witham nodded he is a man and i hope to convince him i have at least a right to toleration that leaves only you the rest dont count they will come round by and by you see  the little forceful gesture with which he concluded pleased maud barrington it was free from vanity but conveyed an assurance that he knew his own value  no friendship that is lightly given is worth very much she said i could decide better in another six months now it is perhaps fortunate that colonel barrington is waiting for us to make up his four at whist  witham allowed a faint gesture of dismay to escape him must i play  yes said the girl smiling whist is my uncles hobby and he is enthusiastic over a clever game  witham groaned inwardly and i am a fool at whist  then it was poker you played and again a faint trace of anger crept into the girls eyes  witham shook his head no he said i had few opportunities of indulging in expensive luxuries  i think we had better take our places said maud barrington with unveiled contempt  withams forehead grew a trifle hot and when he sat down barrington glanced at him i should explain that we never allow stakes of any kind at silverdale he said some of the lads sent out to me have been a trifle extravagant in the old country  he dealt out the cards but a trace of bewildered irritation crept into his eyes as the game proceeded and once or twice he appeared to check an exclamation of astonishment while at last he glanced reproachfully at witham  my dear sir still you have ridden a long way he said laying his finger on a king  witham laughed to hide his dismay i am sorry sir it was scarcely fair to my partner you would however have beaten us anyway  barrington gravely gathered up the cards we will he said have some music i do not play poker  then for the first time witham lost his head in his anger nor do i sir  barrington only looked at him but the farmer felt as though somebody had struck him in the face and as soon as he conveniently could bade miss barrington good night  but we expected you would stay here a day or two your place is not ready she said  witham smiled at her i think i am wise i must feel my way  miss barrington was won and making no further protest signed to dane you will take mr courthorne home with you she said i would have kept him here but he is evidently anxious to talk over affairs with some one more of his age than my brother is  dane appeared quite willing and an hour later witham sat cigar in hand in a room of his outlying farm it was furnished simply but there were signs of taste and the farmer who occupied it had already formed a good opinion of the man whose knowledge of his own profession astonished him  so you are actually going to sell wheat in face of the colonels views he said  of course said witham simply i dont like unpleasantness but i can allow no man to dictate my affairs to me  dane grinned well he said the colonel can be nasty and he has no great reason for being fond of you already  no said witham now of course my accession will make a difference at silverdale but i would consider it a friendly act if you will let me know the views of the colony  dane looked thoughtful the trouble is that your taking up the land leaves less for maud barrington than there would have been barrington who is fond of the girl was trustee for the property and after yourestrangementfrom your father everybody expected she would get it all  so i have deprived miss barrington of part of her income  of course said dane didnt you know  witham found it difficult to answer i never quite realized it before are there more accounts against me  that said dane slowly is rather a facer we are all more or less friends of the dominant family you see  witham laid down his cigar and stood up now he said i generally talk straight and you have held out a hand to me can you believe in the apparent improbability of such a man as i am in the opinion of the folks at silverdale getting tired of a wasted life and trying to walk straight again i want your answer yes or no before i head across the prairie for my own place  sit down said dane with a little smile do you think i would have brought you here if i hadnt believed it and if i have my way the first man who flings a stone will be sorry for it still i dont think any of them willor could afford it if we had all been saints some of us would never have come out from the old country  he stopped and poured out two glasses of wine its a long while since ive talked so much he said heres to our better acquaintance courthorne  after that they talked wheatgrowing and horses and when his guest retired dane still sat smoking thoughtfully beside the stove we want a man with nerve and brains he said i fancy the one who has been sent us will make a difference at silverdale  it was about the same time when colonel barrington stood talking with his niece and sister in silverdale grange and the man threw that trick away when it was absolutely clear who had the aceand wished me to believe that he forgot he said  his face was flushed with indignation but miss barrington smiled at her niece what is your opinion maud  the girl moved one white shoulder with a gesture of disdain can you askafter that besides he twice wilfully perverted facts while he talked to me though it was not in the least necessary  miss barrington looked thoughtful and yet because i was watching him i do not think he plays cards well  but he was a professional gambler said the girl  the elder lady shook her head so weheard she said my dear give him a little time i have seen many men and womenand cant help a fancy that there is good in him  can the leopard change his spots asked colonel barrington with a grim smile  the little whitehaired lady glanced at him as she said quietly when the wicked man     chapter ix  an armistice   the dismal afternoon was drawing in when witham driving home from the railroad came into sight of a lonely farm it lifted itself out of the prairie a blur of huddled buildings on the crest of a long rise but at first sight witham scarcely noticed it he was gazing abstractedly down the sinuous smear of trail which unrolled itself like an endless riband across the great white desolation and his brain was busy four months had passed since he came to silverdale and they had left their mark on him  at first there had been the constant fear of detection and when that had lessened and he was accepted as lance courthorne the latters unfortunate record had met him at every turn it accounted for the suspicions of colonel barrington the reserve of his niece and the aloofness of some of his neighbours while there had been times when witham found silverdale almost unendurable he was however an obstinate man and there was on the opposite side the gracious kindliness of the little greyhaired lady who had from the beginning been his champion and the friendship of dane and one or two of the older men witham had also proved his right to be listened to and treated outwardly at least with due civility while something in his resolute quietness rendered an impertinence impossible he knew by this time that he could hold his own at silverdale and based his conduct on the fact but that was only one aspect of the question and he speculated as to the consummation  it was however evident that in the meanwhile he must continue to pose as courthorne and he felt rightly or wrongly that the possession of his estate was after all a small reparation for the injury the outlaw had done him but the affair was complicated by the fact that in taking courthornes inheritance he had deprived maud barrington of part of hers the girls coldness stung him but her unquestionable beauty and strength of character had not been without their effect and the man winced as he remembered that she had no pity for anything false or mean he had decided only upon two things first that he would vindicate himself in her eyes and since nobody else could apparently do it pull the property that should have been hers out of the ruin it had been drifting into under her uncles guardianship when this had been done and the killing of trooper shannon forgotten it would be time for him to slip back into the obscurity he came from  then the fact that the homestead was growing nearer forced itself upon his perceptions and he glanced doubtfully across the prairie as he approached the forking of the trail a grey dimness was creeping across the wilderness and the smoky sky seemed to hang lower above the dully gleaming snow while the moaning wind flung little clouds of icy dust about him it was evident that the snow was not far away and it was still two leagues to silverdale but witham who had been to winnipeg had business with the farmer and had faced a prairie storm before accordingly he swung the team into the forking trail and shook the reins there was he knew little time to lose and in another five minutes he stood still wearing his whitesprinkled furs in a room of the birchlog building  here are your accounts macdonald and while weve pulled up our losses i cant help thinking we have just got out in time he said the market is but little stiffer yet but there is less selling and before a few months are over were going to see a sharp recovery  the farmer glanced at the documents and smiled with contentment as he took the cheque im glad i listened to you he said its unfortunate for him and his niece that barrington wouldntat least not until he had lost the opportunity  i dont understand said witham  no said the farmer youve been away well you know it takes a long while to get an idea into the colonels head but once its in its even harder to get it out again now barrington looked down on wheat jobbing but moneys tight at silverdale and when he saw what you were making he commenced to think accordingly hes going to sell and as he seems convinced that wheat will not go up again let half the acreage lie fallow this season the worst of it is the others will follow him up and he controls maud barringtons property as well as his own  withams face was grave i heard in winnipeg that most of the smaller men who had lost courage were doing the same thing that means a very small crop of western hard and millers paying our own prices somebody must stop the colonel  well said macdonald dryly i wouldnt like to be the man and after all its only your opinion as you have seen the small men here and in minnesota are afraid to plough  witham laughed softly the man who makes the dollars is the one who sees farther than the crowd anyway i found the views of one or two men who make big deals were much the same as mine and ill speak to miss barrington  then if you will wait a little you will have an opportunity she is here you see  witham looked disconcerted she should not have been why didnt you send her home therell be snow before she reaches silverdale  macdonald laughed i hadnt noticed the weather and though my wife wished her to stay there is no use in attempting to persuade miss barrington to do anything when she does not want to in some respects she is very like the colonel  the farmer led the way into another room and witham flushed a little when the girl returned his greeting in a fashion which he fancied the presence of mrs macdonald alone rendered distantly cordial still a glance through the windows showed him that delay was inadvisable  i think you had better stay here all night miss barrington he said there is snow coming  i am sorry our views do not coincide said the girl i have several things to attend to at the grange  then macdonald will keep your team and i will drive you home said witham mine are the best horses at silverdale and i fancy we will need all their strength  miss barrington looked up sharply there had been a little ring in withams voice but there was also a solicitude in his face which almost astonished her and when macdonald urged her to comply she rose leisurely  i will be ready in ten minutes she said  witham waited at least twenty very impatiently but when at last the girl appeared handed her with quiet deference into the sleigh and then took his place as far as the dimensions of the vehicle permitted apart from her once he fancied she noticed it with faint amusement but the horses knew what was coming and it was only when he pulled them up to a trot again on the slope of a rise that he found speech convenient  i am glad we are alone though i feel a little diffidence in asking a favour of you because unfortunately when i venture to recommend anything you usually set yourself against it he said this is in the language of this country tolerably straight  maud barrington laughed i could find no fault with it on the score of ambiguity  well said witham i believe your uncle is going to sell wheat for you and let a good deal of your land go out of cultivation now as you perhaps do not know the laws which govern the markets are very simple and almost immutable but the trouble is that a good many people do not understand their application  you apparently consider yourself an exception said the girl  witham nodded i do just now still i do not wish to talk about myself you see the people back there in europe must be fed and the latest news from wheatgrowing countries does not promise more than an average crop while half the fainthearted farmers here are not going to sow much this year therefore when the demand comes for western wheat there will be little to sell  but how is it that you alone see this isnt it a trifle egotistical  witham laughed cant we leave my virtues or the reverse out of the question i feel that i am right and want you to dissuade your uncle it would be even better if when i return to winnipeg you would empower me to buy wheat for you  maud barrington looked at him curiously i am a little perplexed as to why you should wish me to  no doubt said witham still is there any reason why i should be debarred the usual privilege of taking an interest in my neighbours affairs  no said the girl slowly but can you not see that it is out of the question that i should entrust you with this commission  withams hands closed on the reins and his face grew a trifle grim as he said from the point of view you evidently take i presume it is  a flush of crimson suffused the girls cheeks i never meant that and i can scarcely forgive you for fancying i did of course i could trust you withyou have made me use the wordthe dollars but you must realize that i could not do anything in public opposition to my uncles opinion  witham was sensible of a great relief but it did not appear advisable to show it there are so many things you apparently find it difficult to forgive meand we will let this one pass he said still i cannot help thinking that colonel barrington will have a good deal to answer for  maud barrington made no answer but she was sensible of a respect which appeared quite unwarranted for the drylyspoken man who though she guessed her words stung him now and then bore them without wincing while she sat silent shivering under her furs darkness crept down the smoky cloud dropped lower the horizon closed in as the grey obscurity rolled up to meet them across a rapidlynarrowing strip of snow then she could scarcely see the horses and the muffled drumming of their hoofs was lost in a doleful wail of wind it also seemed to her that the cold which was already almost insupportable suddenly increased as it not infrequently does in that country before the snow then a white powder was whirled into her face filling her eyes and searing the skin while when she could see anything again the horses were plunging at a gallop through a filmy haze and witham whitened all over leaned forward with lowered head hurling hoarse encouragement at them his voice reached her fitfully through the roar of wind until sight and hearing were lost alike as the white haze closed about them and it was not until the wild gust had passed she heard him again  he was apparently shouting come nearer  maud barrington was not sure whether she obeyed him or he seized and drew her towards him she however felt the furs piled high about her neck and that there was an arm round her shoulder and for a moment was sensible of an almost overwhelming revulsion from the contact she was proud and very dainty and fancied she knew what this man had been while now she was drawn in to his side and felt her chilled blood respond to the warmth of his body indeed she grew suddenly hot to the neck and felt that henceforward she could never forgive him or herself but the mood passed almost as swiftly for again the awful blast shrieked about them and she only remembered her companions humanity as the differences of sex and character vanished under that destroying cold they were no longer man and woman but only beings of flesh and blood clinging desperately to the life that was in them for the first rush of the western snowstorm has more than a physical effect and man exposed to its fury loses all but his animal instincts in the primitive struggle with the elements  then while the snow folded them closely in its white embrace during a lull the girl recovered herself and her strained voice was faintly audible  this is my fault why dont you tell me so she said  a hoarse laugh seemed to issue from the whitened object beside her and she was drawn closer to it again we neednt go into that just now you have one thing to do and that is to keep warm  one of the horses stumbled the grasp that was around her became relaxed and she heard the swish of the whip followed by hoarse expletives and did not resent it the man it seemed was fighting for her life as well as his own and even brutal virility was necessary after that there was a space of oblivion while the storm raged about them until when the wind fell a trifle it became evident that the horses had left the trail  you are off the track and will never make the grange unless you find it she said  witham seemed to nod we are not going there he said and if he added anything it was lost in the scream of a returning gust  again maud barringtons reason reasserted itself and remembering the mans history she became sensible of a curious dismay but it also passed and left her with the vague realization that he and she were actuated alike only by the desire to escape extinction presently she became sensible that the sleigh had stopped beside a formless mound of white and the man was shaking her  hold those furs about you while i lift you down he said  she did his bidding and did not shrink when she felt his arms about her while next moment she was standing kneedeep in the snow and the man shouting something she did not catch team and sleigh seemed to vanish and she saw her companion dimly for a moment before he was lost in the sliding whiteness too then a horrible fear came upon her  it seemed a very long while before he reappeared and thrust her in through what seemed to be a door then there was another waiting before the light of a lamp blinked out and she saw that she was standing in a little logwalled room with bare floor and a few trusses of straw in a corner there was also a rusty stove and a very small pile of billets beside it witham who had closed the door stood looking at them with a curious expression  where is the team she gasped  heading for a birch bluff or silverdale though i scarcely think they will get there said the man i have never stopped here and it wasnt astonishing they fancied the place a pile of snow while i was getting the furs out they slipped away from me  miss barrington now knew where they were the shanty was used by the remoter settlers as a halfway house where they slept occasionally on their long journey to the railroad and as there was a birch bluff not far away it was the rule that whoever occupied it should replace the fuel he had consumed the last man had however not been liberal  but what are we to do she asked with a little gasp of dismay  stay here until the morning said witham quietly unfortunately i cant even spare you my company the stable has fallen in and it would be death to stand outside you see in the meanwhile pull out some of the straw and put it in the stove  can you not do that asked miss barrington feeling that she must commence at once if she was to keep this man at a befitting distance  witham laughed oh yes but you will freeze if you stand still and these billets require splitting still if you have special objections to doing what i ask you you can walk up and down rapidly  the girl glanced at him a moment and then lowered her eyes of course i was wrong do you wish to hear that i am sorry  witham answering nothing swung an axe round his head and the girl kneeling beside the stove noticed the sinewy suppleness of his frame and the precision with which the heavy blade cleft the billets the axe she knew is by no means an easy tool to handle at last the red flame crackled and though she had not intended the question to be malicious there was a faint trace of irony in her voice as she asked is there any other thing you wish me to do  witham flung two bundles of straw down beside the stove and stood looking at her gravely yes he said i want you to sit down and let me wrap this sleigh robe about you  the girl submitted and did not shrink from his touch visibly when he drew the fur robe about her shoulders and packed the end of it round her feet still there was a faint warmth in her face and she was grateful for his unconcernedness  fate or fortune has placed me in charge of you until tomorrow and if the position is distasteful to you it is not my fault he said still i feel the responsibility and it would be a little less difficult if you could accept the fact tacitly  maud barrington would not have shivered if she could have avoided it but the cold was too great for her and she did not know whether she was vexed or pleased at the gleam of compassion in the mans grey eyes it was more eloquent than anything of the kind she had ever seen but it had gone and he was only quietly deferent when she glanced at him again  i will endeavour to be good she said and then flushed with annoyance at the adjective halfdazed by the cold as she was she could not think of a more suitable one witham however retained his gravity  now macdonald gave you no supper and he has dinner at noon he said i brought some eatables along and you must make the best meal you can  he opened a packet and laid it with a little silver flask upon her knee  i cannot eat all thisand it is raw spirit said maud barrington  witham laughed are you not forgetting your promise still we will melt a little snow into the cup  an icy gust swept in when he opened the door and it was only by a strenuous effort he closed it again while when he came back panting with the top of the flask a little colour crept into maud barringtons face i am sorry she said that at least is your due  i really dont want my due said witham with a deprecatory gesture as he laid the silver cup upon the stove cant we forget we are not exactly friends just for tonight if so you will drink this and commence at once on the provisionsto please me  maud barrington was glad of the reviving draught for she was very cold but presently she held out the packet  one really cannot eat many crackers at once will you help me  witham laughed as he took one of the biscuits if i had expected any one would share my meal i would have provided a better one still i have been glad to feast upon more unappetizing things occasionally  when were you unfortunate said the girl  witham smiled somewhat dryly i was unfortunate for six years on end  he was aware of the blunder when he had spoken but maud barrington appeared to be looking at the flask thoughtfully  the design is very pretty she said you got it in england  the man knew that it was the name f witham his companions eyes rested on but his face was expressionless yes he said it is one of the things they make for presentation in the old country  maud barrington noticed the absence of any attempt at explanation and having considerable pride of her own was sensible of a faint approval you are making slow progress she said with a slight but perceptible difference in her tone now you can have eaten nothing since breakfast  witham said nothing but by and by poured a little of the spirit into a rusty can and the girl who understood why he did so felt that it covered several of his offences now she said graciously you may smoke if you wish to  witham pointed to the few billets left and shook his head im afraid i must get more wood  the roar of the wind almost drowned his voice and the birch logs seemed to tremble under the impact of the blast while maud barrington shivered as she asked is it safe  it is necessary said witham with the little laugh she had already found reassuring  he had gone out in another minute and the girl felt curiously lonely as she remembered stories of men who had left their homesteads during a blizzard to see to the safety of the horses in a neighbouring stable and were found afterwards as still as the snow that covered them maud barrington was not unduly timorous but the roar of that awful icy gale would have stricken dismay into the hearts of most men and she found herself glancing with feverish impatience at a diminutive gold watch and wondering whether the cold had retarded its progress ten minutes passed very slowly lengthened to twenty more slowly still and then it flashed upon her that there was at least something she could do and scraping up a little of the snow that sifted in she melted it in the can then she set the flasktop upon the stove and once more listened for the mans footsteps very eagerly  she did not hear them but at last the door swung open and carrying a load of birch branches witham staggered in he dropped them strove to close the door and failed then leaned against it gasping with a livid face for there are few men who can withstand the cold of a snowladen gale at forty degrees below  how maud barrington closed the door she did not know but it was with a little imperious gesture she turned to the man  shake those furs at once she said and drawing him towards the stove held up the steaming cup now sit there and drink it  witham stooped and reached out for the can but the girl swept it off the stove oh i know the silver was for me she said still is this a time for trifles such as that  worn out by a very grim struggle witham did as he was bidden and looked up with a twinkle in his eyes when with the faintest trace of colour in her cheeks the girl sat down close to him and drew part of the fur robe about him  i really believe you were a little pleased to see me come back just now he said  was that quite necessary asked maud barrington still i was  witham made a little deprecatory gesture of course he said now we can resume our former footing tomorrow but in the meanwhile i would like to know why you are so hard upon me miss barrington because i really have not done much harm to any one at silverdale your auntand he made a little respectful inclination of his head which pleased the girlis at least giving me a fair trial  it is difficult to tell youbut it was your own doing said maud barrington at the beginning you prejudiced us when you told us you could only play cards indifferently it was so unnecessary and we knew a good deal about you  well said witham quietly i have only my word to offer and i wonder if you will believe me now but i dont think i ever won five dollars at cards in my life  maud barrington watched him closely but his tone carried conviction and again she was glad that he attempted no explanation i am quite willing to take it she said still you can understand  yes said witham it puts a strain upon your faith but some day i may be able to make a good deal that puzzles you quite clear  maud barrington glanced at the flask i wonder if that is connected with the explanation but i will wait now you have not lighted your cigar  witham understood that the topic was dismissed and sat thoughtfully still while the girl nestled against the birch logs close beside him under the same furs for the wind went through the building and the cold was unbearable a few feet from the stove the birch rafters shook above their heads and every now and then it seemed that a roaring gust would lift the roof from them still the stove glowed and snapped and close in about it there was a drowsy heat while presently the girls eyes grew heavy finallyfor there are few who can resist the desire for sleep in the cold of the northwesther head sank back and witham rising very slowly held his breath as he piled the furs about her that done he stooped and looked down upon her while the blood crept to his face maud barrington lay very still the long dark lashes resting on her coldtinted cheeks and the patrician serenity of her face was even more marked in her sleep then he turned away feeling like one who had committed a desecration knowing that he had looked too long already upon the sleeping girl who believed he had been an outcast and yet had taken his word for it was borne in upon him that a time would come when he would try her faith even more severely moving softly he paced up and down the room  witham afterwards wondered how many miles he walked that night for though the loghouse was not longer than thirty feet the cold bit deep but at last he heard a sigh as he glanced towards the stove and immediately swung round again when he next turned miss barrington stood upright a little flushed in face but otherwise very calm and the man stood still shivering in spite of his efforts and blue with cold the wind had fallen but the sting of the frost that followed it made itself felt beside the stove  you had only your deerskin jacketand you let me sleep under all the furs she said  witham shook his head and hoped he did not look as guilty as he felt when he remembered that it must have been evident to his companion that the furs did not get into the position they had occupied themselves  i only fancied you were a trifle drowsy and not inclined to talk he said with an absence of concern for which miss barrington who did not believe him felt grateful you seeand the inspiration was a trifle too evidenti was too sleepy to notice anything myself still i am glad you are awake now because i must make my way to the grange  but the snow will be ever so deep and i could not come said maud barrington  witham shook his head im afraid you must stay here but i will be back with colonel barrington in a few hours at latest  the girl deemed it advisable to hide her consternation but you might not find the trail she said the ravine would lead you to grahams homestead  still said witham slowly i am going to the grange  then maud barrington remembered and glanced aside from him it was evident this man thought of everything and she made no answer when witham who thrust more billets into the stove turned to her with a little smile  i think we need remember nothing when we meet again beyond the fact that you will give me a chance of showing that the lance courthorne whose fame you know has ceased to exist  then he went out and the girl stood with flushed cheeks looking down at the furs he had left behind him     chapter x  maud harringtons promise   daylight had not broken across the prairie when floundering through a foot of dusty snow witham reached the grange he was aching from fatigue and cold and the deerskin jacket stood out from his numbed body stiff with frost when leaning heavily on a table he awaited colonel barrington the latter on entering stared at him and then flung open a cupboard and poured out a glass of wine  drink that before you talk you look half dead he said  witham shook his head perhaps you had better hear me first  barrington thrust the glass upon him i could make nothing of what you told me while you speak like that drink it and then sit until you get used to the different temperature  witham drained the glass and sank limply into a chair as yet his face was colourless though his chilled flesh tingled horribly as the blood once more crept into the surface tissues then he fixed his eyes upon his host as he told his story barrington stood very straight watching his visitor but his face was drawn for the resolution which supported him through the day was less noticeable in the early morning and it was evident now at least that he was an old man carrying a heavy load of anxiety still as the story proceeded a little blood crept into his cheeks while witham guessed that he found it difficult to retain his grim immobility  i am to understand that an attempt to reach the grange through the snow would have been perilous he said  yes said witham quietly  the older man stood very still regarding him intently until he said i dont mind admitting that it was distinctly regrettable  witham stopped him with a gesture it was at least unavoidable sir the team would not face the snow and no one could have reached the grange alive  no doubt you did your bestand as a connexion of the family i am glad it was you stilland there are cases in which it is desirable to speak plainlythe affair which you will of course dismiss from your recollection is to be considered as closed now  witham smiled and a trace of irony he could not quite repress was just discernible in his voice i scarcely think that was necessary sir it is of course sufficient for me to have rendered a small service to the distinguished family which has given me an opportunity of proving my right to recognition and neither you nor miss barrington need have any apprehension that i will presume upon it  barrington wheeled round you have the courthorne temper at least and perhaps i deserved this display of it you acted with commendable discretion in coming straight to meand the astonishment i got drove the other aspect of the question out of my head if it hadnt been for you my niece would have frozen  im afraid i spoke unguardedly sir but i am very tired still if you will wait a few minutes i will get the horses out without troubling the hired man  barrington made a little gesture of comprehension and then shook his head you are fit for nothing further and need rest and sleep  you will want somebody sir said witham the snow is very loose and deep  he went out and barrington who looked after him with a curious expression in his face nodded twice as if in approval twenty minutes later he took his place in the sleigh that slid away from the grange which lay a league behind it when the sunrise flamed across the prairie the wind had gone and there was only a pitiless brightness and a devastating cold while the snow lay blown in wisps dried dusty and fine as flour by the frost it had no cohesion the runners sank in it and witham was almost waist deep when he dragged the floundering team through the drifts a day had passed since he had eaten anything worth mention but he held on with an endurance which his companion who was incapable of rendering him assistance wondered at there were belts of deep snow the almost buried sleigh must be dragged through and tracts from which the wind had swept the dusty covering leaving bare the grasses the runners would not slide over where the team came to a standstill and could scarcely be urged to continue the struggle  at last however the loghouse rose a lonely mound of whiteness out of the prairie and witham drew in a deep breath of contentment when a dusky figure appeared for a moment in the doorway his weariness seemed to fall from him and once more his companion wondered at the tirelessness of the man as floundering on foot beside them he urged the team through the powdery drifts beneath the big birch bluff witham did not go in however when they reached the house and when five minutes later maud barrington came out she saw him leaning with a drawn face against the sleigh he straightened himself suddenly at the sight of her but she had seen sufficient and her heart softened towards him whatever the mans history had been he had borne a good deal for her  the return journey was even more arduous and now and then maud barrington felt a curious throb of pity for the wornout man who during most of it walked beside the team but it was accomplished at last and she contrived to find means of thanking him alone when they reached the grange  witham shook his head and then smiled a little it isnt nice to make a bargain he said still it is less pleasant now and then to feel under an obligation though there is no reason why you should  maud barrington was not altogether pleased but she could not blind herself to facts and it was plain that there was an obligation i am afraid i cannot quite believe that but i do not see what you are leading to  withams eyes twinkled well he said reflectively i dont want you to fancy that last night commits you to any line of conduct in regard to me i only asked for a truce you see  maud barrington was a trifle nettled yes she said  then i want to show you how you can discharge any trifling obligation you may fancy you may owe me which of course would be more pleasant to you do not allow your uncle to sell any wheat forward for you and persuade him to sow every acre that belongs to you this spring  but however would this benefit you asked the girl  witham laughed i have a fancy that i can straighten up things at silverdale if i can get my way it would please me and i believe they want it of course a desire to improve anything appears curious in me  maud barrington was relieved of the necessity of answering for the colonel came up just then but moved by some sudden impulse she nodded as if in agreement  it was afternoon when she awakened from a refreshing sleep and descending to the room set apart for herself and her aunt sat thoughtfully still awhile in a chair beside the stove then stretching out her hand she took up a little case of photographs and slipped out one of them it was a portrait of a boy and pony but there was a significance in the fact that she knew just where to find it the picture was a good one and once more maud barrington noticed the arrogance which did not however seem out of place there in the lads face it was also a comely face but there was a hint of sensuality in it that marred its beauty then with a growing perplexity she compared it with that of the weary man who had plodded beside the team witham was not arrogant but resolute and there was no stamp of indulgence in his face indeed the girl had from the beginning recognized the virility in it that was tinged with asceticism and sprang from a simple strenuous life of toil in the wind and sun  just then there was a rustle of fabric and she laid down the photograph a moment too late as her aunt came in as it happened the elder ladys eyes rested on the picture and a faint flush of annoyance crept into the face of the girl it was scarcely perceptible but miss barrington saw it and though she felt tempted did not smile  i did not know you were down she said lance is still asleep he seemed very tired  yes said the girl that is very probable he left the railroad before daylight and had driven round to several farms before he came to macdonalds and he was very considerate he had made me take all the furs and i fancy walked up and down with nothing but his indoor clothing on all night long though the wind went through the building and one could scarcely keep alive a few feet from the stove  again the flicker of colour crept into the girls cheeks and the eyes that were keen as well as gentle noticed it  i think you owe him a good deal said miss barrington  yes said her niece with a little laugh which appeared to imply a trace of resentment i believe i do but he seemed unusually anxious to relieve me of that impression he was also good enough to hint that nothing he might have done need prevent me beingthe right word is a trifle difficult to findbut i fancy he meant unpleasant to him if i wished it  there was a little twinkle in miss barringtons eyes are you not a trifle hard to please my dear now if he had attempted to insist on a claim to your gratitude you would have resented it  of course said the girl reflectively still it is annoying to be debarred from offering it there are times aunt when i cant help wishing that lance courthorne had never come to silverdale there are men who leave nothing just as they found it and whom one cant ignore  miss barrington shook her head i fancy you are wrong he has offended after all  she was pleased to see her nieces face relax into a smile that expressed unconcern we are all exacting now and then said the girl still he made me promise to give him a fair trial which was not flattering because it suggested that i had been unnecessarily harsh and then hinted this morning that he had no intention of holding me to it it really was not gratifying to find he held the concession he asked for of so small account you are however as easily swayed by trifles as i am because lance can do no wrong since he kissed your hand  i really think i liked him the better for it said the little silverhaired lady the respect was not assumed but wholly genuine you see and whether i was entitled to it or not it was a good deal in lances favour that he should offer it to me there must be some good in the man who can be moved to reverence anything even if he is mistaken  no man with any sense could help adoring you said maud barrington still i wonder why you believe i was wrong in wishing he had not come to silverdale  miss barrington looked thoughtful i will tell you my dear there are few better men than my brother but his thoughts and the traditions he is bound by are those of fifty years ago while the restless life of the prairie is a thing of today we have fallen too far behind it at silverdale and a crisis is coming that none of us are prepared for even dane is scarcely fitted to help my brother to face it and the rest are either overfond of their pleasure or untrained boys brave lads they are but none of them have been taught that it is only by mental strain or the ceaseless toil of his body the man without an inheritance can win himself a competence now this is why they want a leader who has known hardship and hunger instead of ease and won what he holds with his own hand in place of having it given him  you fancy we could find one in such a man as lance has been  miss barrington looked grave i believe the prodigal was afterwards a better as well as a wiser man than the one who stayed at home and i am not quite sure that lances history is so nearly like that of the son in the parable as we have believed it to be a residence in the sty is apt to leave a stain which i have not though i have looked for it found on him  the eyes of the two women met and though nothing more was said each realized that the other was perplexed by the same question while the girl was astonished to find her vague suspicions shared while they sat silent colonel barrington came in  i am glad to see you looking so much better maud he said with a trace of embarrassment courthorne is resting still now i cant help feeling that we have been a trifle more distant than was needful with him the man has really behaved very discreetly i mean in everything  this was a great admission and miss barrington smiled did it hurt you very much to tell us that she asked  the colonel laughed i know what you mean and if you put me on my mettle ill retract after all it was no great credit to him because blood will tell and he is of course a courthorne  almost without her intention maud barringtons eyes wandered towards the photograph and then looking up she met those of her aunt and once more saw the thought that troubled her in them  the courthorne blood is responsible for a good deal more than discretion said miss barrington who went out quietly  her brother appeared a trifle perplexed now i fancied your aunt had taken him under her wing and when i was about to suggest that considering the connexion between the families we might ask him over to dinner occasionally she goes away he said  the girl looked down a moment for realizing that her uncle recognized the obligation he was under to the man he did not like she remembered that she herself owed him considerably more and he had asked for something in return it was not altogether easy to grant but she had tacitly pledged herself and turning suddenly she laid a hand on barringtons arm  of course but i want to talk of something else just now she said you know i have very seldom asked you questions about my affairs but i wish to take a little practical interest in them this year  yes said barrington with a smile well i am at your service my dear and quite ready to account for my stewardship you are no longer my ward except by your own wishes  i am still your niece said the girl patting his arm now there is of course nobody who could manage the farming better than you do but i would like to raise a large crop of wheat this season  it wouldnt pay and the colonel grew suddenly grave very few men in the district are going to sow all their holding wheat is steadily going down  then if nobody sows there will be very little and shouldnt that put up the prices  barringtons eyes twinkled who has been teaching you commercial economy you are too pretty to understand such things and the argument is fallacious because the wheat is consumed in europeand even if we have not much to offer they can get plenty from california chile india and australia  oh yesand russia said the girl still you see the big mills in winnipeg and minneapolis depend upon the prairie they couldnt very well bring wheat in from australia  barrington was still smiling with his eyes but his lips were set a little knowledge is dangerous my dear and if you could understand me better i could show you where you were wrong as it is i can only tell you that i have decided to sell wheat forward and plough very little  but that was a policy you condemned with your usual vigour you really know you did  my dear said the colonel with a little impatient gesture one can never argue with a lady you seecircumstances alter cases considerably  he nodded with an air of wisdom as though that decided it but the girl persisted uncle she said drawing closer to him with lithe gracefulness i want you to let me have my own way just for once and if i am wrong i will never do anything you do not approve of again after all it is a very little thing and you would like to please me  it is a trifle that is likely to cost you a good deal of money said the colonel dryly  i think i could afford it and you could not refuse me  as i am only your uncle and no longer a trustee i could not said barrington still you would not act against my wishes  his eyes were gentle unusually so for he was not as a rule very patient when any one questioned his will but there was a reproach in them that hurt the girl still because she had promised she persisted  no she said that is why it would be ever so much nicer if you would just think as i did  barrington looked at her steadily if you insist i can at least hope for the best he said with a gravity that brought a faint colour to the listeners cheek  it was next day when witham took his leave and maud barrington stood beside him as he put on his driving furs  you told me there was something you wished me to do and though it was difficult it is done she said my holding will be sown with wheat this spring  witham turned his head aside a moment and apparently found it needful to fumble at the fastenings of the furs while there was a curious expression in his eyes when he looked round again  then he said with a little smile we are quits that cancels any little obligation which may have existed  he had gone in another minute and maud barrington turned back into the stovewarmed room very quietly her lips were however somewhat closely set     chapter xi  speed the plough   winter had fled back beyond the barrens to the lonely north at last and though here and there a little slushy snow still lay soaking the black loam in a hollow a warm wind swept the vast levels when one morning colonel barrington rode with his niece and sister across the prairie spring comes suddenly in that region and the frostbleached sod was steaming under an effulgent sun while in places a hardy flower peeped through it was six hundred miles to the forests of the rockies eastern slope and as far to the athabascan pines but it seemed to maud barrington that their resinous sweetness was in the glorious western wind which awoke a musical sighing from the sea of rippling grass it rolled away before her in billows of lustrous silvergrey and had for sole boundary the first upward spring of the arch of cloudless blue across which the vanguard of the feathered host pressed on company by company towards the pole  the freshness of it all stirred her blood like wine and the brightness that flooded the prairie had crept into her eyes for those who bear the iron winter of that lonely land realize the wonder of the reawakening which in a little space of day dresses the waste which has lain for long months white and silent as the dead in living green it also has its subtle significance that the grimmest toiler feels and the essence of it is hope eternal and triumphant life the girl felt the thrill of it and gave thanks by an answering brightness as the murmuring grasses and peeping flowerets did but there was behind her instinctive gladness a vague wonder and expectancy she had read widely and seen the life of the cities with understanding eyes and now she was to be provided with the edifying spectacle of the gambler and outcast turned farmer  had she been asked a few months earlier whether the man who had as courthorne had done cast away his honour and wallowed in the mire could come forth again and purge himself from the stain her answer would have been coldly sceptical but now with the old familiar miracle and what it symbolized before her eyes the thing looked less improbable why this should give pleasure she did not know or would not admit that she did but the fact remained that it was so  trotting down the slope of the next rise they came upon him and he stood with very little sign of dissolute living upon him by a great breaker plough in front of him the quartermile furrow led on beyond the tall sighting poles on the crest of the next rise and four splendid horses of a kind not very usual on the prairie were stamping the steaming clods at his side bronzed by frost and sun with his brickred neck and arch of chest revealed by the coarse blue shirt that belted at the waist enhanced his slenderness of flank the repentant prodigal was at least a passable specimen of the animal man but it was the strength and patience in his face that struck the girl as he turned towards her bareheaded with a little smile in his eyes she also noticed the difference he presented with his ingrained hands and the stain of the soil upon him to her uncle who sat his horse immaculate as usual with gloved hand on the bridle for the englishmen at silverdale usually hired other men to do their coarser work for them  so you are commencing in earnest in face of my opinion said barrington of course i wish you success but that consummation appears distinctly doubtful  witham laughed as he pointed to a great machine which hauled by four horses rolled towards them scattering the black clods in its wake im doing what i can to achieve it sir he said in fact im staking somewhat heavily that team with the gang ploughs and cultivators cost me more dollars than i care to remember  no doubt said barrington dryly still we have always considered oxen good enough for breaking prairie at silverdale  witham nodded i used to do so sir when i could get nothing better but after driving oxen for eight years one finds out their disadvantages  barringtons face grew a trifle stern there are times when you tax our patience lance he said still there is nothing to be gained by questioning your assertion what i fail to see is where your reward for all this will come from because i am still convinced that the soil will so to speak give you back eighty cents for every dollar you put into it i would however like to look at those implements i have never seen better ones  he dismounted and helped his companion down for witham made no answer the farmer was never sure what actuated him but save in an occasional fit of irony he had not attempted by any reference to make his past fall into line with courthornes since he had first been accepted as the latter at silverdale he had taken the dead mans inheritance for a while but he would stoop no further and to speak the truth which he saw was not credited brought him a grim amusement as well as flung a sop to his pride presently however miss barrington turned to him and there was a kindly gleam in her eyes as she glanced at the splendid horses and widening strip of ploughing  you have the hope of youth lance to make this venture when all looks blackand it pleases me she said sometimes i fancy that men had braver hearts than they have now when i was young  witham flushed a trifle and stretching out an arm swept his hand round the horizon all that looked dead a very little while ago and now you can see the creeping greenness in the sod he said the lean years cannot last for ever and even if one is beaten again there is a consolation in knowing that one has made a struggle now i am quite aware that you are fancying a speech of this kind does not come well from me  maud barrington had seen his gesture and something in the thought that impelled it as well as the almost statuesque pose of his thinlyclad figure appealed to her courthorne as farmer with the damp of clean effort on his forehead and the stain of the good soil that would faithfully repay it on his garments had very little in common with the profligate and gambler vaguely she wondered whether he was not working out his own redemption by every wheat furrow torn from the virgin prairie and then again the doubt crept in could this man have ever found pleasure in the mire  you will plough all your holding lance asked the elder lady who had not answered his last speech yet but meant to do  yes said the man all i can its a big venture and if it fails will cripple me but i seem to feel apart from any reason i can discern that wheat is going up again and i must go through with this ploughing of course it does not sound very sensible  miss barrington looked at him gravely for there was a curious and steadilytightening bond between the two it depends upon what you mean by sense can we reason out all we feel and is there nothing intangible but real behind the impulses which may be sent to us  well said witham with a little smile that is a trifle too deep for me and its difficult to think of anything but the work i have to do but you were the first at silverdale to hold out a hand to meand i have a feeling that your good wishes would go a long way now is it altogether fantastic to believe that the goodwill of my first friend would help to bring me prosperity  the whitehaired ladys eyes grew momentarily soft and with a gravity that did not seem out of place she moved forward and laid her hand on a big horses neck and smiled when the dumb beast responded to her gentle touch  it is a good work she said lance there is more than dollars or the bread that somebody is needing behind what you are doing and because i loved your mother i know how her approval would have followed you and now sow in hope and god speed your plough  she turned away almost abruptly and witham stood still with one hand closed tightly and a little deeper tint in the bronze of his face sensible at once of an unchanged resolution and a horrible degradation then he saw that the colonel had helped miss barrington into the saddle and her niece was speaking  i have something to ask mr courthorne and will overtake you she said  the others rode on and the girl turned to witham i made you a promise and did my best to keep it but i find it harder than i fancied it would be she said i want you to release me  i should like to hear your reasons said witham  the girl made a faint gesture of impatience of course if you insist  i do said witham quietly  then i promised you to have all my holding sown this year and i am still willing to do so but though my uncle makes no protests i know he feels my opposition very keenly and it hurts me horribly unspoken reproaches are the worst to bear you know and now dane and some of the others are following your lead it is painful to feel that i am taking part with them against the man who has always been kind to me  and you would prefer to be loyal to colonel barrington even if it cost you a good deal  of course said maud barrington can you ask me  witham saw the sparkle in her eyes and the halfcontemptuous pride in the poise of the shapely head loyalty it was evident was not a figure of speech with her but he felt that he had seen enough and turned his face aside  i knew it would be difficult when i asked he said still i cannot give you back that promise we are going to see a great change this year and i have set my heart on making all i can for you  but why should you asked maud barrington somewhat astonished that she did not feel more angry  well said witham gravely i may tell you by and by and in the meanwhile you can set it down to vanity this may be my last venture at silverdale and i want to make it a big success  the girl glanced at him sharply and it was because the news caused her an unreasonable concern that there was a trace of irony in her voice  your last venture have we been unkind to you or does it imply that as you once insinuated an exemplary life becomes monotonous  witham laughed no i should like to stay herea very long while he said and the girl saw he spoke the truth as she watched him glance wistfully at the splendid teams great ploughs and rich black soil in fact strange as it may appear it will be virtue given the rein for once that drives me out when i go away  but where are you going to  witham glanced vaguely across the prairie and the girl was puzzled by the look in his eyes back to my own station he said softly as though to himself and then turned with a little shrug of his shoulders in the meanwhile there is a good deal to do and once more i am sorry i cannot release you  then there is an end of it you could not expect me to beg you to so we will discuss the practical difficulty i cannot under the circumstances borrow my uncles teams and i am told i have not sufficient men or horses to put a large crop in  of course said witham quietly well i have now the best teams and machines on this part of the prairie and am bringing ontario men in i will do the ploughingand if it will make it easier for you you can pay me for the services  there was a little flush on the girls face it is all distasteful but as you will not give me back my word i will keep it to the letter still it almost makes me reluctant to ask you a further favour  this one is promised before you ask it said witham quietly  it cost maud barrington some trouble to make her wishes clear and withams smile was not wholly one of pleasure as he listened one of the young english lads who was it appeared a distant connexion of the girls had been losing large sums of money at a gaming table and seeking other equally undesirable relaxations at the railroad settlement for the sake of his mother in england miss barrington desired him brought to his senses but was afraid to appeal to the colonel whose measures were occasionally more draconic than wise  i will do what i can said witham still i am not sure that a lad of the kind is worth your worrying over and i am a trifle curious as to what induced you to entrust the mission to me  the girl felt embarrassed but she saw that an answer was expected since you ask it occurred to me that you could do it better than anybody else she said please dont misunderstand me but i fancy it is the other man who is leading him away  witham smiled somewhat grimly your meaning is quite plain and i am already looking forward to the encounter with my fellowgambler you believe that i will prove a match for him  maud barrington to her annoyance felt the blood creep to her forehead but she looked at the man steadily noticing the quiet forcefulness beneath his somewhat caustic amusement  yes she said simply and i shall be grateful  in another few minutes she was galloping across the prairie and when she rejoined her aunt and barrington endeavoured to draw out the latters opinion respecting courthornes venture by a few discreet questions  heaven knows where he was taught it but there is no doubt that the man is an excellent farmer he said it is a pity that he is also to all intents and purposes mad  miss barrington glanced at her niece and both of them smiled for the colonel usually took for granted the insanity of any one who questioned his opinions  in the meanwhile witham sat swaying on the drivingseat mechanically guiding the horses and noticing how the prairie sod rolled away in black waves beneath the great plough he heard the crackle of fibres beneath the triple shares and the swish of greasy loam along the mouldboards side but his thoughts were far away and when he raised his head he looked into the dim future beyond the long furrow that cut the skyline on the rise  it was shadowy and uncertain but one thing was clear to him and that was that he could not stay in silverdale at first he had almost hoped he might do this for the good land and the means of efficiently working it had been a horrible temptation that was before he reckoned on maud barringtons attractions but of late he had seen what these were leading him to and all that was good in him recoiled from an attempt to win her once he had dared to wonder whether it could be done for his grim life had left him selfcentred and bitter but that mood had passed and it was with disgust he looked back upon it now he knew that the sooner he left silverdale the less difficult it would be to forget her but he was still determined to vindicate himself by the work he did and make her affairs secure then with or without a confession he would slip back into the obscurity he came from  while he worked the soft wind rioted about him and the harbingers of summer passed north in battalions overheadcrane brent goose and mallardin crescents skeins and wedges after the fashion of their kind little longtailed gophers whisked across the whitened sod and when the great plough rolled through the shadows of a bluff jack rabbits pied white and grey scurried amidst the rustling leaves even the birches were fragrant in that vivifying air and seemed to rejoice as all animate creatures did but the mans face grew more sombre as the day of toil wore on still he did his work with the grim unwavering diligence that had already carried him dismayed but unyielding through years of drought and harvest hail and the stars shone down on the prairie when at last he loosed his second team  then standing in the door of his lonely homestead he glanced at the great shadowy granaries and barns and clenched his hand as he saw what he could do if the things that had been forced upon him were rightfully his he knew his own mettle and that he could hold them if he would but the pale cold face of a woman rose up in judgment against him and he also knew that because of the love of her that was casting its toils about him he must give them up  far back on the prairie a lonely coyote howled and a faint wind that was now like snowcooled wine brought the sighing of limitless grasses out of the silence there was no cloud in the crystalline ether and something in the vastness and stillness that spoke of infinity brought a curious sense of peace to him impostor though he was he would leave silverdale better than he found it and afterwards it would be of no great moment what became of him countless generations of toiling men had borne their petty sorrows before him and gone back to the dust they sprang from but still in due succession harvest followed seedtime and the world whirled on then remembering that in the meanwhile he had much to do which would commence with the sun on the morrow he went back into the house and shook the fancies from him     chapter xii  mastery recognized   there was considering the latest price of wheat a somewhat astonishing attendance in the long room of the hotel at the railroad settlement one saturday evening a big stove in the midst of it diffused a stuffy and almost unnecessary heat gaudy nickelled lamps an uncertain brilliancy and the place was filled with the drifting smoke of indifferent tobacco oleographs barbaric in colour and drawing hung about the roughlyboarded walls and any critical stranger would have found the saloon comfortless and tawdry  it was however filled that night with bronzedfaced men who expected nothing better most of them wore jackets of soft black leather or embroidered deerskin and the jean trousers and long boots of not a few apparently stood in need of repairing though the sprinkling of more conventional apparel and paler faces showed that the storekeepers of the settlement had been drawn together as well as the prairie farmers who had driven in to buy provisions or take up their mail there was however but little laughter and their voices were low for boisterousness and assertion are not generally met with on the silent prairie indeed the attitude of some of the men was mildly deprecatory as though they felt that in assisting in what was going forward they were doing an unusual thing still the eyes of all were turned toward the table where a man who differed widely in appearance from most of them dealt out the cards  he wore city clothes and a white shirt with a fine diamond in the front of it while there was a keen intentness behind the halfironical smile in his somewhat colourless face the whiteness of his long nervous fingers and the quickness of his gestures would also have stamped him as a being of different order from the slowlyspoken prairie farmers while the slenderness of the little pile of coins in front of him testified that his endeavours to tempt them to speculation on games of chance had met with no very marked success as yet gambling for stakes of moment is not a popular amusement in that country where the soil demands his best from every man in return for the scanty dollars it yields him but the gamester had chosen his time well and the men who had borne the dreary solitude of winter in outlying farms and now only saw another adverse season opening before them were for once in the mood to clutch at any excitement that would relieve the monotony of their toilsome lives  a few were betting small sums with an apparent lack of interest which did not in the least deceive the dealer and when he handed a few dollars out he laughed a little as he turned to the barkeeper  set them up again i want a drink to pass the time he said ill play you at anything you like to put a name to boys if this game dont suit you but youll have to give me the chance of making my hotel bill in my country ive seen folks livelier at a funeral  the glasses were handed round but when the gambler reached out towards the silver at his side a big bronzedskinned rancher stopped him  no he drawled were not sticking you for a locomotive tank and this comes out of my treasury ill call you three dollars and take my chances on the draw  well said the dealer thats a little more encouraging anybody wanting to make it better  a young lad in elaboratelyembroidered deerskin with a flushed face leaned upon the table show you how we play cards in the old country he said ill make it thirtyfor a beginning  there was a momentary silence for the lad had staked heavily and lost of late but one or two more bets were made then the cards were turned up and the lad smiled fatuously as he took up his winnings  now ill let you see he said this time well make it fifty  he won twice more in succession and the men closed in about the table while for the dealer knew when to strike the glasses went round again and in the growing interest nobody quite noticed who paid for the refreshment then while the dollars began to trickle in the lad flung a bill for a hundred down  go on he said a trifle huskily tonight you cant beat me  once more he won and just then two men came quietly into the room one of them signed to the hotelkeeper  whats going on the boys seem kind of keen he said  the other man laughed a little ferris has struck a streak of luck but i wouldnt be very sorry if you got him away mr courthorne he has had as much as he can carry already and i dont want anybody broke up in my house the boys can look out for themselves but the silverdale kid has been losing a good deal lately and he doesnt know when to stop  witham glanced at his companion who nodded the young fool he said  they crossed towards the table in time to see the lad take up his winnings again and witham laid his hand quietly upon his shoulder  come along and have a drink while you give the rest a show he said you seem to have done tolerably well and its usually wise to stop while the chances are going with you  the lad turned and stared at him with languid insolence in his halfclosed eyes and though he came of a lineage that had been famous in the old country there was nothing very prepossessing in his appearance his mouth was loose his face weak in spite of its inherited pride and there was little need to tell either of the men who noticed his nervous fingers and muddiness of skin that he was one who in the strenuous early days would have worn the woolly crown  were you addressing me he asked  i was said witham quietly i was in fact inviting you to share our refreshment you see we have just come in  then said the lad it was condemnable impertinence since you have taken this fellow up couldnt you teach him that its bad taste to thrust his company upon people who dont want it dane  witham said nothing but drew dane who flushed a trifle aside and when they sat down the latter smiled dryly  you have taken on a big contract courthorne how are you going to get the young ass out he said  well said witham it would gratify me to take him by the neck but as i dont know that it would please the colonel if i made a public spectacle of one of his retainers i fancy ill have to tackle the gambler i dont know him but as he comes from across the frontier its more than likely he has heard of me there are advantages in having a record like mine you see  it would of course be a kindness to the lads peoplebut the young fool is scarcely worth it and its not your affair said dane reflectively  witham guessed the drift of the speech but he could respect a confidence and laughed a little its not often i have done any one a good turn and the novelty has its attractions  dane did not appear contented with this explanation but he asked nothing further and the two sat watching the men about the table who were evidently growing eager  thats two hundred the kid has let go said somebody  there was a murmur of excited voices and one rose hoarse and a trifle shaky in the consonants above the rest  show you how a gentleman can stand up boys throw them out again two hundred this time on the game  there was silence and the rustle of shuffled cards then once more the voices went up against him better let up before he takes your farm oh let him face it and show his gritthe man who slings round his hundreds can afford to lose  the lads face showed a trifle paler through the drifting smoke though a good many of the cigars had gone out now and once more there was the stillness of expectancy through which a strained voice rose  going to get it all back ill stake you four hundred  witham rose and moved forward quietly with dane behind him and then stood still where he could see the table he had also very observant eyes and was free from the excitement of those who had a risk on the game still when the cards were dealt it was the gamblers face he watched for a brief space nobody moved and then the lad flung down his cards and stood up with a greyness in his cheeks and his hands shaking  youve got all my dollars now he said still ill play you for doubles if youll take my paper  the gambler nodded and flung down a big pile of bills i guess ill trust you mine are here  the bystanders waited motionless and none of them made a bet for any stakes they could offer would be trifles now but they glanced at the lad who stood tensely still while witham watched the face of the man at the table in front of him for a moment he saw a flicker of triumph in his eyes and that decided him again one by one the cards went down and then when everybody waited in strained expectancy the lad seemed to grow limp suddenly and groaned  you can let up he said hoarsely ive gone down  then a hard brown hand was laid upon the table and while the rest stared in astonishment a voice which had a little stern ring in it said turn the whole pack up and hand over the other one  in an instant the gamblers hand swept beneath his jacket but it was a mistaken move for as swiftly the other hard brown fingers closed upon the pile of bills and the men too astonished to murmur saw witham leaning very grim in face across the table then it tilted over beneath him and the cards were on the gamblers knees while as the two men rose and faced each other something glinted in the hands of one of them  it is more than probable that the man did not intend to use it and trusted to its moral effect for the display of pistols is not regarded with much toleration on the canadian prairie in any case he had not the opportunity for in another moment withams right hand closed upon his wrist and the gambler was struggling fruitlessly to extricate it he was a muscular man with doubtless a sufficiency of nerve but he had not toiled with his arms and led a spartan life for eight long years before another few seconds had passed he was wondering whether he would ever use that wrist again while dane picked up the fallen pistol and put it in his pocket with the bundle of bills witham handed him  now said the latter i want to do the square thing if youll let us strip you and turn out your pockets well see you get any winnings youre entitled to when weve straightened up the cards  the gambler was apparently not willing for though it is possible he would have found it advisable to play an honest game across the frontier he had evidently surmised that there was less risk of detection among the canadian farmers he probably knew they would not wait long for his consent but in the first stages of the altercation it is not as a rule insuperably difficult for a fearless man to hold his own against an indignant company who have no definite notion of what they mean to do and it was to cover his retreat he turned to witham  and who the  are you he asked  witham smiled grimly i guess you have heard of me anyway there are a good many places in montana where they know lance courthorne quite sure i know a straight game when i see it  the mans resistance vanished but he had evidently been taught the necessity of making the best of defeat in his profession and he laughed as he swept his glance round at the angry faces turned upon him  if you dont theres nobody does he said still as youve got my pistol and most dislocated my wrist the least you can do is to get a partner out of this  there was an ominous murmur and the lads face showed livid with fury and humiliation but witham turned quietly to the hotelkeeper  you will take this man with you into your side room and stop with him there he said dane give him the bills the rest of you had better sit down here and make a list of your losses and youll get whatever the fellow has upon him divided amongst you then because i ask you and youd have had nothing but for me youll put him in his wagon and turn him out quietly upon the prairie  thats sense and we dont want no circus here said somebody  a few voices were raised in protest but when it became evident that one or two of the company were inclined to adopt more draconic measures dane spoke quietly and forcibly and was listened to then witham reached out and grasped the shoulder of the english lad who made the last attempt to rouse his companions  let them alone ferris and come along youll get most of what you lost back tomorrow and were going to take you home he said  ferris turned upon him hoarse with passion flushed in face and swaying a trifle on his feet while witham noticed that he drew one arm back  who are you to lay hands on a gentleman he asked keep your distance im going to stay here and if id have had my way wed have kicked you out of silverdale  witham dropped his hand but next moment the ornament of a distinguished family was seized by the neck and the farmer glanced at dane  weve had enough of this fooling and hell be grateful to me tomorrow he said  then his captive was thrust resisting strenuously out of the room and with danes assistance conveyed to the waiting wagon into which he was flung almost speechless with indignation  now said dane quietly youve given us a good deal more trouble than youre worth ferris and if you attempt to get out again ill break your head for you tell courthorne how much that fellow got from you  in another ten minutes they had jolted across the railroad track and were speeding through the silence of the lonely prairie above them the clear stars flung their cold radiance down through vast distances of liquid indigo and the soft beat of hoofs was the only sound that disturbed the solemn stillness of the wilderness dane drew in a great breath of the cool night air and laughed quietly  its a good deal more wholesome here in several ways said he if youre wise youll let up on cardplaying and hanging round the settlement ferris and stick to farming even if you lose almost as many dollars over it it will pay you considerably better now thats all im going to tell you but i know what im speaking of because ive had my flingand its costing me more than i care to figure out still you however can pull up because by this time you have no doubt found out a good deal if youre not all a fool curiositys at the bottom of half our youthful follies isnt it courthorne we want to know what the things forbidden actually taste like  well said witham dryly i dont quite know you see i had very little money in the old country and still less leisure here to spend either on that kind of experimenting where to get enough to eat was the one problem that worried me  dane turned a trifle sharply we are i fancy tolerably good friends isnt it a little unnecessary for you to adopt that tone with me  witham laughed but made no answer and their companion said nothing at all either the night wind had a drowsy effect on him or he was moodily resentful for it was not until witham pulled up before the homestead whose lands he farmed indifferently under barringtons supervision that he opened his mouth  you have got off very cheaply tonight and if youre wise youll let that kind of thing alone in future said witham quietly  the lad stepped down from the wagon and then stood still i resent advice from you as much as i do your uncalledfor insolence an hour or two ago he said to lie low until honest men got used to him would be considerably more becoming to a man like you  well said witham stung into forgetfulness im not going to offend in that fashion again and you can go to the devil in the way that most pleases you in fact i only pulled you out of the pit tonight because a lady who apparently takes a quite unwarranted interest in you asked me to  ferris stared up at him and his face showed almost livid through the luminous night  she asked you to he said by the lord ill make you sorry for this  witham said nothing but shook the reins and when the wagon lurched forward dane looked at him  i didnt know that before he said  well said witham dryly if i hadnt lost my temper with the lad you wouldnt have done now  dane smiled you miss the point of it our engaging friend made himself the laughingstock of the colony by favouring maud barrington with his attentions when he came out in fact i fancy the lady in desperation had to turn her uncle loose on him before he could be made to understand that they were not appreciated id keep your eye on him courthorne for the little beast has shown himself abominably vindictive occasionally though i have a notion hes scarcely to be held accountable its a case of too pure a strain and consanguinity two branches of the familymarriage between land and money you see  it will be my heel if he gets in my way said witham grimly  it was late when they reached his homestead where dane was to stay the night and when they went in a youthful figure in uniform rose up in the big logwalled hall for a moment withams heart almost stood still and then holding himself in hand by a strenuous effort he moved forward and stood where the light of a lamp did not shine quite fully upon him he knew that uniform and he had also seen the lad who wore it once or twice before at an outpost six hundred miles away across the prairie he knew the risk he took was great but it was evident to him that if his identity escaped detection at first sight use would do the rest and while he had worn a short pointed beard on the western prairie he was cleanlyshaven now  the lad stood quite still a moment staring at him and witham returning his gaze steadily felt his pulses throb  well trooper what has brought you here he said  homestead visitation sir said the lad who had a pleasant english voice mr courthorne i presumeaccept my regrets if i stared too hard at youbut for a moment you reminded me of a man i knew theyve changed us round lately and im from the alberta squadron just sent in to this district it was late when i rode in and your people were kind enough to put me up  witham laughed i have been taken for another man before would you like anything to drink or a smoke before you turn in trooper  no sir said the lad if youll sign my docket to show ive been here ill get some sleep ive sixty miles to ride tomorrow  witham did as he was asked and the trooper withdrew while when they sat down to a last cigar it seemed to dane that his companions face was graver than usual  did you notice the lads astonishment when you came in he asked he looked very much as if he had seen a ghost  witham smiled i believe he fancied he had there was a man in the district he came from whom some folks considered resembled me in reality i was by no means like him and hes dead now  likenesses are curious things and its stranger still how folks alter said dane now theyve a photograph at barringtons of you as a boy and while there is a resemblance in the face nobody with any discernment would have fancied that lad would grow into a man like you still thats of no great moment and i want to know just how you spotted the gambler i had a tolerably expensive tuition in most games of chance in my callow days and havent forgotten completely what i was taught then but though i watched the game i saw nothing that led me to suspect crooked play  witham laughed i watched his face and what i saw there decided me to try a bluff but it was not until he turned the table over i knew i was right  well said dane dryly you dont need your nerves toning up with only a suspicion to go upon it was a tolerably risky game still of course you had advantages  i have played a more risky one but i dont know that i have cause to be very grateful for anything i acquired in the past said witham with a curious smile  dane stood up and flung his cigar away its time i was asleep he said still since our talk has turned in this direction i want to tell you that as you have doubtless seen there is something about you that puzzles me occasionally i dont ask your confidence until you are ready to give it mebut if ever you want anybody to stand behind you in a difficulty youll find me rather more than willing  he went out and witham sat still very grave in face for at least another hour     chapter xiii  a fair advocate   thanks to the fashion in which the hotelkeeper managed the affair the gambler left the settlement without personal injury but very little richer than when he entered it the rest of those who were present at his meeting with witham were also not desirous that their friends should know they had been victimized and because dane was discreet news of what had happened might never have reached silverdale had not one of the younger men ridden in to the railroad a few days later odd scraps of conversation overheard led him to suspect that something unusual had taken place but as nobody seemed willing to supply details he returned to silverdale with his curiosity unsatisfied as it happened he was shortly afterwards present at a gathering of his neighbours at macdonalds farm and came across ferris there  i heard fragments of a curious story at the settlement he said there was trouble of some kind in which a professional gambler figured last saturday night and though nobody seemed to want to talk about it i surmised that somebody from silverdale was concerned in it  he had perhaps spoken a trifle more loudly than he had intended and there were a good many of the silverdale farmers with a few of their wives and daughters whose attention was not wholly confined to the efforts of mrs macdonald at the piano in the long room just then in any case a voice broke through the silence that followed the final chords  ferris could tell us if he liked he was there that night  ferris who had cause for doing so looked uncomfortable and endeavoured to sign to the first speaker that it was not desirable to pursue the topic  i have been in tolerably often of late had things to attend to he said  the other man was however possessed by a mischievous spirit or did not understand him you may just as well tell us now as later because you never kept a secret in your life he said  in the meantime several of the others had gathered about them and mrs macdonald who had joined the group smiled as she said there is evidently something interesting going on maynt i know gordon  of course said the man who had visited the settlement you shall know as much as i do though that is little and if it excites your curiosity you can ask ferris for the rest he is only anxious to enhance the value of his story by being mysterious well there was a more or less dramatic happening of the kind our friends in the old country unwarrantably fancy is typical of the west in the saloon at the settlement not long ago cards pistols a professional gambler and the unmasking of foul play dont you know somebody from silverdale played the leading rôle  how interesting said a young english girl now i used to fancy something of that kind happened here every day before i came out to the prairie please tell us mr ferris one would like to find there was just a trace of reality in our picturesque fancies of debonair desperadoes and bighatted cavaliers  there was a curious expression in ferris face but as he glanced round at the rest who were regarding him expectantly he did not observe that maud barrington and her aunt had just come in and stood close behind him  cant you see theres no getting out of it ferris said somebody  well said the lad in desperation i can only admit that gordon is right there was foul play and a pistol drawn but im sorry that i cant add anything further in fact it wouldnt be quite fair of me  but the man from silverdale asked mrs macdonald  im afraid said ferris with the air of one shielding a friend i cant tell you anything about him  i know mr courthorne drove in that night said the young english girl who was not endued with very much discretion  courthorne said one of the bystanders and there was a momentary silence that was very expressive was he concerned in what took place ferris  yes said the lad with apparent reluctance mrs macdonald you will remember that they dragged it out of me but i will tell you nothing more whatever  it seems to me you have told us quite sufficient and perhaps a trifle too much said somebody  there was a curious silence all of those present were more or less acquainted with courthornes past history and the suggestion of foul play coupled with the mention of a professional gambler had been significant ferris while committing himself in no way had certainly said sufficient then there was a sudden turning of heads as a young woman moved quietly into the midst of the group she was ominously calm but she stood very straight and there was a little hard glitter in her eyes which reminded one or two of them who noticed it of those of colonel barrington the fingers of one hand were also closed at her side  i overheard you telling a story ferris but you have a bad memory and left rather too much out she said  they compelled me to tell them what i did miss barrington said the lad who winced beneath her gaze now there is really nothing to be gained by going any further into the affair shall i play something for you mrs macdonald  he turned as he spoke and would have edged away but that one of the men at a glance from the girl laid a hand on his shoulder  dont be in a hurry ferris i fancy miss barrington has something more to tell you he said dryly  the girl thanked him with a gesture i want you to supply the most important part she said and the lad saying nothing changed colour under the glance she cast upon him you do not seem willing then perhaps i had better do it for you there were two men from silverdale directly concerned in the affair and one of them at no slight risk to himself did a very generous thing that one was mr courthorne did you see him lay a single stake upon a card or do anything that led you to suppose he was there for the purpose of gambling that evening  no said the lad seeing she knew the truth and his hoarse voice was scarcely audible  then said maud barrington i want you to tell us what you did see him do  ferris said nothing and though the girl laughed a little as she glanced at the wondering group her voice was icily disdainful  well she said i will tell you you saw him question a professional gamblers play to save a man who had no claim on him from ruin and with only one comrade to back him drive the swindler who had a pistol from the field he had you admit no interest of any kind in the game  ferris had grown crimson again and the veins on his forehead showed swollen high no he said almost abjectly  maud barrington turned from him to her hostess as she answered that will suffice in the meanwhile until i can decide whether it is desirable to make known the rest of the tale i brought the new song evelyn wanted mrs macdonald and i will play it for her if she would care to try it  she moved away with the elder lady and left the rest astonished to wonder what had become of ferris who was seen no more that evening while presently witham came in  his face was a trifle weary for he had toiled since the sun rose above the rim of the prairie and when the arduous day was over and those who worked for him were glad to rest their aching limbs had driven two leagues to macdonalds why he had done so he was not willing to admit but he glanced round the long room anxiously as he came in and his eyes brightened as they rested on maud barrington they were however observant eyes and he noticed that there was a trifle more colour than usual in the girls paletinted face and signs of suppressed curiosity about some of the rest when he had greeted his hostess he turned to one of the men  it seems to me you are either trying not to see something gordon or to forget it as soon as you can he said  gordon laughed a little you are not often mistaken courthorne that is precisely what we are doing i presume you havent heard what occurred here an hour ago  no said witham im not very curious if it does not concern me  gordon looked at him steadily i fancy it does you see that young fool ferris was suggesting that you had been mixed up in something not very creditable at the settlement lately as it happened maud barrington overheard him and made him retract before the company she did it effectively and if it had been any one else the scene would have been almost theatrical still you know nothing seems out of place when it comes from the colonels niece nor if you had heard her would you have wanted a better advocate  for a moment the bronze deepened in withams forehead and there was a gleam in his eyes but though it passed as rapidly as it came gordon had seen it and smiled when the farmer moved away  thats a probability i never counted on he thought still i fancy if it came about it would suit everybody but the colonel  then he turned as mrs macdonald came up to him what are you doing here alone when i see there is nobody talking to the girl from winnipeg she said  the man laughed a little i was wondering whether it is a good sign or otherwise when a young woman is so far as she can decently be uncivil to a man who desires her goodwill  mrs macdonald glanced at him sharply and then shook her head the question is too deep for youand it is not your affair besides havent you seen that indiscreet freedom of speech is not encouraged at silverdale  in the meanwhile witham crossing the room took a vacant place at maud barringtons side she turned her head a moment and looked at him  witham nodded yes i heard he said why did you do it  maud barrington made a little gesture of impatience that is quite unnecessary you know i sent you  yes said witham a trifle dryly i see you would have felt mean if you hadnt defended me  no said the girl with a curious smile that was not exactly the reason but we cannot talk too long here dane is anxious to take us home in his new buggy but it would apparently be a very tight fit for three will you drive me over  witham only nodded for mrs macdonald approached in pursuit of him but he spent the rest of the evening in a state of expectancy and maud barrington fancied that his hard hands were suspiciously unresponsive as she took them when he helped her into the silverdale wagona vehicle a strong man could have lifted and in no way resembling its english prototype the team was mettlesome the lights of macdonalds homestead soon faded behind them and they were racing with many a lurch and jolt straight as the crow flies across the prairie  there was no moon but the stars shone far up in the soft indigo and the grasses whirled back in endless ripples to the humming wheels dimmed to the dusky blue that suffused the whole intermerging sweep of earth and sky the sweetness of wild peppermint rose through the coolness of the dew and the voices of the wilderness were part of the silence that was but the perfect balance of the nocturnal harmonies the two who knew and loved the prairie could pick out each one of them nor did it seem that there was any need of speech on such a night but at last witham turned with a little smile to his companion as he checked the horses on the slope of a billowy rise  one feels diffident about intruding on this great quietness he said still i fancy you had a purpose in asking me to drive you home  yes said the girl with a curious gentleness in the first place though i know it isnt necessary with you i want to thank you i made dane tell me and you have done all i wishedsplendidly  witham laughed well you see it naturally came easy to me  maud barrington noticed the trace of grimness in his voice please try to overlook our unkindness she said is it really needful to keep reminding me and how was i to know what you were when i had only heard that wicked story  witham felt a little thrill run through him for which reason he looked straight in front of him and shifted his grasp on the reins disdainful and imperious as she was at times he knew there was a wealth of softer qualities in his companion now her daintiness in thought and person and honesty of purpose appealed to him while that night her mere physical presence had an effect that was almost bewildering for a moment he wondered vaguely how far a man with what fate had thrust upon him might dare to go and then with a little shiver saw once more the barrier of deceit and imposture  you believe it was not a true one he asked  of course said maud barrington how could it be and you have been very patient under our suspicions now if you still value the goodwill you once asked for it is yours absolutely  but you may still hear unpleasant stories about me said witham with a note the girl had not heard before in his voice  i should not believe them she said  still persisted witham if the tales were true  maud barrington did nothing by halves then i should remember that there is always so much we do not know which would put a different colour on any story and i believe they could never be true again  witham checked a little gasp of wonder and delight and maud barrington looked away across the prairie she was not usually impulsive and seldom lightly bestowed gifts that were worth the having and the man knew that the faith in him she had confessed to was the result of a conviction that would last until he himself shattered it then in the midst of his elation he shivered again and drew the lash across the near horses back the wonder and delight he felt had suddenly gone  few would venture to predict as much now and then i feel that our deeds are scarcely contrived by our own will and one could fancy our parts had been thrust upon us in a grim joke he said for instance isnt it strange that i should have a share in the rousing of silverdale to a sense of its responsibilities lord what i could make of it if fate had but given me a fair opportunity  he spoke almost fiercely but the words did not displease the girl the forceful ring in his voice set something thrilling within her and she knew by this time that his assertions seldom went beyond the fact  but you will have the opportunity and we need you here she said  no said witham slowly i am afraid not still i will finish the work i see in front of me that at leastone cannot hope for the unattainable  maud barrington was sensible of a sudden chill still if one has strength and patience is anything quite unattainable  witham looked out across the prairie and for a moment the demons of pride and ambition rioted within him he knew there were in him the qualities that compel success and the temptation to stretch out a daring hand and take all he longed for grew almost overmastering still he also knew how strong the innate prejudices of caste and tradition are in most women of his companions station and she had never hidden one aspect of her character from him it was with a smothered groan he realized that if he flung the last shred of honour aside and grasped the forbidden fruit it would turn to bitterness in his mouth  yes he said very slowly there is a limit which only fools would pass  then there was silence for a while until as they swept across the rise maud barrington laughed as she pointed to the lights that blinked in the hollow and witham realized that the barrier between them stood firm again  our views seldom coincide for very long but there is something else to mention before we reach the grange she said you must have paid out a good many dollars for the ploughing of your land and mine and nobodys exchequer is inexhaustible at silverdale now i want you to take a cheque from me  is it necessary that i should  of course said the girl with a trace of displeasure  witham laughed then i shall be prepared to hand you my account whenever you demand it  he did not look at his companion again but with a tighter grip than there was any need for on the reins sent the light wagon jolting down the slope to silverdale grange     chapter xiv  the unexpected   the sun beat down on the prairie which was already losing its flush of green but it was cool where maud barrington and her aunt stood in the shadow of the bluff by silverdale grange the birches tasselled now with whispering foliage divided the homestead from the waste which would lie white and desolate under the parching heat and that afternoon it seemed to the girl that the wall of green shut out more than the driving dust and sunglare from the grange for where the trees were thinner she could see moving specks of men and horses athwart the skyline  they had toiled in the sunbaked furrow since the first flush of crimson streaked the prairies rim and the chill of dusk would fall upon the grasses before their work was done those men who bore the burden and heat of the day were the girl knew helots now but there was in them the silent vigour and something of the sombreness of the land of rock and forest they came from and a time would come when others would work for them winning slowly holding grimly they were moving on while secure in its patrician tranquility silverdale stood still and maud barrington smiled curiously as she glanced down at the long white robe that clung very daintily about her and then towards her companions in the tennis field her apparel had cost many dollars in montreal and there was a joyous irresponsibility in the faces of those she watched  it is a little unequal isnt it aunt she said one feels inclined to wonder what we have done that we should have exemption from the charge laid upon the first tiller of the soil we and the men who are plodding through the dust there are descended from  miss barrington laughed a little as she glanced with a nod of comprehension at the distant toilers and more gravely towards the net merry voices came up to her through the shadows of the trees as english lad and english maiden lissom and picturesque in manyhued jackets and light dresses flitted across the little square of velvet green the men had followed the harrow and seeder a while that morning some of them indeed had for a few hours driven a team and then left the rest to the hired hands for the stress and sweat of effort that was to turn the wilderness into a granary was not for such as them  dont you think it is all made up to those others she asked  in one senseyes said the girl of course one can see that all effort must have its idealistic aspect and there may be men who find their compensation in the thrill of the fight and the knowledge of work well done when they rest at night still i fancy most of them only toil to eat and their views are not revealed to us we are you see womenand we live at silverdale  her aunt smiled again how long is it since the plough crossed the red river and what is manitoba now how did those mile furrows come there and who drove the road that takes the wheat out through the granite of the superior shore it is more than their appetites that impelled those men my dear still it is scarcely wise to expect too much when one meets them for though one could feel it is presumptuous to forgive its deficiencies the berserk type of manhood is not conspicuous for its refinement  for no apparent reason maud barrington evaded her aunts gaze you she said dryly have forgiven one of that type a good deal already but at least we have never seen him when the fit was upon him  miss barrington laughed still i have no doubt that sooner or later you will enjoy the spectacle  just then a light wagon came up behind them and when one of the hired men helped them in they swept out of the cool shade into the dust and glare of the prairie and when some little time later with the thud of hoofs and rattle of wheels softened by the bleaching sod they rolled down a rise there was spread out before them evidence of mans activity  acre by acre gleaming chocolate brown against the grey and green of the prairie the wheat loam rolled away back to the ridge over it and on again it was such a breadth of sowing as had but once when wheat was dear been seen at silverdale but still across the foreground advancing in echelon came lines of dusty teams and there was a meaning in the furrows they left behind them for they were not ploughing where the wheat had been each wave of lustrous clods that rolled from the gleaming shares was so much rent from the virgin prairie and a promise of what would come when man had fulfilled his mission and the wilderness would blossom there was a wealth of food stored little by little during ages past counting in every yard of the crackling sod to await the time when the toiler with the sweat of the primeval curse upon his forehead should unseal it with the plough it was also borne in upon maud barrington that the man who directed those energies was either altogether without discernment or one who saw further than his fellows and had an excellent courage when he flung his substance into the furrows while wheat was going down then as the hired man pulled up the wagon she saw him  a great plough with triple shares had stopped at the end of the furrow and the leading horses were apparently at variance with the man who while he gave of his own strength to the uttermost was asking too much from them young and indifferently broken tortured by swarming insects and galled by the strain of the collar they had laid back their ears and the wickedness of the bronco strain shone in their eyes one rose almost upright amidst a clatter of harness its mate squealed savagely and the man who loosed one hand from the headstall flung out an arm then he and the pair whirled round together amidst the trampled clods in a blurred medley of spumeflecked bodies soilstained jean flungup hoofs and an arm that swung and smote again miss barrington grew a trifle pale as she watched but a little glow crept into her nieces eyes  the struggle however ended suddenly and hailing a man who plodded behind another team witham picked up his broad hat which was trampled into shapelessness and turned towards the wagon there was dust and spume upon him a rent in the blue shirt and the knuckles of one hand dripped red but he laughed as he said i did not know we had an audience but this you see is necessary  is it asked miss barrington who glanced at the ploughing when wheat is going down  witham nodded yes he said i mean to me and the price of wheat is only part of the question  miss barrington stretched out her hand though her niece said nothing at all of course but i want you to help us down maud has an account you have not sent in to ask you for  witham first turned to the two men who now stood by the idle machine youll have to drive those beasts of mine as best you can tom and jake will take your team get them off again now this piece of breaking has to be put through before we loose again  then he handed his visitors down and maud barrington fancied as he walked with them to the house that the fashion in which the damaged hat hung down over his eyes would have rendered most other men ludicrous he left them a space in his bare sittingroom which suggested only grim utility and miss barrington smiled when her niece glanced at her  and this is how lance the profligate lives said she  maud barrington shook her head no she said can you believe that this man was ever a prodigal  her aunt was a trifle less astonished than she would once have been but before she could answer witham who had made a trifling change in his clothing came in  i can give you some green tea though i am afraid it might be a good deal better than it is and our crockery is not all you have been used to he said you see we have only time to think of one thing until the sowing is through  miss barringtons eyes twinkled and then  then said witham with a little laugh there will be prairie hay to cut and after that the harvest coming on  in the meanwhile it was business that brought me here and i have a cheque with me said maud barrington please let us get it over first of all  witham sat down at a table and scribbled on a strip of paper that he said gravely is what you owe me for the ploughing  there was a little flush in his face as he took the cheque the girl filled in and both felt somewhat grateful for the entrance of a man in blue jean with the tea it was of very indifferent quality and he had sprinkled a good deal on the tray but witham felt a curious thrill as he watched the girl pour it out at the head of the bare table her white dress gleamed in the light of a dusty window and the shadowy cedar boarding behind her forced up each line of the shapely figure again the maddening temptation took hold of him and he wondered whether he had betrayed too much when he felt the elder ladys eyes upon him there was a tremor in his brown fingers as he took the cup held out to him but his voice was steady  you can scarcely fancy how pleasant this is he said for eight years in fact ever since i left england no woman has ever done any of these graceful little offices for me  miss barrington glanced at her niece and both of them knew that if the lawyer had traced courthornes past correctly this could not be true still there was no disbelief in the elder ladys eyes and the girls faith remained unshaken  eight years she said with a little smile is a very long while  yes said witham horribly long and one year at silverdale is worth them allthat is a year like this one which is going to be remembered by all who have sown wheat on the prairie and that leads up to something when i have ploughed all my own holding i shall not be content and i want to make another bargain give me the use of your unbroken land and i will find horses seed and men while we will share what it yields us when the harvest is in  the girl was astonished this she knew was splendid audacity for the man had already staken very heavily on the crop he had sown and while the daring of it stirred her she sat silent a moment  i could lose nothing but you will have to bring out a host of men and have risked so much she said nobody but you and i and three or four others in all the province are ploughing more than half their holdings  the suggestion of comradeship set withams blood tingling but it was with a little laugh he turned over the pile of papers on the table and then took them up in turn  very little ploughing has been done in the tracts of minnesota previously alluded to farmers find wheat cannot be grown at present prices and there is apparently no prospect of a rise he said  the dakota wheatgrowers are mostly following they cant quite figure how they would get eighty cents for the dollars worth of seeding this year  milling very quiet in winnipeg no inquiries from europe coming in and manitoba dealers generally find little demand for harrows or seeders this year reports from assiniboia seem to show that the one hope this season will be mixed farming and the neglect of cereals  there is only one inference he said when the demand comes there will be nothing to meet it with  when it comes said maud barrington quietly but you who believe it will stand alone  almost said witham still there are a few much cleverer men who feel as i do i cant give you all my reasons or read you the sheaf of papers from the pacific slope london new york australia but while men lose hope and little by little the stocks run down the world must be fed just as sure as the harvest follows the sowing it will wake up suddenly to the fact that it is hungry they are buying cotton and scattering their money in other nations bonds in the old country now for they and the rest of europe forget their necessities at times but it is impossible to picture them finding their granaries empty and clamouring for bread  it was a crucial test of faith and the man knew it as the woman did he stood alone with the opinions of the multitude against him but there was maud barrington felt a great if undefinable difference between his quiet resolution and the gamblers recklessness once more the boldness of his venture stirred her and this time there was a little flash in her eyes as she bore witness to her perfect confidence  you shall have the land every acre of it to do what you like with and i will ask no questions whether you win or lose she said  then miss barrington glanced at him in turn lance i have a thousand dollars i want you to turn into wheat for me  withams fingers trembled and a darker hue crept into his tan madam he said i can take no money from you  you must said the little whitehaired lady for your mothers sake lance it is a brave thing you are doing and you are the son of one who was my dearest friend  witham turned his head away and both women wondered when he looked round again his face seemed a trifle drawn and his voice was strained  i hope he said slowly it will in some degree make amends for others i have done in the meanwhile there are reasons why your confidence humiliates me  miss barrington rose and her niece after her still i believe it is warranted and you will remember there are two women who have trusted you hoping for your success and now i fancy we have kept you too long  witham stood holding the door open a moment with his head bent and then suddenly straightened himself  i can at least be honest with you in this venture he said with a curious quietness  nothing further was said but when his guests drove away witham sat still awhile and then went back very grim in face to his ploughing he had passed other unpleasant moments of that kind since he came to silverdale and long afterwards the memory of them brought a flush to his face the excuses he had made seemed worthless when he strove to view what he had done and was doing through those womens eyes  it was dusk when he returned to the homestead worn out in body but more tranquil in mind and stopped a moment in the doorway to look back on the darkening sweep of the ploughing he felt with no misgivings that his time of triumph would come and in the meanwhile the handling of this great farm with all the aids that money could buy him was a keen joy to him but each time he met maud barringtons eyes he realized the more surely that the hour of his success must also see accomplished an act of abnegation which he wondered with a growing fear whether he could find the strength for then as he went in a man who cooked for his hired assistants came to meet him  theres a stranger inside waiting for you he said wouldnt tell me what he wanted but sat right down as if the place was his and helped himself without asking to your cigars wanted something to drink too and smiled at me kind of wicked when i brought him the cider  the room was almost dark when witham entered it and stood still a moment staring at a man who sat cigar in hand quietly watching him his appearance was curiously familiar but witham could not see his face until he moved forward another step or two then he stopped once more and the two saying nothing looked at one another it was witham who spoke first and his voice was very even  what do you want here he asked  the other man laughed isnt that a curious question when the place is mine you dont seem overjoyed to see me come to life again  witham sat down and slowly lighted a cigar we need not go into that i asked you what you want  well said courthorne dryly it is not a great deal only the means to live in a manner more befitting a gentleman than i have been able to do lately  you have not been prospering and witham favoured his companion with a slow scrutiny  no and courthorne laughed again you see i could pick up a tolerable living as lance courthorne but there is very little to be made at my business when you commence in new fields as an unknown man  well said witham coldly i dont know that it wouldnt be better to face my trial than stay here at your mercy so far as my inclinations go i would sooner fight than have any further dealings with a man like you  courthorne shook his head i fixed up the thing too well and you would be convicted still well not go into that and you will not find me unreasonable a life at silverdale would not suit me and you know by this time that it would be difficult to sell the place while i dont know where i could find a tenant who would farm it better than you that being so it wouldnt be good policy to bleed you too severely still i want a thousand dollars in the meanwhile theyre mine you see  witham sat still a minute he was sensible of a fierce distrust and hatred of the man before him but he felt he must at least see the consummation of his sowing  then you shall have them on condition that you go away and stay away until harvest is over after that i will send for you and shall have more to tell you if in the meantime you come back here or hint that i am witham i will surrender to the police or decide our differences in another fashion  courthorne nodded that is direct he said one knows where he is when he deals with a man who talks as you do now are you not curious as to the way i cheated both the river and the police  no said witham grimly not in the least we will talk business together when it is necessary but i can only decline to discuss anything else with you  courthorne laughed theres nothing to be gained by pretending to misunderstand you but it wouldnt pay me to be resentful when im graciously willing to let you work for me still i have been inclined to wonder how you were getting on with my estimable relatives and connexions one of them has i hear unbent a trifle towards you but i would like to warn you not to presume on any small courtesy shown you by the younger miss barrington  witham stood up and set his back to the door you heard my terms but if you mention that lady again in connexion with me it would suit me equally well to make good all i owe you very differently  courthorne did not appear in any way disconcerted but before he could answer a man outside opened the door  heres sergeant stimson and one of his troopers wanting you he said  witham looked at courthorne but the latter smiled the visit has nothing to do with me it is probably accidental but i fancy stimson knows me and it wouldnt be advisable for him to see us both together now i wonder whether you could make it fifteen hundred dollars  no said witham stay if it pleases you  courthorne shook his head i dont know that it would you dont do it badly witham  he went out by another door almost as the grizzled sergeant came in and stood still looking at the master of the homestead  i havent seen you since i came here mr courthorne and now you remind me of another man i once had dealings with he said  witham laughed a little i scarcely fancy that is very civil sergeant  well said the prairierider there is a difference when i look at you more closely let me see i met you once or twice back there in alberta  he appeared to be reflecting but witham was on his guard more frequently i fancy but you had nothing definite against me and the times have changed i would like to point that out to you civilly your chiefs are also on good terms with us at silverdale you see  the sergeant laughed well sir i meant no offence and called round to requisition a horse one of the whitesod boys has been deciding a quarrel with a neighbour with an axe and while i fancy they want me at once my beast got his foot in a badger hole  tell tom in the stables to let you have your choice said witham if you like them theres no reason you shouldnt take some of these cigars along  the sergeant went out and when the beat of hoofs sank into the silence of the prairie witham called courthorne in i have offered you no refreshment but the best in the house is at your service he said  courthorne looked at him curiously and for the first time witham noticed that the life he had led was telling upon his companion  as your guest he asked  yes said witham i am tenant here and that i may owe you nothing purpose paying you a second thousand dollars when the crop is in as well as bankrate interest on the value of the stock and machines and the money i have used as shown in the documents handed me by colonel barrington with wheat at its present price nobody would give you more for the land in return i demand the unconditional use of the farm until within three months from harvest i have the elevator warrants for whatever wheat i raise which will belong to me if you do not agree or remain here after sunrise tomorrow i shall ride over to the outpost and make a declaration  well said courthorne slowly you can consider it a deal     chapter xv  facing the flame   courthorne rode away next morning and some weeks had passed when maud barrington came upon witham sitting beside his mower in a sloo he did not at first see her for the rattle of the machines in a neighbouring hollow drowned the muffled beat of hoofs and the girl reining her horse in looked down on him the man was sitting very still which was unusual with him a hammer in his hand gazing straight before him as though he could see something beyond the shimmering heat that danced along the rim of the prairie  summer had come and the grass which grew scarcely ankledeep on the great levels was once more white and dry but in the hollows that had held the melting snow it stood waisthigh scented with peppermint harsh and wiry and witham had set out with every man he had to harvest it already a line of loaded wagons crawled slowly across the prairie and men and horses moved halfseen amid the dust that whirled about another sloo out of it came the trampling of hoofs and the musical tinkle of steel  suddenly witham looked up and the care which was stamped upon it fled from his face when he saw the girl the dust that lay thick upon his garments had spared her and as she sat patting the restless horse with a little smile in her face which showed just touched by the sun beneath the big white hat something in her dainty freshness reacted upon the tired mans fancy he had long borne the stress and the burden and as he watched her a longing to taste for at least a space the life of leisure and refinement came upon him as it had done too often for his tranquility since he came to silverdale this woman who had been born to it could it seemed to him lift the man she trusted beyond the sordid cares of the turmoil to her own high level and as he waited for her to speak a fit of passion shook him it betrayed itself only by the sudden hardening of his face  it is the first time i have surprised you idle you were dreaming she said  witham smiled a trifle mirthlessly i was but i am afraid the fulfillment of the dreams is not for me one is apt to be pulled up suddenly when he ventures over far  we are inquisitive you know said maud barrington cant you tell me what they were  witham did not know what impulse swayed him and afterwards blamed himself for complying but the girls interest compelled him and he showed her a little of what was in his heart  i fancy i saw silverdale gorging the elevators with the choicest wheat he said a new bridge flung level across the ravine where the wagons go down halfloaded to the creek a dam turning the hollow into a lake and big turbines driving our own flouring mill then there were herds of cattle fattening on the strippings of the grain that wasteful people burn our products clamoured for east in the old country and west in british columbiaand for a background prosperity and power even if it was paid for with half the traditions of silverdale still you see it may all be due to the effect of the fierce sunshine on an idle mans fancy  maud barrington regarded him steadily and the smile died out of her eyes but she said slowly is all that quite beyond realization could you not bring it about  witham saw her quiet confidence and something of her pride there was no avarice in this woman but the slight dilation of the nostrils and the glow in her eyes told of ambition and for a moment his soul was not his own  i could he said and maud barrington who watched the swift straightening of his shoulders and lifting of his head felt that he spoke no more than the truth then with a sudden access of bitterness but i never will  why she asked have you grown tired of silverdale or has what you pictured no charm for you  witham leaned as it were wearily against the wheel of the mower i wonder if you could understand what my life has been the crushing poverty that rendered every effort useless from the beginning the wounds that come from using imperfect tools and the numb hopelessness that follows repeated failure they are tolerably hard to bear alone but it is more difficult to make the best of them when the poorlyfed body is as worn out as the mind to stay here would beparadisebut a glimpse of it will probably have to suffice its gates are well guarded and without are the dogs you know  something in maud barrington thrilled in answer to the faint hoarseness in withams voice and she did not resent it she was a woman with all her sexs instinctive response to passion and emotion though as yet the primitive impulses that stir the hearts of men had been covered if not wholly hidden from her by the thin veneer of civilization now at least she felt in touch with them and for a moment she looked at the man with a daring that matched his own shining in her eyes  and you fear the angel with the sword she said there is nothing so terrible at silverdale  no said witham i think it is the load i have to carry i fear the most  for the moment maud barrington had flung off the bonds of conventionality lance she said you have proved your right to stay at silverdale and would not what you are doing now cover a great deal in the past  witham smiled wryly it is the present that is difficult he said can a man be pardoned and retain the offence  he saw the faint bewilderment in the girls face give place to the resentment of frankness unreturned and with a little shake of his shoulders shrank into himself maud barrington who understood it once more put on the becoming reticence of silverdale  we are getting beyond our depth and it is very hot she said you have all this hay to cut  witham laughed as he bent over the mowers knife yes he said it is really more in my line and i have kept you in the sun too long  in another few moments maud barrington was riding across the prairie but when the rattle of the machine rose from the sloo behind her she laughed curiously  the man knew his place but you came perilously near making a fool of yourself this morning my dear she said  it was a week or two later and very hot when with others of his neighbours witham sat in the big hall at silverdale grange the windows were open wide and the smell of hot dust came in from the white waste which rolled away beneath the stars there was also another odour in the little puffs of wind that flickered in and far off where the arch of indigo dropped to the dusky earth wavy lines of crimson moved along the horizon it was then the season when fires that are lighted by means which no man knows creep up and down the waste of grass until they put on speed and roll in a surf of flame before a sudden breeze still nobody was anxious about them for the guarding furrows that would oppose a space of dusty soil to the march of the flame had been ploughed round every homestead at silverdale  maud barrington was at the piano and her voice was good while witham who had known what it is to toil from red dawn to sunset without hope of more than daily food found the simple song she had chosen chime with his mood all day long the reapers  a faint staccato drumming that rose from the silent prairie throbbed through the final chords of it and when the music ceased swelled into the gallop of a horse it seemed in some curious fashion portentous and when there was a rattle and jingle outside other eyes than withams were turned towards the door it swung open presently and dane came in there was quiet elation and some diffidence in his bronzed face as he turned to colonel barrington  i could not get away earlier from the settlement sir but i have great news he said they have awoke to the fact that stocks are getting low in the old country wheat moved up at winnipeg and there was almost a rush to buy yesterday  there was a sudden silence for among those present were men who remembered the acres of good soil they had not ploughed but a little grim smile crept into their leaders face  it is he said quietly too late for most of us still we will not grudge you your good fortune dane you and a few of the others owe it to courthorne  every eye was on the speaker for it had become known among his neighbours that he had sold for a fall but barrington could lose gracefully then both his niece and dane looked at witham with a question in their eyes  yes he said very quietly it is the turning of the tide  he crossed over to barrington who smiled at him dryly as he said it is a trifle soon to admit that i was wrong  witham made a gesture of almost impatient deprecation i was wondering how far i might presume sir you have forward wheat to deliver  i have said barrington unfortunately a good deal you believe the advance will continue  yes said witham simply still it is but the beginning and there will be a reflux before the stream sets in wait a little sir and then telegraph your broker to cover all your contracts when the price drops again  i fancy it would be wiser to cut my losses now said barrington dryly  then witham did a somewhat daring thing for he raised his voice a trifle in a fashion that seemed to invite the attention of the rest of the company  the more certain the advance seems to be the fiercer will be the bears last attack he said they have to get from under and will take heavy chances to force prices back as yet they may contrive to check or turn the stream and then every wise man who has sold down will try to cover but no one can tell how far it may carry us once it sets strongly in  the men understood as did colonel barrington that they were being warned above their leaders head and his niece while resenting the slight admitted the courage of the man barringtons face was sardonic and a less resolute man would have winced under the implication as he said  this is no doubt intuition i fancy you told us you had no dealings on the markets at winnipeg  witham looked steadily at the speaker and the girl noticed with a curious approval that he smiled  perhaps it is but i believe events will prove me right in any case what i had the honour of telling you and miss barrington was the fact he said  nobody spoke and the girl was wondering by what means the strain which though few heard what barrington said all seemed to feel could be relieved when out of the darkness came a second beat of hoofs and by and by a man swaying on the drivingseat of a jolting wagon swept into the light from the windows then there were voices outside and a breathless lad came in  a big grass fire coming right down on courthornes farm he said it was tolerably close when i got away  in an instant there was commotion and every man in silverdale grange was on his feet for the most part they took life lightly and looked upon their farming as an attempt to combine the making of dollars with gentlemanly relaxation but there were no laggards among them when there was perilous work to be done and they went out to meet the fire joyously inside five minutes scarcely a horse remained in the stables and the men were flying at a gallop across the dusky prairie laughing at the risk of a stumble in a deadly badger hole yet in the haste of saddling they found time to arrange a twentydollar sweepstake and the allowance for weight  up the long rise and down the back of it they swept stirrup as yet by stirrup and neck by neck while the roar of the hoofs reft the silence of the prairie like the roll of musketry behind came the wagons lurching up the slope and the blood surged to the brave young faces as the night wind smote them and fanned into brightness the crimson smear on the horizon they were english lads and healthy englishmen of the stock that had furnished their nations fighting line and not infrequently counted no sacrifice too great that brought their colours home first on the racing turf still careless to the verge of irresponsibility as they were in most affairs that did not touch their pride the man who rode with red spurs and dane next behind him a clear length before the first of them asked no better allies in what was to be done  then the line drew out as the pace began to tell though the rearmost rode grimly knowing the risks the leaders ran and that the chance of being first to meet the fire might yet fall to them there was not one among them who would not have killed his best horse for that honour and for further incentive the colonels niece in streaming habit flitted in front of them she had come up from behind them and passed them on a rise for barrington disdained to breed horses for dollars alone and there was blood well known on the english turf in the beast she rode  byandby a straggling birch bluff rose blackly across their way but nobody swung wide swaying low while the branches smote them they went through the twigs crackling under foot and here and there the red drops trickling down a flushed scarred face for the slanting rent of a birch bough cuts like a knife dim trees whirled by them undergrowth went down and they were out on the dusty grass again while hurled straight like field guns wanted at the front the bouncing wagons went through behind then the fire rose higher in front of them and when they topped the last rise the pace grew faster still the slope they thundered down was undermined by gophers and seamed by badgerholes but they took their chances gleefully sparing no effort of hand and heel for the sum of twenty dollars and the credit of being first man in then the smoke rolled up to them and when eager hands drew bridle at last a youthful voice rose breathlessly out of it  stapleton a good first but hell go back on weight it used to be black and orange when he was at home  there was a ripple of hoarse laughter a gasping cheer and then silence for now their play was over and it was with the grim quietness which is not unusual with their kind the men of silverdale turned towards the fire it rolled towards the homestead a waving crimson wall not fast but with remorseless persistency out of the dusky prairie and already the horses were plunging in the smoke of it that however did not greatly concern the men for the bare fire furrows stretched between themselves and it but there was also another blaze inside the defences and unless it was checked nothing could save house and barns and granaries rows of costly binders and stock of prairie hay they looked for a leader and found one ready for withams voice came up through the crackle of the fire  some of you lead the saddlehorses back to the willows and picket them the rest to the stables and bring out the working beasts the ploughs are by the corral and the first team that comes up is to be harnessed to each in turn then start in and turn over a falldepth furrow a furlong from the fire  there was no confusion and already the hired men were busy with two great machines until witham displaced two of them  how that fire passed the guards i dont know but there will be time to find out later he said to dane follow with the big breakerit wants a strong man to keep that share inas close as you can  then they were off a man at the heads of the leading horses harnessed to the great machines and witham sitting very intent in the drivingseat of one while the tough sod crackled under the rending shares both the man and the reins were needed when the smoke rolled down on them but it was for a moment torn aside again and there roared up towards the blurred arch of indigo a great rush of flame the heat of it smote into prickliness the uncovered skin and in spite of all that witham could do the beasts recoiled upon the machine behind them then they swung round wrenching the shares from the triplex furrow and for a few wild minutes man and terrified beast fought for the mastery breathless halfstrangled objurgations the clatter of trace and swivel and the thud of hoofs rose muffled through the roar of the fire for while swaying plunging panting they fought with fist and hoof it was rolling on and now the heat was almost insupportable the victory however was to the men and when the great machine went on again maud barrington who with the wife of one of her neighbours had watched the struggle stood wideeyed halfafraid and yet thrilled in every fibre  it was splendid she said they cant be beaten  her companion seemed to shiver a little yes she said perhaps it was but i wish it was over it would appeal to you differently my dear if you had a husband at one of those horses heads  for a moment maud barrington wondered whether it would and then when a red flame flickered out towards the team felt a little chill of dread in another second the smoke whirled about them and she moved backward choking with her companion the teams however went on and though the men who led them afterwards wondered how they kept their grip on the horses heads came out frantic with fear on the farther side then it was that while the machines swung round and other men ran to help witham springing from the drivingseat found dane amidst the swaying plunging medley of beasts and men  if you cant find hook or clevis cut the trace he said it cant burn the plough and the devils are out of hand now the fire will jump these furrows and weve got to try again  in another minute four maddened beasts were careering across the prairie with portions of their trappings banging about them while one man who was badly kicked sat down grey in face and gasping and the fire rolled up to the ridge of loam checked and then sprang across it here and there  ill take one of those lads places said dane that fellow cant hold the breaker straight courthorne  it was a minute or two later when he flung a breathless lad away from his plough and the latter turned upon him hoarse with indignation  i raced stapleton for it loose your hold confound you its mine he said  dane turned and laughed at him as he signed to one of the ontario hired men to take the near horses head  youre a plucky lad and youve done what you could he said still if you get in the way of a grown man now ill break your head for you  he was off in another moment crossed witham who had found fresh beasts in his furrow and had turned and doubled it before the fire that had passed the other barrier came close upon them once more the smoke grew blinding and one of danes beasts went down  im out of action now he said try back that team will never face it courthorne  withams face showed very grim under the tossing flame theyve got to im going through he said if the others are to stop it behind there they must have time  then he and the husband of the woman who had spoken to maud barrington passed on with the frantic team into the smoke that was streaked with flame  good lord said dane and added more as sitting on the horses head he turned his tingling face from the fire  it was some minutes before he and the hired man who came up loosed the fallen horse and led it and its fellow back towards the last defences the rest had been raising while the first furrows checked but did not stay the conflagration there he presently came upon the man who had been with witham  i dont know where courthorne is he said the beasts bolted with us just after wed gone through the worst of it and i fancy they took the plough along anyway i didnt see what became of them and dont fancy anybody would have worried much about them after being trampled on by a horse in the lumbar region  dane saw that the man was limping and white in face and asked no more questions it was evident to him that courthorne would be where he was most needed and he did what he could with those who were adding furrow to furrow across the path of the fire it rolled up to them roaring stopped flung a shower of burning filaments before it sank and swept aloft again while the sparks rained down upon the grass before the draught it made  blackened men with smouldering clothes were however ready and they fought each incipient blaze with soaked grain bags and shovels some of them also careless of blistered arms with their own wet jackets as fast as each fire was trampled out another sprang into life but the parent blaze that fed them sank and died and at last there was a hoarse cheer they had won and the fire they had beaten passed on divided across the prairie leaving the homestead unscathed between  then they turned to look for their leader and did not find him until a lad came up to dane  courthornes back by the second furrows and i fancy hes badly hurt he said he didnt appear to know me and his head seems all kicked in  it was not apparent how the news went round but in a few more minutes dane was kneeling beside a limp blackened object stretched amidst the grass and while his comrades clustered behind her maud barrington bent over him her voice was breathless as she asked you dont believe him dead  somebody had brought a lantern and dane felt inclined to gasp when he saw the girls white face but what she felt was not his business then  hes of a kind that is very hard to kill hold that lantern so i can see him he said  the rest waited silent glad that there was somebody to take a lead and in a few moments dane looked round again  ride in to the settlement stapleton and bring that doctor fellow out if you bring him by the neck stop just a moment you dont know where youre to bring him to  here of course said the lad breaking into a run  wait and danes voice stopped him now i dont fancy that would do it seems to me that this is a case in which a woman to look after him would be necessary  then before any of the married men or their wives who had followed them could make an offer maud barrington touched his shoulder  he is coming to the grange she said  dane nodded signed to stapleton then spoke quickly to the men about him and turned to maud barrington  ride on at a gallop and get everything ready ill see he comes to no harm he said  the girl felt curiously grateful as she rode out with her companion and dane who laid witham carefully in a wagon drew two of the other men aside when it rolled away towards the grange  there is something to be looked into did you notice anything unusual about the affair he said since you asked me i did said one of the men i however scarcely cared to mention it until i had time for reflection but while i fancy the regulation guards would have checked the fire on the boundaries without our help i dont see how one started in the hollow inside them  exactly said dane very dryly well we have got to discover it and the more quickly we do it the better i fancy however that the question who started it is what we have to consider  the men looked at one another and the third of them nodded  i fancy it comes to thatthough it is horribly unpleasant to admit it he said     chapter xvi  maud barrington is merciless   dane overtook the wagon close by the birch bluff at silverdale grange it was late then but there were lights in the windows that blinked beyond the trees and when the wagon stopped barrington stood in the doorway with one or two of his hired men accidents are not infrequent on the prairie where surgical assistance is not always available and there was a shutter ready on the ground beside him for the colonel had seen the field hospital in operation  unhook the tailboard he said sharply two of you pick up the shutter four more here now arms about his shoulders hips and knees lift and lowerstep off with right foot leading bearer with your left in the rear  it was done in a few moments and when the bearers passed into the big hall that rang with their shuffling steps maud barrington shivered as she waited with her aunt in an inner room that tramping was horribly suggestive and she had seen but little of sickness and grievous wounds still the fact scarcely accounted for the painful throbbing of her heart and the dizziness that came upon her then the bearers came in panting with barrington and dane behind them and the girl was grateful to her aunt who laid a hand upon her arm when she saw the singed head and blackened face that was smeared with a ruddier tint upon the shutter  lower said colonel barrington lift as i told you and the huddled object was laid upon the bed then there was silence until the impassive voice rose again  we shall not want you maud dane you and i will get these burnt things off him  the girl went out and while she stood feeling curiously chilly in an adjoining room barrington bent over his patient  well put together he said thoughtfully most of his people were lighter in the frame well we can only oil the burns and get a cold compress about his head all intact so far as i can see and i fancy hed pull through a good deal more than has happened to him i am obliged for your assistance but i need not keep you  the men withdrew and when a rattle of wheels rose from the prairie maud barrington waylaid her uncle in the hall her fingers were trembling and though her voice was steady the man glanced at her curiously as she asked how is he  one can scarcely form an opinion yet he said slowly he is burned here and there and his head is badly cut but it is the concussion that troubles me a frantic horse kicks tolerably hard you know but i shall be able to tell you more when the doctor comes tomorrow in the meanwhile you had better rest though you could look in and see if your aunt wants anything in an hour or two  maud barrington passed an hour in horrible impatience and then stole quietly into the sickroom the windows were open wide and the shaded lamp burned unsteadily as the cool night breeze flowed in its dim light just touched the man who lay motionless with a bandage round his head and the drawn pallor of his face once more sent a shiver through the girl then miss barrington rose and lifted a warning hand  quite unconscious still she said softly i fancy he was knocked down by one of the horses and trampled on but your uncle has hopes of him he has evidently led a healthy life  the girl was a little less serene than usual then and drew back into the shadow  yes she said we did not think so once  miss barrington smiled curiously are you very much astonished maud still there is nothing you can do for me and we shall want you tomorrow  realizing that there was no need for her the girl went out and when the door closed behind her the little whitehaired lady bent down and gazed at her patient long and steadily then she shook her head and moved back to the seat she had risen from with perplexity in her face  in the meantime maud barrington sat by the open window in her room staring out into the night there was a whispering in the birch bluff and the murmuring of leagues of grasses rose from the prairie that stretched away beyond it still though the wind fanned her throbbing forehead with a pleasant coolness the nocturnal harmonies awoke no response in her sleep was out of the question for her brain was in a whirl of vague sensation through which fear came uppermost every now and then why anything which could befall this man who had come out of the obscurity and was he had told her to go back into it again should disturb her maud barrington did not know but there was no disguising the fact that she would feel his loss grievously as others at silverdale would do then with a little tremor she wondered whether they must lose him and rising stood tensely still listening for any sound from the room where the sick man lay  there was nothing but the sighing of the grasses outside and the murmur of the birches in the bluff until the doleful howl of a coyote stole faintly out of the night again the beast sent its cry out upon the wind and the girl trembled as she listened the unearthly wail seemed charged with augury and every nerve in her thrilled  then she sank down into her chair again and sat still hoping listening fearing and wondering when the day would come until at last her eyes grew heavy and it was with a start she roused herself when a rattle of wheels came up out of the prairie in the early morning then a spumeflecked team swept up to the house a door swung open there was a murmur of voices and a sound of feet that moved softly in the hall after which for what seemed an interminable time silence reigned again at last when the stealthy patter of feet recommenced the girl slipped down the stairway and came upon barrington still she could not ask the question that was trembling on her lips  is there anything i can do she said  barrington shook his head not now the doctor is here and does not seem very anxious about him the concussion is not apparently serious and his other injuries will not trouble him much  maud barrington said nothing and turned away sensible of a great relief while her aunt entering her room an hour later found her lying fast asleep but still dressed as she had last seen her then being a discerning woman she went out softly with a curious smile and did not at any time mention what she had seen  it was that evening and barrington had departed suddenly on business to winnipeg when dane rode up to the grange he asked for miss barrington and her niece and when he heard that his comrade was recovering sensibility sat down looking very grave  i have something to tell you but courthorne must not know until he is better while im not sure that we need tell him then he said in the meanwhile i am also inclined to fancy it would be better kept from colonel barrington on his return it is the first time anything of the kind has happened at silverdale and it would hurt him horribly which decided us to come first to you  you must be more concise said miss barrington quietly and dane trifled with the hat in his hand  it is he said a most unpleasant thing and is known to three men only of whom i am one we have also arranged that nobody else will chance upon what we have discovered you see ferris is unfortunately connected with you and his people have had trouble enough already  ferris said maud barrington with a sudden hardening of her face you surely dont mean  dane nodded yes he said reluctantly im afraid i do now if you will listen to me for a minute or two  he told his story with a grim convincing quietness and the blood crept into the girls cheeks as she followed his discoveries step by step glancing at her aunt she saw that there was horror as well as belief in the gentle ladys face  then she said with cold incisiveness ferris cannot stay here and he shall be punished  no said dane we have no room for a lad of his disposition at silverdalebut im very uncertain in regard to the rest you see it couldnt be done without attracting attentionand i have the honour of knowing his mother you will remember how she lost another son that is why i did not tell colonel barrington he is a trifleprecipitateoccasionally  miss barrington glanced at him gratefully you have done wisely she said ethel ferris has borne enough and she has never been the same since the horrible night they brought frank home for she knew how he came by his death though the coroner brought it in misadventure i also fancy my brother would be implacable in a case like this though how far i am warranted in keeping the facts from him i do not know  dane nodded gravely we leave that to you you will however remember what happened once before we cannot go through what we did then again  miss barrington recalled the formal courtmartial that had once been held in the hall of the grange when every man in the settlement had been summoned to attend for there were offences in regard to which her brother was inflexible when it was over and the disgraced man went forth an outcast a full account of the proceedings had been forwarded to those at home who had hoped for much from him  no she said for the sake of the woman who sent him here we must stop short of that  then maud barrington looked at them both there is one person you do not seem to consider at all and that is the man who lies here in peril through ferriss fault she said is there nothing due to him  dane noticed the sternness in her eyes and glanced as if for support towards miss barrington i fancy he would be the last to claim it if he knew what we do still in the meanwhile i leave the affair to your aunt and you we would like to have your views before doing anything further  he rose as he spoke and when he had gone out maud barrington sat down at a writing table aunt she said quietly i will ask ferris to come here at once  it was next day when ferris came evidently ill at ease though he greeted miss barrington with elaborate courtesy and would have done the same with her niece but the girl turned from him with visible disdain  sit down she said coldly colonel barrington is away but his sister will take his place and after him i have the largest stake in the welfare of silverdale now a story has come to our ears which if it had not been substantiated would have appeared incredible shall miss barrington tell it you  ferris who was a very young man flushed but the colour faded and left his cheeks a trifle grey he was not a very prepossessing lad for it requires a better physique than he was endowed with to bear the stamp of viciousness that is usually most noticeable on the feeble but he was distinguished by a trace of arrogance that not infrequently served him as well as resolution  if it would not inconvenience miss barrington it would help me to understand a good deal i can find no meaning for now he said  the elder ladys face grew sterner and very quietly but remorselessly she set forth his offence until no one who heard the tale could have doubted the origin of the fire  i should have been better pleased had you if only when you saw we knew everything appeared willing to confess your fault and make amends she said  ferris laughed as ironically as he dared under the eyes which had lost their gentleness you will pardon me for telling you that i have no intention of admitting it now that you should be so readily prejudiced against me is not gratifying but you see nobody could take any steps without positive proof of the story and my word is at least as credible as that of the interloper who told it you  maud barrington raised her head suddenly and looked at him with a curious light in her eyes but the elder lady made a little gesture of deprecation  mr courthorne has told us nothing she said still three gentlemen whose worth is known at silverdale are willing to certify every point of it if we lay the affair before colonel barrington you will have an opportunity of standing face to face with them  the lads assurance which so far and no further did duty for courage deserted him he was evidently not prepared to be made the subject of another courtmartial and the hand he laid on the table in front of him trembled a little  madam he said hoarsely if i admit everything what will you do  nothing said maud barrington coldly on conditions that within a month you leave silverdale  ferris stared at her you cant mean that you see im fond of farming and nobody would give me what the place cost me i couldnt live among the outside settler fellows  the girl smiled coldly i mean exactly what you heard and if you do not enlighten them the settlers would probably not object to you your farm will be taken over at what you gave for it  ferris stood up i am going to make a last appeal silverdales the only place fit for a gentleman to live in in canada and i want to stay here you dont know what it would cost me to go away and id do anything for reparationsend a big cheque to a winnipeg hospital and starve myself to make up for it if that would content you only dont send me away  his tone grew almost abject as he proceeded and while miss barringtons eyes softened her nieces heart grew harder because of it as she remembered that he had brought a strong man down  no she said dryly that would punish your mother and sisters from whom you would cajole the money you can decide between leaving silverdale and having the story and the proof of it put into the hands of colonel barrington  she sat near an open window regarding him with quiet scorn and the light that shone upon her struck a sparkle from her hair and set the rounded cheek and neck gleaming like ivory the severity of her pose became her and the lads callow desire that had driven him to his ruin stirred him to impotent rage in his desperation there were grey patches in his cheeks and his voice was strained and hoarse  you have no mercy on me because i struck at him he said the one thing i shall always be sorry for is that i failed and i would go away with pleasure if the horse had trampled the life out of him well there was a time when you could have made what you wished of me and now at least i shall not see the blackleg you have showered your favours on drag you down to the mire he came from  maud barringtons face had grown very colourless but she said nothing and her aunt rose and raised the hammer of a gong  ferris she said do you wish to be led out by the hired men  the lad laughed and the hideous merriment set the whitehaired ladys nerves on edge oh i am going now but for once let us be honest it was for her i did it and if it had been any other man i had injured she would have forgiven me  then with an ironical farewell he swung out of the room and the two women exchanged glances when the door closed noisily behind him miss barrington was flushed with anger but her nieces face was paler than usual  are there men like him she said  miss barrington shook off her anger and rising laid a gentle hand on her nieces shoulder very few i hope she said still it would be better if we sent word to dane you would not care for that tale to spread  for a moment the girls cheek flamed then she rose quietly and crossed the room  no she said and her aunt stood still apparently lost in contemplation after the door swung softly to then she sat down at the writing table there was very little in the note but an hour after dane received it that night a wagon drew up outside ferriss farm two men went quietly in and found the owner of the homestead sitting with a sheaf of papers scattered about the table in front of him  come back tomorrow i cant be worried now he said well why the devil dont you go  dane laid a hand on his shoulder we are waiting for you you are coming with us  ferris turned and stared at them where to  to the railroad said dane dryly after that you can go just where it pleases you now theres no use whatever making a fuss and every care will be taken of your property until you can arrange to dispose of it hadnt you better get ready  the grim quietness of the voice was sufficient and ferris who saw that force would be used if it was necessary decided that it was scarcely likely his hired men would support him  i might have expected it he said of course it was imprudent to speak the truth to our leaders niece you know what i have done  i know what you did the night courthorne nearly lost his life said dane one would have fancied that would have contented you  well said ferris if you like to hear of a more serious offence ill oblige you  danes finger closed on his arm if you attempt to tell me ill break your head for you  next moment ferris was lifted from his chair and in less than ten minutes dane thrust him into the wagon where another man who passed a hand through his arm sat beside him it was a very long drive to the railroad but few words were exchanged during it and when they reached the settlement one of ferriss companions mounted guard outside the hotel he found accommodation in until the montreal express crawled up above the rim of the prairie then both went with him to the station and as the long cars rolled in dane turned quietly to the lad  now i am quite aware that we are incurring some responsibility so you need not waste your breath he said there are however lawyers in winnipeg if you fancy it is advisable to make use of them and you know where i and macdonald are if you want us in the meanwhile your farm will be run better than ever it was in your hands until you dispose of it that is all i have to tell you except that if any undesirable version of the affair gets about courthorne or i will assuredly find you  then there was a scream of the whistle and the train rolled away with ferris standing white with fury on the platform of a car  in the meanwhile maud barrington spent a sleepless night ferriss taunt had reached its mark and she realized with confusion that it was the truth he spoke the fact that brought the blood to her cheeks would no longer be hidden and she knew it was a longing to punish the lad who had struck down the man she loved that had led to her insistence on the former leaving silverdale it was a difficult admission but she made it that night the outcast who had stepped out of the obscurity and into her peaceful life had shown himself a man that any woman might be proud to mate with and though he had said very little and now and then his words were bitter she knew that he loved her whatever he had doneand she felt against all the teachings of her reason that it had not been evilhe had shown himself the equal of the best at silverdale and she laughed as she wondered which of the men there she could set in the balance against him then she shivered a little remembering that there was a barrier whose extent he alone realized between them and wondered vaguely what the future would bring  it was a week or two before witham was on his feet again and maud barrington was one of the first to greet him when he walked feebly into the hall she had however decided on the line of conduct that would be most fitting and there was no hint of more than neighbourly kindliness in her tone they had spoken about various trifles when witham turned to her  you and miss barrington have taken such good care of me that if i consulted my inclinations i would linger in convalescence a long while he said still i must make an effort to get away tomorrow  we cannot take the responsibility of letting you go under a week yet said maud barrington have you anything especially important to do  yes said withamand the girl understood the grimness of his facei have  it concerns the fire  witham looked at her curiously i would sooner you did not ask me that question miss barrington  i scarcely fancy it is necessary said the girl with a little smile still i have something to tell you and a favour to ask ferris has left silverdale and you must never make any attempt to discover what caused the fire  you know  yes said maud barrington dane macdonald and hassal know too but you will not ask them and if you did they would not tell you  i can refuse you nothing said witham with a laugh though his voice betrayed him still i want a quid pro quo wait until ferriss farm is in the sale list and then take it with the growing crop  i could not there are reasons said the girl  witham gazed at her steadily and a little colour crept to his forehead but he answered unconcernedly they can be overridden it may be the last favour i shall ever ask you  no said maud barrington anything else you wish but not that you must believe without wondering why that it is out of the question  witham yielded with a curious little smile well he said we will let it drop i ask no questions you have accepted so much already without understanding it     chapter xvii  with the stream   it was withams last afternoon at the grange and almost unpleasantly hot while the man whose vigour had not as yet returned to him was content to lounge in the big windowseat listlessly watching his companion he had borne the strain of effort long and the time of his convalescence amidst the tranquility of silverdale grange had with the gracious kindliness of miss barrington and her niece been a revelation to him there were moments when it brought him bitterness and selfreproach but these were usually brief and he made the most of what he knew might never be his again telling himself that it would at least be something to look back upon  maud barrington sat close by glancing through the letters a mounted man had brought in and the fact that his presence put no restraint on her curiously pleased the man at last however she opened a paper and passed it across to him  you have been very patient but no doubt you will find something that will atone for my silence there she said  witham turned over the journal and then smiled at her is there anything of moment in your letters  no said the girl with a little laugh i scarcely think there isa garden party a big reception the visit of a high official and a description of the latest hat still you know that is supposed to be enough for us  then i wonder whether you will find this more interesting the bears made a determined rally yesterday and wheat moved back again there was later in the day a rush to sell and prices now stand at almost two cents below their lowest level  yes said maud barrington noticing the sudden intentness of his pallid face i do it is serious news for you  and for you you see where i have led you ill or well i must start for winnipeg tomorrow  maud barrington smiled curiously you and i and a handful of others stand alone but i told you i would not blame you whether we won or lost do you know that i am grateful for the glimpses of the realities of life that you have given me  witham felt his pulses throb faster for the girls unabated confidence stirred him but he looked at her gravely i wonder if you realize what you have given me in return life as i had seen it was very grim and bareand now i know what with a little help it is possible to make of it  with a little help said maud barrington  witham nodded and his face which had grown almost wistful hardened those who strive in the pit are apt to grow blind to the bestthe sweetness and order and all the little graces that mean so much even if their eyes are opened it is usually too late you see they lose touch with all that lies beyond the struggle and without some one to lead them they cannot get back to it still if i talk in this fashion you will laugh at me but every one has his weakness now and thenand no doubt i shall make up for it at winnipeg tomorrow one cannot afford to be fanciful when wheat is two cents down  maud barrington was not astonished tireless in his activities and more curious still almost ascetic in his mode of life the man had already given her glimpses of his inner self and the vague longings that came upon him he never asked her pity but she found something pathetic in his attitude for it seemed he knew that the stress and the turmoil alone could be his why this was so she did not know but it was with a confidence that could not be shaken now she felt it was through no fault of his his last words however showed her that the mask was on again  i scarcely fancy you are well enough but if you must go i wonder whether you would do a good turn to alfreton she said the lad has been speculating and he seems anxious lately  it is natural that they should all bring their troubles to you  maud barrington laughed i however generally pass them on to you  a trace of colour crept into the mans face and his voice was a trifle hoarse as he said do you know that i would ask nothing better than to take every care you had and bear it for you  still said the girl with a little smile that is very evidently out of the question  witham rose and she saw that one hand was closed as he looked down upon her then he turned and stared out at the prairie but there was something very significant in the rigidity of his attitude and his face seemed to have grown suddenly careworn when he glanced back at her  of course he said quietly you see i have been ill and a little off my balance lately that accounts for erratic speeches though i meant it all colonel barrington is still in winnipeg  yes said the girl who was not convinced by the explanation very quietly i am a little anxious about him too he sold wheat forward and i gather from his last letter has not bought it yet now as alfreton is driving in tomorrow he could take you  witham was grateful to her and still more to miss barrington who came in just then while he did not see the girl again before he departed with alfreton on the morrow when they had left silverdale a league behind the trail dipped steeply amidst straggling birches to a bridge which spanned the creek in a hollow and witham glanced at the winding ascent thoughtfully  it has struck me that going round by this place puts another six miles on to your journey to the railroad and a double team could not pull a big load up he said  the lad nodded the creek is a condemned nuisance we have either to load light when we are hauling grain in and then pitch half the bags off at the bottom and come back for themwhile you know one man cant put up many four bushel bagsor keep a man and horses at the ravine until were through  witham laughed now i wonder whether you ever figured how much those little things put up the price of your wheat  this is the only practicable way down said the lad you can scarcely climb up one side where the ravines narrow abreast of silverdale  drive round i want to see it said witham call at rushforth for a spool of binder twine  halfanhour later alfreton pulled the wagon up amidst the birches on the edge of the ravine which just there sloped steep as a railway cutting and not very much broader to the creek witham gazed at it and then handed the twine to the hired man  take that with you charley and get down he said if you strip your boots off you can wade through the creek  i dont know that i want to said the man  well said witham it would please me if you did as well as cool your feet then you could climb up and hold that twine down on the other side  the man grinned and though alfreton remembered that he was not usually so tractable with him proceeded to do withams bidding when he came back there was a twinkle of comprehension in his eyes and witham who cut off the length of twine smiled at alfreton  it is he said dryly only a little idea of mine  they drove on and reaching winnipeg next day went straight to graham the wheatbrokers offices he kept them waiting some time and in the meanwhile men with intent faces passed hastily in and out through the outer office some of them had telegrams or bundles of papers in their hands and the eyes of all were eager the corridor rang with footsteps the murmur of voices seemed to vibrate through the great building while it seemed to alfreton there was a suggestion of strain and expectancy in all he heard and saw witham however sat gravely still though the lad noticed that his eyes were keener than usual for the muffled roar of the city patter of messengers feet ceaseless tinkle of telephone call bells and whirr of the elevators each packed with human freight all stirred him hitherto he had grappled with nature but now he was to test his judgment against the keenest wits of the cities and stand or fall by it in the struggle that was to be waged over the older nations food  at last however a clerk signed to them from a doorway and they found graham sitting before a littered table a man sat opposite him with the telephone receiver in his hand  sorry to keep you but ive both hands full just now every man in this city is thinking wheat he said has he word from chicago thomson  yes said the clerk bears lost hold this morning general buying  just then the door swung open and a breathless man came in guess i scared that clerk of yours who wanted to turn me off he said heard what chicagos doing well youve got to buy for me now theyre going to send her right up into the sky and its bout time i got out before the bulls trample the life out of me  quite sure you cant wait until tomorrow asked graham  the man shook his head no sir when ive been selling all along the line send off right away and tell your man on the market to cover every blame sale for me  graham signed to the clerk and as the telephone bell tinkled a lad brought in a message the broker opened it new york lost advance and recovered it twice in the first hour he read at present a point or two better steady buying in liverpool  that said the other man is quite enough for me let me have the contracts as soon as theyre ready  he went out and graham turned to witham theres halfadozen more of them outside he said do you buy or sell  witham laughed i want to know which a wise man would do  well said graham i cant tell you the bulls rushed wheat up as i wired you but the other folks got their claws in and worried it down again wheats anywhere and nowhere all the time and im advising nobody just now no doubt youve formed your own opinion  witham nodded its the last of the grappled and the bears arent quite beaten yet but any time the next week or two the decisive turn will come then if they havent got out therell be very little left of them  you seem tolerably sure of the thing got plenty of confidence in the bulls  witham smiled i fancy i know how western wheat was sown this year better than any statistician of the ring and its not the bulls im counting on but those millions of hungry folks in the old country its not new york or chicago but liverpool the spark is coming from  well said graham thats my notion too but ive no time for anybody who hasnt grist for me just now still id be glad to come round and take you home to supper if you havent the prejudice which is not unknown at silverdale against eating with a man who makes his dollars on the market and didnt get them given him  witham laughed and held up a lean brown hand all i ever had until less than a year ago i earned with that ill be ready for you  he went out with alfreton and noticed that the lad ate little at lunch when the meal was over he glanced at him with a smile through the cigar smoke  i think it would do you good to take me into your confidence he said  well said alfreton it would be a relief to talk and i feel i could trust you still its only fair to tell you i didnt at the beginning i was an opinionated ass you see  witham laughed i dont mind in the least and we have most of us felt that way  well said the lad i was a little short of funds and proud of myself and when everybody seemed certain that wheat was going down for ever i thought i saw my chance of making a little now ive more wheat than i care to think of to deliver the markets against me if it stiffens any further it will break me and thats not all you see things have gone tolerably badly with the folks at home and i fancy it took a good deal of what should have been the girls portion to start me at silverdale  then said witham its no use trying to show you how foolish youve been that is the usual thing and its easy but what the man in the hole wants to know is the means of getting out again  alfreton smiled ruefully im tolerably far in i could just cover at todays prices if i pledged my crop but it would leave me nothing to go on with and the next advance would swamp the farm  well said witham quietly dont buy today theres going to be an advance that will take folks breath away but the times not quite ripe yet youll see prices knocked back a little the next day or two and then you will cover your sales to the last bushel  but are you sure asked the lad a trifle hoarsely you see if youre mistaken it will mean ruin to me  witham laid his hand on his shoulder if i am wrong ill make your losses good  nothing more was said on that subject but alfretons face grew anxious once more as they went up and down the city everybody was talking wheat which was not astonishing for that city and the two great provinces to the west of it lived by the trade in grain and before the afternoon had passed they learned that there had been a persistent advance the lads uneasiness showed itself but when they went back to the hotel about the supper hour witham smiled at him  youre feeling sick he said still i dont fancy you need worry  then graham appeared and claimed him and it was next morning when he saw alfreton again he was breakfasting with colonel barrington and dane and witham noticed that the older man did not appear to have much appetite when the meal was finished he drew him aside  you have covered your sales sir he asked  no sir said barrington i have not  then i wonder if it would be presumption if i asked you a question  barrington looked at him steadily to be frank i fancy it would be better if you did not i have of course only my own folly to blame for believing i could equal your natural aptitude for this risky amusement which i had and still have objections to i was however in need of money and seeing your success yielded to the temptation i am not laying any of the responsibility on you but am not inclined to listen to more of your suggestions  witham met his gaze without embarrassment i am sorry you have been unfortunate sir  just then dane joined them i sat up late last night in the hope of seeing you he said now i dont know what to make of the market but there were one or two fellows who would have bought my estimated crop from me at a figure which would have about covered working expenses some of the others who did not know you were coming in put their affairs in my hands too  sell nothing said witham quietly  it was an hour later when a messenger from graham found them in the smokingroom and colonel barrington smiled dryly as he tore up the envelope handed him  market opened with sellers prevailing chicago flat he read  dane glanced at witham somewhat ruefully but the latters eyes were fixed on colonel barrington  if i had anything to cover i should still wait he said  that said dane is not exactly good news to me  our turn will come said witham gravely  that day and during several which followed it wheat moved down and dane said nothing to witham about what he felt though his face grew grimmer as the time went on barrington was quietly impassive when they met him while alfreton who saw a way out of his difficulties was hard to restrain witham long afterwards remembered that horrible suspense but he showed no sign of what he was enduring then and was only a trifle quieter than usual when he and alfreton entered grahams office one morning it was busier than ever while the men who hastened in and out seemed to reveal by attitude and voice that they felt something was going to happen  in sellers favour said the broker everybody with a few dollars is hammering prices one way or the other nothing but wheat is heard of in this city well well simmer down when the turn comes and though im piling up dollars ill be thankful hallo thomson anything going on now  chicago buying said the clerk now its liverpool sellers holding off wanting a twoeights more the cental  the telephone bell tinkled again and there was a trace of excitement in the face of the man who answered it  walthew has got news ahead of us he said chicago bears caved in buying orders from liverpool broke them got it there strong  witham tapped alfretons shoulder now is the time tell him to buy he said well wait outside until youve put this deal through graham  it was twenty minutes before graham came out to them ill let you have your contracts mr alfreton and my man on the market just fixed them in time he said theyre up a penny on the cental in liverpool now and nobody will sell while here in winnipeg theyre falling over each other to buy never had such a circus since the trade began  alfreton who seemed to quiver turned to his companion and then forgot what he had to tell him witham had straightened himself and his eyes were shining while the lad was puzzled by his face still save for the little tremor in it his voice was very quiet  it has come at last he said two farms would not have covered your losses alfreton if you had waited until tomorrrow have supper with us grahamif you like it lakes of champagne  i want my head but ill come said graham with a curious smile i dont know that it wouldnt pay me to hire yours just now  then witham turned suddenly and running down the stairway shook the man awaiting him by the arm  the floods with us now he said find colonel barrington and make him cover everything before hes ruined dane you and i and a few others will see the dollars rolling into silverdale  dane found barrington who listened with a grim smile to what he had to tell him  the words are yours dane but that is all he said wheat will go down again and i do not know that i am grateful to courthorne  dane dare urge nothing further and spent the rest of that day wandering up and down the city in a state of blissful content with alfreton and witham one of them had turned his losses into a small profit and the other two who had hoping almost against hope sown when others had feared to plough saw that the harvest would repay them beyond their wildest expectations they heard nothing but predictions of higher prices everywhere and the busy city seemed to throb with exultation the turn had come and there was hope for the vast wheat lands it throve upon  graham had much to tell them when they sat down to the somewhat elaborate meal witham termed supper that night and he nodded approvingly when dane held out his glass of champagne and touched his comrades  im not fond of speeches courthorne and i fancy our tastes are the same he said still i cant let this great night pass without greeting you as the man who has saved not a few of us at silverdale we were in a very tight place before you came and we are with you when you want us from this time soul and body and all our possessions alfretons eyes glistened and his hand shook a little as he touched the rim of withams goblet  there are folks in the old country who will bless you when they know he said youll forget it though i cant that i was once against you  witham nodded to them gravely and when the glasses were empty shook hands with the three  we have put up a good fight and i think we shall win but while you will understand me better byandby what you have offered me almost hurts he said  what we have given is yours we dont take it back said dane  witham smiled though there was a wistfulness in his eyes as he saw the faint bewilderment in his companions faces  well he said slowly you can do a little for me now colonel barrington was right when he set his face against speculation and it was only because i saw dollars were badly needed at silverdale and the one means of getting them i made my deal still if we are to succeed as farmers we must market our wheat as cheaply as our rivals and we want a new bridge on the level now i got a drawing of one and estimates for british columbia stringers yesterday while the birches in the ravine will give us what else we want ill build a bridge myself but it will cheapen the wheathauling to everybody and you might like to help me  dane glanced at the drawing laid before him but alfreton spoke first one hundred dollars im only a small man but i wish it was five he said  ill make it that much and see the others do their share said dane and then glanced at the broker with a curious smile  how does he do itthis and other things he was never a business man  graham nodded he cant help it it was born in him you and i can figure and plan but courthorne is differentthe right thing comes to him i knew the first night i saw him you had got the man you wanted at silverdale  then witham stood up wineglass in hand i am obliged to you but i fancy this has gone far enough he said there is one man who has done more for you than i could ever do prosperity is a good thing but you at least know what he has aimed at stands high above that may you have the head of the silverdale community long with you     chapter xviii  under test   the prairie lay dim and shadowy in the creeping dusk when witham sat on a redwood stringer near the head of his partlyfinished bridge there was no sound from the hollow behind him but the faint gurgle of the creek and the almost imperceptible vibration of countless minute wings the birches which climbed the slope to it wound away sinuously a black wall on either hand and the prairie lying grey and still stretched back into the silence in front of him here and there a smouldering fire showed dully red on the brink of the ravine but the tired men who had lighted them were already wrapped in heavy slumber  the prairie hay was gathered harvest had not come and for the last few weeks witham with his hired men from the bush of ontario had toiled at the bridge with a tireless persistency which had somewhat astonished the gentlemen farmers of silverdale they however rode over every now and then and most cheerfully rendered what assistance they could until it was time to return for tennis or a shooting sweepstake and witham thanked them gravely even when he and his ontario axemen found it necessary to do the work again he could have told nobody why he had undertaken to build the bridge which could be of no use to him but he was in a measure prompted by instincts born in him for he was one of the englishmen who with a dim recognition of the primeval charge to subdue the earth and render it fruitful gravitate to the newer lands and usually leave their mark upon them he had also a halfdefined notion that it would be something he could leave behind in reparation that the men of silverdale might remember the stranger who had imposed on them more leniently while in the strain of the mental struggle strenuous occupation was a necessity to him  a bundle of papers it was now too dim to see lay beside him clammy with the dew and he sat bareheaded a pipe which had gone out in his hand staring across the prairie with an ironical smile in his eyes he had planned boldly and striven tirelessly and now the fee he could not take would surely be tendered him wheat was growing dearer every day and such crops as he had sown had not been seen at silverdale still the man who had had few compunctions before he met maud barrington knew now that in a little while he must leave all he had painfully achieved behind what he would do then he did not know for only one fact seemed certainin another four months or less he would have turned his back on silverdale  presently however the sound of horsehoofs caught his ears and he stood up when a mounted figure rose out of the prairie the moon had just swung up round and coppery from behind a rise and when horse and rider cut black and sharp against it his pulses throbbed faster and a little flush crept into his face for he knew every line of the figure in the saddle some minutes had passed when maud barrington rode slowly to the head of the bridge and pulled up her horse at the sight of him  the moon turning silver now shone behind her head and a tress of hair sparkled beneath her wide hat while the man had a glimpse of the gleaming whiteness of rounded cheek and neck her face he could not see but shapely shoulders curve of waist and sweeping line of the light habit were forced up as in a daguerreotype and as the girl sat still looking down on him slender lissom dainty etherealized almost by the brightening radiance she seemed to him a visionary complement of the harmonies of the night it also appeared wiser to think of her as such than a being of flesh and blood whom he had wildly ventured to long for and he almost regretted when her first words dispelled the illusion  it is dreadfully late she said pluto went very lame soon after i left macdonalds and i knew if i went back for another horse he would have insisted on riding home with me i had slipped away while he was in the granary one can cross the bridge  not mounted said witham there are only a few planks between the stringers here and there but if you dont mind waiting i can lead your horse across  he smiled a little for the words seemed trivial and out of place in face of the effect the girls appearance had on him but she glanced at him questioningly  no she said now i would have gone round by the old bridge only that allardyce told me you let him ride across this afternoon  still and the man stopped a moment it was daylight then you see  maud barrington laughed a little for his face was visible and she understood the slowness of his answer is that all it is moonlight now  no said witham dryly but one is apt to make an explanation too complete occasionally will you let me help you down  maud barrington held out her hands and when he swung her down watched him tramp away with the horse with a curious smile a light compliment seldom afforded her much pleasure but the mans grim reserve had now and then piqued more than her curiosity though she was sensible that the efforts she occasionally made to uncover what lay behind it were not without their risk then he came back and turned to her very gravely  let me have your hand he said  maud barrington gave it him and hoped the curious little thrill that ran through her when his hard fingers closed upon her palm did not communicate itself to him she also noticed that he moved his head sharply a moment and then looked straight in front again then the birches seemed to fall away beneath them and they moved out across the dim gully with the looselylaid planking rattling under their feet until they came to a strip scarcely three feet wide which spanned a gulf of blackness in the shadow of the trees  hold fast said witham with a trace of hoarseness you are sure you feel quite steady  of course said the girl with a little laugh though she recognized the anxiety in his voice and felt his hand close almost cruelly on her own she was by no means timorous and still less fanciful but when they moved out into the blackness that closed about them above and beneath along the slender strip of swaying timber she was glad of the masterful grip it seemed in some strange fashion portentous for she felt that she would once more be willing to brave unseen perils secure only in his guidance what he felt she did not know and was sensible of an almost overwhelming curiosity until when at last wellstiffened timber lay beneath them she contrived to drop a glove just where the moonlight smote the bridge witham stooped and his face was clear in the silvery light when he rose again maud barrington saw the relief in it and compelled by some influence stood still looking at him with a little glow behind the smile in her eyes a good deal was revealed to both of them in that instant but the man dare not admit it and was master of himself  yes he said very simply i am glad you are across  maud barrington laughed i scarcely fancy the risk was very great but tell me about the bridge she said you are living beside it  yes said witham in a tent i must have it finished before harvest you see  the girl understood why this was necessary but deciding that she had on other occasions ventured sufficiently far with that topic moved on across the bridge  a tent she said cannot be a very comfortable place to live in and who cooks for you  witham smiled dryly i am used to it and can do all the cooking that is necessary he said it is the usual home for the beginner and i lived six months in oneon grindstone bread the tinctured glucose you are probably not acquainted with as drips and rancid porkwhen i first came out to this country and hired myself for ten dollars monthly to another man it is a diet one gets a little tired of occasionally but after breaking prairie twelve hours every day one can eat almost anything and when i afterwards turned farmer my credit was rarely good enough to provide the pork  the girl looked at him curiously for she knew how some of the smaller settlers lived and once more felt divided between wonder and sympathy she could picture the grim selfdenial for she had seen the stubborn patience in this mans face as well as a stamp that was not borne by any other man at silverdale some of the crofter settlers who periodically came near starvation in their sod hovels and the men from ontario who staked their little handful of dollars on the first wheat crop to be wrested from the prairie bore it however from what miss barrington had told her it was clear that courthornes first year in canada could not have been spent in this fashion but there was no doubt in the girls mind as she listened her faith was equal to a more strenuous test  there is a difference in the present but who taught you bridgebuilding it takes years to learn the use of the axe she said  witham laughed i think it took me four but the man who has not a dollar to spare usually finds out how to do a good many things for himself and i had working drawings of the bridge made in winnipeg besides your friends have helped me with their hands as well as their goodwill except at the beginning they have all been kind to me and one could not well have expected very much from them then  maud barrington coloured a trifle as she remembered her own attitude towards him cannot you forget it she said with a curious little ring in her voice they would do anything you asked them now  one generally finds it useful to have a good memory and i remember most clearly that although they had very little reason for it most of them afterwards trusted me that made and still makes a great difference to me  the girl appeared thoughtful does it she said still do you know i fancy that if they had tried to drive you out you would have stayed in spite of them  yes said witham dryly i believe i would but the fact that in a very little while they held out a friendly hand to a stranger steeped in suspicion and gave him the chance to prove himself their equal carries a big responsibility that and your aunts goodness puts so many things one might have done out of the question  the obvious inference was that the prodigal had been reclaimed by the simple means of putting him on his honour but that did not for a moment suggest itself to the girl she had often regretted her own disbelief and once more felt the need for reparation  lance she said very quietly my aunt was wiser than i was but she was mistaken what she gave you out of her wide charity was already yours by right  that was complete and final for maud barrington did nothing by half and witham recognized that she held him blameless in the past which she could not know as well as in the present which was visible to her her confidence stung him as a whip and when in place of answering he looked away the girl fancied that a smothered groan escaped him she waited curiously expectant but he did not speak and just then the fall of hoofs rose from behind the birches in the bluff then a mans voice came through it singing a little french song and maud barrington glanced at her companion  lance she said how long is it since you sang that song  well said witham doggedly conscious of what he was doing i do not know a word of it and never heard it in my life  maud barrington stared at him think she said it seems ever so long ago but you cannot have forgotten surely you remember madame aubert who taught me to prattle in french and the day you slipped into the musicroom and picked up the song while she tried in vain to teach it me cant you recollect how i cried when you sang it in the billiardroom and uncle geoffrey gave you the halfsovereign which had been promised to me  no said witham a trifle hoarsely and with his head turned from her watched the trail  a man in embroidered deerskin jacket was riding into the moonlight and though the little song had ceased and the wide hat hid his face there was an almost insolent gracefulness in his carriage that seemed familiar to witham it was not the abandon of the swashbuckler stockrider from across the frontier but something more finished and distinguished that suggested the bygone cavalier maud barrington it was evident also noticed it  geoffrey courthorne rode as that man does she said i remember hearing my mother once tell him that he had been born too late because his attributes and tastes would have fitted him to follow prince rupert  witham made no answer and the man rode on until he drew bridle in front of them then he swung his hat off and while the moonlight shone into his face looked down with a little ironical smile at the man and woman standing beside the horse witham closed one hand a trifle and slowly straightened himself feeling that there was need of all his selfcontrol for he saw his companion glance at him and then almost too steadily at lance courthorne  the latter said nothing for a space of seconds for which witham hated him and yet in the tension of the suspense he noticed that the signs of indulgence he had seen on the last occasion were plainer in courthornes face the little bitter smile upon his lips was also not quite in keeping with the restlessness of his fingers upon the bridle  is that bridge fit for crossing farmer he asked  yes said witham quietly you must lead your horse  maud barrington had in the meanwhile stood very still and now moved as by an effort it is time i rode on and you can show the stranger across she said i have kept you at least five minutes longer than was necessary  courthorne witham fancied shifted one foot from the stirrup but then sat still as the farmer held his hand for the girl to mount by while when she rode away he looked at his companion with a trace of anger as well as irony in his eyes  yes said witham what you heard was correct miss barringtons horse fell lame coming from one of the farms which accounts for her passing here so late i had just led the beast across the incompleted bridge still it is not on my account i tell you this where have you been and why have you broken one of my conditions  courthorne laughed it seems to me you are adopting a somewhat curious tone i went to my homestead to look for you  you have not answered my other question and in the meanwhile i am your tenant and the place is mine  we really neednt quibble said courthorne i came for the very simple reason that i wanted money  you had one thousand dollars said witham dryly  courthorne made a little gesture of resignation it is however certain that i havent got them now they went as dollars usually do the fact is i have met one or two men recently who apparently know rather more about games of chance than i do and i passed on the fame which was my most valuable asset to you  you passed me on the brand of a crime i never committed said witham grimly that however is not the question now not one dollar except at the time agreed upon will you get from me why did you come here dressed as we usually are on the prairie  courthorne glanced down at the deerskin jacket and smiled as he straightened himself into a caricature of withams mounted attitude it was done cleverly  when i ride in this fashion we are really not very unlike you see and i let one or two men i met get a good look at me he said i meant it as a hint that it would be wise of you to come to terms with me  i have done so already you made the bargain  well said courthorne smiling a contract may be modified at any time when both parties are willing  one is not said witham dryly you heard my terms and nothing that you can urge will move me a hairsbreadth from them  courthorne looked at him steadily and some men would have found his glance disconcerting for now and then all the wickedness that was in him showed in his halfclosed eyes still he saw that the farmer was unyielding  then we will let it go in the meanwhile he said take me across the bridge  they were halfway along it when he pulled the horse up and once more looked down on witham  your hand is a tolerably good one so long as you are willing to sacrifice yourself but it has its weak points and there is one thing i could not tolerate he said  what is that  courthorne laughed wickedly you wish me to be explicit maud barrington is devilishly pretty but it is quite out of the question that you should ever marry her  witham turned towards him with the veins on his forehead swollen granting that it is so what is that to you  courthorne nodded as if in comprehension well im probably not consistent but one rarely quite loses touch with everything and if i believed that my kinswoman was growing fond of a beggarly farmer id venture to put a sudden stop to your lovemaking this at least is perfectly bona fide witham  witham had borne a good deal of late and his hatred of the man flared up he had no definite intention but he moved a pace forward and courthorne touched the horse with his heel it backed and then growing afraid of the blackness about it plunged while witham for the first time saw that there was a gap in the looselylaid planking close behind it another plunge or flounder and horse and rider would go down together  for a moment he held his breath and watched then as the beast resisting its riders efforts backed again sprang forward and seized the bridle  get your spurs in shove him forward for your life he said  there was a momentary struggle on the slippery planking and almost as its hind hoofs overhung the edge witham dragged the horse away courthorne swung himself out of the saddle left the farmer the bridle and glanced behind him at the gap then he turned and the two men looked at each other steadily their faces were a trifle paler than usual  you saw it asked courthorne  yes but not until you backed the beast and he commenced plunging  he plunged once or twice before you caught the bridle  yes said witham quietly  courthorne laughed you are a curious man it would have cleared the ground for you  no said witham dryly i dont know that you will understand me but i scarcely think it would it may have been a mistake of mine to do what i did but i have a good deal on my shoulders already  courthorne made no answer as he led his horse across the bridge then he mounted and looked down on the farmer who stood beside him  i remember some things though i dont always let them influence me to my detriment he said im going back to the railroad and then west and dont quite know when you will have the pleasure of seeing me again  witham watched him quietly it would be wiser if you did not come back until i send for you     chapter xix  courthorne blunders   lance courthorne had lightly taken a good many risks in his time for he usually found a spice of danger stimulating and there was in him an irresponsible daring that not infrequently served him better than a welllaid plan there are also men of his type who for a time at least appear immune from the disasters which follow the one rash venture the prudent make and it was half in frolic and half in malice he rode to silverdale dressed as a prairie farmer in the light of day and forgot that their occupation sets a stamp he had never worn upon the tillers of the soil the same spirit induced him to imitate one or two of withams gestures for the benefit of his cook and afterwards wait for a police trooper who apparently desired to overtake him when he had just left the homestead  he pulled his horse up when the other man shouted to him and trusting to the wide hat that hid most of his face smiled out of halfclosed eyes when he handed a packet  you have saved me a ride mr courthorne i heard you were at the bridge the trooper said if youll sign for those documents i neednt keep you  he brought out a pencil and courthorne scribbled on the paper handed him he was quite aware that there was a risk attached to this but if witham had any communications with the police it appeared advisable to discover what they were about then he laughed as riding on again he opened the packet  agricultural bureau documents he said this lot to be returned filled in well if i can remember ill give them to witham  as it happened he did not remember but he made a worse mistake just before his departure from the railroad settlement he had spent two nights at a little wooden hotel which was not the one where witham put up when he drove into the place and to pass the time commenced a flirtation with the proprietors daughter the girl was pretty and courthorne a man of different type from the wheatgrowers she had been used to when his horse was at the door he strolled into the saloon where he found the girl alone in the bar  im a very sad man today my dear he said and his melancholy became him  the girl blushed prettily still she said whenever you want to you can come back again  if i did would you be pleased to see me  of course said the girl now you wait a minute and ill give you something to remember me by i dont mix this up for everybody  she busied herself with certain decanters and essences and courthorne held the glass she handed him high  the brightest eyes and the reddest lips between winnipeg and the rockies he said this is nectar but i would like to remember you by something sweeter still  their heads were not far apart when he laid down his glass and before the girl quite knew what was happening an arm was round her neck next moment she had flung the man backwards and stood very straight quivering with anger and crimson in face for courthorne as occasionally happens with men of his type assumed too much and did not always know when to stop then she called sharply jake  there was a tramp of feet outside and when a big grimfaced man looked in at the door courthorne decided it was time for him to effect his retreat while it could be done with safety he knew already that there were two doors to the saloon and his finger closed on the neck of a decanter next moment it smote the newcomer on the chest and while he staggered backwards with the fluid trickling from him courthorne departed through the opposite entrance once outside he mounted leisurely but nobody came out from the hotel and shaking the bridle with a little laugh he cantered out of the settlement  in the meanwhile the other man carefully wiped his garments and then turned to his companion  now whats all this about he said  the girl told him and the man ruminated for a minute or two well hes gone and i dont know that im sorry there wasnt a circus here he said i figured there was something not square about that fellow anyway registered as guyler from minnesota but ive seen somebody like him among the boys from silverdale guess ill find out when i ride over about the horse and then ill have a talk with him quietly  in the meanwhile the police trooper who had handed him the packet returned to the outpost and as it happened found the grizzled sergeant stimson who appeared astonished to see him back so soon there  i met courthorne near his homestead and gave him the papers sir he said  you did said the sergeant now thats kind of curious because hes at the bridge  it couldnt have been anybody else because he took the documents and signed for them said the trooper  big bay horse  no sir said the trooper it was a bronco and a screw at that  well said stimson dryly let me have your book if payne has come in tell him i want him  the trooper went out and when his comrade came in stimson laid a strip of paper before him you have seen courthornes writing he said would you call it anything like that  no sir said trooper payne i would not  stimson nodded take a good horse and ride round by the bridge if you find courthorne there as you probably will head for the settlement and see if you can come across a man who might pass for him ask your question as though the answer didnt count and tell nobody what you hear but me  payne rode out and when he returned three days later sergeant stimson made a journey to confer with one of his superiors the officer was a man who had risen in the service somewhat rapidly and when he heard the tale said nothing while he turned over a bundle of papers a trooper brought him then he glanced at stimson thoughtfully  i have a report of the shannon shooting case here he said how did it strike you at the time  stimsons answer was guarded as a curious affair you see it was quite easy to get at withams character from anybody down there and he wasnt the kind of man to do the thing there were one or two other trifles i couldnt quite figure out the meaning of  witham was drowned said the officer  well said stimson the trooper who rode after him heard him break through the ice but nobody ever found him though a farmer came upon his horse  the officer nodded i fancy you are right and the point is this there were two men who apparently bore some resemblance to each other engaged in an unlawful venture and one of them commits a crime nobody believed him capable of but which would have been less out of keeping with the others character then the second man comes into an inheritance and leads a life which seems to have astonished everybody who knows him now have you ever seen these two men side by side  no sir said stimson courthorne kept out of our sight when he could in alberta and i dont think i or any of the boys except shannon ever saw him for more than a minute or two now and then we passed witham on the prairie or saw him from the trail but i think i only once spoke to him  well said the officer it seems to me i had better get you sent back to your old station where you can quietly pick up the threads again would the trooper you mentioned be fit to keep an eye on things at silverdale  no one better sir said stimson  then it shall be done said the officer the quieter you keep the affair the better  it was a week or two later when witham returned to his homestead from the bridge which was almost completed dusk was closing in but as he rode down the rise he could see the wheat roll in slow ripples back into the distance the steady beat of its rhythmic murmur told of heavy ears and where the stalks stood waisthigh on the rise the last flush of saffron in the northwest was flung back in a dull bronze gleam the rest swayed athwart the shadowy hollow dusky indigo and green but that flash of gold and red told that harvest was nigh again  witham had seen no crop to compare with it during the eight years he had spent in the dominion there had been neither drought nor hail that year and now when the warm western breezes kept sweet and wholesome the splendid ears they fanned there was removed from him the terrors of the harvest frost which not infrequently blights the fairest prospects in one bitter night fate which had tried him hardly hitherto denying the seed its due share of fertilizing rain sweeping his stock from existence with icy blizzard and mowing down the tall green corn with devastating hail was now showering favours on him when it was too late still though he felt the irony of it he was glad for others had followed his lead and while the lean years had left a lamentable scarcity of dollars at silverdale wealth would now pour in to every man who had had the faith to sow  he dismounted beside the oats which he would harvest first and listened with a curious stirring of his pulses to their musical patter it was not the fulltoned song of the wheat but there was that in the quicker beat of it which told that each graceful tassel would redeem its promise he could not see the end of them but by the right of the producer they were all his he knew that he could also hold them by right of conquest too for that year a knowledge of his strength had been forced upon him still from something he had seen in the eyes of a girl and grasped at in the words of a whitehaired lady he realized that there is a limit beyond which mans ambition may not venture and a right before which even that of possession must bow  it had been shown him plainly that no man of his own devices can make the wheat grow and standing beside it in the creeping dusk he felt in a vague halfpagan fashion that there was somewhere behind what appeared the chaotic chances of life a scheme of order and justice immutable which would in due time crush the too presumptuous human atom who opposed himself to it regret and rebellion were it seemed equally futile and he must go out from silverdale before retribution overtook him he had done wrong and though he had made what reparation he could knew that he would carry his punishment with him  the house was almost dark when he reached it and as he went in his cook signed to him theres a man in here waiting for you he said he doesnt seem in any way friendly or civil  witham nodded as he went on wondering with a grim expectancy whether courthorne had returned again if he had he felt in a mood for very direct speech with him his visitor was however not courthorne witham could see that at a glance although the room was dim  i dont seem to know you but ill get a light in a minute he said  i wouldnt waste time said the other we can talk just as straight in the dark and i guess this meeting will finish up outside on the prairie youve given me a good deal of trouble to trail you mr guyler  well said witham dryly it seems to me that you have found the wrong man  the stranger laughed unpleasantly i was figuring youd take it like that but you cant bluff me well now ive come round to take it out of you for slinging that decanter at me and if there is another thing we neednt mention it  witham stared at the man and his astonishment was evident but the fact that he still spoke with an english accentuation as courthorne did was against him  to the best of my recollection i have never suffered the unpleasantness of meeting you in my life he said i certainly never threw a decanter or anything else at you though i understand that one might feel tempted to  the man rose up slowly and appeared big and heavyshouldered as he moved athwart the window i guess that is quite enough for me he said what were you condemned englishmen made for anyway but to take the best of what other men worked for until the folks whove got grit enough run you out of the old country lord why dont they drown you instead of dumping you and your wickedness on to us still im going to show one of you as ive longed to do that you cant play your old tricks with the women of this country  i dont see the drift of a word of it said witham hadnt you better come back when youve worked the vapours off tomorrow  come out said the other man grimly theres scarcely room in here well then have it your own way and the devil take care of you  i think theres enough said witham and as the other swung forward closed with him  he felt sick and dizzy for a moment for he had laid himself open and the first blow got home but he had decided that if the grapple was inevitable it was best to commence it and end it speedily a few seconds later there was a crash against the table and the stranger gasped as he felt the edge of it pressed into his backbone then he felt himself borne backwards until he groaned under the strain and heard a hoarse voice say if you attempt to use that foot again ill make the leg useless all your life to you come right in here tom  a man carrying a lantern came in and stared at the pair as he set it down do you want me to see a fair finishup he said  no said witham i want you to see this gentleman out with me nip his arms behind his back he cant hurt you  it was done with a little difficulty and there was a further scuffle in the hall for the stranger resisted strenuously but a minute later the trio reeled out of the door just as a buggy pulled up then as the evicted man plunged forward alone witham straightening himself suddenly saw that colonel barrington was looking down on him and that his niece was seated at his side he stood still flushed and breathless with his jacket hanging rent halfway up about him and the colonels voice was quietly ironical  i had a question or two to ask you but can wait he said no doubt i shall find you less engaged another time  he flicked the horse and as the buggy rolled away the other man walked up to witham  while i only wanted to get rid of you before i feel greatly tempted to give you your wish now said the latter  the stranger laughed dryly i guess you neednt worry i dont fight because im fond of it and youre not the man  not the man said witham  no sir said the other not like him now i can see you better well im kind of sorry i started a circus here  a suspicion of the truth flashed upon witham what sort of a man was the one you mistook for me  usual british waster never done a days work in his life and never wanted to too tired to open his eyes more than halfway when he looked at you but if he ever fools round the saloon again hell know what he is before im through with him  witham laughed i wouldnt be rash or you may get another astonishment we really know one or two useful things in the old country but you cant fetch the settlement before morning and well put you up if you like  no sir said the other dryly im not fond of englishmen and we might get arguing while ive had bout enough of you for one night  he rode away and witham went back into the house very thoughtfully wondering whether he would be called upon to answer for more of courthornes doings  it was two or three days later when maud barrington returned with her aunt from a visit to an outlying farm where because an account of what took place in the saloon had by some means been spread about she heard a story brought in from the settlement it kept her silent during the return journey and miss barrington said nothing but when the colonel met them in the hall he glanced at his niece  i see mrs carndall has been telling you both a tale he said it would have been more fitting if she had kept it to herself  yes said maud barrington still you do not credit it  barrington smiled a trifle dryly i should very much prefer not to my dear but what we saw the other night appears to give it probability the man courthorne was dismissing somewhat summarily is i believe to marry the lady in question you will remember i asked you once before whether the leopard can change his spots  the girl laughed a little still are you not presuming when you take it for granted that there are spots to change  colonel barrington said nothing further and it was late that night when the two women reopened the subject  aunt said maud barrington i want to know what you think about mrs carndalls tale  the little lady shook her head i should like to disbelieve it if i could  then said maud barrington why dont you  can you give me any reasons one must not expect too much from human nature my dear  the girl sat silent awhile remembering the man whom she had at first sight and in the moonlight fancied was like her companion at the time it was not however the faint resemblance that had impressed her but a vague something in his mannerhis grace his halfveiled insolence his poise in the saddle she had only seen lance courthorne on a few occasions when she was very young but she had seen others of his race and the man reminded her of them still she felt halfinstinctively that as yet it would be better that nobody should know this and she stooped over some lace on the table as she answered the elder lady  i only know one and it is convincing that lance should have done what he is credited with doing is quite impossible  miss barrington smiled i almost believe so too but others of his family have done such things somewhat frequently do you know that lance has all along been a problem to me for there is a good deal in my brothers question although it seems out of the question i have wondered whether there could be two lance courthornes in western canada  the girl looked at her aunt in silence for a space but each hid a portion of her thoughts then maud barrington laughed  the lance courthorne now at silverdale is as free from reproach as any man may be she said i cant tell you why i am sure of itbut i know i am not mistaken     chapter xx  the face at the window   it was a hot morning when sergeant stimson and corporal payne rode towards the railroad across the prairie the grassy levels rolled away before them white and parched into the blue distance where willow grove and straggling bluff floated on the dazzling horizon and the fibrous dust rose in little puffs beneath the horses feet until stimson pulled his beast up in the shadow of the birches by the bridge and looked back towards silverdale there wooden homesteads girt about with barns and granaries rose from the whitened waste and behind some of them stretched great belts of wheat then the sergeant understanding the faith of the men who had sown that splendid grain nodded for he was old and wise and had seen many adverse seasons and the slackness that comes when hope has gone to beaten men  they will reap this yeara handful of cents on every bushel he said a fine gentleman is colonel barrington but some of them will be thankful theres a better head than the one he has at silverdale  yes sir said corporal payne who wore the double chevrons for the first time and surmised that his companions observations were not without their purpose  stimson glanced at the bridge good work he said it will save them dollars on every load they haul in a gambler built it do they teach men to use the axe in montana saloons  the corporal smiled and waited for what he felt would come he was no longer the hotblooded lad who had come out from the old country for he had felt the bonds of discipline and been taught restraint and silence on the lonely marches of the prairie  i have he said tentatively fancied there was something a little unusual about the thing  stimson nodded but his next observation was apparently quite unconnected with the topic you were a raw colt when i got you payne and the bit galled you now and then but you had good hands on a bridle and somebody who knew his business had taught you to sit a horse in the old country still you were not as handy with brush and fork at stable duty  the bronze seemed to deepen in the corporals face but it was turned steadily toward his officer sir he said has that anything to do with what you were speaking of  stimson laughed softly that depends my lad now ive taught you to ride straight and to hold your tongue ive asked you no questions but ive eyes in my head and its not without a purpose youve been made corporal youre the kind they give commissions to now and thenand your folks in the old country never raised you for a police trooper  can you tell me how to win one asked the corporal and stimson noticed the little gleam in his eyes  theres one road to advancement and you know where to find the troopers duty laid down plain he said with a dry smile now you saw lance courthorne once or twice back there in alberta  yes sir but never close to  and you knew farmer witham  payne appeared thoughtful of course i met him a few times on the prairie always on horseback with his big hat on but witham is deadthat is i heard him break through the ice  the mens eyes met for a moment and stimson smiled curiously there is he said still a warrant out for him now you know where i am going and while i am away you will watch courthorne and his homestead if anything curious happens there you will let me know the new man has instructions to find you any duty that will suit you  the corporal looked at his officer steadily and again there was comprehension in his eyes then he nodded yes sir i have wondered whether if shannon could have spoken another word that night it would have been witham the warrant was issued for  stimson raised a restraining hand my lad he said dryly the police trooper who gets advancement is the one that carries out his orders and never questions them until he can show that they are wrong then he uses a good deal of discretion now you know your duty  yes sir said payne and stimson shaking his bridle cantered off across the prairie  then seeing no need to waste time the corporal rode towards courthornes homestead and found its owner stripping a binder pieces of the machine lay all around him and from the fashion in which he handled them it was evident that he was capable of doing what the other men at silverdale left to the mechanic at the settlement payne wondered as he watched him who had taught the gambler to use spanner and file  i will not trouble you if you are busy mr courthorne but if you would give me the returns the bureau ask for it would save me riding round again he said  im afraid i cant said witham you see i havent had the papers  trooper bacon told me he had given them to you  i dont seem to remember it said witham  payne laughed one forgets things when he is busy still you had thembecause you signed for them  witham looked up suddenly and in another moment smiled but he was a trifle too late for payne had seen his astonishment and that he was now on guard  well he said i havent got them now send me a duplicate you have no doubt some extra forms at the outpost  payne decided that the man had never had the documents but was too clever to ask any questions or offer explanations that might involve him it was evident he knew that somebody had personated him and the fact sent a little thrill through the corporal he was at least on the trail  ill bring you one round the next time im in the neighbourhood he said and witham sat still with the spanner lying idle in his hand when he rode away  he realized that courthorne had taken the papers and his face grew anxious as well as grim the harvest was almost ready now and a little while would see it in then his work would be over but he had of late felt a growing fear lest something that would prevent its accomplishment might happen in the meanwhile then almost fiercely he resumed the stripping of the machine  an hour or two later dane rode up and sat still in his saddle looking down on witham with a curious smile in his face  i was down at the settlement and found a curious story going round he said of course it had its humorous aspect but i dont know that the thing was quite discreet you see barrington has once or twice had to put a stern check on the indulgence in playfulness of that kind by some of the younger men and you are becoming an influence at silverdale  you naturally believed what you heard it was in keeping with what you have seen of me  danes eyes twinkled i didnt want to and i must admit that it isnt still a good many of you quiet men are addicted to occasionally astonishing our friends and i cant help a fancy that you could do that kind of thing as well as most folks if it pleased you it fact there was an artistic finish to the climax that suggested your usual thoroughness  it did said witham grimly remembering his recent visitor and one or two of courthornes albertan escapades still as im afraid i havent the dramatic instinct do you mind telling me how  dane laughed well it is probable there are other men who would have kissed the girl but i dont know that it would have occurred to them to smash a decanter on the irate lovers head  witham felt his finger tingle for a grip on courthornes throat and thats what ive been doing lately you of course concluded that after conducting myself in an exemplary fashion an astonishing time it was a trifling lapse  well said dane dryly as i admitted it appeared somewhat out of your usual line but when i heard that a man from the settlement had been ejected with violence from your homestead what could one believe  colonel barrington told you that  no said dane you know he didnt still he had a hired man riding a horse hed bought and i believethough it is not my affairmaud barrington was there now of course one feels diffident about anything that may appear like preaching but you see a good many of us are following you and i wouldnt like you to have many little lapses of that kind while i am backing you you and i have done with these frivolities some time ago but there are lads here they might appeal to i should be pleased if you could deny the story  withams face was grim im afraid it would not suit me to do as much just now he said still between you and me do you believe it likely that i would fly at that kind of game  dane laughed softly well he said tastes differ and the girl is pretty while you know after all theyre very much the same we have however got to look at the thing sensibly and you admit you cant deny it  i told you it wouldnt suit me  then there is a difference  witham nodded you must make the best of that but the others may believe exactly what they please it will be a favour to me if you remember it  dane smiled curiously then i think it is enough for me and you will overlook my presumption courthorne i wonder now and then when i shall altogether understand you  the time will come said witham dryly to hide what he felt for his comrades simple avowal had been wonderfully eloquent then dane touched his horse with his heel and rode away  it was two or three weeks later when witham being requested to do so drove over to attend one of the assemblies at silverdale grange it was dark when he reached the house for the nights were drawing in but because of the temperature few of the great oil lamps were lighted and the windows were open wide somebody had just finished singing when he walked into the big general room and he would have preferred another moment to make his entrance but disdained to wait he however felt a momentary warmth in his face when miss barrington stately as when he had first seen her in her rustling silk and ancient laces came forward to greet him with her usual graciousness he knew that every eye was upon them and guessed why she had done so much  what she said was of no moment but the fact that she had received him without sign of coldness was eloquent and the man bent very respectfully over the little white hand then he stood straight and square for a moment and met her eyes  madam he said i shall know who to come to when i want a friend  afterwards he drifted towards a group of married farmers and their wives who except for that open warranty might have been less cordial to him and presently though he was never quite sure how it came about found himself standing beside maud barrington she smiled at him and then glanced towards one of the open windows outside which one or two of the older men were sitting  the room is very hot said witham tentatively  yes said the girl i fancy it would be cooler in the hall  they passed out together into the shadowy hall but a little gleam of light from the doorway behind them rested on maud barrington as she sat down she looked inquiringly at the man as though in wait for something  it is distinctly cooler here he said  maud barrington laughed impatiently it is she said  well said witham with a little smile i will try again wheat has made another advance lately  the girl turned towards him with a little sparkle in her eyes witham saw it and the faint shimmer of the pearls upon the whiteness of her neck and then moved his head so that he looked out upon the dusky prairie  pshaw she said you know why you were brought here tonight  witham admired her courage but did not turn round for there were times when he feared his will might fail him i fancy i know why your aunt was so gracious to me do you know that her confidence almost hurts me  then why dont you vindicate it and yourself dane would be your mouthpiece and two or three words would be sufficient  witham made no answer for a space somebody was singing in the room behind them and through the open window he could see the stars in the soft indigo above the great sweep of prairie he noticed them vacantly and took a curious impersonal interest in the two dim figures standing close together outside the window one was a young english lad and the other a girl in a long white dress what they were doing there was no concern of his but any trifle that diverted his attention a moment was welcome in that time of strain for he had felt of late that exposure was close at hand and was fiercely anxious to finish his work before it came maud barringtons finances must be made secure before he left silverdale and he must remain at any cost until the wheat was sold  then he turned slowly towards her it is not your aunts confidence that hurts me the most  the girl looked at him steadily the colour a trifle plainer in her face which she would not turn from the light and a growing wonder in her eyes  lance she said we both know that it is not misplaced still your impassiveness does not please us  witham groaned inwardly and the swollen veins showed on his forehead his companion had leaned forward a little so that she could see him and one white shoulder almost touched his own the perfume of her hair was in his nostrils and when he remembered how cold she had once been to him a longing that was stronger than the humiliation that came with it grew almost overwhelming still because of her very trust in him there was a wrong he could not do and it dawned on him that a means of placing himself beyond further temptation was opening to him maud barrington he knew would have scanty sympathy with an intrigue of the kind courthornes recent adventure pointed to  you mean why do i not deny what you have no doubt heard he said what could one gain by that if you had heard the truth  maud barrington laughed softly isnt the question useless  no said witham a trifle hoarsely now  the girl touched his arm almost imperiously as he turned his head again  lance she said men of your kind need not deal in subterfuge the wheat and the bridge you built speak for you  still persisted witham and the girl checked him with a smile  i fancy you are wasting time she said now i wonder whether when you were in england you ever saw a play founded on an incident in the life of a once famous actor at the time it rather appealed to me the hero with a chivalric purpose assumed various shortcomings he had really no sympathy withbut while there is of course no similarity beyond the generous impulse between the cases he did not do it clumsily it is however a trifle difficult to understand what purpose you could have and one cannot help fancying that you owe a little to silverdale and yourself  it was a somewhat daring parallel for witham who dare not look at his companion and saw that he had failed knew the play  isnt the subject a trifle difficult he asked  then said maud barrington we will end it still you promised that i should understanda good dealwhen the time came  witham nodded gravely you shall he said  then somewhat to his embarrassment the two figures moved further across the window and as they were silhouetted against the blue duskiness he saw that there was an arm about the waist of the girls white dress he became sensible that maud barrington saw it too and then that perhaps to save the situation she was smiling the two figures however vanished and a minute later a young girl in a long white dress came in and stood still apparently dismayed when she saw maud barrington she did not notice witham who sat further in the shadow he however saw her face suddenly crimson  have you been here long she asked  yes said maud barrington with a significant glance towards the window at least ten minutes i am sorry but i really couldnt help it it was very hot in the other room and allender was singing  then said the girl with a little tremor in her voice you will not tell  no said maud barrington but you must not do it again  the girl stooped swiftly and kissed her then recoiled with a gasp when she saw the man but maud barrington laughed  i think she said i can answer for mr courthornes silence still when i have an opportunity i am going to lecture you  witham turned with a twinkle he could not quite repress in his eyes and with a flutter of her dress the girl whisked away  im afraid this makes me an accessory but i can only neglect my manifest duty which would be to warn her mother said maud barrington  is it a duty asked witham feeling that the further he drifted away from the previous topic the better it would be for him  some people would fancy so said his companion lily will have a good deal of money by and by and she is very young atterly has nothing but an unprofitable farm but he is an honest lad and i know she is very fond of him  and would that count against the dollars  maud barrington laughed a little yes she said quietly i think it would if the girl is wise even now such things do happen but i fancy it is time i went back again  she moved away but witham stayed where he was until the lad came in with a cigar in his hand  hallo courthorne he said did you notice anybody pass the window a little while ago  you are the first come in through it said witham dryly the kind of things you wear admit of climbing  the lad glanced at him with a trace of embarrassment  i dont quite understand you but i meant a man he said he was walking curiously as if he was half asleep but he slipped round the corner of the building and i lost him  witham laughed theres a want of finish in the tale but you neednt worry about me i didnt see a man  theres rather less wisdom than usual in your remarks tonight but i tell you i saw him said the lad  he passed on and a minute later there was a cry from the inner room its there again cant you see the face at the window  witham was in the larger room next moment and saw as a startled girl had evidently done a face that showed distorted and white to ghastliness through the window he also recognized it and running back through the hall was outside in another few seconds courthorne was leaning against one of the casements as though faint with weakness or pain and collapsed when witham dragged him backwards into the shadow he had scarcely laid him down when the window was opened and colonel barringtons shoulders showed black against the light  come outside alone sir said witham barrington did so and witham stood so that no light fell on the pallid face in the grass its a man i have dealings with he said he has evidently ridden out from the settlement and fallen from his horse  why should he fall asked the colonel  witham laughed there is a perfume about him that is tolerably conclusive i was however on the point of going and if you will tell your hired man to get my wagon out ill take him away quietly you can make light of the affair to the others  yes said barrington unless you think the man is hurt that would be best but well keep him if you like  no sir i couldnt trouble you said witham hastily men of his kind are also very hard to kill  five minutes later he and the hired man hoisted courthorne into the wagon and packed some hay about him while soon after the rattle of wheels sank into the silence of the prairie the girl maud barrington had spoken to rejoined her companion  could courthorne have seen you coming in he asked  yes said the girl blushing he did  then it cant be helped and after all courthorne wouldnt talk even if he wasnt what he is said the lad you dont know why and im not going to tell you but it wouldnt become him  you dont mean maud barrington asked his companion  no said the lad with a laugh courthorne is not like me he has no sense its quite another kind of girl you see     chapter xxi  colonel barrington is convinced   it was not until early morning that courthorne awakened from the stupor he sank into soon after witham conveyed him into his homestead first however he asked for a little food and ate it with apparent difficulty when witham came in he looked up from the bed where he lay with the dust still white upon his clothing and his face showed grey and haggard in the creeping light  im feeling a trifle better now he said still i scarcely fancy i could get up just yet i gave you a little surprise last night  witham nodded you did of course i knew how much your promise was worth but in view of the risks you ran i had not expected you to turn up at the grange  the risks said courthorne with an unpleasant smile  yes said witham wearily i have a good deal on hand i would like to finish here and it will not take me long but i am quite prepared to give myself up now if it is necessary  courthorne laughed i dont think you need and it wouldnt be wise you see even if you made out your innocence which you couldnt do you rendered yourself an accessory by not denouncing me long ago i fancy we can come to an understanding which would be pleasanter to both of us  the difficulty said witham is that an understanding is useless when made with a man who never keeps his word  well said courthorne dryly we shall gain nothing by paying each other compliments and whether you believe it or otherwise it was not by intention i turned up at the grange i was coming here from a place west of the settlement and you can see that i have been ill if you look at me i counted too much on my strength couldnt find a homestead where i could get anything to eat and the rest may be accounted for by the execrable brandy i had with me anyway the horse threw me and made off and after lying under some willows a good deal of the day i dragged myself along until i saw a house  that said witham is beside the question what do you want of me dollars in all probability well you will not get them  im afraid im scarcely fit for a discussion now said courthorne the fact is it hurts me to talk and theres an aggressiveness about you which isnt pleasant to a badlyshaken man wait until this evening but there is no necessity for you to ride to the outpost before you have heard me  im not sure it would be advisable to leave you here said witham dryly  courthorne smiled ironically use your eyes would any one expect me to get up and indulge in a fresh folly leave me a little brandyi need itand go about your work youll certainly find me here when you want me  witham glancing at the mans face considered this very probable and went out he found his cook who could be trusted and said to him the man yonder is tolerably sick and youll let him have a little brandy and something to eat when he asks for it still youll bring the decanter away with you and lock him in whenever you go out  the man nodded and making a hasty breakfast witham who had business at several outlying farms mounted and rode away it was evening before he returned and found courthorne lying in a big chair with a cigar in his hand languidly debonair but apparently ill his face was curiously pallid and his eyes dimmer than they had been but there was a sardonic twinkle in them  you take a look at the decanter said the man who went up with witham carrying a lamp hes been wanting brandy all the time but it doesnt seem to have muddled him  witham dismissed the man and sat down in front of courthorne  well he said  courthorne laughed you ought to be a witty man though one would scarcely charge you with that you surmised correctly this morning it is dollars i want  you had my answer  of course still i dont want very many in the meanwhile and you havent heard what led up to the demand or why i came back to you you are evidently not curious but im going to tell you soon after i left you i fell very sick and lay in the saloon of a little desolate settlement for days the place was suffocating and the wind blew the alkali dust in they had only horrible brandy and bitter water to drink it with and i lay there on my back panting with the flies crawling over me i knew if i stayed any longer it would finish me and when there came a merciful cool day i got myself into the saddle and started off to find you i dont quite know how i made the journey and during a good deal of it i couldnt see the prairie but i knew you would feel there was an obligation on you to do something for me of course i could put it differently  witham had as little liking for courthorne as he had ever had but he remembered the time when he had lain very sick in his lonely log hut he also remembered that everything he now held belonged to this man  you made the bargain he said less decisively  courthorne nodded still i fancy one of the conditions could be modified now if i wait for another three months i may be dead before the reckoning comes and while that probably wouldnt grieve you i could when it appeared advisable send for a magistrate and make a deposition  you could said witham i have however something of the same kind in contemplation  courthorne smiled curiously i dont know that it will be necessary carry me on until you have sold your crop and then make a reasonable offer and its probable you may still keep what you have at silverdale to be quite frank ive a notion that my time in this world is tolerably limited and i want a last taste of all it has to offer a man of my capacities before i leave it one is a long while dead you know  witham nodded for he understood he had also during the grim cares of the lean years known the fierce longing for one deep draught of the wine of pleasure whatever it afterwards cost him  it was that which induced you to look for a little relaxation at the settlement at my expense he said a trifle paltry wasnt it  courthorne laughed it seems you dont know me yet that was a frolic indulged in out of humour for your benefit you see your rôle demanded a good deal more ability than you ever displayed in it and it did not seem fitting that a very puritanical and priggish person should pose as me at silverdale the little affair was the one touch of verisimilitude about the thing no doubt my worthy connexions are grieving over your lapse  my sense of humour had never much chance of developing said witham grimly what is the matter with you  pulmonary haemorrhage said courthorne perhaps it was born in me but i never had much trouble until after that night in the snow at the river would you care to hear about it were not fond of each other but after the steerdrivers ive been herding with its a relief to talk to a man of moderate intelligence  go on said witham  well said courthorne when the trooper was close behind me my horse went through the ice but somehow i crawled out we were almost across the river and it was snowing fast while i had a fancy that i might have saved the horse but as the trooper would probably have seen a mounted man i let him go the stream sucked him under and though you may not believe it i felt very mean when i saw nothing but the hole in the ice then as the troopers didnt seem inclined to cross i went on through the snow and as it happened blundered across jardines old shanty there was still a little prairie hay in the place and i lay in it until morning dragging fresh armfuls around me as i burnt it in the stove did you ever spend a night wet through in a place that was ten to twenty under freezing  yes said witham dryly i have done it twice  well said courthorne i fancy that night narrowed in my life for me but i made out across the prairie in the morning and as we had a good many friends up and down the country one of them took care of me  witham sat silent a while the story had held his attention and the frankness of the man who lay panting a little in his chair had its effect on him there was no sound from the prairie and the house was very still  why did you kill shannon he asked at length  is any one quite sure of his motives said courthorne the lad had done something which was difficult to forgive him but i think i would have let him go if he hadnt recognized me the world is tolerably good to the man who has no scruples you see and i took all it offered me while it did not seem fitting that a clod of a trooper without capacity for enjoyment or much more sensibility than the beast he rode should put an end to all my opportunities still it was only when he tried to warn his comrades he threw his last chance away  witham shivered a little at the dispassionate brutality of the speech and then checked the anger that came upon him  fate or my own folly has put it out of my power to denounce you without abandoning what i have set my heart upon and after all it is not my business he said i will give you five hundred dollars and you can go to chicago or montreal and consult a specialist if the money is exhausted before i send for you i will pay your hotel bills but every dollar will be deducted when we come to the reckoning  courthorne laughed a little you had better make it sevenfifty five hundred dollars will not go very far with me  then you will have to husband them said witham dryly i am paying you at a rate agreed upon for the use of your land and small bank balance handed me and want all of it the rent is a fair one in face of the fact that a good deal of the farm consisted of virgin prairie which can be had from the government for nothing  he said nothing further and soon after he went out courthorne went to sleep but witham sat by an open window with a burnedout cigar in his hand staring at the prairie while the night wore through until he rose with a shiver in the chill of early morning to commence his task again  a few days later he saw courthorne safely into a sleeping car with a ticket for chicago in his pocket and felt that a load had been lifted off his shoulders when the train rolled out of the little prairie station another week had passed when riding home one evening he stopped at the grange and as it happened found maud barrington alone she received him without any visible restraint but he realized that all that had passed at their last meeting was to be tacitly ignored  has your visitor recovered yet she asked  so far as to leave my place and i was not anxious to keep him said witham with a little laugh i am sorry he disturbed you  maud barrington seemed thoughtful i can scarcely think the man was to blame  no said witham  the girl looked at him curiously and shook her head no she said i heard my uncles explanation but it was not convincing i saw the mans face  it was several seconds before witham answered and then he took the bold course  well he said  maud barrington made a curious little gesture i knew i had seen it before at the bridge but that was not all it was vaguely familiar and i felt i ought to know it it reminded me of somebody  of me and witham laughed  no there was a resemblance but it was very superficial that mans face had little in common with yours  these faint likenesses are not unusual said witham and once more maud barrington looked at him steadily  no she said of course not well we will conclude that my fancies ran away with me and be practical what is wheat doing just now  rising still said witham and regretted the alacrity with which he had seized the opportunity of changing the topic when he saw that it had not escaped the notice of his companion you and i and a few others will be rich this year  yes but i am afraid some of the rest will find it has only further anxieties for them  i fancy said witham you are thinking of one  maud barrington nodded yes i am sorry for him  then it would please you if i tried to straighten out things for him it would be difficult but i believe it could be accomplished  maud barringtons eyes were grateful but there was something that witham could not fathom behind her smile  if you undertook it one could almost believe you had the wonderful lamp she said  witham smiled somewhat dryly then all its virtues will be tested tonight and i had better make a commencement while i have the courage colonel barrington is in  maud barrington went with him to the door and then laid her hand a moment on his arm lance she said with a little tremor in her voice if there was a time when our distrust hurt you it has recoiled upon our heads you have returned it with a splendid generosity  witham did not trust himself to answer but walked straight to barringtons room and finding the door open went quietly in the head of the silverdale settlement was sitting at a littered table in front of a shaded lamp and the light that fell upon it showed the care in his face it grew a trifle grimmer when he saw the younger man  will you sit down he said i have been looking for a visit from you for some little time it would have been more fitting had you made it earlier  witham nodded as he took a chair i fancy i understand you but i have nothing that you expect to hear to tell you sir  that said barrington is unfortunate now it is not my business to pose as a censor on the conduct of any man here except when it affects the community but their friends have sent out a good many young english lads some of whom have not been too discreet in the old country to me they did not do so solely that i might teach them farming a charge of that kind is no light responsibility and i look for assistance from the men who have almost as large a stake as i have in the prosperity of silverdale  have you ever seen me do anything you could consider prejudicial to it asked witham  i have not said colonel barrington  and it was by her own wish miss barrington who i fancy is seldom mistaken asked me to the grange  is is a good plea said barrington i cannot question anything my sister does  then we will let it pass though i am afraid you will consider what i am going to ask a further presumption you have forward wheat to deliver and find it difficult to obtain it  barringtons smile was somewhat grim in both cases you have surmised correctly  witham nodded still it is not mere inquisitiveness sir i fancy i am the only man at silverdale who can understand your difficulties and what is more to the point suggest a means of obviating them you still expect to buy at lower prices before the time to make delivery comes  again the care crept into barringtons face and he sat silent for almost a minute then he said very slowly i feel that i should resent the question but i will answer it is what i hope to do  well said witham i am afraid you will find prices higher still there is very little wheat in minnesota this year and what there was in dakota was cut down by hail millers in st paul and minneapolis are anxious already and there is talk of a big corner in chicago nobody is offering again while you know what land lies fallow in manitoba and the activity of their brokers shows the fears of winnipeg millers with contracts on hand this is not my opinion alone i can convince you from the papers and market reports i see before you  barrington could not controvert the unpleasant truth he was still endeavouring to shut his eyes to the demand from the east may slacken he said  witham shook his head russia can give them nothing there was a failure in the indian monsoon and south american crops were small now i am going to take a further liberty how much are you short  barrington was never sure why he told him but he was hard pressed then and there was a quiet forcefulness about the younger man that had its effect on him that he said holding out a document is the one contract i have not covered  witham glanced at it the quantity is small still money is very scarce and bank interest almost extortionate just now  barrington flushed a trifle and there was anger in his face he knew the fact that his loss on this sale should cause him anxiety was significant and that witham had surmised the condition of his finances tolerably correctly  have you not gone quite far enough he said  witham nodded i fancy i need ask no more sir you can scarcely buy the wheat and the banks will advance nothing further on what you have to offer at silverdale it would be perilous to put yourself in the hands of a mortgagebroker  barrington stood up very grim and straight and there were not many men at silverdale who would have met his gaze  your content is a little too apparent but i can still resent an impertinence he said are my affairs your business  sit down sir said witham i fancy they are and had it not been necessary i would not have ventured so far you have done much for silverdale and it had cost you a good deal while it seems to me that every man here has a duty to the head of the settlement i am however not going to urge that point but have as you know a propensity for taking risks i cant help it it was probably born in me now i will take that contract up for you  barrington gazed at him in bewildered astonishment but you would lose on it heavily how could you overcome a difficulty that is too great for me  well said witham with a little smile it seems i have some ability in dealing with these affairs  barrington did not answer for a while and when he spoke it was slowly you have a wonderful capacity for making any one believe in you  that is not the point said witham if you will let me have the contract or and it comes to the same thing buy the wheat it calls for and if advisable sell as much again exactly as i tell you at my risk and expense i shall get what i want out of it my affairs are a trifle complicated and it would take some little time to make you understand how this would suit me in the meanwhile you can give me a mere i o u for the difference between what you sold at and the price today to be paid without interest and whenever it suits you it isnt very formal but you will have to trust me  barrington moved twice up and down the room before he turned to the younger man lance he said when you first came here any deal of this kind between us would have been out of the question now it is only your due to tell you that i have been wrong from the beginning and you have a good deal to forgive  i think we need not go into that said witham with a little smile this is a business deal and if it hadnt suited me i would not have made it  he went out in another few minutes with a little strip of paper and just before he left the grange placed it in maud barringtons hand  you will not ask any questions but if ever colonel barrington is not kind to you you can show him that he said  he had gone in another moment but the girl comprehending dimly what he had done stood still staring at the paper with a warmth in her cheeks and a mistiness in her eyes     chapter xxii  sergeant stimson confirms his suspicions   it was late in the afternoon when colonel barrington drove up to withams homestead he had his niece and sister with him and when he pulled up his team all three were glad of the little breeze that came down from the blueness of the north and rippled the whitened grass it had blown over leagues of sunbleached prairie and the great desolation beyond the pines of the saskatchewan but had not wholly lost the faint wholesome chill it brought from the pole  there was no cloud in the vault of ether and slanting sunrays beat fiercely down upon the prairie until the fibrous dust grew fiery and the eyes ached from the glare of the vast stretch of silvery grey the latter was however relieved by stronger colour in front of the party for blazing gold on the dazzling stubble the oat sheaves rolled away in long rows that diminished and melted into each other until they cut the blue of the sky in a delicate filigree oats had moved up in value in sympathy with wheat and the good soil had most abundantly redeemed its promise that year colonel barrington however sighed a little as he looked at them and remembered that such a harvest might have been his  we will get down and walk towards the wheat he said it is a good crop and lance is to be envied  still said miss barrington he deserved it and those sheaves stand for more than the toil that brought them there  of course said the colonel with a curious little smile for rashness i fancied when they showed the first blade above the clod but i am less sure of it now well the wheat is even finer  a man who came up took charge of the horses and the party walked in silence towards the wheat it stretched before them in a vast parallelogram and while the oats were the pale gold of the austral there was the tint of the ruddier metal of their own northwest in this it stood tall and stately murmuring as the sea does until it rolled before a stronger puff of breeze in waves of ochre through which the warm bronze gleamed when its rhythmic patter swelled into deepertoned harmonies there was that in the elfin music and blaze of colour which appealed to sensual ear and eye and something which struck deeper still as it did in the days men poured libations on the fruitful soil and whiterobed priest blessed it when the world was young  maud barrington felt it vaguely but she recognized more clearly as her aunt had done the faith and daring of the sower the earth was very bountiful but that wheat had not come there of itself and she knew the man who had called it up had done more than bear his share of the primeval curse which however was apparently more or less evaded at silverdale even when the issue appeared hopeless the courage that held him resolute in face of others fears and the greatness of his projects had appealed to her and it almost counted for less that he had achieved success then glancing further across the billowing grain she saw himstill as it seemed it had always been with him amidst the stress and dust of strenuous endeavour  once more as she had seen them when the furrows were bare at seed time and there was apparently only ruin in store for those who raised the eastern peoples bread lines of dusty teams came plodding down the rise they advanced in echelon keeping their time and distance with a military precision but in place of the harrows the tossing arms of the binders flashed and swung the wheat went down before them their wake was strewn with gleaming sheaves and one man came foremost swaying in the drivingseat of a rattling machine his face was the colour of a blackfoots and she could see the darkness of his neck above the loosefronted shirt and a bare blackened arm that was raised to hold the tired beasts to their task their trampling and the crash and rattle that swelled in slow crescendo drowned the murmur of the wheat until one of the machines stood still and the leader turning a moment in his saddle held up a hand then those that came behind swung into changed formation passed and fell into indented line again while colonel barrington nodded with grim approval  it is very well done he said the best of harvesters no newcomers yonder theyre capable manitoba men i dont know where he got them and in any other year one would have wondered where he would find the means of paying them we have never seen farming of this kind at silverdale  he seemed to sigh a little while his hand closed on the bridle and maud barrington fancied she understood his thoughts just then  nobody can be always right and the good years do not come alone she said you will plough every acre next one  barrington smiled dryly im afraid that will be a little late my dear any one can follow but since when everybodys crop is good the price comes down the man who gets the prize is the one who shows the way  he was content to face the risk said miss barrington  of course said the colonel quietly i should be the last to make light of his foresight and courage indeed i am glad i can acknowledge it in more ways than one for i have felt lately that i am getting an old man still there is one with greater capacities ready to step into my shoes and though it was long before i could overcome my prejudice against him i think i should now be content to let him have them whatever lance may have been he was born a gentleman and blood is bound to tell  maud barrington who was of a patrician parentage and would not at one time have questioned this assertion wondered why she felt less sure of it just then  but if he had not been would not what he has done be sufficient to vouch for him she said  barrington smiled a little and the girl felt that her question was useless as she glanced at him he sat very straight in his saddle immaculate in dress with a gloved hand on his hip and a stamp which he had inherited with the thinlycovered pride that usually accompanies it from generations of a similar type on his cleancut face it was evidently needless to look for any sympathy with that view from him  my dear he said there are things at which the others can beat us but after all i do not think they are worth the most and while lance has occasionally exhibited a few undesirable characteristics no doubt acquired in this country and has not been always blameless the fact that he is a courthorne at once covers and accounts for a good deal  then witham recognized them and made a sign to one of the men behind him as he hauled his binder clear of the wheat he had dismounted in another minute and came towards them with the jacket he had not wholly succeeded in struggling into loose about his shoulders  it is almost time i gave my team a rest he said will you come with me to the house  no said colonel barrington we only stopped in passing the crop will harvest well  yes said witham turning with a little smile to miss barrington better than i expected and prices are still moving up you will remember madam who it was wished me good fortune it has undeniably come  then said the whitehaired lady next year i will do as much again though it will be a little unnecessary because you have my good wishes all the time still you are too prosaic to fancy they can have anything to do withthis  she pointed to the wheat but though witham smiled again there was a curious expression in his face as he glanced at her niece  i certainly do and your goodwill has made a greater difference than you realize to me he said  miss barrington looked at him steadily lance she said there is something about you and your speeches that occasionally puzzles me now of course that was the only rejoinder you could make but i fancied you meant it  i did said witham with a trace of grimness in his smile still isnt it better to tell any one too little rather than too much  well said miss barrington you are going to be franker with me by and by now my brother has been endeavouring to convince us that you owe your success to qualities inherited from bygone courthornes  witham did not answer for a moment and then he laughed i fancy colonel barrington is wrong he said dont you think there are latent capabilities in every man though only one here and there gets an opportunity of using them in any case wouldnt it be pleasanter for any one to feel that his virtues were his own and not those of his family  miss barringtons eyes twinkled but she shook her head that she said would be distinctly wrong of him but i fancy it is time we were getting on  in another few minutes colonel barrington took up the reins and as they drove slowly past the wheat his niece had another view of the toiling teams they were moving on tirelessly with their leader in front of them and the rasp of the knives trample of hoofs and clash of the binders wooden arms once more stirred her she had heard those sounds often before and attached no significance to them but now she knew a little of the stress and effort that preceded them she could hear through the turmoil the exultant note of victory  then the wagon rolled more slowly up the rise and had passed from view behind it when a mounted man rode up to witham with an envelope in his hand  mr macdonald was in at the settlement and the telegraph clerk gave it him he said he told me to come along with it  witham opened the message and his face grew grim as he read send me five hundred dollars urgent  then he thrust it into his pocket and went on with his harvesting when he had thanked the man he also worked until dusk was creeping up across the prairie before he concerned himself further about the affair and then the note he wrote was laconic  enclosed you will find fifty dollars sent only because you may be ill in case of necessity you can forward your doctors or hotel bills it ran  it was with a wry smile he watched the man ride off towards the settlement with it i shall not be sorry when the climax comes he said the strain is telling  in the meanwhile sergeant stimson had been quietly renewing his acquaintance with certain ranchers and herders of sheep scattered across the albertan prairie some six hundred miles away they found him more communicative and cordial than he used to be and with one or two he unbent so far as in the face of regulations to refresh himself with whisky which had contributed nothing to the canadian revenue now the lonely ranchers have as a rule few opportunities of friendly talk with anybody and as they responded to the sergeants geniality he became acquainted with a good many facts some of which confirmed certain vague suspicions of his though others astonished him in consequence of this he rode out one night with two or three troopers of a western squadron  his apparent business was somewhat prosaic musquash the blackfoot in place of remaining quietly on his reserve had in a state of inebriation reverted to the primitive customs of his race and taking the trail not only annexed some of his white neighbours ponies and badly frightened their wives but drove off a steer with which he feasted his people the owner following came upon the hide and musquash seeing it was too late to remove the brand from it expressed his contrition and pleaded in extenuation that he was rather worthy of sympathy than blame because he would never have laid hands on what was not his had not a white man sold him deleterious liquor as no white man is allowed to supply an indian with alcohol in any form the wardens of the prairie took a somewhat similar view of the case and stimson was from motives which he did not mention especially anxious to get his grip upon the other offender  the night when they rode out was very dark and they spent half of it beneath a birch bluff seeing nothing whatever and only hearing a coyote howl it almost appeared that there was something wrong with the information supplied them respecting the probable running of another load of prohibited whisky and towards morning stimson rode up to the young commissioned officer  the man who brought us word has either played their usual trick and sent us here while his friends take the other trail or somebody saw us ride out and went south to tell the boys he said now you might consider it advisable that i and one of the troopers should head for the ford at willow hollow sir  yes said the young officer who was quite aware that there was as yet many things connected with his duties he did not know now i come to think of it sergeant i do well give you two hours and then if you dont turn up ride over after you its condemnably shivery waiting for nothing here  stimson saluted and shook his bridle and rather less than an hour later faintly discerned a rattle of wheels that rose from a long way off across the prairie then he used the spur and by and by it became evident that the drumming of their horses feet had carried far for though the rattle grew a little louder there was no doubt that whoever drove the wagon had no desire to be overtaken still two horses cannot haul a vehicle over a rutted trail as fast as one can carry a man and when the wardens of the prairie raced towards the black wall of birches that rose higher in front of them the sound of wheels seemed very near it however ceased suddenly and was followed by a drumming that could only have been made by a galloping horse  one beast said the sergeant well theyd have two men anyway in that wagon get down and picket well find the other fellow somewhere in the bluff  they came upon him within five minutes endeavouring to cut loose the remaining horse from the entangled harness in such desperate haste that he did not hear them until stimson grasped his shoulder  hold out your hands he said you have your carbine ready trooper  the man made no resistance and stimson laughed when the handcuffs were on  now he said wheres your partner  i dont know that i mind telling you said the prisoner it was a low down trick he played on me we got down to take out the horses when we saw we couldnt get away from you and id a blanket girthed round the best of them when he said hed hold him while i tried what i could do with the other well i let him and the first thing i knew he was off at a gallop leaving me with the other kicking devil two men couldnt handle youll find him rustling south over the montana trail  mount and ride said stimson and when his companion galloped off turned once more to his prisoner  youll have a lantern somewhere and id like a look at you he said if youre the man i expect im glad i found you  its in the wagon said the other dejectedly  stimson got a light and when he had released and picketed the plunging horse held it so that he could see his prisoner then he nodded with evident contentment  you may as well sit down weve got to have a talk he said  well said the other id help you to catch harmon if i could but i can prove he hired me to drive him over to kemps in the wagon and youd find it difficult to show i knew what there was in the packages he took along  stimson smiled dryly still he said i think it could be done and ive another count against you you had one or two deals with the boys some little while ago  im not afraid of your fixing up against me anything i did then said the other man  no said stimson now i guess youre wrong and it might be a good deal more serious than whiskyrunning one night a man crawled up to your homestead through the snow and you took him in  he saw the sudden fear in his companions face before he turned it from the lantern  it has happened quite a few times said the latter we dont turn any stranger out in this country  of course said the sergeant gravely though he felt a little thrill of content as he saw the shot he had been by no means sure of had told that man however had lost his horse in the river and it was the one he got from you that took him out of the country now if we could show you knew what he had done it might go as far as hanging somebody  the man was evidently not a confirmed lawbreaker but merely one of the small farmers who were willing to pick up a few dollars by assisting the whiskyrunners now and then and he abandoned all resistance  sergeant he said it was most a week before i knew and if anybody had told me at the time id have turned him out to freeze before id have let him have a horse of mine  that wouldnt go very far if we brought the charge against you said stimson grimly if youd sent us word when you did know wed have had him  well said the man he was across the frontier by that time and i dont know that most folks would have done it if theyd had the warning the boys sent me  stimson appeared to consider for almost a minute and then gravely rapped his companions arm  it seems to me that the sooner you and i have an understanding the better it will be for you he said  they were some time arriving at it and the sergeants superiors might not have been pleased with all he promised during the discussion still he was flying at higher game and had to sacrifice a little while he knew his man  well fix it up without you as far as we can but if we want you to give evidence that the man who lost his horse in the river was not farmer witham well know where to find you he said youll have to take your chance of being tried with him if we find you trying to get out of the country  it was half an hour later when the rest of the troopers arrived and stimson had some talk with their officer aside  a little out of the usual course isnt it said the latter i dont know that id have countenanced it so to speak off my own bat at all but i had a tolerably plain hint that you were to use your discretion over this affair after all one has to stretch a point or two occasionally  yes sir said stimson a good many now and then  the officer smiled a little and went back to the rest two of you will ride after the other rascal he said now look here my man the first time my troopers wholl call round quite frequently dont find you about your homestead youll land yourself in a tolerably serious difficulty in the meanwhile im sorry we cant bring a charge of whiskyrunning against you but another time be careful who you hire your wagon to  then there was a rapid drumming of hoofs as two troopers went off at a gallop while when the rest turned back towards the outpost stimson rode with them quietly content     chapter xxiii  the revelation   withams harvesting prospered as his sowing had done for day by day the bright sunshine shone down on standing wheat and lengthening rows of sheaves it was in the bracing cold of sunrise the work began and the first pale stars were out before the tired men and jaded horses dragged themselves home again not infrequently it happened that the men wore out the teams and machines but there was no stoppage then for fresh horses were led out from the corral or a new binder was ready every minute was worth a dollar and witham who had apparently foreseen and provided for everything wasted none  thenfor wheat is seldom stacked in that countryas the days grew shorter and the evenings cool the smoke of the big thrasher streaked the harvest field and the wagons went jolting between humming separator and granary until the latter was gorged to repletion and the wheat was stored within a willow framing beneath the chaff and straw that streamed from the shoot of the great machine witham had round him the best men that dollars could hire and toiled tirelessly with the grimy host in the whirling dust of the thrasher and amidst the sheaves wherever another pair of hands or the quick decision that would save an hours delay was needed most  as compared with the practice of insular britain there were not half enough of them but wages are high in that country and the crew of the thrasher paid by the bushel while the rest had long worked for their own hand on the levels of manitoba and in the bush of ontario and knew that the sooner their toil was over the sooner they would go home again with welllined pockets so generously fed splendid human muscle kept pace with clinking steel under a stress that is seldom borne outside the sunbleached prairie at harvest time and witham forgot everything save the constant need for the utmost effort of body and brain it was even of little import to him that prices moved steadily upwards as he toiled  at last it was finished and only kneehigh stubble covered his land and that of maud barrington whilefor he was one who could venture fearlessly and still know when he had risked enoughsoon after it was thrashed out the wheat was sold the harvesters went home with enough to maintain them through the winter and witham who spent two days counting his gain wrote asking graham to send him an accountant from winnipeg with him he spent a couple more and then with an effort he was never to forget prepared himself for the reckoning it was time to fling off the mask before the eyes of all who had trusted him  he had thought over it carefully and his first decision had been to make the revelation alone to colonel barrington that however would he felt be too simple and his pride rebelled against anything that would stamp him as one who dare not face the men he had deceived one by one they had tacitly offered him their friendship and then their esteem until he knew that he was virtually leader at silverdale and it seemed fitting that he should admit the wrong he had done them and bear the obloquy before them all for a while the thought of maud barrington restrained him and then he brushed that aside he had fancied with masculine blindness that what he felt for her had been well concealed and that her attitude to him could be no more than kindly sympathy with one who was endeavouring to atone for a discreditable past her anger and astonishment would be hard to bear but once more his pride prompted him and he decided that she should at least see he had the courage to face the results of his wrongdoing as it happened he was also given an opportunity when he was invited to the harvest celebration that was held each year at silverdale  it was a still cool evening when every man of the community and most of the women gathered in the big diningroom of the grange the windows were shut now for the chill of the early frost was on the prairie and the great lamps burned steadily above the long tables cut glass dainty china and silver gleamed beneath them amidst the ears of wheat that stood in clusters for sole and appropriate ornamentation they merited the place of honour for wheat had brought prosperity to every man at silverdale who had had the faith to sow that year  on either hand were rows of smiling faces the mens burned and bronzed the womens kissed into faintly warmer colour by the sun and white shoulders shone amidst the sombrely covered ones while here and there a diamond gleamed on a snowy neck barrington sat at the head of the longest table with his niece and sister dane and his oldest followers about him and witham at its foot dressed very simply after the usual fashion of the prairie farmers there were few in the company who had not noticed this though they did not as yet understand its purport  nothing happened during dinner but maud barrington noticed that although some of his younger neighbours rallied him witham was grimly quiet when it was over barrington rose and the men who knew the care he had borne that year never paid him more willing homage than they did when he stood smiling down on them as usual he was immaculate in dress erect and quietly commanding but in spite of its smile his face seemed worn and there were thickening wrinkles which told of anxiety about his eyes  another year has gone and we have met again to celebrate with gratefulness the fulfilment of the promise made when the world was young he said we do well to be thankful but i think humility becomes us too while we doubted the sun and the rain have been with us for a sign that though men grow fainthearted and spare their toil seed time and harvest shall not fail  it was the first time colonel barrington had spoken in quite that strain and when he paused a moment there was a curious stillness for those who heard him noticed an unusual tremor in his voice there was also a gravity that was not far removed from sadness in his face when he went on again but the intentness of his retainers would have been greater had they known that two separate detachments of police troopers were then riding toward silverdale  the year has brought its changes and set its mark deeply on some of us he said we cannot recall it or retrieve our blunders but we can hope they will be forgiven us and endeavour to avoid them again this is not the fashion in which i had meant to speak to you tonight but after the bounty showered upon us i feel my responsibility the law is unchangeable the man who would have bread to eat or sell must toil for it and i in disregard of it bade you hold your hand well we have had our lesson and we will be wiser another time but i have felt that my usefulness as your leader is slipping away from me this year has shown me that i am getting an old man  dane kicked the foot of a lad beside him and glanced at the piano as he stood up  sir he said simply although we have differed about trifles and may do again we dont want a better oneand if we did we couldnt find him  a chord from the piano rang through the approving murmurs and the company rose to their feet before the lad had beaten out the first bar of the jingling rhythm then the voices took it up and the great hall shook to the rafters with the last nobody can deny  trite as it was barrington saw the darker flush in the bronzed faces and there was a shade of warmer colour in his own as he went on again  the things one feels the most are those one can least express and i will not try to tell you how i value your confidence he said still the fact remains that sooner or later i must let the reins fall into younger hands and there is a man here who will i fancy lead you farther than you would ever go with me times change and he can teach you how those who would do the most for the dominion need live today he is also and i am glad of it one of us for traditions do not wholly lose their force and we know that blood will tell that this year has not ended hi disaster irretrievable is due to our latest comrade lance courthorne  this time there were no musical honours or need of them for a shout went up that called forth an answering rattle from the cedar panelling it was flung back from table to table up and down the great room and when the men sat down flushed and breathless their eyes still shining the one they admitted had saved silverdale rose up quietly at the foot of the table the hand he laid on the snowy cloth shook a little and the bronze that generally suffused it was less noticeable in his face all who saw it felt that something unusual was coming and maud barrington leaned forward a trifle with a curious throbbing of her heart  comrades it is i think the last time you will hear the term from me he saidi am glad that we have made and won a good fight at silverdale because it may soften your most warranted resentment when you think of me  every eye was turned upon him and an expression of bewilderment crept into the faces while a lad who sat next to him touched his arm reassuringly  youll feel your feet in a moment but thats a curious fashion of putting it he said  witham turned to barrington and stood silent a moment he saw maud barringtons face showing strained and intent but less bewildered than the others and that of her aunt which seemed curiously impassive and a little thrill ran through him it passed and once more he only saw the leader of silverdale  sir he said i did you a wrong when i came here and with your convictions you would never tolerate me as your successor  there was a rustle of fabric as some of the women moved and a murmur of uncontrollable astonishment while those who noticed it remembered barringtons gasp it expressed absolute bewilderment but in another moment he smiled  sit down lance he said you need make no speeches we expect better things from you  witham stood very still it was the simple truth i told you sir he said dont make it too hard for me  just then there was a disturbance at the rear of the room and a man who shook off the grasp of one that followed him came in he moved forward with uneven steps and then resting his hand on a chairback faced about and looked at witham the dust was thick upon his clothes but it was his face that seized and held attention it was horribly pallid save for the flush that showed in either cheek and his halfclosed eyes were dazed  i heard them cheering he said couldnt find you at your homestead you should have sent the five hundred dollars they would have saved you this  the defective utterance would alone have attracted attention and with the mans attitude was very significant but it was equally evident to most of those who watched him that he was also struggling with some infirmity western hospitality has however no limit and one of the younger men drew out a chair  hadnt you better sit down and if you want anything to eat well get it you he said then you can tell us what your errand is  the man made a gesture of negation and pointed to witham  i came to find a friend of mine they told me at his homestead that he was here he said  there was an impressive silence until colonel barrington glanced at witham who still stood quietly impassive at the foot of the table  you know our visitor he said the grange is large enough to give a stranger shelter  the man laughed of course he does its my place hes living in  barrington turned again to witham and his face seemed to have grown a trifle stern  who is this man he said  witham looked steadily in front of him vacantly noticing the rows of faces turned towards him under the big lamps if he had waited a few minutes longer you would have known he said he is lance courthorne  this time the murmurs implied incredulity but the man who stood swaying a little with his hand on the chair and a smile in his halfclosed eyes made an ironical inclination  its evident you dont believe it or wish to still its true he said  one of the men nearest him rose and quietly pushed him into the chair  sit down in the meanwhile he said dryly by and by colonel barrington will talk to you  barrington thanked him with a gesture and glanced at the rest one would have preferred to carry out this inquiry more privately he said very slowly but with hoarse distinctness still you have already heard so much  dane nodded i fancy you are right sir because we have known and respected the man who has at least done a good deal for us it would be better that we should hear the rest  barrington made a little gesture of agreement and once more fixed his eyes on witham then will you tell us who you are  a struggling prairie farmer said witham quietly the son of an english country doctor who died in penury and one who from your point of view could never have been entitled to more than courteous toleration from any of you  he stopped butfor the astonishment was passingthere was negation in the murmurs which followed while somebody said go on  dane stood up i fancy our comrade is mistaken he said whatever he may have been we recognize our debt to him still i think he owes us a more complete explanation  then maud barrington sitting where all could see her signed imperiously to alfreton who was on his feet next moment with macdonald and more of the men following him  i he said with a little ring in his voice and a flush in his young face owe him everything and im not the only one this it seems to me is the time to acknowledge it  barrington checked him with a gesture sit down all of you painful and embarrassing as it is now we have gone so far this affair must be elucidated it would be better if you told us more  witham drew back a chair and when courthorne moved the man who sat next to him laid a grasp on his arm you will oblige me by not making any remarks just now he said dryly when colonel barrington wants to hear anything from you hell ask you  there is little more said witham i could see no hope in the old country and came out to this one with one hundred pounds a distant connexion lent me that sum will not go very far anywhere as i found when after working for other men i bought stock and took up government land to hear how i tried to do three mens work for six weary years and at times went for months together halffed might not interest you though it has its bearing on what came after the seasons were against me and i had not the dollars to tide me over the time of drought and blizzard until a good one came still though my stock died and i could scarcely haul in the little wheat the frost and hail left me with my wornout team i held on feeling that i could achieve prosperity if i once had the chances of other men  he stopped a moment and macdonald poured out a glass of wine and passed it across to him in a fashion that made the significance of what he did evident  we know what kind of a struggle you made by what we have seen at silverdale he said  witham put the glass aside and turned once more to colonel barrington  still he said until courthorne crossed my path i had done no wrong and i was in dire need of the money that tempted me to take his offer he made a bargain with me that i should ride his horse and personate him that the police troopers might leave him unsuspected to lead his comrades running whisky while they followed me i kept my part of the bargain and it cost me what i fancy i can never recover unless the trial i shall shortly face will take the stain from me while i passed for him your lawyer found me and i had no choice between being condemned as a criminal for what courthorne had in the meanwhile done or continuing the deception he had as soon as i had left him taken my horse and garments so that if seen by the police they would charge me i could not take your money but though courthorne was apparently drowned i did wrong when i came to silverdale for a time the opportunities dazzled me ambition drew me on and i knew what i could do  he stopped again and once more there was a soft rustle of dresses and a murmur as those who listened gave inarticulate expression to their feelings moving a little he looked steadily at maud barrington and her aunt who sat close together  then he said very slowly it was borne in upon me that i could not persist in deceiving you courthorne i fancied could not return to trouble me but the confidence that little by little you placed in me rendered it out of the question still i saw that i could save some at least at silverdale from drifting to disaster and there was work for me here which would go a little way in reparation and now that it is done i was about to bid you goodbye and ask you not to think too hardly of me  there was a moments intense silence until once more dane rose up and pointed to courthorne sitting with halfclosed eyes dusty partly dazed by indulgence and with the stamp of dissolute living on him in his chair then he glanced at withams bronzed face which showed quietly resolute at the bottom of the table  whatever we would spare you and ourselves sir we must face the truth he said which of these men was needed at silverdale  again the murmurs rose up but witham sat silent his pulses throbbing with a curious exultation he had seen the colour creep into maud barringtons face and her aunts eyes when he told her what had prompted him to leave silverdale and knew they understood him then in the stillness that followed the drumming of hoofs rose from the prairie it grew louder and when another sound became audible too more than one of those who listened recognized the jingle of accoutrements courthorne rose unsteadily and made for the door  i think he said with a curious laugh i must be going i dont know whether the troopers want me or your comrade  a lad sprang to his feet and as he ran to the door called stop him  in another moment dane had caught his arm and his voice rang through the confusion as everybody turned or rose  keep back all of you he said let him go  courthorne was outside by this time and only those who reached the door before dane closed it heard a faint beat of hoofs as somebody rode quietly away beneath the bluff while as the rest clustered together wondering a minute or two later corporal payne flecked with spume and covered with dust came in he raised his hand in salutation to colonel barrington who sat very grim in face in his chair at the head of the table  im sorry sir but its my duty to apprehend lance courthorne he said  you have a warrant asked barrington  yes sir said the corporal  there was intense silence for a moment then the colonels voice broke through it very quietly  he is not here he said  payne made a little deprecatory gesture we knew he came here it is my duty to warn you that proceedings will be taken against any one concealing or harbouring him  barrington rose up very stiffly with a little grey tinge in his face but words seemed to fail him and dane laid his hand on the corporals shoulder  then he said grimly dont exceed it if you believe hes here we will give you every opportunity of finding him  payne called to a comrade outside who was as it happened new to the force and they spent at least ten minutes questioning the servants and going up and down the house then as they glanced into the general room the trooper looked deprecatingly at his officer  i fancied i heard somebody riding by the bluff just before we reached the house he said  payne wheeled round with a flash in his eyes then you have lost us our man out with you and tell jackson to try the bluff for a trail  they had gone in another moment and witham still sat at the foot of the table and barrington at the head while the rest of the company were scattered some wonderingly silent though others talked in whispers about the room as yet they felt only consternation and astonishment     chapter xxiv  courthorne makes reparation   the silence in the big room had grown oppressive when barrington raised his head and sat stiffly upright  what has happened has been a blow to me and i am afraid i am scarcely equal to entertaining you tonight he said i should however like dane and macdonald and one or two of the older men to stay a while there is still i fancy a good deal for us to do  the others turned towards the door but as they passed witham miss barrington turned and touched his shoulder the man looking up suddenly saw her and her niece standing close beside her  madam he said hoarsely though it was maud barrington he glanced at the comedy is over well i promised you an explanation and now you have it you will try not to think too bitterly of me i cannot ask you to forgive me  the little whitehaired lady pointed to the ears of wheat which stood gleaming ruddybronze in front of him  that she said very quietly will make it easier  maud barrington said nothing but every one in the room saw her standing a moment beside the man with a little flush in her face and no blame in her eyes then she passed on but short as it was the pause had been very significant for it seemed that whatever the elders of the community might decide the two women whose influence was supreme at silverdale had given the impostor absolution  the girl could not analyse her feelings but through them all a vague relief was uppermost for whatever he had been it was evident the man had done one wrong only and daringly and that was a good deal easier to forgive than several incidents in courthornes past would have been then she was conscious that miss barringtons eyes were upon her  aunt she said with a little tremor in her voice it is almost bewildering still one seemed to feel that what that man has done could never have been the work of lance courthorne  miss barrington made no answer but her face was very grave and just then those nearest it drew back a little from the door a trooper stood outside it his carbine glinting in the light and another was silhouetted against the sky sitting motionless in his saddle further back on the prairie  the police are still there said somebody  one by one they passed out under the troopers gaze but there was the usual delay in harnessing and saddling and the first vehicle had scarcely rolled away when again the beat of hoofs and thin jingle of steel came portentously out of the silence maud barrington shivered a little as she heard it  in the meanwhile the few who remained had seated themselves about colonel barrington when there was quietness again he glanced at witham who still sat at the foot of the table  have you anything more to tell us he asked these gentlemen are here to advise me if necessary  yes said witham quietly i shall probably leave silverdale before morning and have now to hand you a statement of my agreement with courthorne and the result of my farming here drawn up by a winnipeg accountant here is also a document in which i have taken the liberty of making you and dane my assigns you will as authorized by it pay to courthorne the sum due to him and with your consent which you have power to withhold i propose taking one thousand dollars only of the balance that remains to me i have it here now and in the meanwhile surrender it to you of the rest you will make whatever use that appears desirable for the general benefit of silverdale courthorne has absolutely no claim upon it  he laid a wallet on the table and dane glanced at colonel barrington who nodded when he returned it unopened  we will pass it without counting you accept the charge sir he said  yes said barrington gravely it seems it is forced on me well we will glance through the statement  for at least ten minutes nobody spoke and then dane said there are prairie farmers who would consider what he is leaving behind him a competence  if this agreement which was apparently verbal is confirmed by courthorne the entire sum rightfully belongs to the man he made his tenant said barrington and macdonald smiled gravely as he glanced at witham  i think we can accept the statement that it was made without question sir he said  witham shook his head i claim one thousand dollars as the fee of my services and they should be worth that much but i will take no more  are we not progressing a little too rapidly sir said dane it seems to me we have yet to decide whether it is necessary that the man who has done so much for us should leave silverdale  witham smiled a trifle grimly i think he said that question will very shortly be answered for you  macdonald held his hand up and a rapid thud of hoofs came faintly through the silence  troopers they are coming here he said  yes said witham i fancy they will relieve you from any further difficulty  dane strode to one of the windows and glanced at colonel barrington as he pulled back the catch witham however shook his head and a little flush crept into danes bronzed face  sorry of course you are right he said it will be better that they should acquit you  no one moved for a few more minutes and then with a trooper behind him sergeant stimson came in and laid his hand on withams shoulder  i have a warrant for your apprehension farmer witham he said you probably know the charge against you  yes said witham simply i hope to refute it i will come with you  he went out and barrington stared at the men about him i did not catch the name before that was the man who shot the police trooper in alberta  no sir said dane very quietly nothing would induce me to believe it of him  barrington looked at him in bewilderment but he must have doneunless he said and ended with a little gasp good lord there was the faint resemblance and they changed horsesit is horrible  danes eyes were very compassionate as he laid his hand gently on his leaders shoulder  sir he said you have our sympathy and i am sorry that to offer it is all we can do now i think we have stayed too long already  they went out and left colonel barrington sitting alone with a grey face at the head of the table  it was a minute or two later when witham swung himself into the saddle at the door of the grange all the vehicles had not left as yet and there was a little murmur of sympathywhen the troopers closed in about him still before they rode away one of the men wheeled his horse aside and witham saw maud barrington standing bareheaded by his stirrup the moonlight showed that her face was impassive but curiously pale  we could not let you go without a word and you will come back to us with your innocence made clear she said  her voice had a little ring in it that carried far and her companions heard her what witham said they could not hear and he did not remember it but he swung his hat off and those who saw the girl at his stirrup recognized with confusion that she alone had proclaimed her faith while they had stood aside from him then the sergeant raised his hand and the troopers rode forward with their prisoner  in the meanwhile courthorne was pressing south for the american frontier and daylight was just creeping across the prairie when the pursuers who had found his trail and the ranch he obtained a fresh horse at had sight of him there were three of them riding wearily grimed with dust when a lonely mounted figure showed for a moment on the crest of a rise in another minute it dipped into a hollow and corporal payne smiled grimly  i think we have him now the creek cant be far away and hes west of the bridge he said while we try to head him off youll follow behind him hilton  one trooper sent the spurs in and while the others swung off rode straight on courthorne was at least a mile from them but they were nearer the bridge and payne surmised that his jaded horse would fail him if he essayed to ford the creek and climb the farther side of the deep ravine it flowed through they saw nothing of him when they swept across the rise for here and there a grove of willows stretched out across the prairie from the sinuous band of trees in front of them these marked the river hollow and payne knowing that the chase might be ended in a few more minutes did not spare the spur he also remembered as he tightened his grip on the bridle the white face of trooper shannon flecked with the drifting snow  the bluff that rose steadily higher came back to them willow and straggling birch flashed by and at last payne drew bridle where a rutted trail wound down between the trees to the bridge in the hollow a swift glance showed him that a mounted man could scarcely make his way between them and he smiled dryly as he signed to his companion  back your horse clear of the trail he said and there was a rattle as he flung his carbine across the saddle with hilton behind him hell ride straight into our hands  he wheeled his horse in among the birches and then sat still with fingers that quivered a little on the carbine stock until a faint drumming rose from the prairie  hes coming said the trooper hiltons hanging on to him  payne made no answer and the sound that rang more loudly every moment through the greyness of the early daylight was not pleasant to hear mans vitality is near its lowest about that hour and the troopers had ridden furiously the long night through while one of them who knew lance courthorne surmised that there was grim work before him still though he shivered as a little chilly wind shook the birch twigs he set his lips and once more remembered the comrade who had ridden far and kept many a lonely vigil with him  then a mounted man appeared in the space between the trees his horse was jaded and he rode loosely swaying once or twice in his saddle but he came straight on and there was a jingle and rattle as the troopers swung out into the trail the man saw them for he glanced over his shoulder as if at the rider who appeared behind and then sent the spurs in again  pull him up cried corporal payne and his voice was a little strained stop right where you are before we fire on you  the man must have seen the carbines for he raised himself a trifle and payne saw his face under the flapping hat it was drawn and grey but there was no sign of yielding or consternation in the halfclosed eyes then he lurched in his saddle as from exhaustion or weariness and straightened himself again with both hands on the bridle payne saw his heels move and the spurs drip red and slid his left hand further along the carbine stock the trail was steep and narrow a horseman could scarcely turn in it and the stranger was coming on at a gallop  he will have it said the trooper hoarsely if he rides one of us down he may get away  we have got to stop him said corporal payne  once more the swaying man straightened himself flung his head back and with a little breathless laugh drove his horse furiously at payne he was very close now and his face showed livid under the smearing dust but his lips were drawn up in a little bitter smile as he rode straight upon the levelled carbines payne at least understood it and the absence of flungup hand or cry courthornes inborn instincts were strong to the end  there was a hoarse shout from the trooper and no answer and a carbine flashed then courthorne loosed the bridle reeled sideways from the saddle rolled half round with one foot in the stirrup and his head upon the ground and was left behind while the riderless horse and pursuer swept past the two men who avoiding them by a hairsbreadth sat motionless a moment in the thin drifting smoke  then corporal payne swung himself down and while the trooper followed stooped over the man who lay a limp huddled object in the trail he blinked up at them out of eyes that were almost closed  i think you have done for me he said  payne glanced at his comrade push on to the settlement he said theyve a doctor there bring him and harland the magistrate out  the trooper seemed glad to mount and ride away and payne once more bent over the wounded man  very sorry he said still you see you left me no other means of stopping you now is there anything i can do for you  a little wry smile crept into courthornes face dont worry he said i had no wish to wait for the jury and you cant get at an injury thats inside me  he said nothing more and it seemed a very long while to corporal payne and trooper hilton who rejoined him before a wagon with two men in it beside the trooper came jolting up the trail they got out and one of them who was busy with courthorne for some minutes nodded to payne  any time in the next twelve hours he may last that long he said nobodys going to worry him now but ill see if i can revive him a little when we get to adamsons it cant be more than a league away  they lifted courthorne who appeared insensible into the wagon and payne signed to trooper hilton take my horse and tell colonel barrington let him understand theres no time to lose then you can bring stimson  the tired lad hoisted himself into his saddle and groaned a little as he rode away but he did his errand and late that night barrington and dane drove up to a lonely homestead a man led them into a room where a limp figure was lying on a bed  been kind of sleeping most of the day but the doctor has given him something that has wakened him he said  barrington returned paynes greeting and sat down with dane close beside him while when the wounded man raised his head the doctor spoke softly to the magistrate from the settlement a league or two away  i fancy he can talk to you but you had better be quick if you wish to ask him anything he said  courthorne seemed to have heard him for he smiled a little as he glanced at barrington im afraid it will hurt you to hear what i have to tell this gentleman he said now i want you to listen carefully and every word put down doctor a little more brandy  barrington apparently would have spoken but while the doctor held a glass to the bloodless lips the magistrate who took up a strip of paper signed to him  well have it in due form give him that book doctor he said now repeat after me and then well take your testimony  it was done and a flicker of irony showed in courthornes halfclosed eyes  you feel more sure of me after that he said in a voice that was very faint and strained still you see i could gain nothing by deviating from the truth now well i shot trooper shannon youll have the date in the warrant dont know if it will seem strange to you but i forget it i borrowed farmer withams horse and rifle without his knowledge though i had paid him a trifle to personate me and draw the troopers off the whiskyrunners that was withams only complicity the troopers who fancied they were chasing him followed me until his horse which i was riding went through the ice but witham was in montana at the time and did not know that i was alive until a very little while ago now you can straighten that up and read it out to me  the magistrates pen scratched noisily in the stillness of the room but before he had finished sergeant stimson hot and dusty came in then he raised his hand and for a while his voice rose and fell monotonously until courthorne nodded  thats all right he said ill sign  the doctor raised him a trifle and moistened his lips with brandy as he gave him the pen it scratched for a moment or two and then fell from his relaxing fingers while the man who took the paper wrote across the foot of it and then would have handed it to colonel barrington but that dane quietly laid his hand upon it  no he said if you want another witness take me  barrington thanked him with a gesture and courthorne looking round saw stimson  you have been very patient sergeant and its rough on you that the one man you can lay your hands upon is slipping away from you he said youll see by my deposition that witham thought me as dead as the rest of you did  stimson nodded to the magistrate i heard what was read and it is confirmed by the facts i have picked up he said  then courthorne turned to barrington i sympathize with you sir he said this must be horribly mortifying but you see witham once stopped my horse backing over a bridge into a gully when just to hold his hand would have rid him of me you will not grudge me the one good turn i have probably done any man when i shall assuredly not have the chance of doing another  barrington winced a little for he recognized the irony in the failing voice but he rose and moved towards the bed  lance he said a trifle hoarsely it is not that which makes what has happened horrible to me and i am only glad that you have righted this man your father had many claims on me and things might have gone differently if when you came out to canada i had done my duty by his son  courthorne smiled a little but without bitterness it would have made no difference sir and after all i led the life that suited me by and by you will be grateful to me i sent you a man who will bring prosperity to silverdale  then he turned to stimson and his voice sank almost beyond hearing as he said sergeant remember witham fancied i was dead  he moved his head a trifle and the doctor stooping over him signed to the rest who went out except barrington  it was some hours later and very cold when barrington came softly into the room where dane lay half asleep in a big chair the latter glanced at him with a question in his eyes and the colonel nodded very gravely  yes he said he has slipped out of the troopers hands and beyond our reproachesbut i think the last thing he did will count for a little     chapter xxv  witham rides away   the first of the snow was driving across the prairie before a bitter wind when maud barrington stood by a window of the grange looking out into the night the double casements rattled the curtains behind her moved with the icy draughts until growing weary of watching the white flakes whirl past she drew them to and walked slowly towards a mirror then a faint tinge of pink crept into her cheeks and a softness that became her into her eyes they however grew critical as she smoothed back a tress of lustrous hair a trifle from her forehead straightened the laces at neck and wrist and shook into more flowing lines the long black dress maud barrington was not unduly vain but it was some time before she seemed contented and one would have surmised that she desired to appear her best that night  the result was beyond cavil in its artistic simplicity for the girl knowing the significance that trifles have at times had laid aside every adornment that might hint at wealth and the sombre draperies alone emphasized the polished whiteness of her face and neck still and she did not know whether she was pleased or otherwise at this the mirror had shown the stamp which revealed itself even in passive pose and poise of head it was her birthright and would not be disguised  then she drew a low chair towards the stove and once more the faint colour crept into her face as she took up a note it was laconic and requested permission to call at the grange but maud barrington was not deceived and recognized the consideration each word had cost the man who wrote it afterwards she glanced at her watch raised it with a little gesture of impatience to make sure it had not stopped and sat still listening to the moaning of the wind until the door opened and miss barrington came in she glanced at her niece who felt that her eyes had noticed each detail of her somewhat unusual dress but said nothing until the younger woman turned to her  they would scarcely come tonight aunt she said  miss barrington listening a moment heard the wind that whirled the snow about the lonely building but smiled incredulously  i fancy you are wrong and i wish my brother were here she said we could not refuse mr witham permission to call but whatever passes between us will have more than its individual significance anything we tacitly promise the others will agree to and i feel the responsibility of deciding for silverdale  miss barrington went out but her niece who understood her smile and that she had received a warning sat with a strained expression in her eyes the prosperity of silverdale had been dear to her but she knew she must let something that was dearer still slip away from her or since they must come from her trample on her pride as she made the first advances it seemed a very long while before there was a knocking at the outer door and she rose with a little quiver when light steps came up the stairway  in the meanwhile two men stood beside the stove in the hall until an english maid returned to them  colonel barrington is away but miss barrington and miss maud are at home she said will you go forward into the morningroom when you have taken off your furs  did you know barrington was not here asked witham when the maid moved away  dane appeared embarrassed the fact is i did  then said witham dryly i am a little astonished you did not think fit to tell me  danes face flushed but he laid his hand on his comrades arm no he said i didnt now listen to me for the last time witham ive not been blind you see and as i told you your comrades have decided that they wish you to stay cant you sink your confounded pride and take what is offered you  witham shook his grasp off and there was weariness in his face you need not go through it all again i made my decision a long while ago  well said dane with a gesture of hopelessness ive done all i could and since you are going on ill look at that trace clip while you tell miss barrington i mean the younger one  the harness can wait said witham you are coming with me  a little grim smile crept into danes eyes i am not i wouldnt raise a finger to help you now he said and retreated hastily                                                   it was five minutes later when witham walked quietly into maud barringtons presence and sat down when the girl signed to him he wondered if she guessed how his heart was beating  it is very good of you to receive me but i felt i could not slip away without acknowledging the kindness you and miss barrington have shown me he said i did not know colonel barrington was away  the girl smiled a little or you would not have come then we should have had no opportunity of congratulating you on your triumphant acquittal you see it must be mentioned  im afraid there was a miscarriage of justice said witham quietly still though it is a difficult subject the deposition of the man i supplanted went a long way and the police did not seem desirous of pressing a charge against me perhaps i should have insisted on implicating myself but you would scarcely have looked for that after what you now know of me  maud barrington braced herself for an effort though she was outwardly very calm no she said no one would have looked for it from any man placed as you were and you are purposing to do more than is required of you why will you go away  i am a poor man said witham one must have means to live at silverdale  then said the girl with a soft laugh which cost her a good deal it is because you prefer poverty and you have at least one opportunity at silverdale courthornes land was mine to all intents and purposes before it was his and now it reverts to me i owe him nothing and he did not give it me will you stay and farm it on whatever arrangement dane and macdonald may consider equitable my uncles hands are too full for him to attempt it  no said witham and his voice trembled a little your friends would resent it  then said the girl why have they urged you to stay  a generous impulse they would repent of it by and by i am not one of them and they know it now as i did at the beginning no doubt they would be courteous but you see a halfcontemptuous toleration would gall me  there was a little smile on maud barringtons lips but it was not in keeping with the tinge in her cheek and the flash in her eyes  i once told you that you were poor at subterfuge and you know you are wronging them she said you also know that even if they were hostile to you you could stay and compel them to acknowledge you i fancy you once admitted as much to me what has become of this pride of the democracy you showed me  witham made a deprecatory gesture you must have laughed at me i had not been long at silverdale then he said dryly i should feel very lonely now one man against long generations wouldnt it be a trifle unequal  maud barrington smiled again i did not laugh and this is not england though what you consider prejudices do not count for so much as they used to there while there is one is told quite frequently no limit to what a man may attain to here if he dares sufficiently  a little quiver ran through witham and he rose and stood looking down on her with one brown hand clenched on the table and the veins showing on his forehead  you would have me stay he said  maud barrington met his eyes for the spirit that was in her was the equal of his i would have you be yourselfwhat you were when you came here in defiance of colonel barrington and again when you sowed the last acre of courthornes land while my friends who are yours too looked on wondering then you would stayif it pleased you where has your splendid audacity gone  witham slowly straightened himself and the girl noticed the damp the struggle had brought there on his forehead for he understood that if he would stretch out his hand and take it what he longed for might be his  i do not know any more than i know where it came from for until i met courthorne i had never made a big venture in my life he said it seems it has served its turn and left mefor now there are things i am afraid to do  so you will go away and forget us  witham stood very still a moment and the girl who felt her heart beating noticed that his face was drawn still she could go no further then he said very slowly i should be under the shadow always if i stay and my friends would feel it even more deeply than i would do i may win the right to come back again if i go away  maud barrington made no answer but both knew no further word could be spoken on that subject until if fate ever willed it the man returned again and it was a relief when miss barrington came in with dane he glanced at his comrade keenly and then seeing the grimness in his face quietly declined the whitehaired ladys offer of hospitality five minutes later the farewells were said and maud barrington stood with the stinging flakes whirling about her in the doorway while the sleigh slid out into the filmy whiteness that drove across the prairie when it vanished she turned back into the warmth and brightness with a little shiver and one hand tightly closed  the great room seemed very lonely when while the wind moaned outside she and her aunt sat down to dinner neither of them appeared communicative and both felt it a relief when the meal was over then maud barrington smiled curiously as she rose and stood with hands stretched out towards the stove  aunt she said twoinette has twice asked me to go back to montreal and i think i will the prairie is very dreary in the winter  it was about this time when as the whitened horses floundered through the lee of a bluff where there was shelter from the wind the men in the sleigh found opportunity for speech  now said dane quietly i know that we have lost you for a while at least will you ever come back witham  witham nodded yes he said when time has done its work and colonel barrington asks me if i can buy land enough to give me a standing at silverdale  that said dane will need a good many dollars and you insisted on flinging those you had away how are you going to make them  i dont know said witham simply still by some means it will be done  it was next day when he walked into grahams office at winnipeg and laughed when the broker who shook hands passed the cigar box across to him  we had better understand each other first he said you have heard what has happened to me and will not find me a profitable customer today  these cigars are the best in the city or i wouldnt ask you to take one said graham dryly you understand me anyway wait until i tell my clerk that if anybody comes round im busy  a bell rang a little window opened and shut again and witham smiled over his cigar  i want to make thirty thousand dollars as soon as i can and it seems to me there are going to be opportunities in this business do you know anybody who would take me as clerk or salesman  graham did not appear astonished  youll scarcely make them that way if i find you a berth at fifty a month he said  no said witham still i wouldnt purpose keeping it for more than six months or so by that time i should know a little about the business  got any dollars now  one thousand said witham quietly  graham nodded smoke that cigar out and dont worry me ive got some thinking to do  witham took up a journal and laid it down again twenty minutes later well he said you think its too big a thing  no said graham it depends upon the man and it might be done knowing the business goes a good way and so does having dollars in hand but theres something thats born in one man in a thousand that goes a long way further still i cant tell you what it is but i know it when i see it  then said witham you have seen this thing in me  graham nodded gravely yes sir but you dont want to get proud you had nothing to do with the getting of it it was given you now were going to have a year that will not be forgotten by those who handle wheat and flour and the men with the long heads will roll the dollars in well ive no use for another clerk and my salesmans good enough for me but if we can agree on the items ill take you for a partner  the offer was made and accepted quietly and when a rough draft of the arrangement had been agreed upon graham nodded as he lighted another cigar  you may as well take hold at once and theres work ready now he said youve heard of the old st louis mills back on the edge of the bush country never did any good folks who had them were short of dollars and didnt know how they should be run well i and two other men have bought them for a song and while the place is tumbling in the plant seems good now i can get hold of orders for flour when i want them and everybody with dollars to spare will plank them right into any concern handling foodstuffs this year you go down tomorrow with an engineer and when youve got the mills running and orders coming in well sell out to a company if we dont want them  witham sat silent a space turning over a big bundle of plans and estimates then he said youll have to lay out a pile of dollars  graham laughed thats going to be your affair when you want them the dollars will be ready and theres only one condition every dollar we put down has got to bring another in  but said witham i dont know anything about milling  then said graham dryly you have got to learn a good many men have got quite rich in this country running things they didnt know much about when they took hold of them  theres one more point said witham i must make those thirty thousand dollars soon or theyll be no great use to me and when i have them i may want to leave you  thats all right said graham by the time youve done it youll have made sixty for me well go out and have some lunch to clinch the deal if youre ready  it might have appeared unusual in england but it was much less so in a country where the specialization of professions is still almost unknown and the man who can adapt himself attains ascendency and on the morrow witham arrived at a big wooden building beside a pineshrouded river it appeared falling to pieces and the engineer looked disdainfully at some of the machinery but somewhat against his wishes he sat up with his companion most of the night in a little log hotel and orders that occasioned one of grahams associates consternation were mailed to the city next morning then machines came out by the carload and men with tools in droves some of them murmured mutinously when they found they were expected to do as much as their leader who was not a tradesman but these were forthwith sent back again and the rest were willing to stay and earn the premium he promised them for rapid work  before the frost grew arctic the building stood firm and the hammers rang inside it night and day until when the ice had bound the dam and lead the fires were lighted and the trials under steam again it cost more than water but buyers with orders from the east were clamouring for flour just then for a fortnight witham snatched his food in mouthfuls and scarcely closed his eyes when graham found him pale and almost haggard when he came down with several men from the cities in response to a telegram for an hour they moved up and down watching whirring belt and humming roller and then whitened with the dust stood very intent and quiet while one of them dipped up a little flour from the delivery hopper his opinions on and dealings in that product were famous in the land he said nothing for several minutes and then brushing the white dust from his hands turned with a little smile to graham  well have some baked but i dont know that theres much use for it this will grade a very good first he said you can book me the thousand two eighties for a beginning now  withams fingers trembled but there was a twinkle in grahams eyes as he brought his hand down on his shoulder  gentlemen he said i was figuring right on this when i brought the champagne along it was all i could do but imperial tokay wouldnt be good enough to rinse this dust down with when every speck of it thats on you means dollars by the handful rolling in  it was a very contented and slightly hilarious party that went back to the city but witham sat down before a shaded lamp with a wet rag round his head when they left him and bent over a sheaf of drawings until his eyes grew dim then he once more took up a little strip of paper that graham had given him and leaned forward with his arms upon the table the mill was very silent at last for of all who toiled in it that day one weary man alone sat awake staring with aching eyes in front of him there was however a little smile in them for roseate visions floated before them if the promise that strip of paper held out was redeemed they might be materialized for those who had toiled and wasted their substance that the eastern peoples might be fed would that year at least not go without their reward then he stretched out his arms wearily above his head  it almost seems that what i have hoped for may be mine he said still there is a good deal to be done first and not two hours left before i begin it tomorrow     chapter xxvi  reinstation   a year of tireless effort and some anxiety had passed since witham had seen the first load of flour sent to the east when he and graham sat talking in their winnipeg office the products of the st louis mills were already in growing demand and graham appeared quietly contented as he turned over the letters before him when he laid down the last one however he glanced at his companion somewhat anxiously  we have got to fix up something soon he said i have booked all the st louis can turn out for six months ahead and the syndicate is ready to take the business over though i dont know quite whether it would be wise to let them it seems to me that milling is going to pay tolerably well for another year and if i knew what you were wanting it would suit me better  i told you i wanted thirty thousand dollars said witham quietly  youve got them said graham when the next balance comes out youll have a good many more the question is what youre going to do with them now theyre yours  witham took out a letter from dane and passed it across to graham im sorry to tell you the colonel is getting no better it ran the specialist we brought in seems to think he will never be quite himself again and now he has let the reins go things are falling to pieces at silverdale somebody left atterly a pile of money and he is going back to the old country carshalton is going too and as they cant sell out to any one we dont approve of the rest insisted on my seeing you i purpose starting tomorrow  what happened to colonel barrington asked graham  his sleigh turned over said witham horse trampled on him and it was an hour or two before his hired man could get him under shelter  you would be content to turn farmer again  i think i would said witham at least at silverdale  graham made a little grimace well he said resignedly i guess its human nature but im thankful now and then theres nothing about me but my dollars that would take the eye of any young woman i figure theyre kind of useful to wake up a man so hell stir round looking for something to offer one of them but he is apt to find his business must go second when she has got it and him and he has to waste on house fixings what would give a man a fair start in life still its no use talking what have you told him  witham laughed a little nothing he said i will let him come and you shall have my decision when ive been to silverdale  it was next day when dane arrived at winnipeg and witham listened gravely to all he had to tell him  i have two questions to ask he said would the others be unanimous in receiving me and does colonel barrington know of your mission  yes to both said dane we havent a man there who would not hold out his hand to you and barrington has been worrying and talking a good deal about you lately he seems to fancy nothing has gone right at silverdale since you left it and others share his opinion the fact is the old man is losing his grip tolerably rapidly  then said witham quietly ill go down with you but i can make no promise until i have heard the others  dane smiled a little that is all i want i dont know whether i told you that maud barrington is there would tomorrow suit you  no said witham i will come today  it was early next morning when they stepped out of the stovewarmed car into the stinging cold of the prairie furclad figures showing shapeless in the creeping light clustered about them and witham felt himself thumped on the shoulders by mittened hands while alfretons young voice broke through the murmurs of welcome  let him alone while hes hungry he said its the first time in its history theyve had breakfast ready at this hour in the hotel and it would not have been accomplished if i hadnt spent most of yesterday playing cards with the man who keeps it and making love to the young women  thats quite right said another lad when he takes his cap off youll see how one of them rewarded him but come along witham itisready  the greetings might of course have been expressed differently but witham also was not addicted to displaying all he felt and the little ring in the lads voices was enough for him as they moved towards the hotel he saw that dane was looking at him  well said the latter you see they want you  that was probably the most hilarious breakfast that had ever been held in the wooden hotel and before it was over three of his companions had said to witham of course youll drive in with me  boys he said as they put their furs on and his voice shook a trifle i cant ride in with everybody who has asked me unless you dismember me  finally alfreton who was a trifle too quick for the others got him into his sleigh and they swept out behind a splendid team into the frozen stillness of the prairie the white leagues rolled behind them the cold grew intense but while witham was for the most part silent and apparently preoccupied alfreton talked almost incessantly and only once looked grave that happened when witham asked about colonel barrington  the lad shook his head i scarcely think he will ever take hold again he said you will understand me better when you see him  they stopped awhile at midday at an outlying farm but witham glanced inquiringly at alfreton when one of the sleighs went on the lad smiled at him  yes he said he is going on to tell them we have got you  they would have found it out in a few more hours said witham  alfretons eyes twinkled no doubt they would he said dryly still you see somebody was offering two to one that dane couldnt bring you and you know were generally keen about any kind of wager  the explanation which was not quite out of keeping with the customs of the younger men at silverdale did not content witham but he said nothing so far his return had resembled a triumph and while the sincerity of the welcome had its effect on him he shrank a little from what he fancied might be waiting him  the creeping darkness found them still upon the waste and the cold grew keener when the stars peeped out even sound seemed frozen and the faint muffled beat of hoofs unreal and out of place in the icy stillness of the wilderness still the horses knew they were nearing home and swung into faster pace while the men drew fur caps down and the robes closer round them as the draught their passage made stung them with a cold that seemed to sear the skin where there was an inch left uncovered on the face now and then a clump of willows or a birch bluff flitted out of the dimness grew a trifle blacker and was left behind but there was still no sign of habitation and alfreton too chilled at last to speak passed the reins to witham and beat his mittened hands witham could scarcely grasp them for he had lived of late in the cities and the cold he had been sheltered from was numbing  for another hour they slid onwards and then a dim blur crept out of the white waste it rose higher cutting more blackly against the sky and witham recognized with a curious little quiver the birch bluff that sheltered silverdale grange then as they swept through the gloom of it a row of ruddy lights blinked across the snow and witham felt his heart beat as he watched the homestead grow into form he had first come there an impostor and had left it an outcast while now it was amidst the acclamations of those who had once looked on him with suspicion he was coming back again  still he was almost too cold for any definite feeling but the sting of the frost and it was very stiffly he stood up shaken by vague emotions when at last the horses stopped a great door swung open somebody grasped his hand there was a murmur of voices and partly dazed by the change of temperature he blundered into the warmth of the hall the blaze of light bewildered him and he was but dimly sensible that the men who greeted him were helping him to shake off his furs while the next thing he was sure of was that a little whitehaired lady was holding out her hand  we are all very glad to see you back she said with a simplicity that yet suggested stateliness your friends insisted on coming over to welcome you and dane will not let you keep them waiting too long dinner is almost ready  witham could not remember what he answered but miss barrington smiled at him as she moved away for the flush in his face was very eloquent the man was very grateful for that greeting and what it implied it was a few minutes later when he found himself alone with dane who laughed softly as he nodded to him  you are convinced at last he said still there is a little more of the same thing to be faced and if it would relieve you i will send for alfreton who has some taste in that direction to fix that tie for you you have been five minutes over it and it evidently does not please you its the first time ive ever seen you worry about your dress  witham turned and a curious smile crept into his face as he laid a lean hand that shook a little on the toilet table  i also think its the first time these fingers wouldnt do what i wanted them you can deduce what you please from that he said  dane only nodded and when they went down together laid a kindly grasp upon his comrades arm as he led him into the great diningroom every man at silverdale was apparently there as were most of the women and witham stood still a moment very erect with shoulders square because the posture enabled him to conceal the tremor that ran through him when he saw the smiling faces turned upon him then he moved slowly down the room towards maud barrington and felt her hand rest for a second between his fingers which he feared were too responsive after that everybody seemed to speak to him and he was glad when he found himself sitting next to miss barrington at the head of the long table with her niece opposite him  he could not remember what he or the others talked about during the meal but he had a vague notion that there was now and then a silence of attention when he answered a question and that the little ladys face grew momentarily grave when as the voice sank a trifle he turned to her  i would have paid my respects to colonel barrington but dane did not consider it advisable he said  no said miss barrington he has talked a good deal about you during the last two days but he is sleeping now and we did not care to disturb him i am afraid you will find a great change in him when you see him  witham asked no more questions on that topic until later in the evening when he found a place apart from the rest by miss barringtons side he fancied this would not have happened without her connivance and she seemed graver than usual when he stood by her chair  i dont wish to pain you but i surmise that colonel barrington is scarcely well enough to be consulted about anything of importance just now he said  miss barrington made a little gesture of assent we usually pay him the compliment but i am almost afraid he will never make a decision of moment again  then said witham slowly you stand in his place and i fancy you know why i have come back to silverdale will you listen for a very few minutes while i tell you about my parents and what my upbringing has been i must return to winnipeg for a time at least tomorrow  miss barrington signed her willingness and the man spoke rapidly with a faint trace of hoarseness then he looked down on her  madam he said i have told you everything partly from respect for those who only by a grim sacrifice did what they could for me and that you may realize the difference between myself and the rest at silverdale i want to be honest now at least and i discovered not without bitterness at the time that the barriers between our castes are strong in the old country  miss barrington smiled a little have i ever made you feel it here  no said witham gravely still i am going to put your forbearance to a strenuous test i want your approval i have a question to ask your niece tonight  if i withheld it  it would hurt me said witham still i would not be astonished and i could not blame you  but it would make no difference  yes said witham gravely it would but it would not cause me to desist nothing would do that if miss barrington can overlook the past  the little whitehaired lady smiled at him then she said if it is any comfort to you you have my good wishes i do not know what mauds decision will be but that is the spirit which would have induced me to listen in times long gone by  she rose and left him and it may have been by her arranging that shortly afterwards witham found maud barrington passing through the dimlylighted hall he opened the door she moved towards a trifle and then stood facing her with it in his hand  will you wait a moment and then you may pass if you wish he said i had one great inducement for coming here tonight i wonder if you know what it is  the girl stood still and met his gaze though dim as the light was the man could see the crimson in her cheeks  yes she said very quietly  then said witham with a little smile though the fingers on the door quivered visibly i think the audacity you once mentioned must have returned to me for i am going to make a very great venture  for a moment maud barrington turned her eyes away it is the daring venture that most frequently succeeds  then she felt the mans hand on her shoulder and that he was compelling her to look up at him  it is you i came for he said quietly still for you know the wrong i have done i dare not urge you and have little to offer it is you who must give everything if you can come down from your station and be content with mine  one thing said maud barrington very softly is however necessary  that said witham was yours ever since we spent the night in the snow  the girl felt his grip upon her shoulder grow almost painful but her eyes shone softly when she lifted her head again  then she said what i can give is yoursand it seems you have already taken possession  witham drew her towards him and it may have been by miss barringtons arranging that nobody entered the hall but at last the girl glanced up at the man halfshyly as she said why did you wait so long  it was well worth while said witham still i think you know  yes said maud barrington softly now at least i can tell you i am glad you went awaybut if you had asked me i would have gone with you  it was some little time later when miss barrington came in and after a glance at witham kissed her niece then she turned to the man my brother is asking for you she said will you come up with me  witham followed her and hid his astonishment when he found colonel barrington lying in a big chair his face was haggard and pale his form seemed to have grown limp and fragile and the hand he held out trembled  lance he said i am very pleased to have you home again i hear you have done wonders in the city but you are i think the first of your family who could ever make money i have as you will see not been well lately  i am relieved to find you better than i expected sir witham said quietly still i fancy you are forgetting what i told you the night i went away  barrington nodded and then made a little impatient gesture there was something unpleasant but my memory seems to be going and my sister has forgiven you i know you did a good deal for us at silverdale and showed yourself a match for the best of them in the city that pleases me by and by you will take hold here after me  witham glanced at miss barrington who smiled somewhat sadly  i am glad you mentioned that sir because i purpose staying at silverdale now he said it leads up to what i have to ask you  barringtons perceptions seemed to grow clearer and he asked a few pertinent questions before he nodded approbation  yes he said she is a good girla very good girl and it would be a suitable match i should like somebody to send for her  maud barrington came in softly with a little glow in her eyes and a flush in her face and barrington smiled at her  my dear i am very pleased and i wish you every happiness he said once i would scarcely have trusted you to lance but he will forgive me and has shown me that i was wrong you and he will make silverdale famous and it is comforting to know now my rest is very near that you have chosen a man of your own station to follow me with all our faults and blunders blood is bound to tell  witham saw that miss barringtons eyes were a trifle misty and he felt his face grow hot but the girls fingers touched his arm and he followed when while her aunt signed approbation she led him away then when they stood outside she laid her hands upon his face and drew it down to her  you will forget it dear and he is still wrong if you had been lance courthorne i should never have done this she said  no said the man gravely i think there are many ways in which he is right but you can be content with witham the prairie farmer  maud barrington drew closer to him with a little smile in her eyes yes she said simply there never was a courthorne who could stand beside him   london ward lock  co ltd
