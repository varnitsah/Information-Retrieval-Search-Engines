sketches new and old     my watchwritten about 1870  an instructive little tale  my beautiful new watch had run eighteen months without losing or gaining and without breaking any part of its machinery or stopping  i had come to believe it infallible in its judgments about the time of day and to consider its constitution and its anatomy imperishable  but at last one night i let it run down  i grieved about it as if it were a recognized messenger and forerunner of calamity  but by and by i cheered up set the watch by guess and commanded my bodings and superstitions to depart next day i stepped into the chief jewelers to set it by the exact time and the head of the establishment took it out of my hand and proceeded to set it for me  then he said she is four minutes slowregulator wants pushing up  i tried to stop himtried to make him understand that the watch kept perfect time  but no all this human cabbage could see was that the watch was four minutes slow and the regulator must be pushed up a little and so while i danced around him in anguish and implored him to let the watch alone he calmly and cruelly did the shameful deed  my watch began to gain  it gained faster and faster day by day  within the week it sickened to a raging fever and its pulse went up to a hundred and fifty in the shade  at the end of two months it had left all the timepieces of the town far in the rear and was a fraction over thirteen days ahead of the almanac  it was away into november enjoying the snow while the october leaves were still turning  it hurried up house rent bills payable and such things in such a ruinous way that i could not abide it  i took it to the watchmaker to be regulated  he asked me if i had ever had it repaired  i said no it had never needed any repairing he looked a look of vicious happiness and eagerly pried the watch open and then put a small dicebox into his eye and peered into its machinery he said it wanted cleaning and oiling besides regulatingcome in a week  after being cleaned and oiled and regulated my watch slowed down to that degree that it ticked like a tolling bell  i began to be left by trains i failed all appointments i got to missing my dinner my watch strung out three days grace to four and let me go to protest i gradually drifted back into yesterday then day before then into last week and by and by the comprehension came upon me that all solitary and alone i was lingering along in week before last and the world was out of sight  i seemed to detect in myself a sort of sneaking fellowfeeling for the mummy in the museum and a desire to swap news with him  i went to a watchmaker again  he took the watch all to pieces while i waited and then said the barrel was swelled  he said he could reduce it in three days  after this the watch averaged well but nothing more  for half a day it would go like the very mischief and keep up such a barking and wheezing and whooping and sneezing and snorting that i could not hear myself think for the disturbance and as long as it held out there was not a watch in the land that stood any chance against it  but the rest of the day it would keep on slowing down and fooling along until all the clocks it had left behind caught up again  so at last at the end of twentyfour hours it would trot up to the judges stand all right and just in time  it would show a fair and square average and no man could say it had done more or less than its duty  but a correct average is only a mild virtue in a watch and i took this instrument to another watchmaker  he said the kingbolt was broken  i said i was glad it was nothing more serious  to tell the plain truth i had no idea what the kingbolt was but i did not choose to appear ignorant to a stranger he repaired the kingbolt but what the watch gained in one way it lost in another  it would run awhile and then stop awhile and then run awhile again and so on using its own discretion about the intervals and every time it went off it kicked back like a musket  i padded my breast for a few days but finally took the watch to another watchmaker he picked it all to pieces and turned the ruin over and over under his glass and then he said there appeared to be something the matter with the hairtrigger  he fixed it and gave it a fresh start  it did well now except that always at ten minutes to ten the hands would shut together like a pair of scissors and from that time forth they would travel together  the oldest man in the world could not make head or tail of the time of day by such a watch and so i went again to have the thing repaired  this person said that the crystal had got bent and that the mainspring was not straight  he also remarked that part of the works needed halfsoling  he made these things all right and then my timepiece performed unexceptionably save that now and then after working along quietly for nearly eight hours everything inside would let go all of a sudden and begin to buzz like a bee and the hands would straightway begin to spin round and round so fast that their individuality was lost completely and they simply seemed a delicate spiders web over the face of the watch  she would reel off the next twentyfour hours in six or seven minutes and then stop with a bang i went with a heavy heart to one more watchmaker and looked on while he took her to pieces  then i prepared to crossquestion him rigidly for this thing was getting serious  the watch had cost two hundred dollars originally and i seemed to have paid out two or three thousand for repairs  while i waited and looked on i presently recognized in this watchmaker an old acquaintancea steamboat engineer of other days and not a good engineer either  he examined all the parts carefully just as the other watchmakers had done and then delivered his verdict with the same confidence of manner  he said  she makes too much steamyou want to hang the monkeywrench on the safetyvalve  i brained him on the spot and had him buried at my own expense  my uncle william now deceased alas used to say that a good horse was a good horse until it had run away once and that a good watch was a good watch until the repairers got a chance at it  and he used to wonder what became of all the unsuccessful tinkers and gunsmiths and shoemakers and engineers and blacksmiths but nobody could ever tell him       political economy       political economy is the basis of all good government  the wisest      men of all ages have brought to bear upon this subject the  here i was interrupted and informed that a stranger wished to see me down at the door  i went and confronted him and asked to know his business struggling all the time to keep a tight rein on my seething politicaleconomy ideas and not let them break away from me or get tangled in their harness  and privately i wished the stranger was in the bottom of the canal with a cargo of wheat on top of him  i was all in a fever but he was cool  he said he was sorry to disturb me but as he was passing he noticed that i needed some lightningrods  i said yes yesgo onwhat about it  he said there was nothing about it in particularnothing except that he would like to put them up for me i am new to housekeeping have been used to hotels and boardinghouses all my life  like anybody else of similar experience i try to appear to strangers to be an old housekeeper consequently i said in an offhand way that i had been intending for some time to have six or eight lightningrods put up butthe stranger started and looked inquiringly at me but i was serene  i thought that if i chanced to make any mistakes he would not catch me by my countenance  he said he would rather have my custom than any mans in town  i said all right and started off to wrestle with my great subject again when he called me back and said it would be necessary to know exactly how many points i wanted put up what parts of the house i wanted them on and what quality of rod i preferred  it was close quarters for a man not used to the exigencies of housekeeping but i went through creditably and he probably never suspected that i was a novice  i told him to put up eight points and put them all on the roof and use the best quality of rod he said he could furnish the plain article at 20 cents a foot coppered 25 cents zincplated spiraltwist at 30 cents that would stop a streak of lightning any time no matter where it was bound and render its errand harmless and its further progress apocryphal  i said apocryphal was no slouch of a word emanating from the source it did but philology aside i liked the spiraltwist and would take that brand then he said he could make two hundred and fifty feet answer but to do it right and make the best job in town of it and attract the admiration of the just and the unjust alike and compel all parties to say they never saw a more symmetrical and hypothetical display of lightningrods since they were born he supposed he really couldnt get along without four hundred though he was not vindictive and trusted he was willing to try  i said go ahead and use four hundred and make any kind of a job he pleased out of it but let me get back to my work  so i got rid of him at last and now after half an hour spent in getting my train of politicaleconomy thoughts coupled together again i am ready to go on once more       richest treasures of their genius their experience of life and      their learning  the great lights of commercial jurisprudence      international confraternity and biological deviation of all ages      all civilizations and all nationalities from zoroaster down to      horace greeley have  here i was interrupted again and required to go down and confer further with that lightningrod man  i hurried off boiling and surging with prodigious thoughts wombed in words of such majesty that each one of them was in itself a straggling procession of syllables that might be fifteen minutes passing a given point and once more i confronted himhe so calm and sweet i so hot and frenzied  he was standing in the contemplative attitude of the colossus of rhodes with one foot on my infant tuberose and the other among my pansies his hands on his hips his hatbrim tilted forward one eye shut and the other gazing critically and admiringly in the direction of my principal chimney  he said now there was a state of things to make a man glad to be alive and added i leave it to you if you ever saw anything more deliriously picturesque than eight lightningrods on one chimney  i said i had no present recollection of anything that transcended it  he said that in his opinion nothing on earth but niagara falls was superior to it in the way of natural scenery  all that was needed now he verily believed to make my house a perfect balm to the eye was to kind of touch up the other chimneys a little and thus add to the generous coup doeil a soothing uniformity of achievement which would allay the excitement naturally consequent upon the coup detat  i asked him if he learned to talk out of a book and if i could borrow it anywhere  he smiled pleasantly and said that his manner of speaking was not taught in books and thatnothing but familiarity with lightning could enable a man to handle his conversational style with impunity  he then figured up an estimate and said that about eight more rods scattered about my roof would about fix me right and he guessed five hundred feet of stuff would do it and added that the first eight had got a little the start of him so to speak and used up a mere trifle of material more than he had calculated ona hundred feet or along there  i said i was in a dreadful hurry and i wished we could get this business permanently mapped out so that i could go on with my work  he said i could have put up those eight rods and marched off about my businesssome men would have done it but no i said to myself this man is a stranger to me and i will die before ill wrong him there aint lightningrods enough on that house and for one ill never stir out of my tracks till ive done as i would be done by and told him so  stranger my duty is accomplished if the recalcitrant and dephlogistic messenger of heaven strikes your there now there i said put on the other eightadd five hundred feet of spiraltwistdo anything and everything you want to do but calm your sufferings and try to keep your feelings where you can reach them with the dictionary  meanwhile if we understand each other now i will go to work again  i think i have been sitting here a full hour this time trying to get back to where i was when my train of thought was broken up by the lastinterruption but i believe i have accomplished it at last and may venture to proceed again       wrestled with this great subject and the greatest among them have      found it a worthy adversary and one that always comes up fresh and      smiling after every throw  the great confucius said that he would      rather be a profound political economist than chief of police      cicero frequently said that political economy was the grandest      consummation that the human mind was capable of consuming and even      our own greeley had said vaguely but forcibly that political  here the lightningrod man sent up another call for me  i went down in a state of mind bordering on impatience  he said he would rather have died than interrupt me but when he was employed to do a job and that job was expected to be done in a clean workmanlike manner and when it was finished and fatigue urged him to seek the rest and recreation he stood so much in need of and he was about to do it but looked up and saw at a glance that all the calculations had been a little out and if a thunderstorm were to come up and that house which he felt a personal interest in stood there with nothing on earth to protect it but sixteen lightningrodslet us have peace i shrieked  put up a hundred and fifty  put some on the kitchen  put a dozen on the barn  put a couple on the cow  put one on the cookscatter them all over the persecuted place till it looks like a zincplated spiraltwisted silvermounted canebrake  move  use up all the material you can get your hands on and when you run out of lightningrods put up ramrods camrods stairrods pistonrodsanything that will pander to your dismal appetite for artificial scenery and bring respite to my raging brain and healing to my lacerated soul  wholly unmovedfurther than to smile sweetlythis iron being simply turned back his wristbands daintily and said he would now proceed to hump himself  well all that was nearly three hours ago it is questionable whether i am calm enough yet to write on the noble theme of political economy but i cannot resist the desire to try for it is the one subject that is nearest to my heart and dearest to my brain of all this worlds philosophy       economy is heavens best boon to man  when the loose but gifted      byron lay in his venetian exile he observed that if it could be      granted him to go back and live his misspent life over again he      would give his lucid and unintoxicated intervals to the composition      not of frivolous rhymes but of essays upon political economy      washington loved this exquisite science such names as baker      beckwith judson smith are imperishably linked with it and even      imperial homer in the ninth book of the iliad has said                      fiat justitia ruat coelum                     post mortem unum ante bellum                     hic jacet hoc exparte res                     politicum economico est       the grandeur of these conceptions of the old poet together with the      felicity of the wording which clothes them and the sublimity of the      imagery whereby they are illustrated have singled out that stanza      and made it more celebrated than any that ever  now not a word out of younot a single word  just state your bill and relapse into impenetrable silence for ever and ever on these premises  nine hundred dollars  is that all  this check for the amount will be honored at any respectable bank in america  what is that multitude of people gathered in the street for  howlooking at the lightningrods  bless my life did they never see any lightningrods before  never saw such a stack of them on one establishment did i understand you to say  i will step down and critically observe this popular ebullition of ignorance  three days laterwe are all about worn out  for fourandtwenty hours our bristling premises were the talk and wonder of the town  the theaters languished for their happiest scenic inventions were tame and commonplace compared with my lightningrods  our street was blocked night and day with spectators and among them were many who came from the country to see  it was a blessed relief on the second day when a thunderstorm came up and the lightning began to go for my house as the historian josephus quaintly phrases it  it cleared the galleries so to speak  in five minutes there was not a spectator within half a mile of my place but all the high houses about that distance away were full windows roof and all  and well they might be for all the falling stars and fourthofjuly fireworks of a generation put together and rained down simultaneously out of heaven in one brilliant shower upon one helpless roof would not have any advantage of the pyrotechnic display that was making my house so magnificently conspicuous in the general gloom of the storm  by actual count the lightning struck at my establishment seven hundred and sixtyfour times in forty minutes but tripped on one of those faithful rods every time and slid down the spiraltwist and shot into the earth before it probably had time to be surprised at the way the thing was done and through all that bombardment only one patch of slates was ripped up and that was because for a single instant the rods in the vicinity were transporting all the lightning they could possibly accommodate  well nothing was ever seen like it since the world began for one whole day and night not a member of my family stuck his head out of the window but he got the hair snatched off it as smooth as a billiardball and if the reader will believe me not one of us ever dreamt of stirring abroad  but at last the awful siege came to an endbecause there was absolutely no more electricity left in the clouds above us within grappling distance of my insatiable rods  then i sallied forth and gathered daring workmen together and not a bite or a nap did we take till the premises were utterly stripped of all their terrific armament except just three rods on the house one on the kitchen and one on the barnand behold these remain there even unto this day  and then and not till then the people ventured to use our street again i will remark here in passing that during that fearful time i did not continue my essay upon political economy  i am not even yet settled enough in nerve and brain to resume it  to whom it may concernparties having need of three thousand two hundred and eleven feet of best quality zincplated spiraltwist lightningrod stuff and sixteen hundred and thirtyone silvertipped points all in tolerable repair and although much worn by use still equal to any ordinary emergency can hear of a bargain by addressing the publisher       the jumping frog written about 1865  in english  then in french  then clawed back into a civilized language once more by patient unremunerated toil  even a criminal is entitled to fair play and certainly when a man who has done no harm has been unjustly treated he is privileged to do his best to right himself  my attention has just been called to an article some three years old in a french magazine entitled revue des deux mondes review of some two worlds wherein the writer treats of les humoristes americaines these humorists americans  i am one of these humorists american dissected by him and hence the complaint i am making  this gentlemans article is an able one as articles go in the french where they always tangle up everything to that degree that when you start into a sentence you never know whether you are going to come out alive or not  it is a very good article and the writer says all manner of kind and complimentary things about mefor which i am sure i thank him with all my heart but then why should he go and spoil all his praise by one unlucky experiment  what i refer to is this he says my jumping frog is a funny story but still he cant see why it should ever really convulse any one with laughterand straightway proceeds to translate it into french in order to prove to his nation that there is nothing so very extravagantly funny about it  just there is where my complaint originates  he has not translated it at all he has simply mixed it all up it is no more like the jumping frog when he gets through with it than i am like a meridian of longitude  but my mere assertion is not proof wherefore i print the french version that all may see that i do not speak falsely furthermore in order that even the unlettered may know my injury and give me their compassion i have been at infinite pains and trouble to retranslate this french version back into english and to tell the truth i have wellnigh worn myself out at it having scarcely rested from my work during five days and nights  i cannot speak the french language but i can translate very well though not fast i being selfeducated  i ask the reader to run his eye over the original english version of the jumping frog and then read the french or my retranslation and kindly take notice how the frenchman has riddled the grammar  i think it is the worst i ever saw and yet the french are called a polished nation  if i had a boy that put sentences together as they do i would polish him to some purpose  without further introduction the jumping frog as i originally wrote it was as follows after it will be found the french version and after the latter my retranslation from the french     the notorious jumping frog of calaveras county pronounced calevaras  in compliance with the request of a friend of mine who wrote me from the east i called on goodnatured garrulous old simon wheeler and inquired after my friends friend leonidas w smiley as requested to do and i hereunto append the result  i have a lurking suspicion that leonidas w smiley is a myth that my friend never knew such a personage and that he only conjectured that if i asked old wheeler about him it would remind him of his infamous jim smiley and he would go to work and bore me to death with some exasperating reminiscence of him as long and as tedious as it should be useless to me  if that was the design it succeeded  i found simon wheeler dozing comfortably by the barroom stove of the dilapidated tavern in the decayed mining camp of angels and i noticed that he was fat and baldheaded and had an expression of winning gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance  he roused up and gave me good day  i told him that a friend of mine had commissioned me to make some inquiries about a cherished companion of his boyhood named leonidas w smileyrev leonidas w smiley a young minister of the gospel who he had heard was at one time resident of angels camp  i added that if mr wheeler could tell me anything about this rev leonidas w smiley i would feel under many obligations to him  simon wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his chair and then sat down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which follows this paragraph  he never smiled he never frowned he never changed his voice from the gentle flowing key to which he tuned his initial sentence he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm but all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein of impressive earnestness and sincerity which showed me plainly that so far from his imagining that there was anything ridiculous or funny about his story he regarded it as a really important matter and admired its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in finesse  i let him go on in his own way and never interrupted him once  rev leonidas w  hm reverend lewell there was a feller here once by the name of jim smiley in the winter of 49or maybe it was the spring of 50i dont recollect exactly somehow though what makes me think it was one or the other is because i remember the big flume warnt finished when he first come to the camp but anyway he was the curiousest man about always betting on anything that turned up you ever see if he could get anybody to bet on the other side and if he couldnt hed change sides  any way that suited the other man would suit himany way just sos he got a bet he was satisfied  but still he was lucky uncommon lucky he most always come out winner  he was always ready and laying for a chance there couldnt be no solitry thing mentioned but that fellerd offer to bet on it and take ary side you please as i was just telling you  if there was a horserace youd find him flush or youd find him busted at the end of it if there was a dogfight hed bet on it if there was a catfight hed bet on it if there was a chickenfight hed bet on it why if there was two birds setting on a fence he would bet you which one would fly first or if there was a campmeeting he would be there reglar to bet on parson walker which he judged to be the best exhorter about here and so he was too and a good man  if he even see a straddlebug start to go anywheres he would bet you how long it would take him to get toto wherever he was going to and if you took him up he would foller that straddlebug to mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for and how long he was on the road  lots of the boys here has seen that smiley and can tell you about him  why it never made no difference to himhed bet on any thingthe dangdest feller  parson walkers wife laid very sick once for a good while and it seemed as if they warnt going to save her but one morning he come in and smiley up and asked him how she was and he said she was considerable betterthank the lord for his infnite mercyand coming on so smart that with the blessing of provdence shed get well yet and smiley before he thought says well ill resk twoandahalf she dont anyway  thishyer smiley had a marethe boys called her the fifteenminute nag but that was only in fun you know because of course she was faster than thatand he used to win money on that horse for all she was so slow and always had the asthma or the distemper or the consumption or something of that kind  they used to give her two or three hundred yards start and then pass her under way but always at the fag end of the race she get excited and desperate like and come cavorting and straddling up and scattering her legs around limber sometimes in the air and sometimes out to one side among the fences and kicking up more dust and raising more racket with her coughing and sneezing and blowing her noseand always fetch up at the stand just about a neck ahead as near as you could cipher it down  and he had a little small bullpup that to look at him youd think he warnt worth a cent but to set around and look ornery and lay for a chance to steal something  but as soon as money was up on him he was a different dog his underjawd begin to stick out like the focastle of a steamboat and his teeth would uncover and shine like the furnaces and a dog might tackle him and bullyrag him and bite him and throw him over his shoulder two or three times and andrew jacksonwhich was the name of the pupandrew jackson would never let on but what he was satisfied and hadnt expected nothing elseand the bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time till the money was all up and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the jint of his hind leg and freeze to itnot chaw you understand but only just grip and hang on till they throwed up the sponge if it was a year smiley always come out winner on that pup till he harnessed a dog once that didnt have no hind legs because theyd been sawed off in a circular saw and when the thing had gone along far enough and the money was all up and he come to make a snatch for his pet holt he see in a minute how hed been imposed on and how the other dog had him in the door so to speak and he peared surprised and then he looked sorter discouragedlike and didnt try no more to win the fight and so he got shucked out bad  he give smiley a look as much as to say his heart was broke and it was his fault for putting up a dog that hadnt no hind legs for him to take holt of which was his main dependence in a fight and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died  it was a good pup was that andrew jackson and would have made a name for hisself if hed lived for the stuff was in him and he had geniusi know it because he hadnt no opportunities to speak of and it dont stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as he could under them circumstances if he hadnt no talent it always makes me feel sorry when i think of that last fight of hisn and the way it turned out  well thishyer smiley had rattarriers and chicken cocks and tomcats and all them kind of things till you couldnt rest and you couldnt fetch nothing for him to bet on but hed match you  he ketched a frog one day and took him home and said he callated to educate him and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn that frog to jump and you bet you he did learn him too hed give him a little punch behind and the next minute youd see that frog whirling in the air like a doughnutsee him turn one summerset or maybe a couple if he got a good start and come down flatfooted and all right like a cat he got him up so in the matter of ketching flies and kep him in practice so constant that hed nail a fly every time as fur as he could see him smiley said all a frog wanted was education and he could do most anythingand i believe him  why ive seen him set danl webster down here on this floordanl webster was the name of the frogand sing out flies danl flies and quickern you could wink hed spring straight up and snake a fly offn the counter there and flop down on the floor agin as solid as a gob of mud and fall to scratching the side of his head with his hind foot as indifferent as if he hadnt no idea hed been doin any moren any frog might do you never see a frog so modest and straightforard as he was for all he was so gifted  and when it come to fair and square jumping on a dead level he could get over more ground at one straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see jumping on a dead level was his strong suit you understand and when it come to that smiley would ante up money on him as long as he had a red smiley was monstrous proud of his frog and well he might be for fellers that had traveled and been everywheres all said he laid over any frog that ever they see  well smiley kep the beast in a little lattice box and he used to fetch him downtown sometimes and lay for a bet  one day a feller a stranger in the camp he wascome acrost him with his box and says  what might it be that youve got in the box  and smiley says sorter indifferentlike it might be a parrot or it might be a canary maybe but it aintits only just a frog  and the feller took it and looked at it careful and turned it round this way and that and says hmso tis  well whats he good for  well smiley says easy and careless hes good enough for one thing i should judgehe can outjump any frog in calaveras county  the feller took the box again and took another long particular look and give it back to smiley and says very deliberate  well he says i dont see no pints about that frog thats any bettern any other frog  maybe you dont smiley says  maybe you understand frogs and maybe you dont understand em maybe youve had experience and maybe you aint only a amature as it were  anyways ive got my opinion and ill resk forty dollars the he can outjump any frog in calaveras county  and the feller studied a minute and then says kinder sadlike well im only a stranger here and i aint got no frog but if i had a frog id bet you  and then smiley says thats all rightthats all right if youll hold my box a minute ill go and get you a frog  and so the feller took the box and put up his forty dollars along with smileys and set down to wait  so he set there a good while thinking and thinking to himself and then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon and filled him full of quailshotfilled him pretty near up to his chinand set him on the floor  smiley he went to the swamp and slopped around in the mud for a long time and finally he ketched a frog and fetched him in and give him to this feller and says  now if youre ready set him alongside of danl with his fore paws just even with danls and ill give the word then he says onetwothreegit and him and the feller touches up the frogs from behind and the new frog hopped off lively but danl give a heave and hysted up his shoulderssolike a frenchman but it warnt no usehe couldnt budge he was planted as solid as a church and he couldnt no more stir than if he was anchored out  smiley was a good deal surprised and he was disgusted too but he didnt have no idea what the matter was of course   the feller took the money and started away and when he was going out at the door he sorter jerked his thumb over his shouldersoat danl and says again very deliberate well he says i dont see no pints about that frog thats any bettern any other frog  smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at danl a long time and at last he says i do wonder what in the nation that frog throwd off fori wonder if there aint something the matter with him he pears to look mighty baggy somehow  and he ketched danl by the nap of the neck and hefted him and says why blame my cats if he dont weigh five pound and turned him upside down and he belched out a double handful of shot  and then he see how it was and he was the maddest man he set the frog down and took out after that feller but he never ketched him  and  here simon wheeler heard his name called from the front yard and got up to see what was wanted  and turning to me as he moved away he said just set where you are stranger and rest easyi aint going to be gone a second  but by your leave i did not think that a continuation of the history of the enterprising vagabond jim smiley would be likely to afford me much information concerning the rev leonidas w smiley and so i started away  at the door i met the sociable wheeler returning and he buttonholed me and recommenced  well thishyer smiley had a yaller oneeyed cow that didnt have no tail only just a short stump like a bannanner and  however lacking both time and inclination i did not wait to hear about the afflicted cow but took my leave   now let the learned look upon this picture and say if iconoclasm can further go  from the revue des deux mondes of july 15th 1872               la grenouille sauteuse du comte de calaveras  il y avait une fois ici un individu connu sous le nom de jim smiley cétait dans lhiver de 49 peutêtre bien au printemps de 50 je ne me reappelle pas exactement  ce qui me fait croire que cétait lun ou lautre cest que je me souviens que le grand bief nétait pas achevé lorsquil arriva au camp pour la premiére fois mais de toutes facons il était lhomme le plus friand de paris qui se pût voir pariant sur tout ce qui se présentait quand il pouvait trouver un adversaire et quand nen trouvait pas il passait du côté opposé  tout ce qui convenait à lautre lui convenait pourvu quil eût un pari smiley était satisfait et il avait une chance une chance inouie  presque toujours il gagnait it faut dire quil était toujours prêt à sexposer quon ne pouvait mentionner la moindre chose sans que ce gaillard offrît de parier làdessus nimporte quoi et de prendre le côte que lon voudrait comme je vous le disais tout à lheure  sil y avait des courses vous le trouviez riche ou ruiné à la fin sil y avait un combat de chiens il apportait son enjeu il lapportait pour un combat de chats pour un combat de coqsparbleu si vous aviez vu deux oiseaux sur une haie il vous aurait offert de parier lequel senvolerait le premier et sil y aviat meeting au camp il venait parier régulièrement pour le curé walker quil jugeait être le meilleur prédicateur des environs et qui létait en effet et un brave homme  il aurait rencontré une punaise de bois en chemin quil aurait parié sur le temps quil lui faudrait pour aller où elle voudrait aller et si vous laviez pris au mot it aurait suivi la punaise jusquau mexique sans se soucier daller si loin ni du temps quil y perdrait  une fois la femme du curé walker fut très malade pendant longtemps il semblait quon ne la sauverait pas mais un matin le curé arrive et smiley lui demande comment ella va et il dit quelle est bien mieux grâce a linfinie miséricorde tellement mieux quavec la bénédiction de la providence elle sen tirerait et voilá que sans y penser smiley répondeh bien je gage deux et demi quelle mourra tout de même  ce smiley avait une jument que les gars appelaient le bidet du quart dheure mais seulement pour plaisanter vous comprenez parce que bien entendu elle était plus vite que ca  et il avait coutume de gagner de largent avec cette bête quoiquelle fût poussive cornarde toujours prise dasthme de coliques ou de consomption ou de quelque chose dapprochant on lui donnait 2 ou 300 yards au départ puis on la dépassait sans peine mais jamais à la fin elle ne manquait de séchauffer de sexaspérer et elle arrivait sécartant se défendant ses jambes grêles en lair devant les obstacles quelquefois les évitant et faisant avec cela plus de poussière quaucun cheval plus de bruit surtout avec ses éternumens et reniflemenscrac elle arrivait donc toujours première dune tête aussi juste quon peut le mesurer  et il avait un petit bouledogue qui à le voir ne valait pas un sou on aurait cru que parier contre lui cétait voler tant il était ordinaire mais aussitôt les enjeux faits il devenait un autre chien  sa mâchoire inférieure commencait à ressortir comme un gaillard davant ses dents se découvcraient brillantes commes des fournaises et un chien pouvait le taquiner lexciter le mordre le jeter deux ou trois fois pardessus son épaule andré jackson cétait le nom du chien andré jackson prenait cela tranquillement comme sil ne se fût jamais attendu à autre chose et quand les paris étaient doublés et redoublés contre lui il vous saisissait lautre chien juste à larticulation de la jambe de derrière et il ne la lâchait plus non pas quil la mâchât vous concevez mais il sy serait tenu pendu jusquà ce quon jetât léponge en lair fallûtil attendre un an  smiley gagnait toujours avec cette bêtelà malheureusement ils ont fini par dresser un chien qui navait pas de pattes de derrière parce quon les avait sciées et quand les choses furent au point quil voulait et quil en vint à se jeter sur son morceau favori le pauvre chien comprit en un instant quon sétait moqué de lui et que lautre le tenait  vous navez jamais vu personne avoir lair plus penaud et plus découragé il ne fit aucun effort pour gagner le combat et fut rudement secoué de sorte que regardant smiley comme pour lui diremon coeur est brisé cest ta faute pourquoi mavoir livré à un chien qui na pas de pattes de derrière puisque cest par là que je les batsil sen alla en clopinant et se coucha pour mourir ah cétait un bon chien cet andré jackson et il se serait fait un nom sil avait vécu car il y avait de letoffe en lui il avait du génie je la sais bien que de grandes occasions lui aient manqué mais il est impossible de supposer quun chien capable de se battre comme lui certaines circonstances étant données ait manqué de talent  je me sens triste toutes les fois que je pense à son dernier combat et au dénoûment quil a eu  eh bien ce smiley nourrissait des terriers à rats et des coqs combat et des chats et toute sorte de choses au point quil était toujours en mesure de vous tenir tête et quavec sa rage de paris on navait plus de repos il attrapa un jour une grenouille et lemporta chez lui disant quil prétendait faire son éducation vous me croirez si vous voulez mais pendant trois mois il na rien fait que lui apprendre à sauter dans une cour retirée de sa maison et je vous réponds quil avait reussi  il lui donnait un petit coup par derrière et linstant daprès vous voyiez la grenouille tourner en lair comme un beignet audessus de la poêle faire une culbute quelquefois deux lorsquelle était bien partie et retomber sur ses pattes comme un chat  il lavait dressée dans lart de gober des mouches er ly exercait continuellement si bien quune mouche du plus loin quelle apparaissait était une mouche perdue smiley avait coutume de dire que tout ce qui manquait à une grenouille cétait léducation quavec léducation elle pouvait faire presque tout et je le crois  tenez je lai vu poser daniel webster là sur se plancherdaniel webster était le nom de la grenouilleet lui chanter des mouches daniel des mouchesen un clin doeil daniel avait bondi et saisi une mouche ici sur le comptoir puis sauté de nouveau par terre où il restait vraiment à se gratter la tête avec sa patte de derrière comme sil navait pas eu la moindre idée de sa superiorité  jamais vous navez grenouille vu de aussi modeste aussi naturelle douee comme elle létait  et quand il sagissait de sauter purement et simplement sur terrain plat elle faisait plus de chemin en un saut quaucune bete de son espèce que vous puissiez connaître sauter à plat cétait son fort quand il sagissait de cela smiley entassait les enjeux sur elle tant quil lui restait un rouge liard il faut le reconnaitre smiley était monstrueusement fier de sa grenouille et il en avait le droit car des gens qui avaient voyagé qui avaient tout vu disaient quon lui ferait injure de la comparer à une autre de facon que smiley gardait daniel dans une petite boîte a clairevoie quil emportait parfois à la ville pour quelque pari  un jour un individu étranger au camp larrête aver sa boîte et lui ditquestce que vous avez donc serré là dedans  smiley dit dun air indifférentcela pourrait être un perroquet ou un serin mais ce nest rien de pareil ce nest quune grenouille  lindividu la prend la regarde avec soin la tourne dun côté et de lautre puis il dittiens en effet  a quoi estelle bonne  mon dieu répond smiley toujours dun air dégagé elle est bonne pour une chose à mon avis elle peut battre en sautant toute grenouille du comté de calaveras  lindividu reprend la boîte lexamine de nouveau longuement et la rend à smiley en disant dun air délibéréeh bien je ne vois pas que cette grenouille ait rien de mieux quaucune grenouille  possible que vous ne le voyiez pas dit smiley possible que vous vous entendiez en grenouilles possible que vous ne vous y entendez point possible que vous avez de lexpérience et possible que vous ne soyez quun amateur  de toute manière je parie quarante dollars quelle battra en sautant nimporte quelle grenouille du comté de calaveras  lindividu réfléchit une seconde et dit comme attristéje ne suis quun étranger ici je nai pas de grenouille mais si jen avais une je tiendrais le pari  fort bien répond smiley  rien de plus facile si vous voulez tenir ma boîte une minute jirai vous chercher une grenouillevoilà donc lindividu qui garde la boîte qui met ses quarante dollars sur ceux de smiley et qui attend  il attend assez longtemps réflechissant tout seul et figurezvous quil prend daniel lui ouvre la bouche de force at avec une cuiller à thé lemplit de menu plomb de chasse mais lemplit jusquau menton puis il le pose par terre  smiley pendant ce temps était à barboter dans une mare  finalement il attrape une grenouille lapporte à cet individu et ditmaintenant si vous êtes prêt mettezla tout contra daniel avec leurs pattes de devant sur la même ligne et je donnerai le signal puis il ajouteun deux trois sautez  lui et lindividu touchent leurs grenouilles par derrière et la grenouille neuve se met à sautiller mais daniel se soulève lourdement hausse les épaules ainsi comme un francais à quoi bon il ne pouvait bouger il était planté solide comma une enclume il navancait pas plus que si on leût mis à lancre smiley fut surpris et dégoûté mais il ne se doutait pas du tour bien entendu  lindividu empoche largent sen va et en sen allant estce quil ne donna pas un coup de pouce pardessus lépaule comma ca au pauvre daniel en disant de son air délibéréeh bien je ne vois pas qua cette grenouille ait rien de muiex quune autre  smiley se gratta longtemps la tête les yeux fixés sur daniel jusquà ce quenfin il ditje me demande comment diable il se fait que cette bête ait refusé    estce quelle aurait quelque chose    on croirait quelle est enfleé  il empoigne daniel par la peau du cou le souléve et ditle loup me croque sil ne pèse pas cinq livres  il le retourne et le malheureux crache deux poignées de plomb  quand smiley reconnut ce qui en était il fut comme fou  vous le voyez dici poser sa grenouille par terra et courir aprés cet individu mais il ne le rattrapa jamais et    translation of the above back from the french  the frog jumping of the county of calaveras  it there was one time here an individual known under the name of jim smiley it was in the winter of 89 possibly well at the spring of 50 i no me recollect not exactly  this which me makes to believe that it was the one or the other it is that i shall remember that the grand flume is not achieved when he arrives at the camp for the first time but of all sides he was the man the most fond of to bet which one have seen betting upon all that which is presented when he could find an adversary and when he not of it could not he passed to the side opposed  all that which convenienced to the other to him convenienced also seeing that he had a bet smiley was satisfied  and he had a chance a chance even worthless nearly always he gained  it must to say that he was always near to himself expose but one no could mention the least thing without that this gaillard offered to bet the bottom no matter what and to take the side that one him would as i you it said all at the hour tout à lheure  if it there was of races you him find rich or ruined at the end if it there is a combat of dogs he bring his bet he himself laid always for a combat of cats for a combat of cocks byblue  if you have see two birds upon a fence he you should have offered of to bet which of those birds shall fly the first and if there is meeting at the camp meeting au camp he comes to bet regularly for the curé walker which he judged to be the best predicator of the neighborhood prédicateur des environs and which he was in effect and a brave man  he would encounter a bug of wood in the road whom he will bet upon the time which he shall take to go where she would goand if you him have take at the word he will follow the bug as far as mexique without himself caring to go so far neither of the time which he there lost  one time the woman of the cure walker is very sick during long time it seemed that one not her saved not but one morning the cure arrives and smiley him demanded how she goes and he said that she is well better grace to the infinite misery lui demande comment elle va et il dit quelle est bien mieux grâce a linfinie miséricorde so much better that with the benediction of the providence she herself of it would pull out elle sen tirerait and behold that without there thinking smiley responds well i gage twoandhalf that she will die all of same  this smiley had an animal which the boys called the nag of the quarter of hour but solely for pleasantry you comprehend because well understand she was more fast as that now why that exclamationm t and it was custom of to gain of the silver with this beast notwithstanding she was poussive cornarde always taken of asthma of colics or of consumption or something of approaching  one him would give two or three hundred yards at the departure then one him passed without pain but never at the last she not fail of herself échauffer of herself exasperate and she arrives herself écartant se defendant her legs greles in the air before the obstacles sometimes them elevating and making with this more of dust than any horse more of noise above with his eternumens and reniflemenscrac she arrives then always first by one head as just as one can it measure  and he had a small bulldog bouledogue who to him see no value not a cent one would believe that to bet against him it was to steal so much he was ordinary but as soon as the game made she becomes another dog  her jaw inferior commence to project like a deck of before his teeth themselves discover brilliant like some furnaces and a dog could him tackle le taquiner him excite him murder le mordre him throw two or three times over his shoulder andré jacksonthis was the name of the dogandré jackson takes that tranquilly as if he not himself was never expecting other thing and when the bets were doubled and redoubled against him he you seize the other dog just at the articulation of the leg of behind and he not it leave more not that he it masticate you conceive but he himself there shall be holding during until that one throws the sponge in the air must he wait a year  smiley gained always with this beastlà unhappily they have finished by elevating a dog who no had not of feet of behind because one them had sawed and when things were at the point that he would and that he came to himself throw upon his morsel favorite the poor dog comprehended in an instant that he himself was deceived in him and that the other dog him had  you no have never seen person having the air more penaud and more discouraged he not made no effort to gain the combat and was rudely shucked  eh bien this smiley nourished some terriers à rats and some cocks of combat and some cats and all sorts of things and with his rage of betting one no had more of repose  he trapped one day a frog and him imported with him et lemporta chez lui saying that he pretended to make his education  you me believe if you will but during three months he not has nothing done but to him apprehend to jump apprendre à sauter in a court retired of her mansion de sa maison  and i you respond that he have succeeded  he him gives a small blow by behind and the instant after you shall see the frog turn in the air like a greasebiscuit make one summersault sometimes two when she was well started and refall upon his feet like a cat  he him had accomplished in the art of to gobble the flies gober des mouches and him there exercised continually so well that a fly at the most far that she appeared was a fly lost smiley had custom to say that all which lacked to a frog it was the education but with the education she could do nearly alland i him believe  tenez i him have seen pose daniel webster there upon this plankdaniel webster was the name of the frogand to him sing some flies daniel some fliesin a flash of the eye daniel had bounded and seized a fly here upon the counter then jumped anew at the earth where he rested truly to himself scratch the head with his behind foot as if he no had not the least idea of his superiority never you not have seen frog as modest as natural sweet as she was and when he himself agitated to jump purely and simply upon plain earth she does more ground in one jump than any beast of his species than you can know  to jump plainthis was his strong  when he himself agitated for that smiley multiplied the bets upon her as long as there to him remained a red  it must to know smiley was monstrously proud of his frog and he of it was right for some men who were traveled who had all seen said that they to him would be injurious to him compare to another frog  smiley guarded daniel in a little box latticed which he carried bytimes to the village for some bet  one day an individual stranger at the camp him arrested with his box and him said  what is this that you have them shut up there within  smiley said with an air indifferent  that could be a paroquet or a syringe ou un serin but this no is nothing of such it not is but a frog  the individual it took it regarded with care it turned from one side and from the other then he said  tiens in effectat what is she good  my god respond smiley always with an air disengaged she is good for one thing to my notice à mon avis she can batter in jumping elle peut battre en sautant all frogs of the county of calaveras  the individual retook the box it examined of new longly and it rendered to smiley in saying with an air deliberate  eh bien i no saw not that that frog had nothing of better than each frog  je ne vois pas que cette grenouille ait rien de mieux quaucune grenouille if that isnt grammar gone to seed then i count myself no judgem  t  possible that you not it saw not said smiley possible that youyou comprehend frogs possible that you not you there comprehend nothing possible that you had of the experience and possible that you not be but an amateur  of all manner de toute manière i bet forty dollars that she batter in jumping no matter which frog of the county of calaveras  the individual reflected a second and said like sad  i not am but a stranger here i no have not a frog but if i of it had one i would embrace the bet  strong well respond smiley nothing of more facility  if you will hold my box a minute i go you to search a frog jirai vous chercher  behold then the individual who guards the box who puts his forty dollars upon those of smiley and who attends et qui attend  he attended enough long times reflecting all solely  and figure you that he takes daniel him opens the mouth by force and with a teaspoon him fills with shot of the hunt even him fills just to the chin then he him puts by the earth  smiley during these times was at slopping in a swamp finally he trapped attrape a frog him carried to that individual and said  now if you be ready put him all against daniel with their before feet upon the same line and i give the signalthen he added one two threeadvance  him and the individual touched their frogs by behind and the frog new put to jump smartly but daniel himself lifted ponderously exalted the shoulders thus like a frenchmanto what good he not could budge he is planted solid like a church he not advance no more than if one him had put at the anchor  smiley was surprised and disgusted but he no himself doubted not of the turn being intended mais il ne se doutait pas du tour bien entendu the individual empocketed the silver himself with it went and of it himself in going is it that he no gives not a jerk of thumb over the shoulderlike thatat the poor daniel in saying with his air deliberatelindividu empoche largent sen va et en sen allant estce quil ne donne pas un coup de pouce pardessus lépaule comme ça au pauvre daniel en disant de son air délibéré  eh bien i no see not that that frog has nothing of better than another  smiley himself scratched longtimes the head the eyes fixed upon daniel until that which at last he said  i me demand how the devil it makes itself that this beast has refused is it that she had something  one would believe that she is stuffed  he grasped daniel by the skin of the neck him lifted and said  the wolf me bite if he no weigh not five pounds  he him reversed and the unhappy belched two handfuls of shot et le malheureux etc  when smiley recognized how it was he was like mad he deposited his frog by the earth and ran after that individual but he not him caught never   such is the jumping frog to the distorted french eye  i claim that i never put together such an odious mixture of bad grammar and delirium tremens in my life  and what has a poor foreigner like me done to be abused and misrepresented like this  when i say well i dont see no pints about that frog thats any bettern any other frog is it kind is it just for this frenchman to try to make it appear that i said eh bien i no saw not that that frog had nothing of better than each frog i have no heart to write more  i never felt so about anything before  hartford march 1875       journalism in tennesseewritten about 1871       the editor of the memphis avalanche swoops thus mildly down upon a      correspondent who posted him as a radicalwhile he was writing      the first word the middle dotting his is crossing his ts and      punching his period he knew he was concocting a sentence that was      saturated with infamy and reeking with falsehoodexchange  i was told by the physician that a southern climate would improve my health and so i went down to tennessee and got a berth on the morning glory and johnson county warwhoop as associate editor  when i went on duty i found the chief editor sitting tilted back in a threelegged chair with his feet on a pine table  there was another pine table in the room and another afflicted chair and both were half buried under newspapers and scraps and sheets of manuscript  there was a wooden box of sand sprinkled with cigar stubs and old soldiers and a stove with a door hanging by its upper hinge  the chief editor had a longtailed black cloth frockcoat on and white linen pants  his boots were small and neatly blacked  he wore a ruffled shirt a large sealring a standing collar of obsolete pattern and a checkered neckerchief with the ends hanging down  date of costume about 1848  he was smoking a cigar and trying to think of a word and in pawing his hair he had rumpled his locks a good deal  he was scowling fearfully and i judged that he was concocting a particularly knotty editorial  he told me to take the exchanges and skim through them and write up the spirit of the tennessee press condensing into the article all of their contents that seemed of interest  i wrote as follows                      spirit of the tennessee press       the editors of the semiweekly earthquake evidently labor under a      misapprehension with regard to the ballyhack railroad  it is not      the object of the company to leave buzzardville off to one side      on the contrary they consider it one of the most important points      along the line and consequently can have no desire to slight it      the gentlemen of the earthquake will of course take pleasure in      making the correction       john w blossom esq the able editor of the higginsville      thunderbolt and battle cry of freedom arrived in the city      yesterday  he is stopping at the van buren house       we observe that our contemporary of the mud springs morning howl has      fallen into the error of supposing that the election of van werter      is not an established fact but he will have discovered his mistake      before this reminder reaches him no doubt  he was doubtless misled      by incomplete election returns       it is pleasant to note that the city of blathersville is endeavoring      to contract with some new york gentlemen to pave its wellnigh      impassable streets with the nicholson pavement  the daily hurrah      urges the measure with ability and seems confident of ultimate      success  i passed my manuscript over to the chief editor for acceptance alteration or destruction  he glanced at it and his face clouded  he ran his eye down the pages and his countenance grew portentous  it was easy to see that something was wrong  presently he sprang up and said  thunder and lightning do you suppose i am going to speak of those cattle that way  do you suppose my subscribers are going to stand such gruel as that  give me the pen  i never saw a pen scrape and scratch its way so viciously or plow through another mans verbs and adjectives so relentlessly  while he was in the midst of his work somebody shot at him through the open window and marred the symmetry of my ear  ah said he that is that scoundrel smith of the moral volcanohe was due yesterday  and he snatched a navy revolver from his belt and firedsmith dropped shot in the thigh  the shot spoiled smiths aim who was just taking a second chance and he crippled a stranger  it was me  merely a finger shot off  then the chief editor went on with his erasure and interlineations just as he finished them a hand grenade came down the stovepipe and the explosion shivered the stove into a thousand fragments  however it did no further damage except that a vagrant piece knocked a couple of my teeth out  that stove is utterly ruined said the chief editor  i said i believed it was  well no matterdont want it this kind of weather  i know the man that did it  ill get him  now here is the way this stuff ought to be written  i took the manuscript  it was scarred with erasures and interlineations till its mother wouldnt have known it if it had had one  it now read as follows                      spirit of the tennessee press       the inveterate liars of the semiweekly earthquake are evidently      endeavoring to palm off upon a noble and chivalrous people another      of their vile and brutal falsehoods with regard to that most      glorious conception of the nineteenth century the ballyhack      railroad  the idea that buzzardville was to be left off at one side      originated in their own fulsome brainsor rather in the settlings      which they regard as brains  they had better swallow this lie if      they want to save their abandoned reptile carcasses the cowhiding      they so richly deserve       that ass blossom of the higginsville thunderbolt and battle cry of      freedom is down here again sponging at the van buren       we observe that the besotted blackguard of the mud springs morning      howl is giving out with his usual propensity for lying that van      werter is not elected  the heavenborn mission of journalism is to      disseminate truth to eradicate error to educate refine and      elevate the tone of public morals and manners and make all men more      gentle more virtuous more charitable and in all ways better and      holier and happier and yet this blackhearted scoundrel degrades      his great office persistently to the dissemination of falsehood      calumny vituperation and vulgarity       blathersville wants a nicholson pavementit wants a jail and a      poorhouse more  the idea of a pavement in a onehorse town composed      of two ginmills a blacksmith shop and that mustardplaster of a      newspaper the daily hurrah  the crawling insect buckner who      edits the hurrah is braying about his business with his customary      imbecility and imagining that he is talking sense   now that is the way to writepeppery and to the point  mushandmilk journalism gives me the fantods  about this time a brick came through the window with a splintering crash and gave me a considerable of a jolt in the back  i moved out of range i began to feel in the way  the chief said that was the colonel likely  ive been expecting him for two days  he will be up now right away  he was correct  the colonel appeared in the door a moment afterward with a dragoon revolver in his hand  he said sir have i the honor of addressing the poltroon who edits this mangy sheet  you have  be seated sir  be careful of the chair one of its legs is gone  i believe i have the honor of addressing the putrid liar colonel blatherskite tecumseh  right sir  i have a little account to settle with you  if you are at leisure we will begin  i have an article on the encouraging progress of moral and intellectual development in america to finish but there is no hurry  begin  both pistols rang out their fierce clamor at the same instant  the chief lost a lock of his hair and the colonels bullet ended its career in the fleshy part of my thigh  the colonels left shoulder was clipped a little  they fired again  both missed their men this time but i got my share a shot in the arm  at the third fire both gentlemen were wounded slightly and i had a knuckle chipped  i then said i believed i would go out and take a walk as this was a private matter and i had a delicacy about participating in it further  but both gentlemen begged me to keep my seat and assured me that i was not in the way  they then talked about the elections and the crops while they reloaded and i fell to tying up my wounds  but presently they opened fire again with animation and every shot took effectbut it is proper to remark that five out of the six fell to my share  the sixth one mortally wounded the colonel who remarked with fine humor that he would have to say good morning now as he had business uptown  he then inquired the way to the undertakers and left  the chief turned to me and said i am expecting company to dinner and shall have to get ready  it will be a favor to me if you will read proof and attend to the customers  i winced a little at the idea of attending to the customers but i was too bewildered by the fusillade that was still ringing in my ears to think of anything to say  he continued jones will be here at threecowhide him  gillespie will call earlier perhapsthrow him out of the window  ferguson will be along about fourkill him  that is all for today i believe  if you have any odd time you may write a blistering article on the policegive the chief inspector rats  the cowhides are under the table weapons in the drawerammunition there in the cornerlint and bandages up there in the pigeonholes  in case of accident go to lancet the surgeon downstairs  he advertiseswe take it out in trade  he was gone  i shuddered  at the end of the next three hours i had been through perils so awful that all peace of mind and all cheerfulness were gone from me  gillespie had called and thrown me out of the window jones arrived promptly and when i got ready to do the cowhiding he took the job off my hands  in an encounter with a stranger not in the bill of fare i had lost my scalp  another stranger by the name of thompson left me a mere wreck and ruin of chaotic rags  and at last at bay in the corner and beset by an infuriated mob of editors blacklegs politicians and desperadoes who raved and swore and flourished their weapons about my head till the air shimmered with glancing flashes of steel i was in the act of resigning my berth on the paper when the chief arrived and with him a rabble of charmed and enthusiastic friends  then ensued a scene of riot and carnage such as no human pen or steel one either could describe  people were shot probed dismembered blown up thrown out of the window  there was a brief tornado of murky blasphemy with a confused and frantic wardance glimmering through it and then all was over  in five minutes there was silence and the gory chief and i sat alone and surveyed the sanguinary ruin that strewed the floor around us  he said youll like this place when you get used to it  i said ill have to get you to excuse me i think maybe i might write to suit you after a while as soon as i had had some practice and learned the language i am confident i could  but to speak the plain truth that sort of energy of expression has its inconveniences and a man is liable to interruption  you see that yourself  vigorous writing is calculated to elevate the public no doubt but then i do not like to attract so much attention as it calls forth  i cant write with comfort when i am interrupted so much as i have been today  i like this berth well enough but i dont like to be left here to wait on the customers  the experiences are novel i grant you and entertaining too after a fashion but they are not judiciously distributed  a gentleman shoots at you through the window and cripples me a bombshell comes down the stovepipe for your gratification and sends the stove door down my throat a friend drops in to swap compliments with you and freckles me with bulletholes till my skin wont hold my principles you go to dinner and jones comes with his cowhide gillespie throws me out of the window thompson tears all my clothes off and an entire stranger takes my scalp with the easy freedom of an old acquaintance and in less than five minutes all the blackguards in the country arrive in their warpaint and proceed to scare the rest of me to death with their tomahawks  take it altogether i never had such a spirited time in all my life as i have had today  no i like you and i like your calm unruffled way of explaining things to the customers but you see i am not used to it  the southern heart is too impulsive southern hospitality is too lavish with the stranger  the paragraphs which i have written today and into whose cold sentences your masterly hand has infused the fervent spirit of tennesseean journalism will wake up another nest of hornets  all that mob of editors will comeand they will come hungry too and want somebody for breakfast  i shall have to bid you adieu  i decline to be present at these festivities  i came south for my health i will go back on the same errand and suddenly  tennesseean journalism is too stirring for me  after which we parted with mutual regret and i took apartments at the hospital       the story of the bad little boywritten about 1865  once there was a bad little boy whose name was jimthough if you will notice you will find that bad little boys are nearly always called james in your sundayschool books  it was strange but still it was true that this one was called jim  he didnt have any sick mother eithera sick mother who was pious and had the consumption and would be glad to lie down in the grave and be at rest but for the strong love she bore her boy and the anxiety she felt that the world might be harsh and cold toward him when she was gone most bad boys in the sunday books are named james and have sick mothers who teach them to say now i lay me down etc and sing them to sleep with sweet plaintive voices and then kiss them good night and kneel down by the bedside and weep  but it was different with this fellow he was named jim and there wasnt anything the matter with his mother no consumption nor anything of that kind  she was rather stout than otherwise and she was not pious moreover she was not anxious on jims account  she said if he were to break his neck it wouldnt be much loss she always spanked jim to sleep and she never kissed him good night on the contrary she boxed his ears when she was ready to leave him  once this little bad boy stole the key of the pantry and slipped in there and helped himself to some jam and filled up the vessel with tar so that his mother would never know the difference but all at once a terrible feeling didnt come over him and something didnt seem to whisper to him is it right to disobey my mother  isnt it sinful to do this  where do bad little boys go who gobble up their good kind mothers jam and then he didnt kneel down all alone and promise never to be wicked any more and rise up with a light happy heart and go and tell his mother all about it and beg her forgiveness and be blessed by her with tears of pride and thankfulness in her eyes  no that is the way with all other bad boys in the books but it happened otherwise with this jim strangely enough  he ate that jam and said it was bully in his sinful vulgar way and he put in the tar and said that was bully also and laughed and observed that the old woman would get up and snort when she found it out and when she did find it out he denied knowing anything about it and she whipped him severely and he did the crying himself  everything about this boy was curiouseverything turned out differently with him from the way it does to the bad jameses in the books  once he climbed up in farmer acorns apple tree to steal apples and the limb didnt break and he didnt fall and break his arm and get torn by the farmers great dog and then languish on a sickbed for weeks and repent and become good  oh no he stole as many apples as he wanted and came down all right and he was all ready for the dog too and knocked him endways with a brick when he came to tear him  it was very strange nothing like it ever happened in those mild little books with marbled backs and with pictures in them of men with swallowtailed coats and bellcrowned hats and pantaloons that are short in the legs and women with the waists of their dresses under their arms and no hoops on nothing like it in any of the sundayschool books  once he stole the teachers penknife and when he was afraid it would be found out and he would get whipped he slipped it into george wilsons cappoor widow wilsons son the moral boy the good little boy of the village who always obeyed his mother and never told an untruth and was fond of his lessons and infatuated with sundayschool  and when the knife dropped from the cap and poor george hung his head and blushed as if in conscious guilt and the grieved teacher charged the theft upon him and was just in the very act of bringing the switch down upon his trembling shoulders a whitehaired improbable justice of the peace did not suddenly appear in their midst and strike an attitude and say spare this noble boythere stands the cowering culprit  i was passing the school door at recess and unseen myself i saw the theft committed  and then jim didnt get whaled and the venerable justice didnt read the tearful school a homily and take george by the hand and say such a boy deserved to be exalted and then tell him to come and make his home with him and sweep out the office and make fires and run errands and chop wood and study law and help his wife do household labors and have all the balance of the time to play and get forty cents a month and be happy  no it would have happened that way in the books but didnt happen that way to jim  no meddling old clam of a justice dropped in to make trouble and so the model boy george got thrashed and jim was glad of it because you know jim hated moral boys  jim said he was down on them milksops  such was the coarse language of this bad neglected boy  but the strangest thing that ever happened to jim was the time he went boating on sunday and didnt get drowned and that other time that he got caught out in the storm when he was fishing on sunday and didnt get struck by lightning  why you might look and look all through the sundayschool books from now till next christmas and you would never come across anything like this  oh no you would find that all the bad boys who go boating on sunday invariably get drowned and all the bad boys who get caught out in storms when they are fishing on sunday infallibly get struck by lightning  boats with bad boys in them always upset on sunday and it always storms when bad boys go fishing on the sabbath  how this jim ever escaped is a mystery to me  this jim bore a charmed lifethat must have been the way of it  nothing could hurt him  he even gave the elephant in the menagerie a plug of tobacco and the elephant didnt knock the top of his head off with his trunk  he browsed around the cupboard after essenceof peppermint and didnt make a mistake and drink aqua fortis  he stole his fathers gun and went hunting on the sabbath and didnt shoot three or four of his fingers off  he struck his little sister on the temple with his fist when he was angry and she didnt linger in pain through long summer days and die with sweet words of forgiveness upon her lips that redoubled the anguish of his breaking heart  no she got over it  he ran off and went to sea at last and didnt come back and find himself sad and alone in the world his loved ones sleeping in the quiet churchyard and the vineembowered home of his boyhood tumbled down and gone to decay  ah no he came home as drunk as a piper and got into the stationhouse the first thing  and he grew up and married and raised a large family and brained them all with an ax one night and got wealthy by all manner of cheating and rascality and now he is the infernalest wickedest scoundrel in his native village and is universally respected and belongs to the legislature  so you see there never was a bad james in the sundayschool books that had such a streak of luck as this sinful jim with the charmed life       the story of the good little boywritten about 1865  once there was a good little boy by the name of jacob blivens  he always obeyed his parents no matter how absurd and unreasonable their demands were and he always learned his book and never was late at sabbathschool  he would not play hookey even when his sober judgment told him it was the most profitable thing he could do  none of the other boys could ever make that boy out he acted so strangely  he wouldnt lie no matter how convenient it was  he just said it was wrong to lie and that was sufficient for him  and he was so honest that he was simply ridiculous  the curious ways that that jacob had surpassed everything he wouldnt play marbles on sunday he wouldnt rob birds nests he wouldnt give hot pennies to organgrinders monkeys he didnt seem to take any interest in any kind of rational amusement  so the other boys used to try to reason it out and come to an understanding of him but they couldnt arrive at any satisfactory conclusion  as i said before they could only figure out a sort of vague idea that he was afflicted and so they took him under their protection and never allowed any harm to come to him  this good little boy read all the sundayschool books they were his greatest delight  this was the whole secret of it  he believed in the good little boys they put in the sundayschool book he had every confidence in them  he longed to come across one of them alive once but he never did  they all died before his time maybe  whenever he read about a particularly good one he turned over quickly to the end to see what became of him because he wanted to travel thousands of miles and gaze on him but it wasnt any use that good little boy always died in the last chapter and there was a picture of the funeral with all his relations and the sundayschool children standing around the grave in pantaloons that were too short and bonnets that were too large and everybody crying into handkerchiefs that had as much as a yard and a half of stuff in them  he was always headed off in this way  he never could see one of those good little boys on account of his always dying in the last chapter  jacob had a noble ambition to be put in a sunday school book  he wanted to be put in with pictures representing him gloriously declining to lie to his mother and her weeping for joy about it and pictures representing him standing on the doorstep giving a penny to a poor beggarwoman with six children and telling her to spend it freely but not to be extravagant because extravagance is a sin and pictures of him magnanimously refusing to tell on the bad boy who always lay in wait for him around the corner as he came from school and welted him so over the head with a lath and then chased him home saying hi hi as he proceeded  that was the ambition of young jacob blivens  he wished to be put in a sundayschool book  it made him feel a little uncomfortable sometimes when he reflected that the good little boys always died  he loved to live you know and this was the most unpleasant feature about being a sundayschoolbook boy  he knew it was not healthy to be good he knew it was more fatal than consumption to be so supernaturally good as the boys in the books were he knew that none of them had ever been able to stand it long and it pained him to think that if they put him in a book he wouldnt ever see it or even if they did get the book out before he died it wouldnt be popular without any picture of his funeral in the back part of it  it couldnt be much of a sundayschool book that couldnt tell about the advice he gave to the community when he was dying  so at last of course he had to make up his mind to do the best he could under the circumstancesto live right and hang on as long as he could and have his dying speech all ready when his time came  but somehow nothing ever went right with the good little boy nothing ever turned out with him the way it turned out with the good little boys in the books  they always had a good time and the bad boys had the broken legs but in his case there was a screw loose somewhere and it all happened just the other way  when he found jim blake stealing apples and went under the tree to read to him about the bad little boy who fell out of a neighbors apple tree and broke his arm jim fell out of the tree too but he fell on him and broke his arm and jim wasnt hurt at all  jacob couldnt understand that  there wasnt anything in the books like it  and once when some bad boys pushed a blind man over in the mud and jacob ran to help him up and receive his blessing the blind man did not give him any blessing at all but whacked him over the head with his stick and said he would like to catch him shoving him again and then pretending to help him up  this was not in accordance with any of the books  jacob looked them all over to see  one thing that jacob wanted to do was to find a lame dog that hadnt any place to stay and was hungry and persecuted and bring him home and pet him and have that dogs imperishable gratitude  and at last he found one and was happy and he brought him home and fed him but when he was going to pet him the dog flew at him and tore all the clothes off him except those that were in front and made a spectacle of him that was  astonishing  he examined authorities but he could not understand the matter  it was of the same breed of dogs that was in the books but it acted very differently  whatever this boy did he got into trouble  the very things the boys in the books got rewarded for turned out to be about the most unprofitable things he could invest in  once when he was on his way to sundayschool he saw some bad boys starting off pleasuring in a sailboat  he was filled with consternation because he knew from his reading that boys who went sailing on sunday invariably got drowned  so he ran out on a raft to warn them but a log turned with him and slid him into the river  a man got him out pretty soon and the doctor pumped the water out of him and gave him a fresh start with his bellows but he caught cold and lay sick abed nine weeks but the most unaccountable thing about it was that the bad boys in the boat had a good time all day and then reached home alive and well in the most surprising manner  jacob blivens said there was nothing like these things in the books  he was perfectly dumfounded  when he got well he was a little discouraged but he resolved to keep on trying anyhow  he knew that so far his experiences wouldnt do to go in a book but he hadnt yet reached the allotted term of life for good little boys and he hoped to be able to make a record yet if he could hold on till his time was fully up  if everything else failed he had his dying speech to fall back on  he examined his authorities and found that it was now time for him to go to sea as a cabinboy  he called on a shipcaptain and made his application and when the captain asked for his recommendations he proudly drew out a tract and pointed to the word to jacob blivens from his affectionate teacher  but the captain was a coarse vulgar man and he said oh that be blowed that wasnt any proof that he knew how to wash dishes or handle a slushbucket and he guessed he didnt want him this was altogether the most extraordinary thing that ever happened to jacob in all his life  a compliment from a teacher on a tract had never failed to move the tenderest emotions of shipcaptains and open the way to all offices of honor and profit in their gift it never had in any book that ever he had read  he could hardly believe his senses  this boy always had a hard time of it  nothing ever came out according to the authorities with him  at last one day when he was around hunting up bad little boys to admonish he found a lot of them in the old ironfoundry fixing up a little joke on fourteen or fifteen dogs which they had tied together in long procession and were going to ornament with empty nitroglycerin cans made fast to their tails  jacobs heart was touched  he sat down on one of those cans for he never minded grease when duty was before him and he took hold of the foremost dog by the collar and turned his reproving eye upon wicked tom jones  but just at that moment alderman mcwelter full of wrath stepped in  all the bad boys ran away but jacob blivens rose in conscious innocence and began one of those stately little sundayschoolbook speeches which always commence with oh sir in dead opposition to the fact that no boy good or bad ever starts a remark with oh sir  but the alderman never waited to hear the rest  he took jacob blivens by the ear and turned him around and hit him a whack in the rear with the flat of his hand and in an instant that good little boy shot out through the roof and soared away toward the sun with the fragments of those fifteen dogs stringing after him like the tail of a kite  and there wasnt a sign of that alderman or that old ironfoundry left on the face of the earth and as for young jacob blivens he never got a chance to make his last dying speech after all his trouble fixing it up unless he made it to the birds because although the bulk of him came down all right in a treetop in an adjoining county the rest of him was apportioned around among four townships and so they had to hold five inquests on him to find out whether he was dead or not and how it occurred  you never saw a boy scattered sothis glycerin catastrophe is borrowed from a floating newspaper item whose authors name i would give if i knew itm t  thus perished the good little boy who did the best he could but didnt come out according to the books  every boy who ever did as he did prospered except him  his case is truly remarkable  it will probably never be accounted for       a couple of poems by twain and moorewritten about 1865                            those evening bells                             by thomas moore                 those evening bells those evening bells                how many a tale their music tells                of youth and home and that sweet time                when last i heard their soothing chime                 those joyous hours are passed away                and many a heart that then was gay                within the tomb now darkly dwells                and hears no more those evening bells                 and so twill be when i am gone                that tuneful peal will still ring on                while other bards shall walk these dells                and sing your

enjoyable place of resort  the hotels are excellent and the prices not at all exorbitant  the opportunities for fishing are not surpassed in the country in fact they are not even equaled elsewhere  because in other localities certain places in the streams are much better than others but at niagara one place is just as good as another for the reason that the fish do not bite anywhere and so there is no use in your walking five miles to fish when you can depend on being just as unsuccessful nearer home  the advantages of this state of things have never heretofore been properly placed before the public  the weather is cool in summer and the walks and drives are all pleasant and none of them fatiguing  when you start out to do the falls you first drive down about a mile and pay a small sum for the privilege of looking down from a precipice into the narrowest part of the niagara river  a railway cut through a hill would be as comely if it had the angry river tumbling and foaming through its bottom  you can descend a staircase here a hundred and fifty feet down and stand at the edge of the water  after you have done it you will wonder why you did it but you will then be too late  the guide will explain to you in his bloodcurdling way how he saw the little steamer maid of the mist descend the fearful rapidshow first one paddlebox was out of sight behind the raging billows and then the other and at what point it was that her smokestack toppled overboard and where her planking began to break and part asunderand how she did finally live through the trip after accomplishing the incredible feat of traveling seventeen miles in six minutes or six miles in seventeen minutes i have really forgotten which  but it was very extraordinary anyhow  it is worth the price of admission to hear the guide tell the story nine times in succession to different parties and never miss a word or alter a sentence or a gesture  then you drive over to suspension bridge and divide your misery between the chances of smashing down two hundred feet into the river below and the chances of having the railwaytrain overhead smashing down onto you either possibility is discomforting taken by itself but mixed together they amount in the aggregate to positive unhappiness  on the canada side you drive along the chasm between long ranks of photographers standing guard behind their cameras ready to make an ostentatious frontispiece of you and your decaying ambulance and your solemn crate with a hide on it which you are expected to regard in the light of a horse and a diminished and unimportant background of sublime niagara and a great many people have the incredible effrontery or the native depravity to aid and abet this sort of crime  any day in the hands of these photographers you may see stately  pictures of papa and mamma johnny and bub and sis or a couple of country cousins all smiling vacantly and all disposed in studied and uncomfortable attitudes in their carriage and all looming up in their aweinspiring imbecility before the snubbed and diminished presentment of that majestic presence whose ministering spirits are the rainbows whose voice is the thunder whose awful front is veiled in clouds who was monarch here dead and forgotten ages before this sackful of small reptiles was deemed temporarily necessary to fill a crack in the worlds unnoted myriads and will still be monarch here ages and decades of ages after they shall have gathered themselves to their bloodrelations the other worms and been mingled with the unremembering dust  there is no actual harm in making niagara a background whereon to display ones marvelous insignificance in a good strong light but it requires a sort of superhuman selfcomplacency to enable one to do it when you have examined the stupendous horseshoe fall till you are satisfied you cannot improve on it you return to america by the new suspension bridge and follow up the bank to where they exhibit the cave of the winds  here i followed instructions and divested myself of all my clothing and put on a waterproof jacket and overalls  this costume is picturesque but not beautiful  a guide similarly dressed led the way down a flight of winding stairs which wound and wound and still kept on winding long after the thing ceased to be a novelty and then terminated long before it had begun to be a pleasure  we were then well down under the precipice but still considerably above the level of the river  we now began to creep along flimsy bridges of a single plank our persons shielded from destruction by a crazy wooden railing to which i clung with both handsnot because i was afraid but because i wanted to presently the descent became steeper and the bridge flimsier and sprays from the american fall began to rain down on us in fast increasing sheets that soon became blinding and after that our progress was mostly in the nature of groping  now a furious wind began to rush out from behind the waterfall which seemed determined to sweep us from the bridge and scatter us on the rocks and among the torrents below  i remarked that i wanted to go home but it was too late  we were almost under the monstrous wall of water thundering down from above and speech was in vain in the midst of such a pitiless crash of sound  in another moment the guide disappeared behind the deluge and bewildered by the thunder driven helplessly by the wind and smitten by the arrowy tempest of rain i followed  all was darkness  such a mad storming roaring and bellowing of warring wind and water never crazed my ears before  i bent my head and seemed to receive the atlantic on my back the world seemed going to destruction  i could not see anything the flood poured down savagely  i raised my head with open mouth and the most of the american cataract went down my throat  if i had sprung a leak now i had been lost  and at this moment i discovered that the bridge had ceased and we must trust for a foothold to the slippery and precipitous rocks  i never was so scared before and survived it  but we got through at last and emerged into the open day where we could stand in front of the laced and frothy and seething world of descending water and look at it  when i saw how much of it there was and how fearfully in earnest it was i was sorry i had gone behind it  the noble red man has always been a friend and darling of mine  i love to read about him in tales and legends and romances  i love to read of his inspired sagacity and his love of the wild free life of mountain and forest and his general nobility of character and his stately metaphorical manner of speech and his chivalrous love for the dusky maiden and the picturesque pomp of his dress and accoutrements especially the picturesque pomp of his dress and accoutrements  when i found the shops at niagara falls full of dainty indian beadwork and stunning moccasins and equally stunning toy figures representing human beings who carried their weapons in holes bored through their arms and bodies and had feet shaped like a pie i was filled with emotion i knew that now at last i was going to come face to face with the noble red man  a lady clerk in a shop told me indeed that all her grand array of curiosities were made by the indians and that they were plenty about the falls and that they were friendly and it would not be dangerous to speak to them  and sure enough as i approached the bridge leading over to luna island i came upon a noble son of the forest sitting under a tree diligently at work on a bead reticule  he wore a slouch hat and brogans and had a short black pipe in his mouth  thus does the baneful contact with our effeminate civilization dilute the picturesque pomp which is so natural to the indian when far removed from us in his native haunts  i addressed the relic as follows  is the wawhoowangwang of the whackawhack happy  does the great speckled thunder sigh for the warpath or is his heart contented with dreaming of the dusky maiden the pride of the forest  does the mighty sachem yearn to drink the blood of his enemies or is he satisfied to make bead reticules for the pappooses of the paleface  speak sublime relic of bygone grandeurvenerable ruin speak  the relic said   an is it mesilf dennis hooligan that yed be takin for a dirty injin ye drawlin lanternjawed spiderlegged divil  by the piper that played before moses ill ate ye  i went away from there  by and by in the neighborhood of the terrapin tower i came upon a gentle daughter of the aborigines in fringed and beaded buckskin moccasins and leggins seated on a bench with her pretty wares about her she had just carved out a wooden chief that had a strong family resemblance to a clothespin and was now boring a hole through his abdomen to put his bow through  i hesitated a moment and then addressed her  is the heart of the forest maiden heavy  is the laughing tadpole lonely  does she mourn over the extinguished councilfires of her race and the vanished glory of her ancestors  or does her sad spirit wander afar toward the huntinggrounds whither her brave gobblerofthe lightnings is gone  why is my daughter silent  has she ought against the paleface stranger  the maiden said  faix an is it biddy malone ye dare to be callin names  lave this or ill shy your lean carcass over the cataract ye sniveling blaggard  i adjourned from there also  confound these indians i said  they told me they were tame but if appearances go for anything i should say they were all on the warpath  i made one more attempt to fraternize with them and only one  i came upon a camp of them gathered in the shade of a great tree making wampum and moccasins and addressed them in the language of friendship  noble red men braves grand sachems war chiefs squaws and high muckamucks the paleface from the land of the setting sun greets you you beneficent polecatyou devourer of mountainsyou roaring thundergustyou bully boy

innocence has damaged your reputation with the soulless usurper trading for fortyrod whisky to enable you to get drunk and happy and tomahawk your families has played the everlasting mischief with the picturesque pomp of your dress and here you are in the broad light of the nineteenth century gotten up like the ragtag and bobtail of the purlieus of new york  for shame  remember your ancestors

down wid him  scoop the blaggard  burn him  hang him dhround him  it was the quickest operation that ever was  i simply saw a sudden flash in the air of clubs brickbats fists beadbaskets and moccasinsa single flash and they all appeared to hit me at once and no two of them in the same place  in the next instant the entire tribe was upon me they tore half the clothes off me they broke my arms and legs they gave me a thump that dented the top of my head till it would hold coffee like a saucer and to crown their disgraceful proceedings and add insult to injury they threw me over the niagara falls and i got wet  about ninety or a hundred feet from the top the remains of my vest caught on a projecting rock and i was almost drowned before i could get loose  i finally fell and brought up in a world of white foam at the foot of the fall whose celled and bubbly masses towered up several inches above my head  of course i got into the eddy  i sailed round and round in it fortyfour timeschasing a chip and gaining on iteach round trip a halfmilereaching for the same bush on the bank fortyfour times and just exactly missing it by a hairsbreadth every time   at last a man walked down and sat down close to that bush and put a pipe in his mouth and lit a match and followed me with one eye and kept the other on the match while he sheltered it in his hands from the wind presently a puff of wind blew it out  the next time i swept around he said  got a match  yes in my other vest  help me out please  not for joe  when i came round again i said  excuse the seemingly impertinent curiosity of a drowning man but will you explain this singular conduct of yours  with pleasure  i am the coroner  dont hurry on my account  i can wait for you  but i wish i had a match  i said take my place and ill go and get you one  he declined  this lack of confidence on his part created a coldness between us and from that time forward i avoided him  it was my idea in case anything happened to me to so time the occurrence as to throw my custom into the hands of the opposition coroner on the american side  at last a policeman came along and arrested me for disturbing the peace by yelling at people on shore for help  the judge fined me but i had the advantage of him  my money was with my pantaloons and my pantaloons were with the indians  thus i escaped  i am now lying in a very critical condition  at least i am lying anywaycritical or not critical  i am hurt all over but i cannot tell the full extent yet because the doctor is not done taking inventory  he will make out my manifest this evening  however thus far he thinks only sixteen of my wounds are fatal  i dont mind the others  upon regaining my right mind i said  it is an awful savage tribe of indians that do the beadwork and moccasins for niagara falls doctor  where are they from   limerick my son       answers to correspondentswritten about 1865  moral statisticiani dont want any of your statistics i took your whole batch and lit my pipe with it  i hate your kind of people  you are always ciphering out how much a mans health is injured and how much his intellect is impaired and how many pitiful dollars and cents he wastes in the course of ninetytwo years indulgence in the fatal practice of smoking and in the equally fatal practice of drinking coffee and in playing billiards occasionally and in taking a glass of wine at dinner etc etc etc  and you are always figuring out how many women have been burned to death because of the dangerous fashion of wearing expansive hoops etc etc etc  you never see more than one side of the question  you are blind to the fact that most old men in america smoke and drink coffee although according to your theory they ought to have died young and that hearty old englishmen drink wine and survive it and portly old dutchmen both drink and smoke freely and yet grow older and fatter all the time  and you never try to find out how much solid comfort relaxation and enjoyment a man derives from smoking in the course of a lifetime which is worth ten times the money he would save by letting it alone nor the appalling aggregate of happiness lost in a lifetime by your kind of people from not smoking  of course you can save money by denying yourself all the little vicious enjoyments for fifty years but then what can you do with it  what use can you put it to  money cant save your infinitesimal soul  all the use that money can be put to is to purchase comfort and enjoyment in this life therefore as you are an enemy to comfort and enjoyment where is the use of accumulating cash  it wont do for you to say that you can use it to better purpose in furnishing a good table and in charities and in supporting tract societies because you know yourself that you people who have no petty vices are never known to give away a cent and that you stint yourselves so in the matter of food that you are always feeble and hungry  and you never dare to laugh in

can to make your former flame unhappy  there is an absurd idea disseminated in novels that the happier a girl is with another man the happier it makes the old lover she has blighted  dont allow

right america was not discovered by alexander selkirk        discarded loveri loved and still love the beautiful edwitha      howard and intended to marry her  yet during my temporary absence      at benicia last week alas she married jones  is my happiness to      be thus blasted for life have i no redress  of course you have  all the law written and unwritten is on your side the intention and not the act constitutes crimein other words constitutes the deed  if you call your bosom friend a fool and intend it for an insult it is an insult but if you do it playfully and meaning no insult it is not an insult  if you discharge a pistol accidentally and kill a man you can go free for you have done no murder but if you try to kill a man and manifestly intend to kill him but fail utterly to do it the law still holds that the intention constituted the crime and you are guilty of murder  ergo if you had married edwitha accidentally and without really intending to do it you would not actually be married to her at all because the act of marriage could not be complete without the intention  and ergo in the strict spirit of the law since you deliberately intended to marry edwitha and didnt do it you are married to her all the samebecause as i said before the intention constitutes the crime  it is as clear as day that edwitha is your wife and your redress lies in taking a club and mutilating jones with it as much as you can  any man has a right to protect his own wife from the advances of other men  but you have another alternativeyou were married to edwitha first because of your deliberate intention and now you can prosecute her for bigamy in subsequently marrying jones  but there is another phase in this complicated case  you intended to marry edwitha and consequently according to law she is your wifethere is no getting around that but she didnt marry you and if she never intended to marry you you are not her husband of course  ergo in marrying jones she was guilty of bigamy because she was the wife of another man at the time which is all very well as far as it goesbut then dont you see she had no other husband when she married jones and consequently she was not guilty of bigamy  now according to this view of the case jones married a spinster who was a widow at the same time and another mans wife at the same time and yet who had no husband and never had one and never had any intention of getting married and therefore of course never had been married and by the same reasoning you are a bachelor because you have never been any ones husband and a married man because you have a wife living and to all intents and purposes a widower because you have been deprived of that wife and a consummate ass for going off to benicia in the first place while things were so mixed  and by this time i have got myself so tangled up in the intricacies of this extraordinary case that i shall have to give up any further attempt to advise youi might get confused and fail to make myself understood  i think i could take up the argument where i left off and by following it closely awhile perhaps i could prove to your satisfaction either that you never existed at all or that you are dead now and consequently dont need the faithless edwithai think i could do that if it would afford you any comfort   arthur augustusno you are wrong that is the proper way to throw a brickbat or a tomahawk but it doesnt answer so well for a bouquet you will hurt somebody if you keep it up  turn your nosegay upside down take it by the stems and toss it with an upward sweep  did you ever pitch quoits that is the idea  the practice of recklessly heaving immense solid bouquets of the general size and weight of prize cabbages from the dizzy altitude of the galleries is dangerous and very reprehensible  now night before last at the academy of music just after signorina  had finished that exquisite melody the last rose of summer one of these floral piledrivers came cleaving down through the atmosphere of applause and if she hadnt deployed suddenly to the right it would have driven her into the floor like a shinglenail  of course that bouquet was well meant but how would you like to have been the target  a sincere compliment is always grateful to a lady so long as you dont try to knock her down with it   young motherand so you think a baby is a thing of beauty and a joy forever  well the idea is pleasing but not original every cow thinks the same of its own calf perhaps the cow may not think it so elegantly but still she thinks it nevertheless  i honor the cow for it  we all honor this touching maternal instinct wherever we find it be it in the home of luxury or in the humble cowshed  but really madam when i come to examine the matter in all its bearings i find that the correctness of your assertion does not assert itself in all cases a soiled baby with a neglected nose cannot be conscientiously regarded as a thing of beauty and inasmuch as babyhood spans but three short years no baby is competent to be a joy forever  it pains me thus to demolish twothirds of your pretty sentiment in a single sentence but the position i hold in this chair requires that i shall not permit you to deceive and mislead the public with your plausible figures of speech i know a female baby aged eighteen months in this city which cannot hold out as a joy twentyfour hours on a stretch let alone forever and it possesses some of the most remarkable eccentricities of character and appetite that have ever fallen under my notice  i will set down here a statement of this infants operations conceived planned and carried out by itself and without suggestion or assistance from its mother or any one else during a single day and what i shall say can be substantiated by the sworn testimony of witnesses  it commenced by eating one dozen large bluemass pills box and all then it fell down a flight of stairs and arose with a blue and purple knot on its forehead after which it proceeded in quest of further refreshment and amusement it found a glass trinket ornamented with brasswork smashed up and ate the glass and then swallowed the brass then it drank about twenty drops of laudanum and more than a dozen tablespoonfuls of strong spirits of camphor  the reason why it took no more laudanum was because there was no more to take  after this it lay down on its back and shoved five or six inches of a silverheaded whalebone cane down its throat got it fast there and it was all its mother could do to pull the cane out again without pulling out some of the child with it  then being hungry for glass again it broke up several wine glasses and fell to eating and swallowing the fragments not minding a cut or two  then it ate a quantity of butter pepper salt and california matches actually taking a spoonful of butter a spoonful of salt a spoonful of pepper and three or four lucifer matches at each mouthful i will remark here that this thing of beauty likes painted german lucifers and eats all she can get of them but she prefers california matches which i regard as a compliment to our home manufactures of more than ordinary value coming as it does from one who is too young to flatter  then she washed her head with soap and water and afterward ate what soap was left and drank as much of the suds as she had room for after which she sallied forth and took the cow familiarly by the tail and got kicked heels over head  at odd times during the day when this joy forever happened to have nothing particular on hand she put in the time by climbing up on places and falling down off them uniformly damaging her self in the operation  as young as she is she speaks many words tolerably distinctly and being plainspoken in other respects blunt and to the point she opens conversation with all strangers male or female with the same formula how do jim not being familiar with the ways of children it is possible that i have been magnifying into matter of surprise things which may not strike any one who is familiar with infancy as being at all astonishing  however i cannot believe that such is the case and so i repeat that my report of this babys performances is strictly true and if any one doubts it i can produce the child  i will further engage that she will devour anything that is given her reserving to myself only the right to exclude anvils and fall down from any place to which she may be elevated merely stipulating that her preference for alighting on her head shall be respected and therefore that the elevation chosen shall be high enough to enable her to accomplish this to her satisfaction  but i find i have wandered from my subject so without further argument i will reiterate my conviction that not all babies are things of beauty and joys forever        arithmeticus virginia nevadai am an enthusiastic student of      mathematics and it is so vexatious to me to find my progress      constantly impeded by these mysterious arithmetical technicalities      now do tell me what the difference is between geometry and      conchology  here you come again with your arithmetical conundrums when i am suffering death with a cold in the head  if you could have seen the expression of scorn that darkened my countenance a moment ago and was instantly split from the center in every direction like a fractured lookingglass by my last sneeze you never would have written that disgraceful question  conchology is a science which has nothing to do with mathematics it relates only to shells  at the same time however a man who opens oysters for a hotel or shells a fortified town or sucks eggs is not strictly speaking a conchologista fine stroke of sarcasm that but it will be lost on such an unintellectual clam as you  now compare conchology and geometry together and you will see what the difference is and your question will be answered  but dont torture me with any more arithmetical horrors until you know i am rid of my cold  i feel the bitterest animosity toward you at this momentbothering me in this way when i can do nothing but sneeze and rage and snort pockethandkerchiefs to atoms  if i had you in range of my nose now i would blow your brains out       to raise poultry  being a letter written to a poultry society that had conferred a complimentary membership upon the author  written about 1870  seriously from early youth i have taken an especial interest in the subject of poultryraising and so this membership touches a ready sympathy in my breast  even as a schoolboy poultryraising was a study with me and i may say without egotism that as early as the age of seventeen i was acquainted with all the best and speediest methods of raising chickens from raising them off a roost by burning lucifer matches under their noses down to lifting them off a fence on a frosty night by insinuating the end of a warm board under their heels  by the time i was twenty years old i really suppose i had raised more poultry than any one individual in all the section round about there  the very chickens came to know my talent by and by  the youth of both sexes ceased to paw the earth for worms and old roosters that came to crow remained to pray when i passed by  i have had so much experience in the raising of fowls that i cannot but think that a few hints from me might be useful to the society  the two methods i have already touched upon are very simple and are only used in the raising of the commonest class of fowls one is for summer the other for winter  in the one case you start out with a friend along about eleven oclock on a summers night not later because in some states especially in california and oregonchickens always rouse up just at midnight and crow from ten to thirty minutes according to the ease or difficulty they experience in getting the public waked up and your friend carries with him a sack  arrived at the henroost your neighbors not your own you light a match and hold it under first one and then another pullets nose until they are willing to go into that bag without making any trouble about it  you then return home either taking the bag with you or leaving it behind according as circumstances shall dictate  n bi have seen the time when it was eligible and appropriate to leave the sack behind and walk off with considerable velocity without ever leaving any word where to send it  in the case of the other method mentioned for raising poultry your friend takes along a covered vessel with a charcoal fire in it and you carry a long slender plank  this is a frosty night understand  arrived at the tree or fence or other henroost your own if you are an idiot you warm the end of your plank in your friends fire vessel and then raise it aloft and ease it up gently against a slumbering chickens foot if the subject of your attentions is a true bird he will infallibly return thanks with a sleepy cluck or two and step out and take up quarters on the plank thus becoming so conspicuously accessory before the fact to his own murder as to make it a grave question in our minds as it once was in the mind of blackstone whether he is not really and deliberately committing suicide in the second degree  but you enter into a contemplation of these legal refinements subsequently not then  when you wish to raise a fine large donkeyvoiced shanghai rooster you do it with a lasso just as you would a bull it is because he must be choked and choked effectually too  it is the only good certain way for whenever he mentions a matter which he is cordially interested in the chances are ninetynine in a hundred that he secures somebody elses immediate attention to it too whether it be day or night  the black spanish is an exceedingly fine bird and a costly one thirtyfive dollars is the usual figure and fifty a not uncommon price for a specimen  even its eggs are worth from a dollar to a dollar and a half apiece and yet are so unwholesome that the city physician seldom or never orders them for the workhouse  still i have once or twice procured as high as a dozen at a time for nothing in the dark of the moon  the best way to raise the black spanish fowl is to go late in the evening and raise coop and all  the reason i recommend this method is that the birds being so valuable the owners do not permit them to roost around promiscuously but put them in a coop as strong as a fireproof safe and keep it in the kitchen at night  the method i speak of is not always a bright and satisfying success and yet there are so many little articles of vertu about a kitchen that if you fail on the coop you can generally bring away something else  i brought away a nice steel trap one night worth ninety cents  but what is the use in my pouring out my whole intellect on this subject i have shown the western new york poultry society that they have taken to their bosom a party who is not a spring chicken by any means but a man who knows all about poultry and is just as high up in the most efficient methods of raising it as the president of the institution himself i thank these gentlemen for the honorary membership they have conferred upon me and shall stand at all times ready and willing to testify my good feeling and my official zeal by deeds as well as by this hastily penned advice and information  whenever they are ready to go to raising poultry let them call for me any evening after eleven oclock and i shall be on hand promptly       experience of the mcwilliamses with membranous croup written about 1878  as related to the author of this book by mr mcwilliams a pleasant new york gentleman whom the said author met by chance on a journey  well to go back to where i was before i digressed to explain to you how that frightful and incurable disease membranous croupdiphtheria dw was ravaging the town and driving all mothers mad with terror i called mrs mcwilliamss attention to little penelope and said  darling i wouldnt let that child be chewing that pine stick if i were you  precious where is the harm in it  said she but at the same time preparing to take away the stickfor women cannot receive even the most palpably judicious suggestion without arguing it that is married women  i replied  love it is notorious that pine is the least nutritious wood that a child can eat  my wifes hand paused in the act of taking the stick and returned itself to her lap  she bridled perceptibly and said  hubby you know better than that  you know you do  doctors all say that the turpentine in pine wood is good for weak back and the kidneys  ahi was under a misapprehension  i did not know that the childs kidneys and spine were affected and that the family physician had recommended  who said the childs spine and kidneys were affected  my love you intimated it  the idea  i never intimated anything of the kind  why my dear it hasnt been two minutes since you said  bother what i said  i dont care what i did say  there isnt any harm in the childs chewing a bit of pine stick if she wants to and you know it perfectly well  and she shall chew it too  so there now  say no more my dear  i now see the force of your reasoning and i will go and order two or three cords of the best pine wood today  no child of mine shall want while i  oh please go along to your office and let me have some peace  a body can never make the simplest remark but you must take it up and go to arguing and arguing and arguing till you dont know what you are talking about and you never do  very well it shall be as you say  but there is a want of logic in your last remark which  however she was gone with a flourish before i could finish and had taken the child with her  that night at dinner she confronted me with a face as white as a sheet  oh mortimer theres another  little georgi gordon is taken  membranous croup  membranous croup  is there any hope for him  none in the wide world  oh what is to become of us  by and by a nurse brought in our penelope to say good night and offer the customary prayer at the mothers knee  in the midst of now i lay me down to sleep she gave a slight cough  my wife fell back like one stricken with death  but the next moment she was up and brimming with the activities which terror inspires  she commanded that the childs crib be removed from the nursery to our bedroom and she went along to see the order executed  she took me with her of course  we got matters arranged with speed  a cotbed was put up in my wifes dressing room for the nurse  but now mrs mcwilliams said we were too far away from the other baby and what if he were to have the symptoms in the nightand she blanched again poor thing  we then restored the crib and the nurse to the nursery and put up a bed for ourselves in a room adjoining  presently however mrs mcwilliams said suppose the baby should catch it from penelope  this thought struck a new panic to her heart and the tribe of us could not get the crib out of the nursery again fast enough to satisfy my wife though she assisted in her own person and wellnigh pulled the crib to pieces in her frantic hurry  we moved downstairs but there was no place there to stow the nurse and mrs mcwilliams said the nurses experience would be an inestimable help so we returned bag and baggage to our own bedroom once more and felt a great gladness like stormbuffeted birds that have found their nest again  mrs mcwilliams sped to the nursery to see how things were going on there  she was back in a moment with a new dread  she said  what can make baby sleep so  i said  why my darling baby always sleeps like a graven image  i know  i know but theres something peculiar about his sleep now he seems totohe seems to breathe so regularly  oh this is dreadful   but my dear he always breathes regularly  oh i know it but theres something frightful about it now  his nurse is too young and inexperienced  maria shall stay there with her and be on hand if anything happens  that is a good idea but who will help you  you can help me all i want  i wouldnt allow anybody to do anything but myself anyhow at such a time as this  i said i would feel mean to lie abed and sleep and leave her to watch and toil over our little patient all the weary night  but she reconciled me to it  so old maria departed and took up her ancient quarters in the nursery  penelope coughed twice in her sleep  oh why dont that doctor come  mortimer this room is too warm  this room is certainly too warm  turn off the registerquick  i shut it off glancing at the thermometer at the same time and wondering to myself if 70 was too warm for a sick child  the coachman arrived from downtown now with the news that our physician was ill and confined to his bed  mrs mcwilliams turned a dead eye upon me and said in a dead voice  there is a providence in it  it is foreordained  he never was sick before  never  we have not been living as we ought to live mortimer time and time again i have told you so  now you see the result  our child will never get well  be thankful if you can forgive yourself i never can forgive myself  i said without intent to hurt but with heedless choice of words that i could not see that we had been living such an abandoned life  mortimer  do you want to bring the judgment upon baby too  then she began to cry but suddenly exclaimed  the doctor must have sent medicines  i said  certainly  they are here  i was only waiting for you to give me a chance  well do give them to me  dont you know that every moment is precious now  but what was the use in sending medicines when he knows that the disease is incurable  i said that while there was life there was hope  hope  mortimer you know no more what you are talking about than the child unborn  if you wouldas i live the directions say give one teaspoonful once an hour  once an houras if we had a whole year before us to save the child in  mortimer please hurry  give the poor perishing thing a tablespoonful and try to be quick  why my dear a tablespoonful might  dont drive me frantic        there there there my precious my own its nasty bitter stuff but its good for nellygood for mothers precious darling and it will make her well  there there there put the little head on mammas breast and go to sleep and pretty soonoh i know she cant live till morning  mortimer a tablespoonful every halfhour willoh the child needs belladonna too i know she doesand aconite  get them mortimer  now do let me have my way  you know nothing about these things  we now went to bed placing the crib close to my wifes pillow  all this turmoil had worn upon me and within two minutes i was something more than half asleep  mrs mcwilliams roused me  darling is that register turned on  no  i thought as much  please turn it on at once  this room is cold  i turned it on and presently fell asleep again  i was aroused once more  dearie would you mind moving the crib to your side of the bed  it is nearer the register  i moved it but had a collision with the rug and woke up the child  i dozed off once more while my wife quieted the sufferer  but in a little while these words came murmuring remotely through the fog of my drowsiness  mortimer if we only had some goose greasewill you ring  i climbed dreamily out and stepped on a cat which responded with a protest and would have got a convincing kick for it if a chair had not got it instead  now mortimer why do you want to turn up the gas and wake up the child again  because i want to see how much i am hurt caroline  well look at the chair tooi have no doubt it is ruined  poor cat suppose you had  now i am not going to suppose anything about the cat  it never would have occurred if maria had been allowed to remain here and attend to these duties which are in her line and are not in mine  now mortimer i should think you would be ashamed to make a remark like that  it is a pity if you cannot do the few little things i ask of you at such an awful time as this when our child  there there i will do anything you want  but i cant raise anybody with this bell  theyre all gone to bed  where is the goose grease  on the mantelpiece in the nursery  if youll step there and speak to maria  i fetched the goose grease and went to sleep again  once more i was called  mortimer i so hate to disturb you but the room is still too cold for me to try to apply this stuff  would you mind lighting the fire  it is all ready to touch a match to  i dragged myself out and lit the fire and then sat down disconsolate  mortimer dont sit there and catch your death of cold  come to bed  as i was stepping in she said  but wait a moment  please give the child some more of the medicine  which i did  it was a medicine which made a child more or less lively so my wife made use of its waking interval to strip it and grease it all over with the goose oil  i was soon asleep once more but once more i had to get up  mortimer i feel a draft  i feel it distinctly  there is nothing so bad for this disease as a draft  please move the crib in front of the fire  i did it and collided with the rug again which i threw in the fire mrs mcwilliams sprang out of bed and rescued it and we had some words i had another trifling interval of sleep and then got up by request and constructed a flaxseed poultice  this was placed upon the childs breast and left there to do its healing work  a woodfire is not a permanent thing  i got up every twenty minutes and renewed ours and this gave mrs mcwilliams the opportunity to shorten the times of giving the medicines by ten minutes which was a great satisfaction to her  now and then between times i reorganized the flaxseed poultices and applied sinapisms and other sorts of blisters where unoccupied places could be found upon the child  well toward morning the wood gave out and my wife wanted me to go down cellar and get some more  i said  my dear it is a laborious job and the child must be nearly warm enough with her extra clothing  now mightnt we put on another layer of poultices and  i did not finish because i was interrupted  i lugged wood up from below for some little time and then turned in and fell to snoring as only a man can whose strength is all gone and whose soul is worn out  just at broad daylight i felt a grip on my shoulder that brought me to my senses suddenly  my wife was glaring down upon me and gasping  as soon as she could command her tongue she said  it is all over  all over  the childs perspiring  what shall we do  mercy how you terrify me  i dont know what we ought to do  maybe if we scraped her and put her in the draft again  oh idiot  there is not a moment to lose  go for the doctor go yourself  tell him he must come dead or alive  i dragged that poor sick man from his bed and brought him  he looked at the child and said she was not dying  this was joy unspeakable to me but it made my wife as mad as if he had offered her a personal affront then he said the childs cough was only caused by some trifling irritation or other in the throat  at this i thought my wife had a mind to show him the door  now the doctor said he would make the child cough harder and dislodge the trouble  so he gave her something that sent her into a spasm of coughing and presently up came a little wood splinter or so  this child has no membranous croup said he  she has been chewing a bit of pine shingle or something of the kind and got some little slivers in her throat  they wont do her any hurt  no said i i can well believe that  indeed the turpentine that is in them is very good for certain sorts of diseases that are peculiar to children  my wife will tell you so  but she did not  she turned away in disdain and left the room and since that time there is one episode in our life which we never refer to hence the tide of our days flows by in deep and untroubled serenity  very few married men have such an experience as mcwilliamss and so the author of this book thought that maybe the novelty of it would give it a passing interest to the reader       my first literary venture  i was a very smart child at the age of thirteenan unusually smart child i thought at the time  it was then that i did my first newspaper scribbling and most unexpectedly to me it stirred up a fine sensation in the community  it did indeed and i was very proud of it too  i was a printers devil and a progressive and aspiring one  my uncle had me on his paper the weekly hannibal journal two dollars a year in advance five hundred subscribers and they paid in cordwood cabbages and unmarketable turnips and on a lucky summers day he left town to be gone a week and asked me if i thought i could edit one issue of the paper judiciously  ah didnt i want to try  higgins was the editor on the rival paper  he had lately been jilted and one night a friend found an open note on the poor fellows bed in which he stated that he could not longer endure life and had drowned himself in bear creek  the friend ran down there and discovered higgins wading back to shore  he had concluded he wouldnt  the village was full of it for several days but higgins did not suspect it  i thought this was a fine opportunity i wrote an elaborately wretched account of the whole matter and then illustrated it with villainous cuts engraved on the bottoms of wooden type with a jackknifeone of them a picture of higgins wading out into the creek in his shirt with a lantern sounding the depth of the water with a walkingstick  i thought it was desperately funny and was densely unconscious that there was any moral obliquity about such a publication  being satisfied with this effort i looked around for other worlds to conquer and it struck me that it would make good interesting matter to charge the editor of a neighboring country paper with a piece of gratuitous rascality and see him squirm  i did it putting the article into the form of a parody on the burial of sir john mooreand a pretty crude parody it was too  then i lampooned two prominent citizens outrageouslynot because they had done anything to deserve but merely because i thought it was my duty to make the paper lively  next i gently touched up the newest strangerthe lion of the day the gorgeous journeyman tailor from quincy  he was a simpering coxcomb of the first water and the loudest dressed man in the state  he was an inveterate womankiller  every week he wrote lushy poetry for the journal about his newest conquest  his rhymes for my week were headed to mary in hl meaning to mary in hannibal of course  but while setting up the piece i was suddenly riven from head to heel by what i regarded as a perfect thunderbolt of humor and i compressed it into a snappy footnote at the bottomthus we will let this thing pass just this once but we wish mr j gordon runnels to understand distinctly that we have a character to sustain and from this time forth when he wants to commune with his friends in hl he must select some other medium than the columns of this journal  the paper came out and i never knew any little thing attract so much attention as those playful trifles of mine  for once the hannibal journal was in demanda novelty it had not experienced before  the whole town was stirred  higgins dropped in with a doublebarreled shotgun early in the forenoon  when he found that it was an infant as he called me that had done him the damage he simply pulled my ears and went away but he threw up his situation that night and left town for good  the tailor came with his goose and a pair of shears but he despised me too and departed for the south that night the two lampooned citizens came with threats of libel and went away incensed at my insignificance  the country editor pranced in with a warwhoop next day suffering for blood to drink but he ended by forgiving me cordially and inviting me down to the drug store to wash away all animosity in a friendly bumper of fahnestocks vermifuge it was his little joke  my uncle was very angry when he got back unreasonably so i thought considering what an impetus i had given the paper and considering also that gratitude for his preservation ought to have been uppermost in his mind inasmuch as by his delay he had so wonderfully escaped dissection tomahawking libel and getting his head shot off  but he softened when he looked at the accounts and saw that i had actually booked the unparalleled number of thirtythree new subscribers and had the vegetables to show for it cordwood cabbage beans and unsalable turnips enough to run the family for two years       how the author was sold in newarkwritten about 1869  it is seldom pleasant to tell on oneself but some times it is a sort of relief to a man to make a confession  i wish to unburden my mind now and yet i almost believe that i am moved to do it more because i long to bring censure upon another man than because i desire to pour balm upon my wounded heart i dont know what balm is but i believe it is the correct expression to use in this connectionnever having seen any balm you may remember that i lectured in newark lately for the young gentlemen of thesociety  i did at any rate  during the afternoon of that day i was talking with one of the young gentlemen just referred to and he said he had an uncle who from some cause or other seemed to have grown permanently bereft of all emotion  and with tears in his eyes this young man said oh if i could only see him laugh once more oh if i could only see him weep  i was touched  i could never withstand distress  i said bring him to my lecture  ill start him for you  oh if you could but do it  if you could but do it all our family would bless you for evermorefor he is so very dear to us  oh my benefactor can you make him laugh can you bring soothing tears to those parched orbs  i was profoundly moved  i said my son bring the old party round i have got some jokes in that lecture that will make him laugh if there is any laugh in him and if they miss fire i have got some others that will make him cry or kill him one or the other  then the young man blessed me and wept on my neck and went after his uncle  he placed him in full view in the second row of benches that night and i began on him  i tried him with mild jokes then with severe ones i dosed him with bad jokes and riddled him with good ones i fired old stale jokes into him and peppered him fore and aft with redhot new ones i warmed up to my work and assaulted him on the right and left in front and behind i fumed and sweated and charged and ranted till i was hoarse and sick and frantic and furious but i never moved him oncei never started a smile or a tear  never a ghost of a smile and never a suspicion of moisture  i was astounded  i closed the lecture at last with one despairing shriekwith one wild burst of humor and hurled a joke of supernatural atrocity full at him  then i sat down bewildered and exhausted  the president of the society came up and bathed my head with cold water and said what made you carry on so toward the last  i said i was trying to make that confounded old fool laugh in the second row  and he said well you were wasting your time because he is deaf and dumb and as blind as a badger  now was that any way for that old mans nephew to impose on a stranger and orphan like me  i ask you as a man and brother if that was any way for him to do       the office borewritten about 1869  he arrives just as regularly as the clock strikes nine in the morning and so he even beats the editor sometimes and the porter must leave his work and climb two or three pairs of stairs to unlock the sanctum door and let him in  he lights one of the office pipesnot reflecting perhaps that the editor may be one of those stuckup people who would as soon have a stranger defile his toothbrush as his pipestem  then he begins to lollfor a person who can consent to loaf his useless life away in ignominious indolence has not the energy to sit up straight  he stretches full length on the sofa awhile then draws up to half length then gets into a chair hangs his head back and his arms abroad and stretches his legs till the rims of his bootheels rest upon the floor by and by sits up and leans forward with one leg or both over the arm of the chair  but it is still observable that with all his changes of position he never assumes the upright or a fraudful affectation of dignity  from time to time he yawns and stretches and scratches himself with a tranquil mangy enjoyment and now and then he grunts a kind of stuffy overfed grunt which is full of animal contentment  at rare and long intervals however he sighs a sigh that is the eloquent expression of a secret confession to wit i am useless and a nuisance a cumberer of the earth  the bore and his comradesfor there are usually from two to four on hand day and nightmix into the conversation when men come in to see the editors for a moment on business they hold noisy talks among themselves about politics in particular and all other subjects in generaleven warming up after a fashion sometimes and seeming to take almost a real interest in what they are discussing  they ruthlessly call an editor from his work with such a remark as did you see this smith in the gazette and proceed to read the paragraph while the sufferer reins in his impatient pen and listens they often loll and sprawl round the office hour after hour swapping anecdotes and relating personal experiences to each other hairbreadth escapes social encounters with distinguished men election reminiscences sketches of odd characters etc  and through all those hours they never seem to comprehend that they are robbing the editors of their time and the public of journalistic excellence in next days paper  at other times they drowse or dreamily pore over exchanges or droop limp and pensive over the chairarms for an hour  even this solemn silence is small respite to the editor for the next uncomfortable thing to having people look over his shoulders perhaps is to have them sit by in silence and listen to the scratching of his pen  if a body desires to talk private business with one of the editors he must call him outside for no hint milder than blastingpowder or nitroglycerin would be likely to move the bores out of listeningdistance  to have to sit and endure the presence of a bore day after day to feel your cheerful spirits begin to sink as his footstep sounds on the stair and utterly vanish away as his tiresome form enters the door to suffer through his anecdotes and die slowly to his reminiscences to feel always the fetters of his clogging presence to long hopelessly for one single days privacy to note with a shudder by and by that to contemplate his funeral in fancy has ceased to soothe to imagine him undergoing in strict and fearful detail the tortures of the ancient inquisition has lost its power to satisfy the heart and that even to wish him millions and millions and millions of miles in tophet is able to bring only a fitful gleam of joy to have to endure all this day after day and week after week and month after month is an affliction that transcends any other that men suffer physical pain is pastime to it and hanging a pleasure excursion       johnny greer  the church was densely crowded that lovely summer sabbath said the sundayschool superintendent and all as their eyes rested upon the small coffin seemed impressed by the poor black boys fate  above the stillness the pastors voice rose and chained the interest of every ear as he told with many an envied compliment how that the brave noble daring little johnny greer when he saw the drowned body sweeping down toward the deep part of the river whence the agonized parents never could have recovered it in this world gallantly sprang into the stream and at the risk of his life towed the corpse to shore and held it fast till help came and secured it  johnny greer was sitting just in front of me a ragged streetboy with eager eye turned upon him instantly and said in a hoarse whisper  no but did you though  yes  towed the carkiss ashore and saved it yoself  yes  cracky  what did they give you  nothing  what with intense disgust  dyou know what id a done  id a anchored him out in the stream and said five dollars gents or you carnt have yo nigger       the facts in the case of the great beef contractwritten about 1867  in as few words as possible i wish to lay before the nation what share howsoever small i have had in this matterthis matter which has so exercised the public mind engendered so much illfeeling and so filled the newspapers of both continents with distorted statements and extravagant comments  the origin of this distressful thing was thisand i assert here that every fact in the following résumé can be amply proved by the official records of the general government  john wilson mackenzie of rotterdam chemung county new jersey deceased contracted with the general government on or about the 10th day of october 1861 to furnish to general sherman the sum total of thirty barrels of beef  very well  he started after sherman with the beef but when he got to washington sherman had gone to manassas so he took the beef and followed him there but arrived too late he followed him to nashville and from nashville to chattanooga and from chattanooga to atlantabut he never could overtake him  at atlanta he took a fresh start and followed him clear through his march to the sea  he arrived too late again by a few days but hearing that sherman was going out in the quaker city excursion to the holy land he took shipping for beirut calculating to head off the other vessel when he arrived in jerusalem with his beef he learned that sherman had not sailed in the quaker city but had gone to the plains to fight the indians  he returned to america and started for the rocky mountains after sixtyeight days of arduous travel on the plains and when he had got within four miles of shermans headquarters he was tomahawked and scalped and the indians got the beef  they got all of it but one barrel  shermans army captured that and so even in death the bold navigator partly fulfilled his contract  in his will which he had kept like a journal he bequeathed the contract to his son bartholomew w bartholomew w  made out the following bill and then died       the united states                 in account with john wilson mackenzie of new jersey                deceased                             dr       to thirty barrels of beef for general sherman at 100 3000      to traveling expenses and transportation           14000                 total                     17000                recd payt   he died then but he left the contract to wm j martin who tried to collect it but died before he got through  he left it to barker j allen and he tried to collect it also  he did not survive  barker j allen left it to anson g rogers who attempted to collect it and got along as far as the ninth auditors office when death the great leveler came all unsummoned and foreclosed on him also  he left the bill to a relative of his in connecticut vengeance hopkins by name who lasted four weeks and two days and made the best time on record coming within one of reaching the twelfth auditor  in his will he gave the contract bill to his uncle by the name of obejoyful johnson  it was too undermining for joyful  his last words were weep not for mei am willing to go  and so he was poor soul  seven people inherited the contract after that but they all died  so it came into my hands at last  it fell to me through a relative by the name of hubbard bethlehem hubbard of indiana  he had had a grudge against me for a long time but in his last moments he sent for me and forgave me everything and weeping gave me the beef contract  this ends the history of it up to the time that i succeeded to the property  i will now endeavor to set myself straight before the nation in everything that concerns my share in the matter  i took this beef contract and the bill for mileage and transportation to the president of the united states  he said well sir what can i do for you  i said sire on or about the 10th day of october 1861 john wilson mackenzie of rotterdam chemung county new jersey deceased contracted with the general government to furnish to general sherman the sum total of thirty barrels of beef  he stopped me there and dismissed me from his presencekindly but firmly  the next day i called on the secretary of state  he said well sir  i said your royal highness on or about the 10th day of october 1861 john wilson mackenzie of rotterdam chemung county new jersey deceased contracted with the general government to furnish to general sherman the sum total of thirty barrels of beef  that will do sirthat will do this office has nothing to do with contracts for beef  i was bowed out  i thought the matter all over and finally the following day i visited the secretary of the navy who said speak quickly sir do not keep me waiting  i said your royal highness on or about the 10th day of october 1861 john wilson mackenzie of rotterdam chemung county new jersey deceased contracted with the general government to general sherman the sum total of thirty barrels of beef  well it was as far as i could get  he had nothing to do with beef contracts for general sherman either  i began to think it was a curious kind of government  it looked somewhat as if they wanted to get out of paying for that beef  the following day i went to the secretary of the interior  i said your imperial highness on or about the 10th day of october  that is sufficient sir  i have heard of you before  go take your infamous beef contract out of this establishment  the interior department has nothing whatever to do with subsistence for the army  i went away  but i was exasperated now  i said i would haunt them i would infest every department of this iniquitous government till that contract business was settled  i would collect that bill or fall as fell my predecessors trying  i assailed the postmastergeneral i besieged the agricultural department i waylaid the speaker of the house of representatives  they had nothing to do with army contracts for beef  i moved upon the commissioner of the patent office  i said your august excellency on or about  perdition have you got here with your incendiary beef contract at last  we have nothing to do with beef contracts for the army my dear sir  oh that is all very wellbut somebody has got to pay for that beef it has got to be paid now too or ill confiscate this old patent office and everything in it  but my dear sir  it dont make any difference sir  the patent office is liable for that beef i reckon and liable or not liable the patent office has got to pay for it  never mind the details  it ended in a fight  the patent office won but i found out something to my advantage  i was told that the treasury department was the proper place for me to go to  i went there  i waited two hours and a half and then i was admitted to the first lord of the treasury  i said most noble grave and reverend signor on or about the 10th day of october 1861 john wilson macken  that is sufficient sir  i have heard of you  go to the first auditor of the treasury  i did so  he sent me to the second auditor  the second auditor sent me to the third and the third sent me to the first comptroller of the cornbeef division  this began to look like business  he examined his books and all his loose papers but found no minute of the beef contract i went to the second comptroller of the cornbeef division  he examined his books and his loose papers but with no success  i was encouraged during that week i got as far as the sixth comptroller in that division the next week i got through the claims department the third week i began and completed the mislaid contracts department and got a foothold in the dead reckoning department  i finished that in three days  there was only one place left for it now  i laid siege to the commissioner of odds and ends  to his clerk ratherhe was not there himself  there were sixteen beautiful young ladies in the room writing in books and there were seven wellfavored young clerks showing them how  the young women smiled up over their shoulders and the clerks smiled back at them and all went merry as a marriage bell  two or three clerks that were reading the newspapers looked at me rather hard but went on reading and nobody said anything  however i had been used to this kind of alacrity from fourth assistant junior clerks all through my eventful career from the very day i entered the first office of the cornbeef bureau clear till i passed out of the last one in the dead reckoning division  i had got so accomplished by this time that i could stand on one foot from the moment i entered an office till a clerk spoke to me without changing more than two or maybe three times  so i stood there till i had changed four different times  then i said to one of the clerks who was reading  illustrious vagrant where is the grand turk  what do you mean sir whom do you mean  if you mean the chief of the bureau he is out  will he visit the harem today  the young man glared upon me awhile and then went on reading his paper but i knew the ways of those clerks  i knew i was safe if he got through before another new york mail arrived  he only had two more papers left after a while he finished them and then he yawned and asked me what i wanted  renowned and honored imbecile on or about  you are the beefcontract man  give me your papers  he took them and for a long time he ransacked his odds and ends finally he found the northwest passage as i regarded ithe found the long lost record of that beef contracthe found the rock upon which so many of my ancestors had split before they ever got to it  i was deeply moved  and yet i rejoicedfor i had survived  i said with emotion give it me  the government will settle now  he waved me back and said there was something yet to be done first  where is this john wilson mackenzie  said he  dead  when did he die  he didnt die at allhe was killed  how  tomahawked  who tomahawked him  why an indian of course  you didnt suppose it was the superintendent of a sundayschool did you  no  an indian was it  the same  name of the indian  his name  i dont know his name  must have his name  who saw the tomahawking done  i dont know  you were not present yourself then  which you can see by my hair  i was absent  then how do you know that mackenzie is dead  because he certainly died at that time and i have every reason to believe that he has been dead ever since  i know he has in fact  we must have proofs  have you got the indian  of course not  well you must get him  have you got the tomahawk  i never thought of such a thing  you must get the tomahawk  you must produce the indian and the tomahawk  if mackenzies death can be proven by these you can then go before the commission appointed to audit claims with some show of getting your bill under such headway that your children may possibly live to receive the money and enjoy it  but that mans death must be proven however i may as well tell you that the government will never pay that transportation and those traveling expenses of the lamented mackenzie it may possibly pay for the barrel of beef that shermans soldiers captured if you can get a relief bill through congress making an appropriation for that purpose but it will not pay for the twentynine barrels the indians ate  then there is only a hundred dollars due me and that isnt certain after all mackenzies travels in europe asia and america with that beef after all his trials and tribulations and transportation after the slaughter of all those innocents that tried to collect that bill  young man why didnt the first comptroller of the cornbeef division tell me this  he didnt know anything about the genuineness of your claim  why didnt the second tell me why didnt the third why didnt all those divisions and departments tell me  none of them knew  we do things by routine here  you have followed the routine and found out what you wanted to know  it is the best way it is the only way  it is very regular and very slow but it is very certain  yes certain death  it has been to the most of our tribe  i begin to feel that i too am called young man you love the bright creature yonder with the gentle blue eyes and the steel pens behind her earsi see it in your soft glances you wish to marry herbut you are poor  here hold out your hand here is the beef contract go take her and be happy heaven bless you my children  this is all i know about the great beef contract that has created so much talk in the community  the clerk to whom i bequeathed it died  i know nothing further about the contract or any one connected with it  i only know that if a man lives long enough he can trace a thing through the circumlocution office of washington and find out after much labor and trouble and delay that which he could have found out on the first day if the business of the circumlocution office were as ingeniously systematized as it would be if it were a great private mercantile institution       the case of george fisher  some years ago about 1867 when this was first published few people believed it but considered it a mere extravaganza  in these latter days it seems hard to realize that there was ever a time when the robbing of our government was a novelty  the very man who showed me where to find the documents for this case was at that very time spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in washington for a mail steamship concern in the effort to procure a subsidy for the companya fact which was a long time in coming to the surface but leaked out at last and underwent congressional investigation  this is history  it is not a wild extravaganza like john wilson mackenzies great beef contract but is a plain statement of facts and circumstances with which the congress of the united states has interested itself from time to time during the long period of half a century  i will not call this matter of george fishers a great deathless and unrelenting swindle upon the government and people of the united states for it has never been so decided and i hold that it is a grave and solemn wrong for a writer to cast slurs or call names when such is the casebut will simply present the evidence and let the reader deduce his own verdict  then we shall do nobody injustice and our consciences shall be clear  on or about the 1st day of september 1813 the creek war being then in progress in florida the crops herds and houses of mr george fisher a citizen were destroyed either by the indians or by the united states troops in pursuit of them  by the terms of the law if the indians destroyed the property there was no relief for fisher but if the troops destroyed it the government of the united states was debtor to fisher for the amount involved  george fisher must have considered that the indians destroyed the property because although he lived several years afterward he does not appear to have ever made any claim upon the government  in the course of time fisher died and his widow married again and by and by nearly twenty years after that dimly remembered raid upon fishers cornfields the widow fishers new husband petitioned congress for pay for the property and backed up the petition with many depositions and affidavits which purported to prove that the troops and not the indians destroyed the property that the troops for some inscrutable reason deliberately burned down houses or cabins valued at 600 the same belonging to a peaceable private citizen and alsodestroyed various other property belonging to the same citizen  but congress declined to believe that the troops were such idiots after overtaking and scattering a band of indians proved to have been found destroying fishers property as to calmly continue the work of destruction themselves and make a complete job of what the indians had only commenced  so congress denied the petition of the heirs of george fisher in 1832 and did not pay them a cent  we hear no more from them officially until 1848 sixteen years after their first attempt on the treasury and a full generation after the death of the man whose fields were destroyed  the new generation of fisher heirs then came forward and put in a bill for damages  the second auditor awarded them 8873 being half the damage sustained by fisher the auditor said the testimony showed that at least half the destruction was done by the indians before the troops started in pursuit and of course the government was not responsible for that half  2  that was in april 1848  in december 1848 the heirs of george fisher deceased came forward and pleaded for a revision of their bill of damages  the revision was made but nothing new could be found in their favor except an error of 100 in the former calculation  however in order to keep up the spirits of the fisher family the auditor concluded to go back and allow interest from the date of the first petition 1832 to the date when the bill of damages was awarded  this sent the fishers home happy with sixteen years interest on 8873the same amounting to 899794  total 1787094  3  for an entire year the suffering fisher family remained quieteven satisfied after a fashion  then they swooped down upon the government with their wrongs once more  that old patriot attorneygeneral toucey burrowed through the musty papers of the fishers and discovered one more chance for the desolate orphansinterest on that original award of 8873 from date of destruction of the property 1813 up to 1832 result 1000489 for the indigent fishers  so now we have first 8873 damages second interest on it from 1832 to 1848 899794 third interest on it dated back to 1813 1000489  total 2787583 what better investment for a greatgrandchild than to get the indians to burn a cornfield for him sixty or seventy years before his birth and plausibly lay it on lunatic united states troops  4  strange as it may seem the fishers let congress alone for five yearsor what is perhaps more likely failed to make themselves heard by congress for that length of time  but at last in 1854 they got a hearing  they persuaded congress to pass an act requiring the auditor to reexamine their case  but this time they stumbled upon the misfortune of an honest secretary of the treasury mr james guthrie and he spoiled everything  he said in very plain language that the fishers were not only not entitled to another cent but that those children of many sorrows and acquainted with grief had been paid too much already  5  therefore another interval of rest and silence ensuedan interval which lasted four yearsviz till 1858  the right man in the right place was then secretary of warjohn b floyd of peculiar renown here was a master intellect here was the very man to succor the suffering heirs of dead and forgotten fisher  they came up from florida with a rusha great tidal wave of fishers freighted with the same old musty documents about the same immortal cornfields of their ancestor they straightway got an act passed transferring the fisher matter from the dull auditor to the ingenious floyd  what did floyd do  he said it was proved that the indians destroyed everything they could before the troops entered in pursuit  he considered therefore that what they destroyed must have consisted of the houses with all their contents and the liquor the most trifling part of the destruction and set down at only 3200 all told and that the government troops then drove them off and calmly proceeded to destroy  two hundred and twenty acres of corn in the field thirtyfive acres of wheat and nine hundred and eightysix head of live stock  what a singularly intelligent army we had in those days according to mr floyd though not according to the congress of 1832  so mr floyd decided that the government was not responsible for that 3200 worth of rubbish which the indians destroyed but was responsible for the property destroyed by the troopswhich property consisted of i quote from the printed united states senate document                                               dollars      corn at bassetts creek  3000      cattle  5000      stock hogs  1050      drove hogs  1204      wheat    350      hides  4000      corn on the alabama river  3500                           total 18104  that sum in his report mr floyd calls the full value of the property destroyed by the troops  he allows that sum to the starving fishers together with interest from 1813  from this new sum total the amounts already paid to the fishers were deducted and then the cheerful remainder a fraction under forty thousand dollars was handed to them and again they retired to florida in a condition of temporary tranquillity  their ancestors farm had now yielded them altogether nearly sixtyseven thousand dollars in cash  6  does the reader suppose that that was the end of it  does he suppose those diffident fishers were satisfied  let the evidence show  the fishers were quiet just two years  then they came swarming up out of the fertile swamps of florida with their same old documents and besieged congress once more  congress capitulated on the 1st of june 1860 and instructed mr floyd to overhaul those papers again and pay that bill a treasury clerk was ordered to go through those papers and report to mr floyd what amount was still due the emaciated fishers  this clerk i can produce him whenever he is wanted discovered what was apparently a glaring and recent forgery in the papers whereby a witnesss testimony as to the price of corn in florida in 1813 was made to name double the amount which that witness had originally specified as the price  the clerk not only called his superiors attention to this thing but in making up his brief of the case called particular attention to it in writing  that part of the brief never got before congress nor has congress ever yet had a hint of forgery existing among the fisher papers nevertheless on the basis of the double prices and totally ignoring the clerks assertion that the figures were manifestly and unquestionably a recent forgery mr floyd remarks in his new report that the testimony particularly in regard to the corn crops demands a much higher allowance than any heretofore made by the auditor or myself  so he estimates the crop at sixty bushels to the acre double what florida acres produce and then virtuously allows pay for only half the crop but allows two dollars and a half a bushel for that half when there are rusty old books and documents in the congressional library to show just what the fisher testimony showed before the forgeryviz that in the fall of 1813 corn was only worth from 125 to 150 a bushel  having accomplished this what does mr floyd do next  mr floyd with an earnest desire to execute truly the legislative will as he piously remarks goes to work and makes out an entirely new bill of fisher damages and in this new bill he placidly ignores the indians altogether puts no particle of the destruction of the fisher property upon them but even repenting him of charging them with burning the cabins and drinking the whisky and breaking the crockery lays the entire damage at the door of the imbecile united states troops down to the very last item  and not only that but uses the forgery to double the loss of corn at bassetts creek and uses it again to absolutely treble the loss of corn on the alabama river  this new and ably conceived and executed bill of mr floyds figures up as follows i copy again from the printed united states senate document        the united states in account with the legal representatives                       of george fisher deceased                                                              dolc

  total  13332318  he puts everything in this time  he does not even allow that the indians destroyed the crockery or drank the four dozen bottles of currant wine when it came to supernatural comprehensiveness in gobbling john b floyd was without his equal in his own or any other generation subtracting from the above total the 67000 already paid to george fishers implacable heirs mr floyd announced that the government was still indebted to them in the sum of sixtysix thousand five hundred and nineteen dollars and eightyfive cents which mr floyd complacently remarks will be paid accordingly to the administrator of the estate of george fisher deceased or to his attorney in fact  but sadly enough for the destitute orphans a new president came in just at this time buchanan and floyd went out and they never got their money  the first thing congress did in 1861 was to rescind the resolution of june 1 1860 under which mr floyd had been ciphering then floyd and doubtless the heirs of george fisher likewise had to give up financial business for a while and go into the confederate army and serve their country  were the heirs of george fisher killed  no  they are back now at this very time july 1870 beseeching congress through that blushing and diffident creature garrett davis to commence making payments again on their interminable and insatiable bill of damages for corn and whisky destroyed by a gang of irresponsible indians so long ago that even government redtape has failed to keep consistent and intelligent track of it  now the above are facts  they are history  any one who doubts it can send to the senate document department of the capitol for h r ex doc no 21 36th congress 2d session and for s ex doc no 106 41st congress 2d session and satisfy himself  the whole case is set forth in the first volume of the court of claims reports  it is my belief that as long as the continent of america holds together the heirs of george fisher deceased will still make pilgrimages to washington from the swamps of florida to plead for just a little more cash on their bill of damages even when they received the last of that sixtyseven thousand dollars they said it was only one fourth what the government owed them on that fruitful cornfield and as long as they choose to come they will find garrett davises to drag their vampire schemes before congress  this is not the only hereditary fraud if fraud it iswhich i have before repeatedly remarked is not proven that is being quietly handed down from generation to generation of fathers and sons through the persecuted treasury of the united states       disgraceful persecution of a boy  in san francisco the other day a welldressed boy on his way to sundayschool was arrested and thrown into the city prison for stoning chinamen  what a commentary is this upon human justice  what sad prominence it gives to our human disposition to tyrannize over the weak  san francisco has little right to take credit to herself for her treatment of this poor boy  what had the childs education been  how should he suppose it was wrong to stone a chinaman  before we side against him along with outraged san francisco let us give him a chancelet us hear the testimony for the defense  he was a welldressed boy and a sundayschool scholar and therefore the chances are that his parents were intelligent welltodo people with just enough natural villainy in their composition to make them yearn after the daily papers and enjoy them and so this boy had opportunities to learn all through the week how to do right as well as on sunday  it was in this way that he found out that the great commonwealth of california imposes an unlawful miningtax upon john the foreigner and allows patrick the foreigner to dig gold for nothingprobably because the degraded mongol is at no expense for whisky and the refined celt cannot exist without it  it was in this way that he found out that a respectable number of the taxgatherersit would be unkind to say all of themcollect the tax twice instead of once and that inasmuch as they do it solely to discourage chinese immigration into the mines it is a thing that is much applauded and likewise regarded as being singularly facetious  it was in this way that he found out that when a white man robs a sluicebox by the term white man is meant spaniards mexicans portuguese irish hondurans peruvians chileans etc etc they make him leave the camp and when a chinaman does that thing they hang him  it was in this way that he found out that in many districts of the vast pacific coast so strong is the wild free love of justice in the hearts of the people that whenever any secret and mysterious crime is committed they say let justice be done though the heavens fall and go straightway and swing a chinaman  it was in this way that he found out that by studying one half of each days local items it would appear that the police of san francisco were either asleep or dead and by studying the other half it would seem that the reporters were gone mad with admiration of the energy the virtue the high effectiveness and the daredevil intrepidity of that very policemaking exultant mention of how the arguseyed officer soandso captured a wretched knave of a chinaman who was stealing chickens and brought him gloriously to the city prison and how the gallant officer suchandsuchaone quietly kept an eye on the movements of an unsuspecting almondeyed son of confucius your reporter is nothing if not facetious following him around with that faroff look of vacancy and unconsciousness always so finely affected by that inscrutable being the fortydollar policeman during a waking interval and captured him at last in the very act of placing his hands in a suspicious manner upon a paper of tacks left by the owner in an exposed situation and how one officer performed this prodigious thing and another officer that and another the otherand pretty much every one of these performances having for a dazzling central incident a chinaman guilty of a shillings worth of crime an unfortunate whose misdemeanor must be hurrahed into something enormous in order to keep the public from noticing how many really important rascals went uncaptured in the mean time and how overrated those glorified policemen actually are  it was in this way that the boy found out that the legislature being aware that the constitution has made america an asylum for the poor and the oppressed of all nations and that therefore the poor and oppressed who fly to our shelter must not be charged a disabling admission fee made a law that every chinaman upon landing must be vaccinated upon the wharf and pay to the states appointed officer ten dollars for the service when there are plenty of doctors in san francisco who would be glad enough to do it for him for fifty cents  it was in this way that the boy found out that a chinaman had no rights that any man was bound to respect that he had no sorrows that any man was bound to pity that neither his life nor his liberty was worth the purchase of a penny when a white man needed a scapegoat that nobody loved chinamen nobody befriended them nobody spared them suffering when it was convenient to inflict it everybody individuals communities the majesty of the state itself joined in hating abusing and persecuting these humble strangers  and therefore what could have been more natural than for this sunnyheartedboy tripping along to sundayschool with his mind teeming with freshly learned incentives to high and virtuous action to say to himself  ah there goes a chinaman  god will not love me if i do not stone him  and for this he was arrested and put in the city jail  everything conspired to teach him that it was a high and holy thing to stone a chinaman and yet he no sooner attempts to do his duty than he is punished for ithe poor chap who has been aware all his life that one of the principal recreations of the police out toward the gold refinery is to look on with tranquil enjoyment while the butchers of brannan street set their dogs on unoffending chinamen and make them flee for their lives  i have many such memories in my mind but am thinking just at present of one particular one where the brannan street butchers set their dogs on a chinaman who was quietly passing with a basket of clothes on his head and while the dogs mutilated his flesh a butcher increased the hilarity of the occasion by knocking some of the chinamans teeth down his throat with half a brick  this incident sticks in my memory with a more malevolent tenacity perhaps on account of the fact that i was in the employ of a san francisco journal at the time and was not allowed to publish it because it might offend some of the peculiar element that subscribed for the paper  keeping in mind the tuition in the humanities which the entire pacific coast gives its youth there is a very sublimity of incongruity in the virtuous flourish with which the good city fathers of san francisco proclaim as they have lately done that the police are positively ordered to arrest all boys of every description and wherever found who engage in assaulting chinamen  still let us be truly glad they have made the order notwithstanding its inconsistency and let us rest perfectly confident the police are glad too  because there is no personal peril in arresting boys provided they be of the small kind and the reporters will have to laud their performances just as loyally as ever or go without items  the new form for local items in san francisco will now be the evervigilant and efficient officer soandso succeeded yesterday afternoon in arresting master tommy jones after a determined resistance etc etc followed by the customary statistics and final hurrah with its unconscious sarcasm we are happy in being able to state that this is the fortyseventh boy arrested by this gallant officer since the new ordinance went into effect  the most extraordinary activity prevails in the police department  nothing like it has been seen since we can remember       the judges spirited woman  i was sitting here said the judge in this old pulpit holding court and we were trying a big wickedlooking spanish desperado for killing the husband of a bright pretty mexican woman it was a lazy summer day and an awfully long one and the witnesses were tedious  none of us took any interest in the trial except that nervous uneasy devil of a mexican womanbecause you know how they love and how they hate and this one had loved her husband with all her might and now she had boiled it all down into hate and stood here spitting it at that spaniard with her eyes and i tell you she would stir me up too with a little of her summer lightning occasionally  well i had my coat off and my heels up lolling and sweating and smoking one of those cabbage cigars the san francisco people used to think were good enough for us in those times and the lawyers they all had their coats off and were smoking and whittling and the witnesses the same and so was the prisoner  well the fact is there warnt any interest in a murder trial then because the fellow was always brought in not guilty the jury expecting him to do as much for them some time and although the evidence was straight and square against this spaniard we knew we could not convict him without seeming to be rather highhanded and sort of reflecting on every gentleman in the community for there warnt any carriages and liveries then and so the only style there was was to keep your private graveyard  but that woman seemed to have her heart set on hanging that spaniard and youd ought to have seen how she would glare on him a minute and then look up at me in her pleading way and then turn and for the next five minutes search the jurys faces and by and by drop her face in her hands for just a little while as if she was most ready to give up but out shed come again directly and be as live and anxious as ever  but when the jury announced the verdictnot guiltyand i told the prisoner he was acquitted and free to go that woman rose up till she appeared to be as tall and grand as a seventyfourgun ship and says she  judge do i understand you to say that this man is not guilty that murdered my husband without any cause before my own eyes and my little childrens and that all has been done to him that ever justice and the law can do the same says i  and then what do you reckon she did  why she turned on that smirking spanish fool like a wildcat and out with a navy and shot him dead in open court  that was spirited i am willing to admit  wasnt it though said the judge admiringly  i wouldnt have missed it for anything  i adjourned court right on the spot and we put on our coats and went out and took up a collection for her and her cubs and sent them over the mountains to their friends ah she was a spirited wench       information wanted                                washington december 10 1867  could you give me any information respecting such islands if any as the government is going to purchase  it is an uncle of mine that wants to know  he is an industrious man and well disposed and wants to make a living in an honest humble way but more especially he wants to be quiet  he wishes to settle down and be quiet and unostentatious  he has been to the new island st thomas but he says he thinks things are unsettled there  he went there early with an attache of the state department who was sent down with money to pay for the island  my uncle had his money in the same box and so when they went ashore getting a receipt the sailors broke open the box and took all the money not making any distinction between government money which was legitimate money to be stolen and my uncles which was his own private property and should have been respected  but he came home and got some more and went back  and then he took the fever  there are seven kinds of fever down there you know and as his blood was out of order by reason of loss of sleep and general wear and tear of mind he failed to cure the first fever and then somehow he got the other six he is not a kind of man that enjoys fevers though he is well meaning and always does what he thinks is right and so he was a good deal annoyed when it appeared he was going to die  but he worried through and got well and started a farm  he fenced it in and the next day that great storm came on and washed the most of it over to gibraltar or around there somewhere  he only said in his patient way that it was gone and he wouldnt bother about trying to find out where it went to though it was his opinion it went to gibraltar  then he invested in a mountain and started a farm up there so as to be out of the way when the sea came ashore again  it was a good mountain and a good farm but it wasnt any use an earthquake came the next night and shook it all down  it was all fragments you know and so mixed up with another mans property that he could not tell which were his fragments without going to law and he would not do that because his main object in going to st thomas was to be quiet  all that he wanted was to settle down and be quiet  he thought it all over and finally he concluded to try the low ground again especially as he wanted to start a brickyard this time  he bought a flat and put out a hundred thousand bricks to dry preparatory to baking them  but luck appeared to be against him  a volcano shoved itself through there that night and elevated his brickyard about two thousand feet in the air  it irritated him a good deal  he has been up there and he says the bricks are all baked right enough but he cant get them down  at first he thought maybe the government would get the bricks down for him because since government bought the island it ought to protect the property where a man has invested in good faith but all he wants is quiet and so he is not going to apply for the subsidy he was thinking about  he went back there last week in a couple of ships of war to prospect around the coast for a safe place for a farm where he could be quiet but a great tidal wave came and hoisted both of the ships out into one of the interior counties and he came near losing his life  so he has given up prospecting in a ship and is discouraged  well now he dont know what to do  he has tried alaska but the bears kept after him so much and kept him so much on the jump as it were that he had to leave the country  he could not be quiet there with those bears prancing after him all the time  that is how he came to go to the new island we have boughtst thomas  but he is getting to think st thomas is not quiet enough for a man of his turn of mind and that is why he wishes me to find out if government is likely to buy some more islands shortly  he has heard that government is thinking about buying porto rico  if that is true he wishes to try porto rico if it is a quiet place  how is porto rico for his style of man  do you think the government will buy it       some learned fables for good old boys and girls  in three parts   part first  how the animals of the wood sent out a scientific expedition  once the creatures of the forest held a great convention and appointed a commission consisting of the most illustrious scientists among them to go forth clear beyond the forest and out into the unknown and unexplored world to verify the truth of the matters already taught in their schools and colleges and also to make discoveries  it was the most imposing enterprise of the kind the nation had ever embarked in  true the government had once sent dr bull frog with a picked crew to hunt for a northwesterly passage through the swamp to the righthand corner of the wood and had since sent out many expeditions to hunt for dr bull frog but they never could find him and so government finally gave him up and ennobled his mother to show its gratitude for the services her son had rendered to science  and once government sent sir grass hopper to hunt for the sources of the rill that emptied into the swamp and afterward sent out many expeditions to hunt for sir grass and at last they were successfulthey found his body but if he had discovered the sources meantime he did not let on  so government acted handsomely by deceased and many envied his funeral  but these expeditions were trifles compared with the present one for this one comprised among its servants the very greatest among the learned and besides it was to go to the utterly unvisited regions believed to lie beyond the mighty forestas we have remarked before how the members were banqueted and glorified and talked about everywhere that one of them showed himself straightway there was a crowd to gape and stare at him  finally they set off and it was a sight to see the long procession of dryland tortoises heavily laden with savants scientific instruments glowworms and fireflies for signal service provisions ants and tumblebugs to fetch and carry and delve spiders to carry the surveying chain and do other engineering duty and so forth and so on and after the tortoises came another long train of ironcladsstately and spacious mud turtles for marine transportation service and from every tortoise and every turtle flaunted a flaming gladiolus or other splendid banner at the head of the column a great band of bumblebees mosquitoes katydids and crickets discoursed martial music and the entire train was under the escort and protection of twelve picked regiments of the army worm  at the end of three weeks the expedition emerged from the forest and looked upon the great unknown world  their eyes were greeted with an impressive spectacle  a vast level plain stretched before them watered by a sinuous stream and beyond there towered up against the sky a long and lofty barrier of some kind they did not know what  the tumblebug said he believed it was simply land tilted up on its edge because he knew he could see trees on it  but professor snail and the others said  you are hired to dig sirthat is all  we need your muscle not your brains  when we want your opinion on scientific matters we will hasten to let you know  your coolness is intolerable tooloafing about here meddling with august matters of learning when the other laborers are pitching camp  go along and help handle the baggage  the tumblebug turned on his heel uncrushed unabashed observing to himself if it isnt land tilted up let me die the death of the unrighteous  professor bull frog nephew of the late explorer said he believed the ridge was the wall that inclosed the earth  he continued  our fathers have left us much learning but they had not traveled far and so we may count this a noble new discovery  we are safe for renown now even though our labors began and ended with this single achievement i wonder what this wall is built of  can it be fungus  fungus is an honorable good thing to build a wall of  professor snail adjusted his fieldglass and examined the rampart critically  finally he said  the fact that it is not diaphanous convinces me that it is a dense vapor formed by the calorification of ascending moisture dephlogisticated by refraction  a few endiometrical experiments would confirm this but it is not necessary  the thing is obvious  so he shut up his glass and went into his shell to make a note of the discovery of the worlds end and the nature of it  profound mind said professor angleworm to professor fieldmouse profound mind nothing can long remain a mystery to that august brain  night drew on apace the sentinel crickets were posted the glowworm and firefly lamps were lighted and the camp sank to silence and sleep after breakfast in the morning the expedition moved on  about noon a great avenue was reached which had in it two endless parallel bars of some kind of hard black substance raised the height of the tallest bull frog above the general level  the scientists climbed up on these and examined and tested them in various ways  they walked along them for a great distance but found no end and no break in them  they could arrive at no decision  there was nothing in the records of science that mentioned anything of this kind  but at last the bald and venerable geographer professor mud turtle a person who born poor and of a drudging low family had by his own native force raised himself to the headship of the geographers of his generation said  my friends we have indeed made a discovery here  we have found in a palpable compact and imperishable state what the wisest of our fathers always regarded as a mere thing of the imagination  humble yourselves my friends for we stand in a majestic presence  these are parallels of latitude  every heart and every head was bowed so awful so sublime was the magnitude of the discovery  many shed tears  the camp was pitched and the rest of the day given up to writing voluminous accounts of the marvel and correcting astronomical tables to fit it  toward midnight a demoniacal shriek was heard then a clattering and rumbling noise and the next instant a vast terrific eye shot by with a long tail attached and disappeared in the gloom still uttering triumphant shrieks  the poor camp laborers were stricken to the heart with fright and stampeded for the high grass in a body  but not the scientists  they had no superstitions  they calmly proceeded to exchange theories the ancient geographers opinion was asked  he went into his shell and deliberated long and profoundly  when he came out at last they all knew by his worshiping countenance that he brought light  said he  give thanks for this stupendous thing which we have been permitted to witness  it is the vernal equinox  there were shoutings and great rejoicings  but said the angleworm uncoiling after reflection this is dead summertime  very well said the turtle we are far from our region the season differs with the difference of time between the two points  ah true  true enough  but it is night  how should the sun pass in the night  in these distant regions he doubtless passes always in the night at this hour  yes doubtless that is true  but it being night how is it that we could see him  it is a great mystery  i grant that  but i am persuaded that the humidity of the atmosphere in these remote regions is such that particles of daylight adhere to the disk and it was by aid of these that we were enabled to see the sun in the dark  this was deemed satisfactory and due entry was made of the decision  but about this moment those dreadful shriekings were heard again again the rumbling and thundering came speeding up out of the night and once more a flaming great eye flashed by and lost itself in gloom and distance  the camp laborers gave themselves up for lost  the savants were sorely perplexed  here was a marvel hard to account for  they thought and they talked they talked and they thought  finally the learned and aged lord granddaddylonglegs who had been sitting in deep study with his slender limbs crossed and his stemmy arms folded said  deliver your opinions brethren and then i will tell my thoughtfor i think i have solved this problem  so be it good your lordship piped the weak treble of the wrinkled and withered professor woodlouse for we shall hear from your lordships lips naught but wisdom  here the speaker threw in a mess of trite threadbare exasperating quotations from the ancient poets and philosophers delivering them with unction in the sounding grandeurs of the original tongues they being from the mastodon the dodo and other dead languages  perhaps i ought not to presume to meddle with matters pertaining to astronomy at all in such a presence as this i who have made it the business of my life to delve only among the riches of the extinct languages and unearth the opulence of their ancient lore but still as unacquainted as i am with the noble science of astronomy i beg with deference and humility to suggest that inasmuch as the last of these wonderful apparitions proceeded in exactly the opposite direction from that pursued by the first which you decide to be the vernal equinox and greatly resembled it in all particulars is it not possible nay certain that this last is the autumnal equi  ooo  ooo go to bed go to bed with annoyed derision from everybody  so the poor old woodlouse retreated out of sight consumed with shame  further discussion followed and then the united voice of the commission begged lord longlegs to speak  he said  fellowscientists it is my belief that we have witnessed a thing which has occurred in perfection but once before in the knowledge of created beings  it is a phenomenon of inconceivable importance and interest view it as one may but its interest to us is vastly heightened by an added knowledge of its nature which no scholar has heretofore possessed or even suspected  this great marvel which we have just witnessed fellowsavants it almost takes my breath away is nothing less than the transit of venus  every scholar sprang to his feet pale with astonishment  then ensued tears handshakings frenzied embraces and the most extravagant jubilations of every sort  but by and by as emotion began to retire within bounds and reflection to return to the front the accomplished chief inspector lizard observed  but how is this  venus should traverse the suns surface not the earths  the arrow went home  it carried sorrow to the breast of every apostle of learning there for none could deny that this was a formidable criticism but tranquilly the venerable duke crossed his limbs behind his ears and said  my friend has touched the marrow of our mighty discovery  yesall that have lived before us thought a transit of venus consisted of a flight across the suns face they thought it they maintained it they honestly believed it simple hearts and were justified in it by the limitations of their knowledge but to us has been granted the inestimable boon of proving that the transit occurs across the earths face for we have seen it  the assembled wisdom sat in speechless adoration of this imperial intellect  all doubts had instantly departed like night before the lightning  the tumblebug had just intruded unnoticed  he now came reeling forward among the scholars familiarly slapping first one and then another on the shoulder saying nice ic nice old boy and smiling a smile of elaborate content  arrived at a good position for speaking he put his left arm akimbo with his knuckles planted in his hip just under the edge of his cutaway coat bent his right leg placing his toe on the ground and resting his heel with easy grace against his left shin puffed out his aldermanic stomach opened his lips leaned his right elbow on inspector lizards shoulder and  but the shoulder was indignantly withdrawn and the hardhanded son of toil went to earth  he floundered a bit but came up smiling arranged his attitude with the same careful detail as before only choosing professor dogticks shoulder for a support opened his lips and  went to earth again  he presently scrambled up once more still smiling made a loose effort to brush the dust off his coat and legs but a smart pass of his hand missed entirely and the force of the unchecked impulse slewed him suddenly around twisted his legs together and projected him limber and sprawling into the lap of the lord longlegs  two or three scholars sprang forward flung the low creature head over heels into a corner and reinstated the patrician smoothing his ruffled dignity with many soothing and regretful speeches  professor bull frog roared out  no more of this sirrah tumblebug  say your say and then get you about your business with speed  quickwhat is your errand  come move off a trifle you smell like a stable what have you been at  please ic please your worship i chanced to light upon a find  but no meuck matter bout that  theres bic  been another find whichbeg pardon your honors what was that thic thing that ripped by here first  it was the vernal equinox  inficfernal equinox  ats all right  dic  dunno him  whats other one  the transit of venus  gic  got me again  no matter  las one dropped something  ah indeed  good luck  good news  quick what is it  mic mosey out n see  itll pay  no more votes were taken for fourandtwenty hours  then the following entry was made  the commission went in a body to view the find  it was found to consist of a hard smooth huge object with a rounded summit surmounted by a short upright projection resembling a section of a cabbage stalk divided transversely  this projection was not solid but was a hollow cylinder plugged with a soft woody substance unknown to our regionthat is it had been so plugged but unfortunately this obstruction had been heedlessly removed by norway rat chief of the sappers and miners before our arrival  the vast object before us so mysteriously conveyed from the glittering domains of space was found to be hollow and nearly filled with a pungent liquid of a brownish hue like rainwater that has stood for some time  and such a spectacle as met our view  norway rat was perched upon the summit engaged in thrusting his tail into the cylindrical projection drawing it out dripping permitting the struggling multitude of laborers to suck the end of it then straightway reinserting it and delivering the fluid to the mob as before  evidently this liquor had strangely potent qualities for all that partook of it were immediately exalted with great and pleasurable emotions and went staggering about singing ribald songs embracing fighting dancing discharging irruptions of profanity and defying all authority  around us struggled a massed and uncontrolled mobuncontrolled and likewise uncontrollable for the whole army down to the very sentinels were mad like the rest by reason of the drink  we were seized upon by these reckless creatures and within the hour we even we were undistinguishable from the restthe demoralization was complete and universal  in time the camp wore itself out with its orgies and sank into a stolid and pitiable stupor in whose mysterious bonds rank was forgotten and strange bedfellows made our eyes at the resurrection being blasted and our souls petrified with the incredible spectacle of that intolerable stinking scavenger the tumblebug and the illustrious patrician my lord grand daddy duke of longlegs lying soundly steeped in sleep and clasped lovingly in each others arms the like whereof hath not been seen in all the ages that tradition compasseth and doubtless none shall ever in this world find faith to master the belief of it save only we that have beheld the damnable and unholy vision  thus inscrutable be the ways of god whose will be done  this day by order did the engineerinchief herr spider rig the necessary tackle for the overturning of the vast reservoir and so its calamitous contents were discharged in a torrent upon the thirsty earth which drank it up and now there is no more danger we reserving but a few drops for experiment and scrutiny and to exhibit to the king and subsequently preserve among the wonders of the museum  what this liquid is has been determined  it is without question that fierce and most destructive fluid called lightning  it was wrested in its container from its storehouse in the clouds by the resistless might of the flying planet and hurled at our feet as she sped by  an interesting discovery here results  which is that lightning kept to itself is quiescent it is the assaulting contact of the thunderbolt that releases it from captivity ignites its awful fires and so produces an instantaneous combustion and explosion which spread disaster and desolation far and wide in the earth  after another day devoted to rest and recovery the expedition proceeded upon its way  some days later it went into camp in a pleasant part of the plain and the savants sallied forth to see what they might find their reward was at hand  professor bull frog discovered a strange tree and called his comrades  they inspected it with profound interest  it was very tall and straight and wholly devoid of bark limbs or foliage by triangulation lord longlegs determined its altitude herr spider measured its circumference at the base and computed the circumference at its top by a mathematical demonstration based upon the warrant furnished by the uniform degree of its taper upward  it was considered a very extraordinary find and since it was a tree of a hitherto unknown species professor woodlouse gave it a name of a learned sound being none other than that of professor bull frog translated into the ancient mastodon language for it had always been the custom with discoverers to perpetuate their names and honor themselves by this sort of connection with their discoveries  now professor fieldmouse having placed his sensitive ear to the tree detected a rich harmonious sound issuing from it  this surprising thing was tested and enjoyed by each scholar in turn and great was the gladness and astonishment of all  professor woodlouse was requested to add to and extend the trees name so as to make it suggest the musical quality it possessedwhich he did furnishing the addition anthem singer done into the mastodon tongue  by this time professor snail was making some telescopic inspections he discovered a great number of these trees extending in a single rank with wide intervals between as far as his instrument would carry both southward and northward  he also presently discovered that all these trees were bound together near their tops by fourteen great ropes one above another which ropes were continuous from tree to tree as far as his vision could reach  this was surprising  chief engineer spider ran aloft and soon reported that these ropes were simply a web hung there by some colossal member of his own species for he could see its prey dangling here and there from the strands in the shape of mighty shreds and rags that had a woven look about their texture and were no doubt the discarded skins of prodigious insects which had been caught and eaten and then he ran along one of the ropes to make a closer inspection but felt a smart sudden burn on the soles of his feet accompanied by a paralyzing shock wherefore he let go and swung himself to the earth by a thread of his own spinning and advised all to hurry at once to camp lest the monster should appear and get as much interested in the savants as they were in him and his works  so they departed with speed making notes about the gigantic web as they went  and that evening the naturalist of the expedition built a beautiful model of the colossal spider having no need to see it in order to do this because he had picked up a fragment of its vertebra by the tree and so knew exactly what the creature looked like and what its habits and its preferences were by this simple evidence alone  he built it with a tail teeth fourteen legs and a snout and said it ate grass cattle pebbles and dirt with equal enthusiasm  this animal was regarded as a very precious addition to science  it was hoped a dead one might be found to stuff professor woodlouse thought that he and his brother scholars by lying hid and being quiet might maybe catch a live one  he was advised to try it  which was all the attention that was paid to his suggestion  the conference ended with the naming the monster after the naturalist since he after god had created it  and improved it mayhap muttered the tumblebug who was intruding again according to his idle custom and his unappeasable curiosity  end of part first     some learned fables for good old boys and girls  part second  how the animals of the wood completed their scientific labors  a week later the expedition camped in the midst of a collection of wonderful curiosities  these were a sort of vast caverns of stone that rose singly and in bunches out of the plain by the side of the river which they had first seen when they emerged from the forest  these caverns stood in long straight rows on opposite sides of broad aisles that were bordered with single ranks of trees  the summit of each cavern sloped sharply both ways  several horizontal rows of great square holes obstructed by a thin shiny transparent substance pierced the frontage of each cavern  inside were caverns within caverns and one might ascend and visit these minor compartments by means of curious winding ways consisting of continuous regular terraces raised one above another there were many huge shapeless objects in each compartment which were considered to have been living creatures at one time though now the thin brown skin was shrunken and loose and rattled when disturbed  spiders were here in great number and their cobwebs stretched in all directions and wreathing the great skinny dead together were a pleasant spectacle since they inspired with life and wholesome cheer a scene which would otherwise have brought to the mind only a sense of forsakenness and desolation  information was sought of these spiders but in vain  they were of a different nationality from those with the expedition and their language seemed but a musical meaningless jargon  they were a timid gentle race but ignorant and heathenish worshipers of unknown gods the expedition detailed a great detachment of missionaries to teach them the true religion and in a weeks time a precious work had been wrought among those darkened creatures not three families being by that time at peace with each other or having a settled belief in any system of religion whatever  this encouraged the expedition to establish a colony of missionaries there permanently that the work of grace might go on  but let us not outrun our narrative  after close examination of the fronts of the caverns and much thinking and exchanging of theories the scientists determined the nature of these singular formations  they said that each belonged mainly to the old red sandstone period that the cavern fronts rose in innumerable and wonderfully regular strata high in the air each stratum about five frogspans thick and that in the present discovery lay an overpowering refutation of all received geology for between every two layers of old red sandstone reposed a thin layer of decomposed limestone so instead of there having been but one old red sandstone period there had certainly been not less than a hundred and seventyfive  and by the same token it was plain that there had also been a hundred and seventyfive floodings of the earth and depositings of limestone strata  the unavoidable deduction from which pair of facts was the overwhelming truth that the world instead of being only two hundred thousand years old was older by millions upon millions of years  and there was another curious thing every stratum of old red sandstone was pierced and divided at mathematically regular intervals by vertical strata of limestone  upshootings of igneous rock through fractures in water formations were common but here was the first instance where waterformed rock had been so projected  it was a great and noble discovery and its value to science was considered to be inestimable  a critical examination of some of the lower strata demonstrated the presence of fossil ants and tumblebugs the latter accompanied by their peculiar goods and with high gratification the fact was enrolled upon the scientific record for this was proof that these vulgar laborers belonged to the first and lowest orders of created beings though at the same time there was something repulsive in the reflection that the perfect and exquisite creature of the modern uppermost order owed its origin to such ignominious beings through the mysterious law of development of species  the tumblebug overhearing this discussion said he was willing that the parvenus of these new times should find what comfort they might in their wisedrawn theories since as far as he was concerned he was content to be of the old first families and proud to point back to his place among the old original aristocracy of the land  enjoy your mushroom dignity stinking of the varnish of yesterdays veneering since you like it said he suffice it for the tumblebugs that they come of a race that rolled their fragrant spheres down the solemn aisles of antiquity and left their imperishable works embalmed in the old red sandstone to proclaim it to the wasting centuries as they file along the highway of time  oh take a walk said the chief of the expedition with derision  the summer passed and winter approached  in and about many of the caverns were what seemed to be inscriptions  most of the scientists said they were inscriptions a few said they were not  the chief philologist professor woodlouse maintained that they were writings done in a character utterly unknown to scholars and in a language equally unknown he had early ordered his artists and draftsmen to make facsimiles of all that were discovered and had set himself about finding the key to the hidden tongue  in this work he had followed the method which had always been used by decipherers previously  that is to say he placed a number of copies of inscriptions before him and studied them both collectively and in detail  to begin with he placed the following copies together       the american hotel      meals at all hours      the shades              no smoking      boats for hire cheap     union prayer meeting 4 pm      billiards               the waterside journal      the a1 barber shop      telegraph office      keep off the grass      try brandreths pills      cottages for rent during the watering season      for sale cheap          for sale cheap      for sale cheap          for sale cheap  at first it seemed to the professor that this was a signlanguage and that each word was represented by a distinct sign further examination convinced him that it was a written language and that every letter of its alphabet was represented by a character of its own and finally he decided that it was a language which conveyed itself partly by letters and partly by signs or hieroglyphics  this conclusion was forced upon him by the discovery of several specimens of the following nature  he observed that certain inscriptions were met with in greater frequency than others  such as for sale cheap billiards s t1860x keno ale on draught  naturally then these must be religious maxims  but this idea was cast aside by and by as the mystery of the strange alphabet began to clear itself  in time the professor was enabled to translate several of the inscriptions with considerable plausibility though not to the perfect satisfaction of all the scholars still he made constant and encouraging progress  finally a cavern was discovered with these inscriptions upon it                             waterside museum                            open at all hours                           admission 50 cents                         wonderful collection of                       waxworks ancient fossils                                   etc  professor woodlouse affirmed that the word museum was equivalent to the phrase lumgath molo or burial place  upon entering the scientists were well astonished  but what they saw may be best conveyed in the language of their own official report  erect in a row were a sort of rigid great figures which struck us instantly as belonging to the long extinct species of reptile called man described in our ancient records  this was a peculiarly gratifying discovery because of late times it has become fashionable to regard this creature as a myth and a superstition a work of the inventive imaginations of our remote ancestors  but here indeed was man perfectly preserved in a fossil state  and this was his burial place as already ascertained by the inscription  and now it began to be suspected that the caverns we had been inspecting had been his ancient haunts in that old time that he roamed the earthfor upon the breast of each of these tall fossils was an inscription in the character heretofore noticed  one read captain kidd the pirate another queen victoria another abe lincoln another george washington etc  with feverish interest we called for our ancient scientific records to discover if perchance the description of man there set down would tally with the fossils before us  professor woodlouse read it aloud in its quaint and musty phraseology to wit  in ye time of our fathers man still walked ye earth as by tradition we know  it was a creature of exceeding great size being compassed about with a loose skin sometimes of one color sometimes of many the which it was able to cast at will which being done the hind legs were discovered to be armed with short claws like to a moles but broader and ye forelegs with fingers of a curious slimness and a length much more prodigious than a frogs armed also with broad talons for scratching in ye earth for its food  it had a sort of feathers upon its head such as hath a rat but longer and a beak suitable for seeking its food by ye smell thereof  when it was stirred with happiness it leaked water from its eyes and when it suffered or was sad it manifested it with a horrible hellish cackling clamor that was exceeding dreadful to hear and made one long that it might rend itself and perish and so end its troubles  two mans being together they uttered noises at each other like this hawhawhawdam good dam good together with other sounds of more or less likeness to these wherefore ye poets conceived that they talked but poets be always ready to catch at any frantic folly god he knows  sometimes this creature goeth about with a long stick ye which it putteth to its face and bloweth fire and smoke through ye same with a sudden and most damnable bruit and noise that doth fright its prey to death and so seizeth it in its talons and walketh away to its habitat consumed with a most fierce and devilish joy  now was the description set forth by our ancestors wonderfully indorsed and confirmed by the fossils before us as shall be seen  the specimen marked captain kidd was examined in detail  upon its head and part of its face was a sort of fur like that upon the tail of a horse  with great labor its loose skin was removed whereupon its body was discovered to be of a polished white texture thoroughly petrified  the straw it had eaten so many ages gone by was still in its body undigestedand even in its legs  surrounding these fossils were objects that would mean nothing to the ignorant but to the eye of science they were a revelation  they laid bare the secrets of dead ages  these musty memorials told us when man lived and what were his habits  for here side by side with man were the evidences that he had lived in the earliest ages of creation the companion of the other low orders of life that belonged to that forgotten time  here was the fossil nautilus that sailed the primeval seas here was the skeleton of the mastodon the ichthyosaurus the cavebear the prodigious elk  here also were the charred bones of some of these extinct animals and of the young of mans own species split lengthwise showing that to his taste the marrow was a toothsome luxury  it was plain that man had robbed those bones of their contents since no toothmark of any beast was upon themalbeit the tumblebug intruded the remark that no beast could mark a bone with its teeth anyway  here were proofs that man had vague groveling notions of art for this fact was conveyed by certain things marked with the untranslatable words flint hatchets knives arrowheads and bone ornaments of primeval man some of these seemed to be rude weapons chipped out of flint and in a secret place was found some more in process of construction with this untranslatable legend on a thin flimsy material lying by       jones if you dont want to be discharged from the musseum make      the next primeaveal weppons more carefulyou couldnt even fool one      of these sleepy old syentific grannys from the coledge with the last      ones  and mind you the animles you carved on some of the bone      ornaments is a blame sight too good for any primeaveal man that was      ever fooledvarnum manager  back of the burial place was a mass of ashes showing that man always had a feast at a funeralelse why the ashes in such a place and showing also that he believed in god and the immortality of the soul else why these solemn ceremonies  to sum up  we believe that man had a written language  we know that he indeed existed at one time and is not a myth also that he was the companion of the cavebear the mastodon and other extinct species that he cooked and ate them and likewise the young of his own kind also that he bore rude weapons and knew something of art that he imagined he had a soul and pleased himself with the fancy that it was immortal  but let us not laugh there may be creatures in existence to whom we and our vanities and profundities may seem as ludicrous  end of part second     some learned fables for good old boys and girls  part third  near the margin of the great river the scientists presently found a huge shapely stone with this inscription       in 1847 in the spring the river overflowed its banks and covered      the whole township  the depth was from two to six feet  more than      900 head of cattle were lost and many homes destroyed  the mayor      ordered this memorial to be erected to perpetuate the event  god      spare us the repetition of it  with infinite trouble professor woodlouse succeeded in making a translation of this inscription which was sent home and straightway an enormous excitement was created about it  it confirmed in a remarkable way certain treasured traditions of the ancients  the translation was slightly marred by one or two untranslatable words but these did not impair the general clearness of the meaning  it is here presented       one thousand eight hundred and fortyseven years ago the fires      descended and consumed the whole city  only some nine hundred souls      were saved all others destroyed  the king commanded this stone      to be set up to       untranslatable       prevent the      repetition of it  this was the first successful and satisfactory translation that had been made of the mysterious character left behind him by extinct man and it gave professor woodlouse such reputation that at once every seat of learning in his native land conferred a degree of the most illustrious grade upon him and it was believed that if he had been a soldier and had turned his splendid talents to the extermination of a remote tribe of reptiles the king would have ennobled him and made him rich  and this too was the origin of that school of scientists called manologists whose specialty is the deciphering of the ancient records of the extinct bird termed man  for it is now decided that man was a bird and not a reptile  but professor woodlouse began and remained chief of these for it was granted that no translations were ever so free from error as his others made mistakeshe seemed incapable of it  many a memorial of the lost race was afterward found but none ever attained to the renown and veneration achieved by the mayoritish stone it being so called from the word mayor in it which being translated king mayoritish stone was but another way of saying king stone  another time the expedition made a great find  it was a vast round flattish mass ten frogspans in diameter and five or six high professor snail put on his spectacles and examined it all around and then climbed up and inspected the top  he said  the result of my perlustration and perscontation of this isoperimetrical protuberance is a belief that it is one of those rare and wonderful creations left by the mound builders  the fact that this one is lamellibranchiate in its formation simply adds to its interest as being possibly of a different kind from any we read of in the records of science but yet in no manner marring its authenticity  let the megalophonous grasshopper sound a blast and summon hither the perfunctory and circumforaneous tumblebug to the end that excavations may be made and learning gather new treasures  not a tumblebug could be found on duty so the mound was excavated by a working party of ants  nothing was discovered  this would have been a great disappointment had not the venerable longlegs explained the matter  he said  it is now plain to me that the mysterious and forgotten race of mound builders did not always erect these edifices as mausoleums else in this case as in all previous cases their skeletons would be found here along with the rude implements which the creatures used in life  is not this manifest  true true from everybody  then we have made a discovery of peculiar value here a discovery which greatly extends our knowledge of this creature in place of diminishing it a discovery which will add luster to the achievements of this expedition and win for us the commendations of scholars everywhere for the absence of the customary relics here means nothing less than this the mound builder instead of being the ignorant savage reptile we have been taught to consider him was a creature of cultivation and high intelligence capable of not only appreciating worthy achievements of the great and noble of his species but of commemorating them fellowscholars this stately mound is not a sepulcher it is a monument  a profound impression was produced by this  but it was interrupted by rude and derisive laughterand the tumblebug appeared  a monument quoth he  a monument setup by a mound builder  aye so it is  so it is indeed to the shrewd keen eye of science but to an ignorant poor devil who has never seen a college it is not a monument strictly speaking but is yet a most rich and noble property and with your worships good permission i will proceed to manufacture it into spheres of exceeding grace and  the tumblebug was driven away with stripes and the draftsmen of the expedition were set to making views of the monument from different standpoints while professor woodlouse in a frenzy of scientific zeal traveled all over it and all around it hoping to find an inscription but if there had ever been one it had decayed or been removed by some vandal as a relic  the views having been completed it was now considered safe to load the precious monument itself upon the backs of four of the largest tortoises and send it home to the kings museum which was done and when it arrived it was received with enormous érclat and escorted to its future abidingplace by thousands of enthusiastic citizens king bullfrog xvi himself attending and condescending to sit enthroned upon it throughout the progress  the growing rigor of the weather was now admonishing the scientists to close their labors for the present so they made preparations to journey homeward  but even their last day among the caverns bore fruit for one of the scholars found in an outoftheway corner of the museum or burial place a most strange and extraordinary thing  it was nothing less than a double manbird lashed together breast to breast by a natural ligament and labeled with the untranslatable words siamese twins the official report concerning this thing closed thus  wherefore it appears that there were in old times two distinct species of this majestic fowl the one being single and the other double  nature has a reason for all things  it is plain to the eye of science that the doubleman originally inhabited a region where dangers abounded hence he was paired together to the end that while one part slept the other might watch and likewise that danger being discovered there might always be a double instead of a single power to oppose it  all honor to the mysterydispelling eye of godlike science  and near the double manbird was found what was plainly an ancient record of his marked upon numberless sheets of a thin white substance and bound together  almost the first glance that professor woodlouse threw into it revealed this following sentence which he instantly translated and laid before the scientists in a tremble and it uplifted every soul there with exultation and astonishment  in truth it is believed by many that the lower animals reason and talk together  when the great official report of the expedition appeared the above sentence bore this comment  then there are lower animals than man  this remarkable passage can mean nothing else  man himself is extinct but they may still exist  what can they be  where do they inhabit  ones enthusiasm bursts all bounds in the contemplation of the brilliant field of discovery and investigation here thrown open to science  we close our labors with the humble prayer that your majesty will immediately appoint a commission and command it to rest not nor spare expense until the search for this hitherto unsuspected race of the creatures of god shall be crowned with success  the expedition then journeyed homeward after its long absence and its faithful endeavors and was received with a mighty ovation by the whole grateful country  there were vulgar ignorant carpers of course as there always are and always will be and naturally one of these was the obscene tumblebug  he said that all he had learned by his travels was that science only needed a spoonful of supposition to build a mountain of demonstrated fact out of and that for the future he meant to be content with the knowledge that nature had made free to all creatures and not go prying into the august secrets of the deity       my late senatorial secretaryshipwritten about 1867  i am not a private secretary to a senator any more now  i held the berth two months in security and in great cheerfulness of spirit but my bread began to return from over the waters thenthat is to say my works came back and revealed themselves  i judged it best to resign  the way of it was this  my employer sent for me one morning tolerably early and as soon as i had finished inserting some conundrums clandestinely into his last great speech upon finance i entered the presence  there was something portentous in his appearance  his cravat was untied his hair was in a state of disorder and his countenance bore about it the signs of a suppressed storm  he held a package of letters in his tense grasp and i knew that the dreaded pacific mail was in  he said  i thought you were worthy of confidence  i said yes sir  he said i gave you a letter from certain of my constituents in the state of nevada asking the establishment of a postoffice at baldwins ranch and told you to answer it as ingeniously as you could with arguments which should persuade them that there was no real necessity for an office at that place  i felt easier  oh if that is all sir i did do that  yes you did  i will read your answer for your own humiliation                                          washington nov 24      messrs smith jones and others       gentlemen  what the mischief do you suppose you want with a      postoffice at baldwins ranch  it would not do you any good      if any letters came there you couldnt read them you know and      besides such letters as ought to pass through with money in them      for other localities would not be likely to get through you must      perceive at once and that would make trouble for us all  no dont      bother about a postoffice in your camp  i have your best interests      at heart and feel that it would only be an ornamental folly  what      you want is a nice jail you knowa nice substantial jail and a      free school  these will be a lasting benefit to you  these will      make you really contented and happy  i will move in the matter at      once                     very truly etc                               mark twain                     for james w n u s senator  that is the way you answered that letter  those people say they will hang me if i ever enter that district again and i am perfectly satisfied they will too  well sir i did not know i was doing any harm  i only wanted to convince them  ah  well you did convince them i make no manner of doubt  now here is another specimen  i gave you a petition from certain gentlemen of nevada praying that i would get a bill through congress incorporating the methodist episcopal church of the state of nevada  i told you to say in reply that the creation of such a law came more properly within the province of the state legislature and to endeavor to show them that in the present feebleness of the religious element in that new commonwealth the expediency of incorporating the church was questionable  what did you write                                          washington nov 24       rev john halifax and others       gentlemen you will have to go to the state legislature about that      speculation of yourscongress dont know anything about religion      but dont you hurry to go there either because this thing you      propose to do out in that new country isnt expedientin fact it      is ridiculous  your religious people there are too feeble in      intellect in morality in piety in everything pretty much  you      had better drop thisyou cant make it work  you cant issue stock      on an incorporation like thator if you could it would only keep      you in trouble all the time  the other denominations would abuse      it and bear it and sell it short and break it down  they      would do with it just as they would with one of your silvermines      out therethey would try to make all the world believe it was      wildcat  you ought not to do anything that is calculated to bring      a sacred thing into disrepute  you ought to be ashamed of      yourselvesthat is what i think about it  you close your petition      with the words and we will ever pray  i think you had betteryou      need to do it

never mind  as long as destruction must come now let it be complete  let it be completelet this last of your performances which i am about to read make a finality of it  i am a ruined man  i had my misgivings when i gave you the letter from humboldt asking that the post route from indian gulch to shakespeare gap and intermediate points be changed partly to the old mormon trail  but i told you it was a delicate question and warned you to deal with it deftlyto answer it dubiously and leave them a little in the dark and your fatal imbecility impelled you to make this disastrous reply i should think you would stop your ears if you are not dead to all shame                                          washington nov 30       messrs perkins wagner et al       gentlemen it is a delicate question about this indian trail but      handled with proper deftness and dubiousness i doubt not we shall      succeed in some measure or otherwise because the place where the      route leaves the lassen meadows over beyond where those two shawnee      chiefs dilapidated vengeance and biteroftheclouds were scalped      last winter this being the favorite direction to some but others      preferring something else in consequence of things the mormon trail      leaving mosbys at three in the morning and passing through jaw      bone flat to blucher and then down by jughandle the road passing      to the right of it and naturally leaving it on the right too and      dawsons on the left of the trail where it passes to the left of      said dawsons and onward thence to tomahawk thus making the

fashion itemwritten about 1867  at general gs reception the other night the most fashionably dressed lady was mrs g c  she wore a pink satin dress plain in front but with a good deal of rake to itto the train i mean it was said to be two or three yards long  one could see it creeping along the floor some little time after the woman was gone  mrs c wore also a white bodice cut bias with pompadour sleeves flounced with ruches low neck with the inside handkerchief not visible with white kid gloves  she had on a pearl necklace which glinted lonely high up the midst of that barren waste of neck and shoulders  her hair was frizzled into a tangled chaparral forward of her ears aft it was drawn together and compactly bound and plaited into a stump like a ponys tail and furthermore was canted upward at a sharp angle and ingeniously supported by a red velvet crupper whose forward extremity was made fast with a halfhitch around a hairpin on the top of her head  her whole top hamper was neat and becoming  she had a beautiful complexion when she first came but it faded out by degrees in an unaccountable way  however it is not lost for good  i found the most of it on my shoulder afterward  i stood near the door when she squeezed out with the throng  there were other ladies present but i only took notes of one as a specimen  i would gladly enlarge upon the subject were i able to do it justice       rileynewspaper correspondent  one of the best men in washingtonor elsewhereis riley correspondent of one of the great san francisco dailies  riley is full of humor and has an unfailing vein of irony which makes his conversation to the last degree entertaining as long as the remarks are about somebody else  but notwithstanding the possession of these qualities which should enable a man to write a happy and an appetizing letter rileys newspaper letters often display a more than earthly solemnity and likewise an unimaginative devotion to petrified facts which surprise and distress all men who know him in his unofficial character  he explains this curious thing by saying that his employers sent him to washington to write facts not fancy and that several times he has come near losing his situation by inserting humorous remarks which not being looked for at headquarters and consequently not understood were thought to be dark and bloody speeches intended to convey signals and warnings to murderous secret societies or something of that kind and so were scratched out with a shiver and a prayer and cast into the stove  riley says that sometimes he is so afflicted with a yearning to write a sparkling and absorbingly readable letter that he simply cannot resist it and so he goes to his den and revels in the delight of untrammeled scribbling and then with suffering such as only a mother can know he destroys the pretty children of his fancy and reduces his letter to the required dismal accuracy  having seen riley do this very thing more than once i know whereof i speak  often i have laughed with him over a happy passage and grieved to see him plow his pen through it  he would say i had to write that or die and ive got to scratch it out or starve  they wouldnt stand it you know  i think riley is about the most entertaining company i ever saw  we lodged together in many places in washington during the winter of 678 moving comfortably from place to place and attracting attention by paying our boarda course which cannot fail to make a person conspicuous in washington  riley would tell all about his trip to california in the early days by way of the isthmus and the san juan river and about his baking bread in san francisco to gain a living and setting up tenpins and practising law and opening oysters and delivering lectures and teaching french and tending bar and reporting for the newspapers and keeping dancingschools and interpreting chinese in the courtswhich latter was lucrative and riley was doing handsomely and laying up a little money when people began to find fault because his translations were too free a thing for which riley considered he ought not to be held responsible since he did not know a word of the chinese tongue and only adopted interpreting as a means of gaining an honest livelihood through the machinations of enemies he was removed from the position of official interpreter and a man put in his place who was familiar with the chinese language but did not know any english  and riley used to tell about publishing a newspaper up in what is alaska now but was only an iceberg then with a population composed of bears walruses indians and other animals and how the iceberg got adrift at last and left all his paying subscribers behind and as soon as the commonwealth floated out of the jurisdiction of russia the people rose and threw off their allegiance and ran up the english flag calculating to hook on and become an english colony as they drifted along down the british possessions but a land breeze and a crooked current carried them by and they ran up the stars and stripes and steered for california missed the connection again and swore allegiance to mexico but it wasnt any use the anchors came home every time and away they went with the northeast trades drifting off sideways toward the sandwich islands whereupon they ran up the cannibal flag and had a grand human barbecue in honor of it in which it was noticed that the better a man liked a friend the better he enjoyed him and as soon as they got fairly within the tropics the weather got so fearfully hot that the iceberg began to melt and it got so sloppy under foot that it was almost impossible for ladies to get about at all and at last just as they came in sight of the islands the melancholy remnant of the once majestic iceberg canted first to one side and then to the other and then plunged under forever carrying the national archives along with itand not only the archives and the populace but some eligible town lots which had increased in value as fast as they diminished in size in the tropics and which riley could have sold at thirty cents a pound and made himself rich if he could have kept the province afloat ten hours longer and got her into port  riley is very methodical untiringly accommodating never forgets anything that is to be attended to is a good son a stanch friend and a permanent reliable enemy  he will put himself to any amount of trouble to oblige a body and therefore always has his hands full of things to be done for the helpless and the shiftless  and he knows how to do nearly everything too  he is a man whose native benevolence is a wellspring that never goes dry  he stands always ready to help whoever needs help as far as he is ableand not simply with his money for that is a cheap and common charity but with hand and brain and fatigue of limb and sacrifice of time  this sort of men is rare  riley has a ready wit a quickness and aptness at selecting and applying quotations and a countenance that is as solemn and as blank as the back side of a tombstone when he is delivering a particularly exasperating joke  one night a negro woman was burned to death in a house next door to us and riley said that our landlady would be oppressively emotional at breakfast because she generally made use of such opportunities as offered being of a morbidly sentimental turn and so we should find it best to let her talk along and say nothing backit was the only way to keep her tears out of the gravy  riley said there never was a funeral in the neighborhood but that the gravy was watery for a week  and sure enough at breakfast the landlady was down in the very sloughs of woeentirely brokenhearted  everything she looked at reminded her of that poor old negro woman and so the buckwheat cakes made her sob the coffee forced a groan and when the beefsteak came on she fetched a wail that made our hair rise  then she got to talking about deceased and kept up a steady drizzle till both of us were soaked through and through presently she took a fresh breath and said with a world of sobs  ah to think of it only to think of itthe poor old faithful creature  for she was so faithful  would you believe it she had been a servant in that selfsame house and that selfsame family for twenty seven years come christmas and never a cross word and never a lick  and oh to think she should meet such a death at lastasitting over the red hot stove at three oclock in the morning and went to sleep and fell on it and was actually roasted  not just frizzled up a bit but literally roasted to a crisp  poor faithful creature how she was cooked  i am but a poor woman but even if i have to scrimp to do it i will put up a tombstone over that lone sufferers graveand mr riley if you would have the goodness to think up a little epitaph to put on it which would sort of describe the awful way in which she met her  put it well done good and faithful servant said riley and never smiled       a fine old man  john wagner the oldest man in buffaloone hundred and four years old recently walked a mile and a half in two weeks  he is as cheerful and bright as any of these other old men that charge around so persistently and tiresomely in the newspapers and in every way as remarkable  last november he walked five blocks in a rainstorm without any shelter but an umbrella and cast his vote for grant remarking that he had voted for fortyseven presidentswhich was a lie  his second crop of rich brown hair arrived from new york yesterday and he has a new set of teeth comingfrom philadelphia  he is to be married next week to a girl one hundred and two years old who still takes in washing  they have been engaged eighty years but their parents persistently refused their consent until three days ago  john wagner is two years older than the rhode island veteran and yet has never tasted a drop of liquor in his lifeunlessunless you count whisky       science vs luckwritten about 1867  at that time in kentucky said the hon mr k the law was very strict against what is termed games of chance  about a dozen of the boys were detected playing seven up or old sledge for money and the grand jury found a true bill against them  jim sturgis was retained to defend them when the case came up of course the more he studied over the matter and looked into the evidence the plainer it was that he must lose a case at lastthere was no getting around that painful fact those boys had certainly been betting money on a game of chance  even public sympathy was roused in behalf of sturgis  people said it was a pity to see him mar his successful career with a big prominent case like this which must go against him  but after several restless nights an inspired idea flashed upon sturgis and he sprang out of bed delighted  he thought he saw his way through the next day he whispered around a little among his clients and a few friends and then when the case came up in court he acknowledged the sevenup and the betting and as his sole defense had the astounding effrontery to put in the plea that old sledge was not a game of chance there was the broadest sort of a smile all over the faces of that sophisticated audience  the judge smiled with the rest  but sturgis maintained a countenance whose earnestness was even severe  the opposite counsel tried to ridicule him out of his position and did not succeed the judge jested in a ponderous judicial way about the thing but did not move him  the matter was becoming grave  the judge lost a little of his patience and said the joke had gone far enough  jim sturgis said he knew of no joke in the matterhis clients could not be punished for indulging in what some people chose to consider a game of chance until it was proven that it was a game of chance  judge and counsel said that would be an easy matter and forthwith called deacons job peters burke and johnson and dominies wirt and miggles to testify and they unanimously and with strong feeling put down the legal quibble of sturgis by pronouncing that old sledge was a game of chance   what do you call it now said the judge  i call it a game of science retorted sturgis and ill prove it too  they saw his little game  he brought in a cloud of witnesses and produced an overwhelming mass of testimony to show that old sledge was not a game of chance but a game of science  instead of being the simplest case in the world it had somehow turned out to be an excessively knotty one  the judge scratched his head over it awhile and said there was no way of coming to a determination because just as many men could be brought into court who would testify on one side as could be found to testify on the other  but he said he was willing to do the fair thing by all parties and would act upon any suggestion mr sturgis would make for the solution of the difficulty  mr sturgis was on his feet in a second  impanel a jury of six of each luck versus science  give them candles and a couple of decks of cards  send them into the juryroom and just abide by the result  there was no disputing the fairness of the proposition  the four deacons and the two dominies were sworn in as the chance jurymen and six inveterate old sevenup professors were chosen to represent the science side of the issue  they retired to the juryroom  in about two hours deacon peters sent into court to borrow three dollars from a friend  sensation  in about two hours more dominie miggles sent into court to borrow a stake from a friend  sensation  during the next three or four hours the other dominie and the other deacons sent into court for small loans  and still the packed audience waited for it was a prodigious occasion in bulls corners and one in which every father of a family was necessarily interested  the rest of the story can be told briefly  about daylight the jury came in and deacon job the foreman read the following       verdict       we the jury in the case of the commonwealth of kentucky vs john      wheeler et al have carefully considered the points of the case      and tested the merits of the several theories advanced and do      hereby unanimously decide that the game commonly known as old sledge      or sevenup is eminently a game of science and not of chance  in      demonstration whereof it is hereby and herein stated iterated      reiterated set forth and made manifest that during the entire      night the chance men never won a game or turned a jack although      both feats were common and frequent to the opposition and      furthermore in support of this our verdict we call attention to      the significant fact that the chance men are all busted and the      science men have got the money  it is the deliberate opinion of      this jury that the chance theory concerning sevenup is a      pernicious doctrine and calculated to inflict untold suffering and      pecuniary loss upon any community that takes stock in it  that is the way that sevenup came to be set apart and particularized in the statutebooks of kentucky as being a game not of chance but of science and therefore not punishable under the law said mr k that verdict is of record and holds good to this day       the late benjamin franklinwritten about 1870  never put off till tomorrow what you can do day after tomorrow just as wellb f  this party was one of those persons whom they call philosophers  he was twins being born simultaneously in two different houses in the city of boston  these houses remain unto this day and have signs upon them worded in accordance with the facts  the signs are considered well enough to have though not necessary because the inhabitants point out the two birthplaces to the stranger anyhow and sometimes as often as several times in the same day  the subject of this memoir was of a vicious disposition and early prostituted his talents to the invention of maxims and aphorisms calculated to inflict suffering upon the rising generation of all subsequent ages  his simplest acts also were contrived with a view to their being held up for the emulation of boys foreverboys who might otherwise have been happy  it was in this spirit that he became the son of a soapboiler and probably for no other reason than that the efforts of all future boys who tried to be anything might be looked upon with suspicion unless they were the sons of soapboilers with a malevolence which is without parallel in history he would work all day and then sit up nights and let on to be studying algebra by the light of a smoldering fire so that all other boys might have to do that also or else have benjamin franklin thrown up to them  not satisfied with these proceedings he had a fashion of living wholly on bread and water and studying astronomy at mealtimea thing which has brought affliction to millions of boys since whose fathers had read franklins pernicious biography  his maxims were full of animosity toward boys  nowadays a boy cannot follow out a single natural instinct without tumbling over some of those everlasting aphorisms and hearing from franklin on the spot  if he buys two cents worth of peanuts his father says remember what franklin has said my sona grout a days a penny a year and the comfort is all gone out of those peanuts  if he wants to spin his top when he has done work his father quotes procrastination is the thief of time  if he does a virtuous action he never gets anything for it because virtue is its own reward  and that boy is hounded to death and robbed of his natural rest because franklin said once in one of his inspired flights of malignity                 early to bed and early to rise                makes a man healthy and wealthy and wise  as if it were any object to a boy to be healthy and wealthy and wise on such terms  the sorrow that that maxim has cost me through my parents experimenting on me with it tongue cannot tell the legitimate result is my present state of general debility indigence and mental aberration my parents used to have me up before nine oclock in the morning sometimes when i was a boy  if they had let me take my natural rest where would i have been now  keeping store no doubt and respected by all  and what an adroit old adventurer the subject of this memoir was in order to get a chance to fly his kite on sunday he used to hang a key on the string and let on to be fishing for lightning  and a guileless public would go home chirping about the wisdom and the genius of the hoary sabbathbreaker  if anybody caught him playing mumblepeg by himself after the age of sixty he would immediately appear to be ciphering out how the grass grewas if it was any of his business my grandfather knew him well and he says franklin was always fixedalways ready  if a body during his old age happened on him unexpectedly when he was catching flies or making mudpies or sliding on a cellar door he would immediately look wise and rip out a maxim and walk off with his nose in the air and his cap turned wrong side before trying to appear absentminded and eccentric  he was a hard lot  he invented a stove that would smoke your head off in four hours by the clock  one can see the almost devilish satisfaction he took in it by his giving it his name  he was always proud of telling how he entered philadelphia for the first time with nothing in the world but two shillings in his pocket and four rolls of bread under his arm  but really when you come to examine it critically it was nothing  anybody could have done it  to the subject of this memoir belongs the honor of recommending the army to go back to bows and arrows in place of bayonets and muskets he observed with his customary force that the bayonet was very well under some circumstances but that he doubted whether it could be used with accuracy at a long range  benjamin franklin did a great many notable things for his country and made her young name to be honored in many lands as the mother of such a son  it is not the idea of this memoir to ignore that or cover it up no the simple idea of it is to snub those pretentious maxims of his which he worked up with a great show of originality out of truisms that had become wearisome platitudes as early as the dispersion from babel and also to snub his stove and his military inspirations his unseemly endeavor to make himself conspicuous when he entered philadelphia and his flying his kite and fooling away his time in all sorts of such ways when he ought to have been foraging for soapfat or constructing candles  i merely desired to do away with somewhat of the prevalent calamitous idea among heads of families that franklin acquired his great genius by working for nothing studying by moonlight and getting up in the night instead of waiting till morning like a christian and that this program rigidly inflicted will make a franklin of every fathers fool it is time these gentlemen were finding out that these execrable eccentricities of instinct and conduct are only the evidences of genius not the creators of it  i wish i had been the father of my parents long enough to make them comprehend this truth and thus prepare them to let their son have an easier time of it  when i was a child i had to boil soap notwithstanding my father was wealthy and i had to get up early and study geometry at breakfast and peddle my own poetry and do everything just as franklin did in the solemn hope that i would be a franklin some day  and here i am       mr blokes itemwritten about 1865  our esteemed friend mr john william bloke of virginia city walked into the office where we are subeditor at a late hour last night with an expression of profound and heartfelt suffering upon his countenance and sighing heavily laid the following item reverently upon the desk and walked slowly out again  he paused a moment at the door and seemed struggling to command his feelings sufficiently to enable him to speak and then nodding his head toward his manuscript ejaculated in a broken voice friend of mineoh how sad and burst into tears  we were so moved at his distress that we did not think to call him back and endeavor to comfort him until he was gone and it was too late  the paper had already gone to press but knowing that our friend would consider the publication of this item important and cherishing the hope that to print it would afford a melancholy satisfaction to his sorrowing heart we stopped the press at once and inserted it in our columns       distressing accidentlast evening about six oclock as mr      william schuyler an old and respectable citizen of south park was      leaving his residence to go downtown as has been his usual custom      for many years with the exception only of a short interval in the      spring of 1850 during which he was confined to his bed by injuries received in attempting to stop a runaway horse by thoughtlessly      placing himself directly in its wake and throwing up his hands and      shouting which if he had done so even a single moment sooner must      inevitably have frightened the animal still more instead of checking      its speed although disastrous enough to himself as it was and      rendered more melancholy and distressing by reason of the presence      of his wifes mother who was there and saw the sad occurrence      notwithstanding it is at least likely though not necessarily so      that she should be reconnoitering in another direction when      incidents occur not being vivacious and on the lookout as a      general thing but even the reverse as her own mother is said to      have stated who is no more but died in the full hope of a glorious      resurrection upwards of three years ago aged eightysix being a      christian woman and without guile as it were or property in      consequence of the fire of 1849 which destroyed every single thing      she had in the world  but such is life  let us all take warning by      this solemn occurrence and let us endeavor so to conduct ourselves      that when we come to die we can do it  let us place our hands upon      our heart and say with earnestness and sincerity that from this day      forth we will beware of the intoxicating bowlfirst edition of      the californian  the head editor has been in here raising the mischief and tearing his hair and kicking the furniture about and abusing me like a pickpocket he says that every time he leaves me in charge of the paper for half an hour i get imposed upon by the first infant or the first idiot that comes along  and he says that that distressing item of mr blokes is nothing but a lot of distressing bosh and has no point to it and no sense in it and no information in it and that there was no sort of necessity for stopping the press to publish it  now all this comes of being goodhearted  if i had been as unaccommodating and unsympathetic as some people i would have told mr bloke that i wouldnt receive his communication at such a late hour but no his snuffling distress touched my heart and i jumped at the chance of doing something to modify his misery  i never read his item to see whether there was anything wrong about it but hastily wrote the few lines which preceded it and sent it to the printers  and what has my kindness done for me  it has done nothing but bring down upon me a storm of abuse and ornamental blasphemy  now i will read that item myself and see if there is any foundation for all this fuss  and if there is the author of it shall hear from me  i have read it and i am bound to admit that it seems a little mixed at a first glance  however i will peruse it once more  i have read it again and it does really seem a good deal more mixed than ever  i have read it over five times but if i can get at the meaning of it i wish i may get my just deserts  it wont bear analysis  there are things about it which i cannot understand at all  it dont say whatever became of william schuyler  it just says enough about him to get one interested in his career and then drops him  who is william schuyler anyhow and what part of south park did he live in and if he started downtown at six oclock did he ever get there and if he did did anything happen to him  is he the individual that met with the distressing accident  considering the elaborate circumstantiality of detail observable in the item it seems to me that it ought to contain more information than it does  on the contrary it is obscurand not only obscure but utterly incomprehensible  was the breaking of mr schuylers leg fifteen years ago the distressing accident that plunged mr bloke into unspeakable grief and caused him to come up here at dead of night and stop our press to acquaint the world with the circumstance  or did the distressing accident consist in the destruction of schuylers motherinlaws property in early times or did it consist in the death of that person herself three years ago albeit it does not appear that she died by accident  in a word what did that distressing accident consist in  what did that driveling ass of a schuyler stand in the wake of a runaway horse for with his shouting and gesticulating if he wanted to stop him  and how the mischief could he get run over by a horse that had already passed beyond him  and what are we to take warning by  and how is this extraordinary chapter of incomprehensibilities going to be a lesson to us  and above all what has the intoxicating bowl got to do with it anyhow  it is not stated that schuyler drank or that his wife drank or that his motherinlaw drank or that the horse drankwherefore then the reference to the intoxicating bowl  it does seem to me that if mr bloke had let the intoxicating bowl alone himself he never would have got into so much trouble about this exasperating imaginary accident  i have read this absurd item over and over again with all its insinuating plausibility until my head swims but i can make neither head nor tail of it  there certainly seems to have been an accident of some kind or other but it is impossible to determine what the nature of it was or who was the sufferer by it  i do not like to do it but i feel compelled to request that the next time anything happens to one of mr blokes friends he will append such explanatory notes to his account of it as will enable me to find out what sort of an accident it was and whom it happened to  i had rather all his friends should die than that i should be driven to the verge of lunacy again in trying to cipher out the meaning of another such production as the above       a medieval romance written about 1868   chapter i  the secret revealed  it was night  stillness reigned in the grand old feudal castle of klugenstein  the year 1222 was drawing to a close  far away up in the tallest of the castles towers a single light glimmered  a secret council was being held there  the stern old lord of klugenstein sat in a chair of state meditating  presently he said with a tender accent  my daughter  a young man of noble presence clad from head to heel in knightly mail answered  speak father  my daughter the time is come for the revealing of the mystery that hath puzzled all your young life  know then that it had its birth in the matters which i shall now unfold  my brother ulrich is the great duke of brandenburgh  our father on his deathbed decreed that if no son were born to ulrich the succession should pass to my house provided a son were born to me  and further in case no son were born to either but only daughters then the succession should pass to ulrichs daughter if she proved stainless if she did not my daughter should succeed if she retained a blameless name  and so i and my old wife here prayed fervently for the good boon of a son but the prayer was vain  you were born to us  i was in despair  i saw the mighty prize slipping from my graspthe splendid dream vanishing away  and i had been so hopeful five years had ulrich lived in wedlock and yet his wife had borne no heir of either sex  but hold i said all is not lost  a saving scheme had shot athwart my brain  you were born at midnight  only the leech the nurse and six waitingwomen knew your sex  i hanged them every one before an hour sped  next morning all the barony went mad with rejoicing over the proclamation that a son was born to klugensteinan heir to mighty brandenburgh  and well the secret has been kept  your mothers own sister nursed your infancy and from that time forward we feared nothing  when you were ten years old a daughter was born to ulrich  we grieved but hoped for good results from measles or physicians or other natural enemies of infancy but were always disappointed  she lived she throve heavens malison upon her  but it is nothing  we are safe  for haha have we not a son  and is not our son the future duke  our wellbeloved conrad is it not sofor woman of eightandtwenty years as you are my child none other name than that hath ever fallen to you  now it hath come to pass that age hath laid its hand upon my brother and he waxes feeble  the cares of state do tax him sore therefore he wills that you shall come to him and be already duke in act though not yet in name  your servitors are readyyou journey forth tonight  now listen well  remember every word i say  there is a law as old as germany that if any woman sit for a single instant in the great ducal chair before she hath been absolutely crowned in presence of the people she shall die so heed my words  pretend humility  pronounce your judgments from the premiers chair which stands at the foot of the throne  do this until you are crowned and safe  it is not likely that your sex will ever be discovered but still it is the part of wisdom to make all things as safe as may be in this treacherous earthly life  oh my father is it for this my life hath been a lie  was it that i might cheat my unoffending cousin of her rights  spare me father spare your child  what hussy  is this my reward for the august fortune my brain has wrought for thee  by the bones of my father this puling sentiment of thine but ill accords with my humor  betake thee to the duke instantly and beware how thou meddlest with my purpose  let this suffice of the conversation  it is enough for us to know that the prayers the entreaties and the tears of the gentlenatured girl availed nothing neither they nor anything could move the stout old lord of klugenstein  and so at last with a heavy heart the daughter saw the castle gates close behind her and found herself riding away in the darkness surrounded by a knightly array of armed vassals and a brave following of servants  the old baron sat silent for many minutes after his daughters departure and then he turned to his sad wife and said  dame our matters seem speeding fairly  it is full three months since i sent the shrewd and handsome count detzin on his devilish mission to my brothers daughter constance  if he fail we are not wholly safe but if he do succeed no power can bar our girl from being duchess een though illfortune should decree she never should be duke  my heart is full of bodings yet all may still be well   tush woman leave the owls to croak  to bed with ye and dream of brandenburgh and grandeur     chapter ii  festivity and tears  six days after the occurrences related in the above chapter the brilliant capital of the duchy of brandenburgh was resplendent with military pageantry and noisy with the rejoicings of loyal multitudes for conrad the young heir to the crown was come  the old dukes heart was full of happiness for conrads handsome person and graceful bearing had won his love at once  the great halls of the palace were thronged with nobles who welcomed conrad bravely and so bright and happy did all things seem that he felt his fears and sorrows passing away and giving place to a comforting contentment  but in a remote apartment of the palace a scene of a different nature was transpiring  by a window stood the dukes only child the lady constance  her eyes were red and swollen and full of tears  she was alone  presently she fell to weeping anew and said aloud  the villain detzin is gonehas fled the dukedom  i could not believe it at first but alas it is too true  and i loved him so  i dared to love him though i knew the duke my father would never let me wed him i loved himbut now i hate him  with all my soul i hate him  oh what is to become of me  i am lost lost lost  i shall go mad     chapter iii  the plot thickens  few months drifted by  all men published the praises of the young conrads government and extolled the wisdom of his judgments the mercifulness of his sentences and the modesty with which he bore himself in his great office  the old duke soon gave everything into his hands and sat apart and listened with proud satisfaction while his heir delivered the decrees of the crown from the seat of the premier it seemed plain that one so loved and praised and honored of all men as conrad was could not be otherwise than happy  but strangely enough he was not  for he saw with dismay that the princess constance had begun to love him  the love of the rest of the world was happy fortune for him but this was freighted with danger  and he saw moreover that the delighted duke had discovered his daughters passion likewise and was already dreaming of a marriage  every day somewhat of the deep sadness that had been in the princesss face faded away every day hope and animation beamed brighter from her eye and by and by even vagrant smiles visited the face that had been so troubled  conrad was appalled  he bitterly cursed himself for having yielded to the instinct that had made him seek the companionship of one of his own sex when he was new and a stranger in the palacewhen he was sorrowful and yearned for a sympathy such as only women can give or feel  he now began to avoid his cousin  but this only made matters worse for naturally enough the more he avoided her the more she cast herself in his way  he marveled at this at first and next it startled him  the girl haunted him she hunted him she happened upon him at all times and in all places in the night as well as in the day  she seemed singularly anxious  there was surely a mystery somewhere  this could not go on forever  all the world was talking about it  the duke was beginning to look perplexed  poor conrad was becoming a very ghost through dread and dire distress  one day as he was emerging from a private anteroom attached to the picturegallery constance confronted him and seizing both his hands in hers exclaimed  oh why do you avoid me  what have i donewhat have i said to lose your kind opinion of mefor surely i had it once  conrad do not despise me but pity a tortured heart  i cannot cannot hold the words unspoken longer lest they kill mei love you conrad  there despise me if you must but they would be uttered  conrad was speechless  constance hesitated a moment and then misinterpreting his silence a wild gladness flamed in her eyes and she flung her arms about his neck and said  you relent you relent you can love meyou will love me oh say you will my own my worshipped conrad  conrad groaned aloud  a sickly pallor overspread his countenance and he trembled like an aspen  presently in desperation he thrust the poor girl from him and cried  you know not what you ask  it is forever and ever impossible  and then he fled like a criminal and left the princess stupefied with amazement a minute afterward she was crying and sobbing there and conrad was crying and sobbing in his chamber  both were in despair  both saw ruin staring them in the face  by and by constance rose slowly to her feet and moved away saying  to think that he was despising my love at the very moment that i thought it was melting his cruel heart  i hate him  he spurned medid this manhe spurned me from him like a dog     chapter iv  the awful revelation  time passed on  a settled sadness rested once more upon the countenance of the good dukes daughter  she and conrad were seen together no more now  the duke grieved at this  but as the weeks wore away conrads color came back to his cheeks and his oldtime vivacity to his eye and he administered the government with a clear and steadily ripening wisdom  presently a strange whisper began to be heard about the palace  it grew louder it spread farther  the gossips of the city got hold of it  it swept the dukedom  and this is what the whisper said  the lady constance hath given birth to a child  when the lord of klugenstein heard it he swung his plumed helmet thrice around his head and shouted  long live duke conradfor lo his crown is sure from this day forward  detzin has done his errand well and the good scoundrel shall be rewarded  and he spread the tidings far and wide and for eightandforty hours no soul in all the barony but did dance and sing carouse and illuminate to celebrate the great event and all at proud and happy old klugensteins expense     chapter v  the frightful catastrophe  the trial was at hand  all the great lords and barons of brandenburgh were assembled in the hall of justice in the ducal palace  no space was left unoccupied where there was room for a spectator to stand or sit conrad clad in purple and ermine sat in the premiers chair and on either side sat the great judges of the realm  the old duke had sternly commanded that the trial of his daughter should proceed without favor and then had taken to his bed brokenhearted  his days were numbered poor conrad had begged as for his very life that he might be spared the misery of sitting in judgment upon his cousins crime but it did not avail  the saddest heart in all that great assemblage was in conrads breast  the gladdest was in his fathers for unknown to his daughter conrad the old baron klugenstein was come and was among the crowd of nobles triumphant in the swelling fortunes of his house  after the heralds had made due proclamation and the other preliminaries had followed the venerable lord chief justice said  prisoner stand forth  the unhappy princess rose and stood unveiled before the vast multitude the lord chief justice continued  most noble lady before the great judges of this realm it hath been charged and proven that out of holy wedlock your grace hath given birth unto a child and by our ancient law the penalty is death excepting in one sole contingency whereof his grace the acting duke our good lord conrad will advertise you in his solemn sentence now wherefore give heed  conrad stretched forth the reluctant sceptre and in the selfsame moment the womanly heart beneath his robe yearned pityingly toward the doomed prisoner and the tears came into his eyes  he opened his lips to speak but the lord chief justice said quickly  not there your grace not there  it is not lawful to pronounce judgment upon any of the ducal line save from the ducal throne   a shudder went to the heart of poor conrad and a tremor shook the iron frame of his old father likewise  conrad had not been crowneddared he profane the throne he hesitated and turned pale with fear  but it must be done  wondering eyes were already upon him  they would be suspicious eyes if he hesitated longer  he ascended the throne  presently he stretched forth the sceptre again and said  prisoner in the name of our sovereign lord ulrich duke of brandenburgh i proceed to the solemn duty that hath devolved upon me give heed to my words  by the ancient law of the land except you produce the partner of your guilt and deliver him up to the executioner you must surely die  embrace this opportunitysave yourself while yet you may  name the father of your child  a solemn hush fell upon the great courta silence so profound that men could hear their own hearts beat  then the princess slowly turned with eyes gleaming with hate and pointing her finger straight at conrad said  thou art the man  an appalling conviction of his helpless hopeless peril struck a chill to conrads heart like the chill of death itself  what power on earth could save him  to disprove the charge he must reveal that he was a woman and for an uncrowned woman to sit in the ducal chair was death  at one and the same moment he and his grim old father swooned and fell to the ground  the remainder of this thrilling and eventful story will not be found in this or any other publication either now or at any future time  the truth is i have got my hero or heroine into such a particularly close place that i do not see how i am ever going to get him or her out of it again and therefore i will wash my hands of the whole business and leave that person to get out the best way that offersor else stay there  i thought it was going to be easy enough to straighten out that little difficulty but it looks different now       petition concerning copyright  to the honorable the senate and house of representatives in congress assembled  whereas the constitution guarantees equal rights to all backed by the declaration of independence and  whereas under our laws the right of property in real estate is perpetual and  whereas under our laws the right of property in the literary result of a citizens intellectual labor is restricted to fortytwo years and  whereas fortytwo years seems an exceedingly just and righteous term and a sufficiently long one for the retention of property  therefore your petitioner having the good of his country solely at heart humbly prays that equal rights and fair and equal treatment may be meted out to all citizens by the restriction of rights in all property real estate included to the beneficent term of fortytwo years  then shall all men bless your honorable body and be happy  and for this will your petitioner ever pray                                              mark twain   a paragraph not added to the petition  the charming absurdity of restricting propertyrights in books to fortytwo years sticks prominently out in the fact that hardly any mans books ever live fortytwo years or even the half of it and so for the sake of getting a shabby advantage of the heirs of about one scott or burns or milton in a hundred years the lawmakers of the great republic are content to leave that poor little pilfering edict upon the statutebooks  it is like an emperor lying in wait to rob a phenixs nest and waiting the necessary century to get the chance       afterdinner speech  at a fourth of july gathering in london of americans  mr chairman and ladies and gentlemen i thank you for the compliment which has just been tendered me and to show my appreciation of it i will not afflict you with many words  it is pleasant to celebrate in this peaceful way upon this old mother soil the anniversary of an experiment which was born of war with this same land so long ago and wrought out to a successful issue by the devotion of our ancestors  it has taken nearly a hundred years to bring the english and americans into kindly and mutually appreciative relations but i believe it has been accomplished at last  it was a great step when the two last misunderstandings were settled by arbitration instead of cannon  it is another great step when england adopts our sewingmachines without claiming the inventionas usual  it was another when they imported one of our sleepingcars the other day  and it warmed my heart more than i can tell yesterday when i witnessed the spectacle of an englishman ordering an american sherry cobbler of his own free will and accordand not only that but with a great brain and a level head reminding the barkeeper not to forget the strawberries  with a common origin a common language a common literature a common religion andcommon drinks what is longer needful to the cementing of the two nations together in a permanent bond of brotherhood  this is an age of progress and ours is a progressive land  a great and glorious land tooa land which has developed a washington a franklin a william m tweed a longfellow a motley a jay gould a samuel c pomeroy a recent congress which has never had its equal in some respects and a united states army which conquered sixty indians in eight months by tiring them outwhich is much better than uncivilized slaughter god knows  we have a criminal jury system which is superior to any in the world and its efficiency is only marred by the difficulty of finding twelve men every day who dont know anything and cant read and i may observe that we have an insanity plea that would have saved cain  i think i can say and say with pride that we have some legislatures that bring higher prices than any in the world  i refer with effusion to our railway system which consents to let us live though it might do the opposite being our owners  it only destroyed three thousand and seventy lives last year by collisions and twentyseven thousand two hundred and sixty by running over heedless and unnecessary people at crossings  the companies seriously regretted the killing of these thirty thousand people and went so far as to pay for some of themvoluntarily of course for the meanest of us would not claim that we possess a court treacherous enough to enforce a law against a railway company  but thank heaven the railway companies are generally disposed to do the right and kindly thing without compulsion i know of an instance which greatly touched me at the time  after an accident the company sent home the remains of a dear distant old relative of mine in a basket with the remark please state what figure you hold him atand return the basket  now there couldnt be anything friendlier than that  but i must not stand here and brag all night  however you wont mind a body bragging a little about his country on the fourth of july  it is a fair and legitimate time to fly the eagle  i will say only one more word of bragand a hopeful one  it is this  we have a form of government which gives each man a fair chance and no favor  with us no individual is born with a right to look down upon his neighbor and hold him in contempt  let such of us as are not dukes find our consolation in that and we may find hope for the future in the fact that as unhappy as is the condition of our political morality today england has risen up out of a far fouler since the days when charles i ennobled courtesans and all political place was a matter of bargain and sale  there is hope for us yet 1       1 at least the above is the speech which i was going to make but our      minister general schenck presided and after the blessing got up      and made a great long inconceivably dull harangue and wound up by      saying that inasmuch as speechmaking did not seem to exhilarate the      guests much all further oratory would be dispensed with during the      evening and we could just sit and talk privately to our      elbowneighbors and have a good sociable time  it is known that in      consequence of that remark fortyfour perfected speeches died in the      womb  the depression the gloom the solemnity that reigned over      the banquet from that time forth will be a lasting memory with many      that were there  by that one thoughtless remark general schenck      lost fortyfour of the best friends he had in england  more than      one said that night and this is the sort of person that is sent to      represent us in a great sister empire       lionizing murderers  i had heard so much about the celebrated fortuneteller madame that i went to see her yesterday  she has a dark complexion naturally and this effect is heightened by artificial aids which cost her nothing she wears curlsvery black ones and i had an impression that she gave their native attractiveness a lift with rancid butter  she wears a reddish check handkerchief cast loosely around her neck and it was plain that her other one is slow getting back from the wash  i presume she takes snuff  at any rate something resembling it had lodged among the hairs sprouting from her upper lip  i know she likes garlici knew that as soon as she sighed  she looked at me searchingly for nearly a minute with her black eyes and then said  it is enough  come  she started down a very dark and dismal corridori stepping close after her  presently she stopped and said that as the way was so crooked and dark perhaps she had better get a light  but it seemed ungallant to allow a woman to put herself to so much trouble for me and so i said  it is not worth while madam  if you will heave another sigh i think i can follow it  so we got along all right  arrived at her official and mysterious den she asked me to tell her the date of my birth the exact hour of that occurrence and the color of my grandmothers hair  i answered as accurately as i could  then she said  young man summon your fortitudedo not tremble  i am about to reveal the past  information concerning the future would be in a general way more  silence  you have had much trouble some joy some good fortune some bad  your great grandfather was hanged  that is a l  silence  hanged sir  but it was not his fault  he could not help it  i am glad you do him justice  ahgrieve rather that the jury did  he was hanged  his star crosses yours in the fourth division fifth sphere  consequently you will be hanged also  in view of this cheerful  i must have silence  yours was not in the beginning a criminal nature but circumstances changed it  at the age of nine you stole sugar  at the age of fifteen you stole money  at twenty you stole horses  at twentyfive you committed arson  at thirty hardened in crime you became an editor  you are now a public lecturer  worse things are in store for you  you will be sent to congress  next to the penitentiary  finally happiness will come againall will be wellyou will be hanged  i was now in tears  it seemed hard enough to go to congress but to be hangedthis was too sad too dreadful  the woman seemed surprised at my grief  i told her the thoughts that were in my mind  then she comforted me  why man she said hold up your headyou have nothing to grieve about  listen  in this paragraph the fortuneteller details the exact history of the pikebrown assassination case in new hampshire from the succoring and saving of the stranger pike by the browns to the subsequent hanging and coffining of that treacherous miscreant  she adds nothing invents nothing exaggerates nothing see any new england paper for november 1869  this pikebrown case is selected merely as a type to illustrate a custom that prevails not in new hampshire alone but in every state in the unioni mean the sentimental custom of visiting petting glorifying and snuffling over murderers like this pike from the day they enter the jail under sentence of death until they swing from the gallows  the following extract from the temple bar 1866 reveals the fact that this custom is not confined to the united states on december 31 1841 a man named john johnes a shoemaker murdered his sweetheart mary hallam the daughter of a respectable laborer at mansfield in the county of nottingham  he was executed on march 23 1842  he was a man of unsteady habits and gave way to violent fits of passion  the girl declined his addresses and he said if he did not have her no one else should  after he had inflicted the first wound which was not immediately fatal she begged for her life but seeing him resolved asked for time to pray  he said that he would pray for both and completed the crime  the wounds were inflicted by a shoemakers knife and her throat was cut barbarously  after this he dropped on his knees some time and prayed god to have mercy on two unfortunate lovers he made no attempt to escape and confessed the crime  after his imprisonment he behaved in a most decorous manner he won upon the good opinion of the jail chaplain and he was visited by the bishop of lincoln  it does not appear that he expressed any contrition for the crime but seemed to pass away with triumphant certainty that he was going to rejoin his victim in heaven  he was visited by some pious and benevolent ladies of nottingham some of whom declared he was a child of god if ever there was one  one of the ladies sent him a white camellia to wear at his execution  you will live in new hampshire  in your sharp need and distress the brown family will succor yousuch of them as pike the assassin left alive  they will be benefactors to you  when you shall have grown fat upon their bounty and are grateful and happy you will desire to make some modest return for these things and so you will go to the house some night and brain the whole family with an ax  you will rob the dead bodies of your benefactors and disburse your gains in riotous living among the rowdies and courtesans of boston  then you will be arrested tried condemned to be hanged thrown into prison  now is your happy day  you will be convertedyou will be converted just as soon as every effort to compass pardon commutation or reprieve has failedand thenwhy then every morning and every afternoon the best and purest young ladies of the village will assemble in your cell and sing hymns this will show that assassination is respectable  then you will write a touching letter in which you will forgive all those recent browns  this will excite the public admiration  no public can withstand magnanimity next they will take you to the scaffold with great éclat at the head of an imposing procession composed of clergymen officials citizens generally and young ladies walking pensively two and two and bearing bouquets and immortelles  you will mount the scaffold and while the great concourse stand uncovered in your presence you will read your sappy little speech which the minister has written for you  and then in the midst of a grand and impressive silence they will swing you into perparadise my son  there will not be a dry eye on the ground  you will be a hero  not a rough there but will envy you  not a rough there but will resolve to emulate you  and next a great procession will follow you to the tombwill weep over your remainsthe young ladies will sing again the hymns made dear by sweet associations connected with the jail and as a last tribute of affection respect and appreciation of your many sterling qualities they will walk two and two around your bier and strew wreaths of flowers on it  and lo you are canonized think of it soningrate assassin robber of the dead drunken brawler among thieves and harlots in the slums of boston one month and the pet of the pure and innocent daughters of the land the next  a bloody and hateful devila bewept bewailed and sainted martyrall in a month foolso noble a fortune and yet you sit here grieving  no madam i said you do me wrong you do indeed  i am perfectly satisfied  i did not know before that my greatgrandfather was hanged but it is of no consequence  he has probably ceased to bother about it by this timeand i have not commenced yet  i confess madam that i do something in the way of editing and lecturing but the other crimes you mention have escaped my memory  yet i must have committed themyou would not deceive a stranger  but let the past be as it was and let the future be as it maythese are nothing  i have only cared for one thing i have always felt that i should be hanged some day and somehow the thought has annoyed me considerably but if you can only assure me that i shall be hanged in new hampshire  not a shadow of a doubt  bless you my benefactressexcuse this embraceyou have removed a great load from my breast  to be hanged in new hampshire is happiness it leaves an honored name behind a man and introduces him at once into the best new hampshire society in the other world  i then took leave of the fortuneteller  but seriously is it well to glorify a murderous villain on the scaffold as pike was glorified in new hampshire  is it well to turn the penalty for a bloody crime into a reward  is it just to do it  is it safe       a new crime  legislation needed  this country during the last thirty or forty years has produced some of the most remarkable cases of insanity of which there is any mention in history  for instance there was the baldwin case in ohio twentytwo years ago  baldwin from his boyhood up had been of a vindictive malignant quarrelsome nature  he put a boys eye out once and never was heard upon any occasion to utter a regret for it  he did many such things  but at last he did something that was serious  he called at a house just after dark one evening knocked and when the occupant came to the door shot him dead and then tried to escape but was captured two days before he had wantonly insulted a helpless cripple and the man he afterward took swift vengeance upon with an assassin bullet had knocked him down  such was the baldwin case  the trial was long and exciting the community was fearfully wrought up  men said this spiteful badhearted villain had caused grief enough in his time and now he should satisfy the law  but they were mistaken baldwin was insane when he did the deedthey had not thought of that  by the argument of counsel it was shown that at half past ten in the morning on the day of the murder baldwin became insane and remained so for eleven hours and a half exactly  this just covered the case comfortably and he was acquitted  thus if an unthinking and excited community had been listened to instead of the arguments of counsel a poor crazy creature would have been held to a fearful responsibility for a mere freak of madness  baldwin went clear and although his relatives and friends were naturally incensed against the community for their injurious suspicions and remarks they said let it go for this time and did not prosecute the baldwins were very wealthy  this same baldwin had momentary fits of insanity twice afterward and on both occasions killed people he had grudges against  and on both these occasions the circumstances of the killing were so aggravated and the murders so seemingly heartless and treacherous that if baldwin had not been insane he would have been hanged without the shadow of a doubt  as it was it required all his political and family influence to get him clear in one of the cases and cost him not less than ten thousand dollars to get clear in the other one of these men he had notoriously been threatening to kill for twelve years  the poor creature happened by the merest piece of ill fortune to come along a dark alley at the very moment that baldwins insanity came upon him and so he was shot in the back with a gun loaded with slugs  take the case of lynch hackett of pennsylvania  twice in public he attacked a german butcher by the name of bemis feldner with a cane and both times feldner whipped him with his fists  hackett was a vain wealthy violent gentleman who held his blood and family in high esteem and believed that a reverent respect was due to his great riches  he brooded over the shame of his chastisement for two weeks and then in a momentary fit of insanity armed himself to the teeth rode into town waited a couple of hours until he saw feldner coming down the street with his wife on his arm and then as the couple passed the doorway in which he had partially concealed himself he drove a knife into feldners neck killing him instantly  the widow caught the limp form and eased it to the earth  both were drenched with blood  hackett jocosely remarked to her that as a professional butchers recent wife she could appreciate the artistic neatness of the job that left her in condition to marry again in case she wanted to  this remark and another which he made to a friend that his position in society made the killing of an obscure citizen simply an eccentricity instead of a crime were shown to be evidences of insanity and so hackett escaped punishment  the jury were hardly inclined to accept these as proofs at first inasmuch as the prisoner had never been insane before the murder and under the tranquilizing effect of the butchering had immediately regained his right mind but when the defense came to show that a third cousin of hacketts wifes stepfather was insane and not only insane but had a nose the very counterpart of hacketts it was plain that insanity was hereditary in the family and hackett had come by it by legitimate inheritance  of course the jury then acquitted him  but it was a merciful providence that mrs hs people had been afflicted as shown else hackett would certainly have been hanged  however it is not possible to recount all the marvelous cases of insanity that have come under the public notice in the last thirty or forty years  there was the durgin case in new jersey three years ago the servant girl bridget durgin at dead of night invaded her mistresss bedroom and carved the lady literally to pieces with a knife then she dragged the body to the middle of the floor and beat and banged it with chairs and such things  next she opened the feather beds and strewed the contents around saturated everything with kerosene and set fire to the general wreck  she now took up the young child of the murdered woman in her blood smeared hands and walked off through the snow with no shoes on to a neighbors house a quarter of a mile off and told a string of wild incoherent stories about some men coming and setting fire to the house and then she cried piteously and without seeming to think there was anything suggestive about the blood upon her hands her clothing and the baby volunteered the remark that she was afraid those men had murdered her mistress  afterward by her own confession and other testimony it was proved that the mistress had always been kind to the girl consequently there was no revenge in the murder and it was also shown that the girl took nothing away from the burning house not even her own shoes and consequently robbery was not the motive  now the reader says here comes that same old plea of insanity again but the reader has deceived himself this time  no such plea was offered in her defense  the judge sentenced her nobody persecuted the governor with petitions for her pardon and she was promptly hanged  there was that youth in pennsylvania whose curious confession was published some years ago  it was simply a conglomeration of incoherent drivel from beginning to end and so was his lengthy speech on the scaffold afterward  for a whole year he was haunted with a desire to disfigure a certain young woman so that no one would marry her  he did not love her himself and did not want to marry her but he did not want anybody else to do it  he would not go anywhere with her and yet was opposed to anybody elses escorting her  upon one occasion he declined to go to a wedding with her and when she got other company lay in wait for the couple by the road intending to make them go back or kill the escort  after spending sleepless nights over his ruling desire for a full year he at last attempted its executionthat is attempted to disfigure the young woman  it was a success  it was permanent  in trying to shoot her cheek as she sat at the suppertable with her parents and brothers and sisters in such a manner as to mar its comeliness one of his bullets wandered a little out of the course and she dropped dead  to the very last moment of his life he bewailed the ill luck that made her move her face just at the critical moment  and so he died apparently about half persuaded that somehow it was chiefly her own fault that she got killed  this idiot was hanged  the plea of insanity was not offered  insanity certainly is on the increase in the world and crime is dying out  there are no longer any murdersnone worth mentioning at any rate  formerly if you killed a man it was possible that you were insanebut now if you having friends and money kill a man it is evidence that you are a lunatic  in these days too if a person of good family and high social standing steals anything they call it kleptomania and send him to the lunatic asylum  if a person of high standing squanders his fortune in dissipation and closes his career with strychnine or a bullet temporary aberration is what was the trouble with him  is not this insanity plea becoming rather common  is it not so common that the reader confidently expects to see it offered in every criminal case that comes before the courts  and is it not so cheap and so common and often so trivial that the reader smiles in derision when the newspaper mentions it and is it not curious to note how very often it wins acquittal for the prisoner  of late years it does not seem possible for a man to so conduct himself before killing another man as not to be manifestly insane  if he talks about the stars he is insane  if he appears nervous and uneasy an hour before the killing he is insane  if he weeps over a great grief his friends shake their heads and fear that he is not right  if an hour after the murder he seems ill at ease preoccupied and excited he is unquestionably insane  really what we want now is not laws against crime but a law against insanity  there is where the true evil lies       a curious dream written about 1870  containing a moral  night before last i had a singular dream  i seemed to be sitting on a doorstep in no particular city perhaps ruminating and the time of night appeared to be about twelve or one oclock  the weather was balmy and delicious  there was no human sound in the air not even a footstep there was no sound of any kind to emphasize the dead stillness except the occasional hollow barking of a dog in the distance and the fainter answer of a further dog  presently up the street i heard a bony clackclacking and guessed it was the castanets of a serenading party in a minute more a tall skeleton hooded and half clad in a tattered and moldy shroud whose shreds were flapping about the ribby latticework of its person swung by me with a stately stride and disappeared in the gray gloom of the starlight  it had a broken and wormeaten coffin on its shoulder and a bundle of something in its hand  i knew what the clackclacking was then it was this partys joints working together and his elbows knocking against his sides as he walked  i may say i was surprised  before i could collect my thoughts and enter upon any speculations as to what this apparition might portend i heard another one coming for i recognized his clackclack  he had twothirds of a coffin on his shoulder and some foot and head boards under his arm i mightily wanted to peer under his hood and speak to him but when he turned and smiled upon me with his cavernous sockets and his projecting grin as he went by i thought i would not detain him  he was hardly gone when i heard the clacking again and another one issued from the shadowy halflight  this one was bending under a heavy gravestone and dragging a shabby coffin after him by a string  when he got to me he gave me a steady look for a moment or two and then rounded to and backed up to me saying  ease this down for a fellow will you  i eased the gravestone down till it rested on the ground and in doing so noticed that it bore the name of john baxter copmanhurst with may 1839 as the date of his death  deceased sat wearily down by me and wiped his os frontis with his major maxillarychiefly from former habit i judged for i could not see that he brought away any perspiration  it is too bad too bad said he drawing the remnant of the shroud about him and leaning his jaw pensively on his hand  then he put his left foot up on his knee and fell to scratching his anklebone absently with a rusty nail which he got out of his coffin  what is too bad friend  oh everything everything  i almost wish i never had died  you surprise me  why do you say this  has anything gone wrong  what is the matter  matter  look at this shroudrags  look at this gravestone all battered up  look at that disgraceful old coffin  all a mans property going to ruin and destruction before his eyes and ask him if anything is wrong  fire and brimstone  calm yourself calm yourself i said  it is too badit is certainly too bad but then i had not supposed that you would much mind such matters situated as you are  well my dear sir i do mind them  my pride is hurt and my comfort is impaireddestroyed i might say  i will state my casei will put it to you in such a way that you can comprehend it if you will let me said the poor skeleton tilting the hood of his shroud back as if he were clearing for action and thus unconsciously giving himself a jaunty and festive air very much at variance with the grave character of his position in lifeso to speakand in prominent contrast with his distressful mood  proceed said i  i reside in the shameful old graveyard a block or two above you here in this streetthere now i just expected that cartilage would let go third rib from the bottom friend hitch the end of it to my spine with a string if you have got such a thing about you though a bit of silver wire is a deal pleasanter and more durable and becoming if one keeps it polishedto think of shredding out and going to pieces in this way just on account of the indifference and neglect of ones posterityand the poor ghost grated his teeth in a way that gave me a wrench and a shiver for the effect is mightily increased by the absence of muffling flesh and cuticle  i reside in that old graveyard and have for these thirty years and i tell you things are changed since i first laid this old tired frame there and turned over and stretched out for a long sleep with a delicious sense upon me of being done with bother and grief and anxiety and doubt and fear forever and ever and listening with comfortable and increasing satisfaction to the sextons work from the startling clatter of his first spadeful on my coffin till it dulled away to the faint patting that shaped the roof of my new homedelicious  my i wish you could try it tonight and out of my reverie deceased fetched me a rattling slap with a bony hand  yes sir thirty years ago i laid me down there and was happy  for it was out in the country thenout in the breezy flowery grand old woods and the lazy winds gossiped with the leaves and the squirrels capered over us and around us and the creeping things visited us and the birds filled the tranquil solitude with music  ah it was worth ten years of a mans life to be dead then  everything was pleasant  i was in a good neighborhood for all the dead people that lived near me belonged to the best families in the city  our posterity appeared to think the world of us  they kept our graves in the very best condition the fences were always in faultless repair headboards were kept painted or whitewashed and were replaced with new ones as soon as they began to look rusty or decayed monuments were kept upright railings intact and bright the rosebushes and shrubbery trimmed trained and free from blemish the walks clean and smooth and graveled  but that day is gone by  our descendants have forgotten us  my grandson lives in a stately house built with money made by these old hands of mine and i sleep in a neglected grave with invading vermin that gnaw my shroud to build them nests withal  i and friends that lie with me founded and secured the prosperity of this fine city and the stately bantling of our loves leaves us to rot in a dilapidated cemetery which neighbors curse and strangers scoff at  see the difference between the old time and this for instance our graves are all caved in now our headboards have rotted away and tumbled down our railings reel this way and that with one foot in the air after a fashion of unseemly levity our monuments lean wearily and our gravestones bow their heads discouraged there be no adornments any moreno roses nor shrubs nor graveled walks nor anything that is a comfort to the eye and even the paintless old board fence that did make a show of holding us sacred from companionship with beasts and the defilement of heedless feet has tottered till it overhangs the street and only advertises the presence of our dismal restingplace and invites yet more derision to it  and now we cannot hide our poverty and tatters in the friendly woods for the city has stretched its withering arms abroad and taken us in and all that remains of the cheer of our old home is the cluster of lugubrious forest trees that stand bored and weary of a city life with their feet in our coffins looking into the hazy distance and wishing they were there i tell you it is disgraceful  you begin to comprehendyou begin to see how it is  while our descendants are living sumptuously on our money right around us in the city we have to fight hard to keep skull and bones together  bless you there isnt a grave in our cemetery that doesnt leaknot one  every time it rains in the night we have to climb out and roost in the trees and sometimes we are wakened suddenly by the chilly water trickling down the back of our necks  then i tell you there is a general heaving up of old graves and kicking over of old monuments and scampering of old skeletons for the trees  bless me if you had gone along there some such nights after twelve you might have seen as many as fifteen of us roosting on one limb with our joints rattling drearily and the wind wheezing through our ribs  many a time we have perched there for three or four dreary hours and then come down stiff and chilled through and drowsy and borrowed each others skulls to bail out our graves withif you will glance up in my mouth now as i tilt my head back you can see that my headpiece is half full of old dry sedimenthow topheavy and stupid it makes me sometimes  yes sir many a time if you had happened to come along just before the dawn youd have caught us bailing out the graves and hanging our shrouds on the fence to dry  why i had an elegant shroud stolen from there one morningthink a party by the name of smith took it that resides in a plebeian graveyard over yonderi think so because the first time i ever saw him he hadnt anything on but a check shirt and the last time i saw him which was at a social gathering in the new cemetery he was the bestdressed corpse in the companyand it is a significant fact that he left when he saw me and presently an old woman from here missed her coffinshe generally took it with her when she went anywhere because she was liable to take cold and bring on the spasmodic rheumatism that originally killed her if she exposed herself to the night air much  she was named hotchkissanna matilda hotchkissyou might know her  she has two upper front teeth is tall but a good deal inclined to stoop one rib on the left side gone has one shred of rusty hair hanging from the left side of her head and one little tuft just above and a little forward of her right ear has her underjaw wired on one side where it had worked loose small bone of left forearm gonelost in a fighthas a kind of swagger in her gait and a gallus way of going with her arms akimbo and her nostrils in the airhas been pretty free and easy and is all damaged and battered up till she looks like a queensware crate in ruinsmaybe you have met her  god forbid i involuntarily ejaculated for somehow i was not looking for that form of question and it caught me a little off my guard  but i hastened to make amends for my rudeness and say i simply meant i had not had the honorfor i would not deliberately speak discourteously of a friend of yours  you were saying that you were robbedand it was a shame toobut it appears by what is left of the shroud you have on that it was a costly one in its day  how did  a most ghastly expression began to develop among the decayed features and shriveled integuments of my guests face and i was beginning to grow uneasy and distressed when he told me he was only working up a deep sly smile with a wink in it to suggest that about the time he acquired his present garment a ghost in a neighboring cemetery missed one  this reassured me but i begged him to confine himself to speech thenceforth because his facial expression was uncertain  even with the most elaborate care it was liable to miss fire  smiling should especially be avoided  what he might honestly consider a shining success was likely to strike me in a very different light  i said i liked to see a skeleton cheerful even decorously playful but i did not think smiling was a skeletons best hold  yes friend said the poor skeleton the facts are just as i have given them to you  two of these old graveyardsthe one that i resided in and one further along have been deliberately neglected by our descendants of today until there is no occupying them any longer  aside from the osteological discomfort of itand that is no light matter this rainy weatherthe present state of things is ruinous to property  we have got to move or be content to see our effects wasted away and utterly destroyed  now you will hardly believe it but it is true nevertheless that there isnt a single coffin in good repair among all my acquaintancenow that is an absolute fact  i do not refer to low people who come in a pine box mounted on an expresswagon but i am talking about your hightoned silvermounted burialcase your monumental sort that travel under black plumes at the head of a procession and have choice of cemetery lots i mean folks like the jarvises and the bledsoes and burlings and such they are all about ruined  the most substantial people in our set they were  and now look at themutterly used up and povertystricken  one of the bledsoes actually traded his monument to a late barkeeper for some fresh shavings to put under his head  i tell you it speaks volumes for there is nothing a corpse takes so much pride in as his monument  he loves to read the inscription  he comes after a while to believe what it says himself and then you may see him sitting on the fence night after night enjoying it  epitaphs are cheap and they do a poor chap a world of good after he is dead especially if he had hard luck while he was alive  i wish they were used more  now i dont complain but confidentially i do think it was a little shabby in my descendants to give me nothing but this old slab of a gravestoneand all the more that there isnt a compliment on it  it used to have                      gone to his just reward  on it and i was proud when i first saw it but by and by i noticed that whenever an old friend of mine came along he would hook his chin on the railing and pull a long face and read along down till he came to that and then he would chuckle to himself and walk off looking satisfied and comfortable  so i scratched it off to get rid of those fools  but a dead man always takes a deal of pride in his monument  yonder goes half a dozen of the jarvises now with the family monument along  and smithers and some hired specters went by with his awhile ago  hello higgins goodby old friend  thats meredith higginsdied in 44 belongs to our set in the cemeteryfine old familygreatgrandmother was an injuni am on the most familiar terms with himhe didnt hear me was the reason he didnt answer me  and i am sorry too because i would have liked to introduce you  you would admire him  he is the most disjointed swaybacked and generally distorted old skeleton you ever saw but he is full of fun  when he laughs it sounds like rasping two stones together and he always starts it off with a cheery screech like raking a nail across a windowpane  hey jones  that is old columbus jonesshroud cost four hundred dollarsentire trousseau including monument twentyseven hundred  this was in the spring of 26  it was enormous style for those days  dead people came all the way from the alleghanies to see his thingsthe party that occupied the grave next to mine remembers it well  now do you see that individual going along with a piece of a headboard under his arm one legbone below his knee gone and not a thing in the world on  that is barstow dalhousie and next to columbus jones he was the most sumptuously outfitted person that ever entered our cemetery  we are all leaving  we cannot tolerate the treatment we are receiving at the hands of our descendants  they open new cemeteries but they leave us to our ignominy  they mend the streets but they never mend anything that is about us or belongs to us look at that coffin of mineyet i tell you in its day it was a piece of furniture that would have attracted attention in any drawingroom in this city  you may have it if you want iti cant afford to repair it put a new bottom in her and part of a new top and a bit of fresh lining along the left side and youll find her about as comfortable as any receptacle of her species you ever tried  no thanksno dont mention it you have been civil to me and i would give you all the property i have got before i would seem ungrateful  now this windingsheet is a kind of a sweet thing in its way if you would like tono  well just as you say but i wished to be fair and liberaltheres nothing mean about me goodby friend i must be going  i may have a good way to go tonight dont know  i only know one thing for certain and that is that i am on the emigrant trail now and ill never sleep in that crazy old cemetery again  i will travel till i find respectable quarters if i have to hoof it to new jersey  all the boys are going  it was decided in public conclave last night to emigrate and by the time the sun rises there wont be a bone left in our old habitations  such cemeteries may suit my surviving friends but they do not suit the remains that have the honor to make these remarks  my opinion is the general opinion if you doubt it go and see how the departing ghosts upset things before they started  they were almost riotous in their demonstrations of distaste  hello here are some of the bledsoes and if you will give me a lift with this tombstone i guess i will join company and jog along with themmighty respectable old family the bledsoes and used to always come out in sixhorse hearses and all that sort of thing fifty years ago when i walked these streets in daylight  goodby friend  and with his gravestone on his shoulder he joined the grisly procession dragging his damaged coffin after him for notwithstanding he pressed it upon me so earnestly i utterly refused his hospitality  i suppose that for as much as two hours these sad outcasts went clacking by laden with their dismal effects and all that time i sat pitying them  one or two of the youngest and least dilapidated among them inquired about midnight trains on the railways but the rest seemed unacquainted with that mode of travel and merely asked about common public roads to various towns and cities some of which are not on the map now and vanished from it and from the earth as much as thirty years ago and some few of them never had existed anywhere but on maps and private ones in realestate agencies at that  and they asked about the condition of the cemeteries in these towns and cities and about the reputation the citizens bore as to reverence for the dead  this whole matter interested me deeply and likewise compelled my sympathy for these homeless ones  and it all seeming real and i not knowing it was a dream i mentioned to one shrouded wanderer an idea that had entered my head to publish an account of this curious and very sorrowful exodus but said also that i could not describe it truthfully and just as it occurred without seeming to trifle with a grave subject and exhibit an irreverence for the dead that would shock and distress their surviving friends  but this bland and stately remnant of a former citizen leaned him far over my gate and whispered in my ear and said  do not let that disturb you  the community that can stand such graveyards as those we are emigrating from can stand anything a body can say about the neglected and forsaken dead that lie in them  at that very moment a cock crowed and the weird procession vanished and left not a shred or a bone behind  i awoke and found myself lying with my head out of the bed and sagging downward considerablya position favorable to dreaming dreams with morals in them maybe but not poetry  notethe reader is assured that if the cemeteries in his town are kept in good order this dream is not leveled at his town at all but is leveled particularly and venomously at the next town       a true story  repeated word for word as i heard itwritten about 1876  it was summertime and twilight  we were sitting on the porch of the farmhouse on the summit of the hill and aunt rachel was sitting respectfully below our level on the stepsfor she was our servant and colored  she was of mighty frame and stature she was sixty years old but her eye was undimmed and her strength unabated  she was a cheerful hearty soul and it was no more trouble for her to laugh than it is for a bird to sing  she was under fire now as usual when the day was done that is to say she was being chaffed without mercy and was enjoying it she would let off peal after peal of laughter and then sit with her face in her hands and shake with throes of enjoyment which she could no longer get breath enough to express  at such a moment as this a thought occurred to me and i said  aunt rachel how is it that youve lived sixty years and never had any trouble  she stopped quaking  she paused and there was moment of silence  she turned her face over her shoulder toward me and said without even a smile in her voice  misto c is you in arnest  it surprised me a good deal and it sobered my manner and my speech too i said  why i thoughtthat is i meantwhy you cant have had any trouble ive never heard you sigh and

lord god ob heaven be praise i got my own agin       oh no misto c i haint had no trouble  an no joy       the siamese twinswritten about 1868  i do not wish to write of the personal habits of these strange creatures solely but also of certain curious details of various kinds concerning them which belonging only to their private life have never crept into print  knowing the twins intimately i feel that i am peculiarly well qualified for the task i have taken upon myself  the siamese twins are naturally tender and affectionate in disposition and have clung to each other with singular fidelity throughout a long and eventful life  even as children they were inseparable companions and it was noticed that they always seemed to prefer each others society to that of any other persons  they nearly always played together and so accustomed was their mother to this peculiarity that whenever both of them chanced to be lost she usually only hunted for one of them satisfied that when she found that one she would find his brother somewhere in the immediate neighborhood  and yet these creatures were ignorant and unletteredbarbarians themselves and the offspring of barbarians who knew not the light of philosophy and science  what a withering rebuke is this to our boasted civilization with its quarrelings its wranglings and its separations of brothers  as men the twins have not always lived in perfect accord but still there has always been a bond between them which made them unwilling to go away from each other and dwell apart  they have even occupied the same house as a general thing and it is believed that they have never failed to even sleep together on any night since they were born  how surely do the habits of a lifetime become second nature to us  the twins always go to bed at the same time but chang usually gets up about an hour before his brother  by an understanding between themselves chang does all the indoor work and eng runs all the errands  this is because eng likes to go out changs habits are sedentary  however chang always goes along eng is a baptist but chang is a roman catholic still to please his brother chang consented to be baptized at the same time that eng was on condition that it should not count  during the war they were strong partisans and both fought gallantly all through the great struggleeng on the union side and chang on the confederate  they took each other prisoners at seven oaks but the proofs of capture were so evenly balanced in favor of each that a general army court had to be assembled to determine which one was properly the captor and which the captive the jury was unable to agree for a long time but the vexed question was finally decided by agreeing to consider them both prisoners and then exchanging them  at one time chang was convicted of disobedience of orders and sentenced to ten days in the guardhouse but eng in spite of all arguments felt obliged to share his imprisonment notwithstanding he himself was entirely innocent and so to save the blameless brother from suffering they had to discharge both from custodythe just reward of faithfulness  upon one occasion the brothers fell out about something and chang knocked eng down and then tripped and fell on him whereupon both clinched and began to beat and gouge each other without mercy  the bystanders interfered and tried to separate them but they could not do it and so allowed them to fight it out  in the end both were disabled and were carried to the hospital on one and the same shutter  their ancient habit of going always together had its drawbacks when they reached mans estate and entered upon the luxury of courting  both fell in love with the same girl  each tried to steal clandestine interviews with her but at the critical moment the other would always turn up by and by eng saw with distraction that chang had won the girls affections and from that day forth he had to bear with the agony of being a witness to all their dainty billing and cooing  but with a magnanimity that did him infinite credit he succumbed to his fate and gave countenance and encouragement to a state of things that bade fair to sunder his generous heartstrings  he sat from seven every evening until two in the morning listening to the fond foolishness of the two lovers and to the concussion of hundreds of squandered kissesfor the privilege of sharing only one of which he would have given his right hand  but he sat patiently and waited and gaped and yawned and stretched and longed for two oclock to come  and he took long walks with the lovers on moonlight eveningssometimes traversing ten miles notwithstanding he was usually suffering from rheumatism  he is an inveterate smoker but he could not smoke on these occasions because the young lady was painfully sensitive to the smell of tobacco  eng cordially wanted them married and done with it but although chang often asked the momentous question the young lady could not gather sufficient courage to answer it while eng was by  however on one occasion after having walked some sixteen miles and sat up till nearly daylight eng dropped asleep from sheer exhaustion and then the question was asked and answered  the lovers were married  all acquainted with the circumstance applauded the noble brotherinlaw  his unwavering faithfulness was the theme of every tongue  he had stayed by them all through their long and arduous courtship and when at last they were married he lifted his hands above their heads and said with impressive unction bless ye my children i will never desert ye and he kept his word  fidelity like this is all too rare in this cold world  by and by eng fell in love with his sisterinlaws sister and married her and since that day they have all lived together night and day in an exceeding sociability which is touching and beautiful to behold and is a scathing rebuke to our boasted civilization  the sympathy existing between these two brothers is so close and so refined that the feelings the impulses the emotions of the one are instantly experienced by the other  when one is sick the other is sick when one feels pain the other feels it when one is angered the others temper takes fire  we have already seen with what happy facility they both fell in love with the same girl  now chang is bitterly opposed to all forms of intemperance on principle but eng is the reversefor while these mens feelings and emotions are so closely wedded their reasoning faculties are unfettered their thoughts are free  chang belongs to the good templars and is a hardworking enthusiastic supporter of all temperance reforms  but to his bitter distress every now and then eng gets drunk and of course that makes chang drunk too this unfortunate thing has been a great sorrow to chang for it almost destroys his usefulness in his favorite field of effort  as sure as he is to head a great temperance procession eng ranges up alongside of him prompt to the minute and drunk as a lord but yet no more dismally and hopelessly drunk than his brother who has not tasted a drop  and so the two begin to hoot and yell and throw mud and bricks at the good templars and of course they break up the procession  it would be manifestly wrong to punish chang for what eng does and therefore the good templars accept the untoward situation and suffer in silence and sorrow  they have officially and deliberately examined into the matter and find chang blameless  they have taken the two brothers and filled chang full of warm water and sugar and eng full of whisky and in twentyfive minutes it was not possible to tell which was the drunkest both were as drunk as loonsand on hot whisky punches by the smell of their breath  yet all the while changs moral principles were unsullied his conscience clear and so all just men were forced to confess that he was not morally but only physically drunk  by every right and by every moral evidence the man was strictly sober and therefore it caused his friends all the more anguish to see him shake hands with the pump and try to wind his watch with his nightkey  there is a moral in these solemn warningsor at least a warning in these solemn morals one or the other  no matter it is somehow  let us heed it let us profit by it  i could say more of an instructive nature about these interesting beings but let what i have written suffice  having forgotten to mention it sooner i will remark in conclusion that the ages of the siamese twins are respectively fiftyone and fiftythree years       speech at the scottish banquet in londonwritten about 1872  at the anniversary festival of the scottish corporation of london on monday evening in response to the toast of the ladies mark twain replied  the following is his speech as reported in the london observer  i am proud indeed of the distinction of being chosen to respond to this especial toast to the ladies or to women if you please for that is the preferable term perhaps it is certainly the older and therefore the more entitled to reverence laughter  i have noticed that the bible with that plain blunt honesty which is such a conspicuous characteristic of the scriptures is always particular to never refer to even the illustrious mother of all mankind herself as a lady but speaks of her as a woman laughter  it is odd but you will find it is so  i am peculiarly proud of this honor because i think that the toast to women is one which by right and by every rule of gallantry should take precedence of all othersof the army of the navy of even royalty itselfperhaps though the latter is not necessary in this day and in this land for the reason that tacitly you do drink a broad general health to all good women when you drink the health of the queen of england and the princess of wales  loud cheers  i have in mind a poem just now which is familiar to you all familiar to everybody  and what an inspiration that was and how instantly the present toast recalls the verses to all our minds when the most noble the most gracious the purest and sweetest of all poets says                           woman  o womaner                          wom  laughter  however you remember the lines and you remember how feelingly how daintily how almost imperceptibly the verses raise up before you feature by feature the ideal of a true and perfect woman and how as you contemplate the finished marvel your homage grows into worship of the intellect that could create so fair a thing out of mere breath mere words  and you call to mind now as i speak how the poet with stern fidelity to the history of all humanity delivers this beautiful child of his heart and his brain over to the trials and sorrows that must come to all sooner or later that abide in the earth and how the pathetic story culminates in that apostropheso wild so regretful so full of mournful retrospection  the lines run thus                      alasalasaalas                     alasalas  and so on  laughter i do not remember the rest but taken together it seems to me that poem is the noblest tribute to woman that human genius has ever brought forthlaughterand i feel that if i were to talk hours i could not do my great theme completer or more graceful justice than i have now done in simply quoting that poets matchless words  renewed laughter the phases of

rector of glasgow university and had made a speech which gave rise to a world of discussion       a ghost story  i took a large room far up broadway in a huge old building whose upper stories had been wholly unoccupied for years until i came  the place had long been given up to dust and cobwebs to solitude and silence i seemed groping among the tombs and invading the privacy of the dead that first night i climbed up to my quarters  for the first time in my life a superstitious dread came over me and as i turned a dark angle of the stairway and an invisible cobweb swung its slazy woof in my face and clung there i shuddered as one who had encountered a phantom  i was glad enough when i reached my room and locked out the mold and the darkness  a cheery fire was burning in the grate and i sat down before it with a comforting sense of relief  for two hours i sat there thinking of bygone times recalling old scenes and summoning halfforgotten faces out of the mists of the past listening in fancy to voices that long ago grew silent for all time and to once familiar songs that nobody sings now  and as my reverie softened down to a sadder and sadder pathos the shrieking of the winds outside softened to a wail the angry beating of the rain against the panes diminished to a tranquil patter and one by one the noises in the street subsided until the hurrying footsteps of the last belated straggler died away in the distance and left no sound behind  the fire had burned low  a sense of loneliness crept over me  i arose and undressed moving on tiptoe about the room doing stealthily what i had to do as if i were environed by sleeping enemies whose slumbers it would be fatal to break  i covered up in bed and lay listening to the rain and wind and the faint creaking of distant shutters till they lulled me to sleep  i slept profoundly but how long i do not know  all at once i found myself awake and filled with a shuddering expectancy  all was still all but my own hearti could hear it beat  presently the bedclothes began to slip away slowly toward the foot of the bed as if some one were pulling them  i could not stir i could not speak  still the blankets slipped deliberately away till my breast was uncovered  then with a great effort i seized them and drew them over my head  i waited listened waited  once more that steady pull began and once more i lay torpid a century of dragging seconds till my breast was naked again  at last i roused my energies and snatched the covers back to their place and held them with a strong grip  i waited  by and by i felt a faint tug and took a fresh grip  the tug strengthened to a steady strainit grew stronger and stronger  my hold parted and for the third time the blankets slid away  i groaned  an answering groan came from the foot of the bed  beaded drops of sweat stood upon my forehead  i was more dead than alive  presently i heard a heavy footstep in my roomthe step of an elephant it seemed to meit was not like anything human  but it was moving from methere was relief in that  i heard it approach the door pass out without moving bolt or lockand wander away among the dismal corridors straining the floors and joists till they creaked again as it passedand then silence reigned once more  when my excitement had calmed i said to myself this is a dreamsimply a hideous dream  and so i lay thinking it over until i convinced myself that it was a dream and then a comforting laugh relaxed my lips and i was happy again  i got up and struck a light and when i found that the locks and bolts were just as i had left them another soothing laugh welled in my heart and rippled from my lips  i took my pipe and lit it and was just sitting down before the fire whendown went the pipe out of my nerveless fingers the blood forsook my cheeks and my placid breathing was cut short with a gasp  in the ashes on the hearth side by side with my own bare footprint was another so vast that in comparison mine was but an infants  then i had had a visitor and the elephant tread was explained  i put out the light and returned to bed palsied with fear  i lay a long time peering into the darkness and listening  then i heard a grating noise overhead like the dragging of a heavy body across the floor then the throwing down of the body and the shaking of my windows in response to the concussion  in distant parts of the building i heard the muffled slamming of doors  i heard at intervals stealthy footsteps creeping in and out among the corridors and up and down the stairs  sometimes these noises approached my door hesitated and went away again  i heard the clanking of chains faintly in remote passages and listened while the clanking grew nearerwhile it wearily climbed the stairways marking each move by the loose surplus of chain that fell with an accented rattle upon each succeeding step as the goblin that bore it advanced  i heard muttered sentences halfuttered screams that seemed smothered violently and the swish of invisible garments the rush of invisible wings  then i became conscious that my chamber was invadedthat i was not alone i heard sighs and breathings about my bed and mysterious whisperings three little spheres of soft phosphorescent light appeared on the ceiling directly over my head clung and glowed there a moment and then dropped two of them upon my face and one upon the pillow  they spattered liquidly and felt warm  intuition told me they had turned to gouts of blood as they felli needed no light to satisfy myself of that  then i saw pallid faces dimly luminous and white uplifted hands floating bodiless in the airfloating a moment and then disappearing the whispering ceased and the voices and the sounds and a solemn stillness followed  i waited and listened  i felt that i must have light or die  i was weak with fear  i slowly raised myself toward a sitting posture and my face came in contact with a clammy hand all strength went from me apparently and i fell back like a stricken invalid  then i heard the rustle of a garmentit seemed to pass to the door and go out  when everything was still once more i crept out of bed sick and feeble and lit the gas with a hand that trembled as if it were aged with a hundred years  the light brought some little cheer to my spirits  i sat down and fell into a dreamy contemplation of that great footprint in the ashes  by and by its outlines began to waver and grow dim  i glanced up and the broad gasflame was slowly wilting away  in the same moment i heard that elephantine tread again  i noted its approach nearer and nearer along the musty halls and dimmer and dimmer the light waned the tread reached my very door and pausedthe light had dwindled to a sickly blue and all things about me lay in a spectral twilight  the door did not open and yet i felt a faint gust of air fan my cheek and presently was conscious of a huge cloudy presence before me  i watched it with fascinated eyes  a pale glow stole over the thing gradually its cloudy folds took shapean arm appeared then legs then a body and last a great sad face looked out of the vapor  stripped of its filmy housings naked muscular and comely the majestic cardiff giant loomed above me  all my misery vanishedfor a child might know that no harm could come with that benignant countenance  my cheerful spirits returned at once and in sympathy with them the gas flamed up brightly again  never a lonely outcast was so glad to welcome company as i was to greet the friendly giant  i said  why is it nobody but you  do you know i have been scared to death for the last two or three hours  i am most honestly glad to see you  i wish i had a chairhere here dont try to sit down in that thing  but it was too late  he was in it before i could stop him and down he wenti never saw a chair shivered so in my life  stop stop youll ruin ev  too late again  there was another crash and another chair was resolved into its original elements  confound it havent you got any judgment at all  do you want to ruin all the furniture on the place  here here you petrified fool  but it was no use  before i could arrest him he had sat down on the bed and it was a melancholy ruin  now what sort of a way is that to do  first you come lumbering about the place bringing a legion of vagabond goblins along with you to worry me to death and then when i overlook an indelicacy of costume which would not be tolerated anywhere by cultivated people except in a respectable theater and not even there if the nudity were of your sex you repay me by wrecking all the furniture you can find to sit down on and why will you  you damage yourself as much as you do me  you have broken off the end of your spinal column and littered up the floor with chips of your hams till the place looks like a marble yard  you ought to be ashamed of yourselfyou are big enough to know better  well i will not break any more furniture  but what am i to do  i have not had a chance to sit down for a century  and the tears came into his eyes  poor devil i said i should not have been so harsh with you  and you are an orphan too no doubt  but sit down on the floor herenothing else can stand your weightand besides we cannot be sociable with you away up there above me i want you down where i can perch on this high countinghouse stool and gossip with you face to face  so he sat down on the floor and lit a pipe which i gave him threw one of my red blankets over his shoulders inverted my sitzbath on his head helmet fashion and made himself picturesque and comfortable  then he crossed his ankles while i renewed the fire and exposed the flat honeycombed bottoms of his prodigious feet to the grateful warmth  what is the matter with the bottom of your feet and the back of your legs that they are gouged up so  infernal chilblainsi caught them clear up to the back of my head roosting out there under newells farm  but i love the place i love it as one loves his old home  there is no peace for me like the peace i feel when i am there  we talked along for half an hour and then i noticed that he looked tired and spoke of it  tired he said  well i should think so  and now i will tell you all about it since you have treated me so well  i am the spirit of the petrified man that lies across the street there in the museum i am the ghost of the cardiff giant  i can have no rest no peace till they have given that poor body burial again  now what was the most natural thing for me to do to make men satisfy this wish  terrify them into it haunt the place where the body lay  so i haunted the museum night after night  i even got other spirits to help me  but it did no good for nobody ever came to the museum at midnight  then it occurred to me to come over the way and haunt this place a little  i felt that if i ever got a hearing i must succeed for i had the most efficient company that perdition could furnish  night after night we have shivered around through these mildewed halls dragging chains groaning whispering tramping up and down stairs till to tell you the truth i am almost worn out  but when i saw a light in your room tonight i roused my energies again and went at it with a deal of the old freshness  but i am tired outentirely fagged out  give me i beseech you give me some hope  i lit off my perch in a burst of excitement and exclaimed  this transcends everything everything that ever did occur  why you poor blundering old fossil you have had all your trouble for nothing you have been haunting a plaster cast of yourselfthe real cardiff giant is in albanya fact  the original fraud was ingeniously and fraudfully duplicated and exhibited in new york as the only genuine cardiff giant to the unspeakable disgust of the owners of the real colossus at the very same time that the latter was drawing crowds at a museum in albanyconfound it dont you know your own remains  i never saw such an eloquent look of shame of pitiable humiliation overspread a countenance before  the petrified man rose slowly to his feet and said  honestly is that true  as true as i am sitting here  he took the pipe from his mouth and laid it on the mantel then stood irresolute a moment unconsciously from old habit thrusting his hands where his pantaloons pockets should have been and meditatively dropping his chin on his breast and finally said  welli never felt so absurd before  the petrified man has sold everybody else and now the mean fraud has ended by selling its own ghost  my son if there is any charity left in your heart for a poor friendless phantom like me dont let this get out  think how you would feel if you had made such an ass of yourself  i heard his stately tramp die away step by step down the stairs and out into the deserted street and felt sorry that he was gone poor fellow and sorrier still that he had carried off my red blanket and my bathtub       the capitoline venus  chapter i

follows  wonderful discoverysome six months ago signor john smitthe an american gentleman now some years a resident of rome purchased for a trifle a small piece of ground in the campagna just beyond the tomb of the scipio family from the owner a bankrupt relative of the princess borghese mr smitthe afterward went to the minister of the public records and had the piece of ground transferred to a poor american artist named george arnold explaining that he did it as payment and satisfaction for pecuniary damage accidentally done by him long since upon property belonging to signor arnold and further observed that he would make additional satisfaction by improving the ground for signor a at his own charge and cost  four weeks ago while making some necessary excavations upon the property signor smitthe unearthed the most remarkable ancient statue that has ever been added to the opulent art treasures of rome it was an exquisite figure of a woman and though sadly stained by the soil and the mold of ages no eye can look unmoved upon its ravishing beauty  the nose the left leg from the knee down an ear and also the toes of the right foot and two fingers of one of the hands were gone but otherwise the noble figure was in a remarkable state of preservation the government at once took military possession of the statue and appointed a commission of artcritics antiquaries and cardinal princes of the church to assess its value and determine the remuneration that must go to the owner of the ground in which it was found  the whole affair was kept a profound secret until last night  in the mean time the commission sat with closed doors and deliberated  last night they decided unanimously that the statue is a venus and the work of some unknown but sublimely gifted artist of the third century before christ they consider it the most faultless work of art the world has any knowledge of  at midnight they held a final conference and decided that the venus was worth the enormous sum of ten million francs  in accordance with roman law and roman usage the government being halfowner in all works of art found in the campagna the state has naught to do but pay five million francs to mr  arnold and take permanent possession of the beautiful statue  this morning the venus will be removed to the capitol there to remain and at noon the commission will wait upon signor arnold with his holiness the popes order upon the treasury for the princely sum of five million francs in gold  chorus of voicesluck  its no name for it  another voicegentlemen i propose that we immediately form an american jointstock company for the purchase of lands and excavations of statues here with proper connections in wall street to bull and bear the stock  allagreed    chapter vi  scenethe roman capitol

patched by the most noted roman artistsand the mere fact that they did the humble patching of so noble a creation will make their names illustrious while the world stands  how strange it seemsthis place  the day before i last stood here ten happy years ago i wasnt a rich man bless your soul i hadnt a cent  and yet i had a good deal to do with making rome mistress of this grandest work of ancient art the world contains  the worshiped the illustrious capitoline venusand what a sum she is valued at  ten millions of francs  yesnow she is  and oh georgy how divinely beautiful she is  ah yes but nothing to what she was before that blessed john smith broke her leg and battered her nose  ingenious smithgifted smithnoble smith  author of all our bliss  hark  do you know what that wheeze means  mary that cub has got the whoopingcough  will you never learn to take care of the children  the end   the capitoline venus is still in the capitol at rome and is still the most charming and most illustrious work of ancient art the world can boast of  but if ever it shall be your fortune to stand before it and go into the customary ecstasies over it dont permit this true and secret history of its origin to mar your blissand when you read about a gigantic petrified man being dug up near syracuse in the state of new york or near any other place keep your own counseland if the barnum that buried him there offers to sell to you at an enormous sum dont you buy send him to the pope   notethe above sketch was written at the time the famous swindle of the petrified giant was the sensation of the day in the united states       speech on accident insurance  delivered in hartford at a dinner to cornelius walford of london  gentlemen i am glad indeed to assist in welcoming the distinguished guest of this occasion to a city whose fame as an insurance center has extended to all lands and given us the name of being a quadruple band of brothers working sweetly hand in handthe colts arms company making the destruction of our race easy and convenient our life insurance citizens paying for the victims when they pass away mr batterson perpetuating their memory with his stately monuments and our fireinsurance comrades taking care of their hereafter  i am glad to assist in welcoming our guestfirst because he is an englishman and i owe a heavy debt of hospitality to certain of his fellowcountrymen and secondly because he is in sympathy with insurance and has been the means of making many other men cast their sympathies in the same direction  certainly there is no nobler field for human effort than the insurance line of businessespecially accident insurance  ever since i have been a director in an accidentinsurance company i have felt that i am a better man  life has seemed more precious  accidents have assumed a kindlier aspect  distressing special providences have lost half their horror  i look upon a cripple now with affectionate interestas an advertisement  i do not seem to care for poetry any more  i do not care for politicseven agriculture does not excite me  but to me now there is a charm about a railway collision that is unspeakable  there is nothing more beneficent than accident insurance  i have seen an entire family lifted out of poverty and into affluence by the simple boon of a broken leg  i have had people come to me on crutches with tears in their eyes to bless this beneficent institution  in all my experience of life i have seen nothing so seraphic as the look that comes into a freshly mutilated mans face when he feels in his vest pocket with his remaining hand and finds his accident ticket all right  and i have seen nothing so sad as the look that came into another splintered customers face when he found he couldnt collect on a wooden leg  i will remark here by way of advertisement that that noble charity which we have named the hartford accident insurance companythe speaker is a director of the company namedis an institution which is peculiarly to be depended upon  a man is bound to prosper who gives it his custom  no man can take out a policy in it and not get crippled before the year is out  now there was one indigent man who had been disappointed so often with other companies that he had grown disheartened his appetite left him he ceased to smilelife was but a weariness  three weeks ago i got him to insure with us and now he is the brightest happiest spirit in this landhas a good steady income and a stylish suit of new bandages every day and travels around on a shutter  i will say in conclusion that my share of the welcome to our guest is none the less hearty because i talk so much nonsense and i know that i can say the same for the rest of the speakers       john chinaman in new york  as i passed along by one of those monster american tea stores in new york i found a chinaman sitting before it acting in the capacity of a sign  everybody that passed by gave him a steady stare as long as their heads would twist over their shoulders without dislocating their necks and a group had stopped to stare deliberately  is it not a shame that we who prate so much about civilization and humanity are content to degrade a fellowbeing to such an office as this  is it not time for reflection when we find ourselves willing to see in such a being matter for frivolous curiosity instead of regret and grave reflection  here was a poor creature whom hard fortune had exiled from his natural home beyond the seas and whose troubles ought to have touched these idle strangers that thronged about him but did it apparently not  men calling themselves the superior race the race of culture and of gentle blood scanned his quaint chinese hat with peaked roof and ball on top and his long queue dangling down his back his short silken blouse curiously frogged and figured and like the rest of his raiment rusty dilapidated and awkwardly put on his blue cotton tightlegged pants tied close around the ankles and his clumsy blunttoed shoes with thick cork soles and having so scanned him from head to foot cracked some unseemly joke about his outlandish attire or his melancholy face and passed on  in my heart i pitied the friendless mongol  i wondered what was passing behind his sad face and what distant scene his vacant eye was dreaming of  were his thoughts with his heart ten thousand miles away beyond the billowy wastes of the pacific among the ricefields and the plumy palms of china under the shadows of remembered mountain peaks or in groves of bloomy shrubs and strange forest trees unknown to climes like ours  and now and then rippling among his visions and his dreams did he hear familiar laughter and halfforgotten voices and did he catch fitful glimpses of the friendly faces of a bygone time  a cruel fate it is i said that is befallen this bronzed wanderer  in order that the group of idlers might be touched at least by the words of the poor fellow since the appeal of his pauper dress and his dreary exile was lost upon them i touched him on the shoulder and said  cheer updont be downhearted  it is not america that treats you in this way it is merely one citizen whose greed of gain has eaten the humanity out of his heart  america has a broader hospitality for the exiled and oppressed  america and americans are always ready to help the unfortunate  money shall be raisedyou shall go back to chinayou shall see your friends again  what wages do they pay you here  divil a cint but four dollars a week and find meself but its aisy barrin the troublesome furrin clothes thats so expinsive  the exile remains at his post  the new york tea merchants who need picturesque signs are not likely to run out of chinamen       how i edited an agricultural paperwritten about 1870  i did not take temporary editorship of an agricultural paper without misgivings  neither would a landsman take command of a ship without misgivings  but i was in circumstances that made the salary an object the regular editor of the paper was going off for a holiday and i accepted the terms he offered and took his place  the sensation of being at work again was luxurious and i wrought all the week with unflagging pleasure  we went to press and i waited a day with some solicitude to see whether my effort was going to attract any notice as i left the office toward sundown a group of men and boys at the foot of the stairs dispersed with one impulse and gave me passageway and i heard one or two of them say thats him  i was naturally pleased by this incident  the next morning i found a similar group at the foot of the stairs and scattering couples and individuals standing here and there in the street and over the way watching me with interest  the group separated and fell back as i approached and i heard a man say look at his eye  i pretended not to observe the notice i was attracting but secretly i was pleased with it and was purposing to write an account of it to my aunt  i went up the short flight of stairs and heard cheery voices and a ringing laugh as i drew near the door which i opened and caught a glimpse of two young rurallooking men whose faces blanched and lengthened when they saw me and then they both plunged through the window with a great crash  i was surprised  in about half an hour an old gentleman with a flowing beard and a fine but rather austere face entered and sat down at my invitation  he seemed to have something on his mind  he took off his hat and set it on the floor and got out of it a red silk handkerchief and a copy of our paper  he put the paper on his lap and while he polished his spectacles with his handkerchief he said are you the new editor  i said i was  have you ever edited an agricultural paper before  no i said this is my first attempt  very likely  have you had any experience in agriculture practically  no i believe i have not  some instinct told me so said the old gentleman putting on his spectacles and looking over them at me with asperity while he folded his paper into a convenient shape  i wish to read you what must have made me have that instinct  it was this editorial  listen and see if it was you that wrote it       turnips should never be pulled it injures them  it is much      better to send a boy up and let him shake the tree  now what do you think of thatfor i really suppose you wrote it  think of it  why i think it is good  i think it is sense  i have no doubt that every year millions and millions of bushels of turnips are spoiled in this township alone by being pulled in a halfripe condition when if they had sent a boy up to shake the tree  shake your grandmother  turnips dont grow on trees  oh they dont dont they  well who said they did  the language was intended to be figurative wholly figurative  anybody that knows anything will know that i meant that the boy should shake the vine  then this old person got up and tore his paper all into small shreds and stamped on them and broke several things with his cane and said i did not know as much as a cow and then went out and banged the door after him and in short acted in such a way that i fancied he was displeased about something  but not knowing what the trouble was i could not be any help to him  pretty soon after this a long cadaverous creature with lanky locks hanging down to his shoulders and a weeks stubble bristling from the hills and valleys of his face darted within the door and halted motionless with finger on lip and head and body bent in listening attitude  no sound was heard  still he listened  no sound  then he turned the key in the door and came elaborately tiptoeing toward me till he was within long reaching distance of me when he stopped and after scanning my face with intense interest for a while drew a folded copy of our paper from his bosom and said  there you wrote that  read it to mequick  relieve me  i suffer  i read as follows and as the sentences fell from my lips i could see the relief come i could see the drawn muscles relax and the anxiety go out of the face and rest and peace steal over the features like the merciful moonlight over a desolate landscape       the guano is a fine bird but great care is necessary in rearing it      it should not be imported earlier than june or later than september      in the winter it should be kept in a warm place where it can hatch      out its young       it is evident that we are to have a backward season for grain      therefore it will be well for the farmer to begin setting out his      cornstalks and planting his buckwheat cakes in july instead of      august       concerning the pumpkin  this berry is a favorite with the natives      of the interior of new england who prefer it to the gooseberry for      the making of fruitcake and who likewise give it the preference      over the raspberry for feeding cows as being more filling and fully      as satisfying  the pumpkin is the only esculent of the orange      family that will thrive in the north except the gourd and one or      two varieties of the squash  but the custom of planting it in the      front yard with the shrubbery is fast going out of vogue for it is      now generally conceded that the pumpkin as a shade tree is a      failure       now as the warm weather approaches and the ganders begin to      spawn   the excited listener sprang toward me to shake hands and said  there therethat will do  i know i am all right now because you have read it just as i did word for word  but stranger when i first read it this morning i said to myself i never never believed it before notwithstanding my friends kept me under watch so strict but now i believe i am crazy and with that i fetched a howl that you might have heard two miles and started out to kill somebodybecause you know i knew it would come to that sooner or later and so i might as well begin  i read one of them paragraphs over again so as to be certain and then i burned my house down and started  i have crippled several people and have got one fellow up a tree where i can get him if i want him  but i thought i would call in here as i passed along and make the thing perfectly certain and now it is certain and i tell you it is lucky for the chap that is in the tree  i should have killed him sure as i went back  goodby sir goodby you have taken a great load off my mind  my reason has stood the strain of one of your agricultural articles and i know that nothing can ever unseat it now  goodby sir  i felt a little uncomfortable about the cripplings and arsons this person had been entertaining himself with for i could not help feeling remotely accessory to them  but these thoughts were quickly banished for the regular editor walked in  i thought to myself now if you had gone to egypt as i recommended you to i might have had a chance to get my hand in but you wouldnt do it and here you are  i sort of expected you  the editor was looking sad and perplexed and dejected  he surveyed the wreck which that old rioter and those two young farmers had made and then said this is a sad businessa very sad business there is the mucilagebottle broken and six panes of glass and a spittoon and two candlesticks  but that is not the worst  the reputation of the paper is injuredand permanently i fear  true there never was such a call for the paper before and it never sold such a large edition or soared to such celebritybut does one want to be famous for lunacy and prosper upon the infirmities of his mind  my friend as i am an honest man the street out here is full of people and others are roosting on the fences waiting to get a glimpse of you because they think you are crazy  and well they might after reading your editorials they are a disgrace to journalism  why what put it into your head that you could edit a paper of this nature  you do not seem to know the first rudiments of agriculture  you speak of a furrow and a harrow as being the same thing you talk of the moulting season for cows and you recommend the domestication of the polecat on account of its playfulness and its excellence as a ratter  your remark that clams will lie quiet if music be played to them was superfluousentirely superfluous  nothing disturbs clams  clams always lie quiet  clams care nothing whatever about music  ah heavens and earth friend if you had made the acquiring of ignorance the study of your life you could not have graduated with higher honor than you could today  i never saw anything like it  your observation that the horsechestnut as an article of commerce is steadily gaining in favor is simply calculated to destroy this journal  i want you to throw up your situation and go  i want no more holidayi could not enjoy it if i had it  certainly not with you in my chair  i would always stand in dread of what you might be going to recommend next  it makes me lose all patience every time i think of your discussing oysterbeds under the head of landscape gardening  i want you to go  nothing on earth could persuade me to take another holiday oh why didnt you tell me you didnt know anything about agriculture  tell you you cornstalk you cabbage you son of a cauliflower  its the first time i ever heard such an unfeeling remark  i tell you i have been in the editorial business going on fourteen years and it is the first time i ever heard of a mans having to know anything in order to edit a newspaper  you turnip  who write the dramatic critiques for the secondrate papers  why a parcel of promoted shoemakers and apprentice apothecaries who know just as much about good acting as i do about good farming and no more  who review the books  people who never wrote one who do up the heavy leaders on finance  parties who have had the largest opportunities for knowing nothing about it  who criticize the indian campaigns  gentlemen who do not know a warwhoop from a wigwam and who never have had to run a footrace with a tomahawk or pluck arrows out of the several members of their families to build the evening campfire with  who write the temperance appeals and clamor about the flowing bowl folks who will never draw another sober breath till they do it in the grave  who edit the agricultural papers youyam  men as a general thing who fail in the poetry line yellowcolored novel line sensation drama line cityeditor line and finally fall back on agriculture as a temporary reprieve from the poorhouse  you try to tell me anything about the newspaper business  sir i have been through it from alpha to omaha and i tell you that the less a man knows the bigger the noise he makes and the higher the salary he commands  heaven knows if i had but been ignorant instead of cultivated and impudent instead of diffident i could have made a name for myself in this cold selfish world  i take my leave sir  since i have been treated as you have treated me i am perfectly willing to go  but i have done my duty  i have fulfilled my contract as far as i was permitted to do it  i said i could make your paper of interest to all classesand i have  i said i could run your circulation up to twenty thousand copies and if i had had two more weeks id have done it  and id have given you the best class of readers that ever an agricultural paper hadnot a farmer in it nor a solitary individual who could tell a watermelontree from a peachvine to save his life  you are the loser by this rupture not me pieplant adios  i then left       the petrified man  now to show how really hard it is to foist a moral or a truth upon an unsuspecting public through a burlesque without entirely and absurdly missing ones mark i will here set down two experiences of my own in this thing  in the fall of 1862 in nevada and california the people got to running wild about extraordinary petrifactions and other natural marvels  one could scarcely pick up a paper without finding in it one or two glorified discoveries of this kind  the mania was becoming a little ridiculous  i was a brandnew local editor in virginia city and i felt called upon to destroy this growing evil we all have our benignant fatherly moods at one time or another i suppose  i chose to kill the petrifaction mania with a delicate a very delicate satire  but maybe it was altogether too delicate for nobody ever perceived the satire part of it at all  i put my scheme in the shape of the discovery of a remarkably petrified man  i had had a temporary falling out with mr the new coroner and justice of the peace of humboldt and thought i might as well touch him up a little at the same time and make him ridiculous and thus combine pleasure with business  so i told in patient beliefcompelling detail all about the finding of a petrifiedman at gravelly ford exactly a hundred and twenty miles over a breakneck mountain trail from where  lived how all the savants of the immediate neighborhood had been to examine it it was notorious that there was not a living creature within fifty miles of there except a few starving indians some crippled grasshoppers and four or five buzzards out of meat and too feeble to get away how those savants all pronounced the petrified man to have been in a state of complete petrifaction for over ten generations and then with a seriousness that i ought to have been ashamed to assume i stated that as soon as mrheard the news he summoned a jury mounted his mule and posted off with noble reverence for official duty on that awful five days journey through alkali sage brush peril of body and imminent starvation to hold an inquest on this man that had been dead and turned to everlasting stone for more than three hundred years and then my hand being in so to speak i went on with the same unflinching gravity to state that the jury returned a verdict that deceased came to his death from protracted exposure  this only moved me to higher flights of imagination and i said that the jury with that charity so characteristic of pioneers then dug a grave and were about to give the petrified man christian burial when they found that for ages a limestone sediment had been trickling down the face of the stone against which he was sitting and this stuff had run under him and cemented him fast to the bedrock that the jury they were all silverminers canvassed the difficulty a moment and then got out their powder and fuse and proceeded to drill a hole under him in order to blast him from his position when mr with that delicacy so characteristic of him forbade them observing that it would be little less than sacrilege to do such a thing  from beginning to end the petrified man squib was a string of roaring absurdities albeit they were told with an unfair pretense of truth that even imposed upon me to some extent and i was in some danger of believing in my own fraud  but i really had no desire to deceive anybody and no expectation of doing it  i depended on the way the petrified man was sitting to explain to the public that he was a swindle yet i purposely mixed that up with other things hoping to make it obscureand i did  i would describe the position of one foot and then say his right thumb was against the side of his nose then talk about his other foot and presently come back and say the fingers of his right hand were spread apart then talk about the back of his head a little and return and say the left thumb was hooked into the right little finger then ramble off about something else and by and by drift back again and remark that the fingers of the left hand were spread like those of the right  but i was too ingenious  i mixed it up rather too much and so all that description of the attitude as a key to the humbuggery of the article was entirely lost for nobody but me ever discovered and comprehended the peculiar and suggestive position of the petrified mans hands  as a satire on the petrifaction mania or anything else my petrified man was a disheartening failure for everybody received him in innocent good faith and i was stunned to see the creature i had begotten to pull down the wonderbusiness with and bring derision upon it calmly exalted to the grand chief place in the list of the genuine marvels our nevada had produced  i was so disappointed at the curious miscarriage of my scheme that at first i was angry and did not like to think about it but by and by when the exchanges began to come in with the petrified man copied and guilelessly glorified i began to feel a soothing secret satisfaction and as my gentlemans field of travels broadened and by the exchanges i saw that he steadily and implacably penetrated territory after territory state after state and land after land till he swept the great globe and culminated in sublime and unimpeached legitimacy in the august london lancet my cup was full and i said i was glad i had done it  i think that for about eleven months as nearly as i can remember mrs daily mailbag continued to be swollen by the addition of half a bushel of newspapers hailing from many climes with the petrified man in them marked around with a prominent belt of ink  i sent them to him  i did it for spite not for fun  he used to shovel them into his back yard and curse  and every day during all those months the miners his constituents for miners never quit joking a person when they get started would call on him and ask if he could tell them where they could get hold of a paper with the petrified man in it  he could have accommodated a continent with them i hated  in those days and these things pacified me and pleased me i could not have gotten more real comfort out of him without killing him       my bloody massacre  the other burlesque i have referred to was my fine satire upon the financial expedients of cooking dividends a thing which became shamefully frequent on the pacific coast for a while  once more in my selfcomplacent simplicity i felt that the time had arrived for me to rise up and be a reformer  i put this reformatory satire in the shape of a fearful massacre at empire city  the san francisco papers were making a great outcry about the iniquity of the daney silvermining company whose directors had declared a cooked or false dividend for the purpose of increasing the value of their stock so that they could sell out at a comfortable figure and then scramble from under the tumbling concern  and while abusing the daney those papers did not forget to urge the public to get rid of all their silver stocks and invest in sound and safe san francisco stocks such as the spring valley water company etc  but right at this unfortunate juncture behold the spring valley cooked a dividend too  and so under the insidious mask of an invented bloody massacre i stole upon the public unawares with my scathing satire upon the dividendcooking system  in about half a column of imaginary human carnage i told how a citizen had murdered his wife and nine children and then committed suicide  and i said slyly at the bottom that the sudden madness of which this melancholy massacre was the result had been brought about by his having allowed himself to be persuaded by the california papers to sell his sound and lucrative nevada silver stocks and buy into spring valley just in time to get cooked along with that companys fancy dividend and sink every cent he had in the world  ah it was a deep deep satire and most ingeniously contrived  but i made the horrible details so carefully and conscientiously interesting that the public devoured them greedily and wholly overlooked the following distinctly stated facts to wit the murderer was perfectly well known to every creature in the land as a bachelor and consequently he could not murder his wife and nine children he murdered them in his splendid dressedstone mansion just in the edge of the great pine forest between empire city and dutch nicks when even the very pickled oysters that came on our tables knew that there was not a dressedstone mansion in all nevada territory also that so far from there being a great pine forest between empire city and dutch nicks there wasnt a solitary tree within fifteen miles of either place and finally it was patent and notorious that empire city and dutch nicks were one and the same place and contained only six houses anyhow and consequently there could be no forest between them and on top of all these absurdities i stated that this diabolical murderer after inflicting a wound upon himself that the reader ought to have seen would kill an elephant in the twinkling of an eye jumped on his horse and rode four miles waving his wifes reeking scalp in the air and thus performing entered carson city with tremendous éclat and dropped dead in front of the chief saloon the envy and admiration of all beholders  well in all my life i never saw anything like the sensation that little satire created  it was the talk of the town it was the talk of the territory  most of the citizens dropped gently into it at breakfast and they never finished their meal  there was something about those minutely faithful details that was a sufficing substitute for food  few people that were able to read took food that morning  dan and i dan was my reportorial associate took our seats on either side of our customary table in the eagle restaurant and as i unfolded the shred they used to call a napkin in that establishment i saw at the next table two stalwart innocents with that sort of vegetable dandruff sprinkled about their clothing which was the sign and evidence that they were in from the truckee with a load of hay  the one facing me had the morning paper folded to a long narrow strip and i knew without any telling that that strip represented the column that contained my pleasant financial satire  from the way he was excitedly mumbling i saw that the heedless son of a haymow was skipping with all his might in order to get to the bloody details as quickly as possible and so he was missing the guideboards i had set up to warn him that the whole thing was a fraud presently his eyes spread wide open just as his jaws swung asunder to take in a potato approaching it on a fork the potato halted the face lit up redly and the whole man was on fire with excitement  then he broke into a disjointed checking off of the particularshis potato cooling in midair meantime and his mouth making a reach for it occasionally but always bringing up suddenly against a new and still more direful performance of my hero  at last he looked his stunned and rigid comrade impressively in the face and said with an expression of concentrated awe  jim he biled his baby and he took the old omans skelp  cussd if i want any breakfast  and he laid his lingering potato reverently down and he and his friend departed from the restaurant empty but satisfied  he never got down to where the satire part of it began  nobody ever did they found the thrilling particulars sufficient  to drop in with a poor little moral at the fagend of such a gorgeous massacre was like following the expiring sun with a candle and hope to attract the worlds attention to it  the idea that anybody could ever take my massacre for a genuine occurrence never once suggested itself to me hedged about as it was by all those telltale absurdities and impossibilities concerning the great pine forest the dressedstone mansion etc  but i found out then and never have forgotten since that we never read the dull explanatory surroundings of marvelously exciting things when we have no occasion to suppose that some irresponsible scribbler is trying to defraud us we skip all that and hasten to revel in the bloodcurdling particulars and be happy        the undertakers chat  now that corpse said the undertaker patting the folded hands of deceased approvingly was a brickevery way you took him he was a brick he was so real accommodating and so modestlike and simple in his last moments  friends wanted metallic burialcasenothing else would do i couldnt get it  there warnt going to be timeanybody could see that  corpse said never mind shake him up some kind of a box he could stretch out in comfortable he warnt particular bout the general style of it said he went more on room than style anyway in a last final container  friends wanted a silver doorplate on the coffin signifying who he was and wher he was from  now you know a fellow couldnt roust out such a gaily thing as that in a little countrytown like this  what did corpse say  corpse said whitewash his old canoe and dob his address and general destination onto it with a blackingbrush and a stencilplate long with a verse from some likely hymn or other and pint him for the tomb and mark him c o d and just let him flicker  he warnt distressed any more than you beon the contrary just as cam and collected as a hearsehorse said he judged that wher he was going to a body would find it considerable better to attract attention by a picturesque moral character than a natty burialcase with a swell doorplate on it  splendid man he was  id druther do for a corpse like that n any ive tackled in seven year  theres some satisfaction in buryin a man like that  you feel that what youre doing is appreciated  lord bless you sos he got planted before he spiled he was perfectly satisfied said his relations meant well perfectly well but all them preparations was bound to delay the thing more or less and he didnt wish to be kept layin around  you never see such a clear head as what he hadand so cam and so cool  jist a hunk of brainsthat is what he was perfectly awful  it was a ripping distance from one end of that mans head to tother  often and over again hes had brainfever araging in one place and the rest of the pile didnt know anything about itdidnt affect it any more than an injun insurrection in arizona affects the atlantic states  well the relations they wanted a big funeral but corpse said he was down on flummerydidnt want any processionfill the hearse full of mourners and get out a stern line and tow him behind he was the most down on style of any remains i ever struck  a beautiful simpleminded creatureit was what he was you can depend on that  he was just set on having things the way he wanted them and he took a solid comfort in laying his little plans  he had me measure him and take a whole raft of directions then he had the minister stand up behind a long box with a tablecloth over it to represent the coffin and read his funeral sermon saying angcore angcore at the good places and making him scratch out every bit of brag about him and all the hifalutin and then he made them trot out the choir sos he could help them pick out the tunes for the occasion and he got them to sing pop goes the weasel because hed always liked that tune when he was downhearted and solemn music made him sad and when they sung that with tears in their eyes because they all loved him and his relations grieving around he just laid there as happy as a bug and trying to beat time and showing all over how much he enjoyed it and presently he got worked up and excited and tried to join in for mind you he was pretty proud of his abilities in the singing line but the first time he opened his mouth and was just going to spread himself his breath took a walk  i never see a man snuffed out so sudden  ah it was a great lossa powerful loss to this poor little onehorse town  well well well i haint got time to be palavering along heregot to nail on the lid and mosey along with him and if youll just give me a lift well skeet him into the hearse and meander along  relations bound to have it sodont pay no attention to dying injunctions minute a corpses gone but if i had my way if i didnt respect his last wishes and tow him behind the hearse ill be cussd  i consider that whatever a corpse wants done for his comfort is little enough matter and a man haint got no right to deceive him or take advantage of him and whatever a corpse trusts me to do im agoing to do you know even if its to stuff him and paint him yaller and keep him for a keepsakeyou hear me  he cracked his whip and went lumbering away with his ancient ruin of a hearse and i continued my walk with a valuable lesson learnedthat a healthy and wholesome    is not necessarily impossible to any occupation  the lesson is likely to be lasting for it will take many months to obliterate the memory of the remarks and circumstances that impressed it       concerning chambermaids  against all chambermaids of whatsoever age or nationality i launch the curse of bachelordom  because  they always put the pillows at the opposite end of the bed from the gasburner so that while you read and smoke before sleeping as is the ancient and honored custom of bachelors you have to hold your book aloft in an uncomfortable position to keep the light from dazzling your eyes  when they find the pillows removed to the other end of the bed in the morning they receive not the suggestion in a friendly spirit but glorying in their absolute sovereignty and unpitying your helplessness they make the bed just as it was originally and gloat in secret over the pang their tyranny will cause you  always after that when they find you have transposed the pillows they undo your work and thus defy and seek to embitter the life that god has given you  if they cannot get the light in an inconvenient position any other way they move the bed  if you pull your trunk out six inches from the wall so that the lid will stay up when you open it they always shove that trunk back again  they do it on purpose  if you want the spittoon in a certain spot where it will be handy they dont and so they move it  they always put your other boots into inaccessible places  they chiefly enjoy depositing them as far under the bed as the wall will permit  it is because this compels you to get down in an undignified attitude and make wild sweeps for them in the dark with the bootjack and swear  they always put the matchbox in some other place  they hunt up a new place for it every day and put up a bottle or other perishable glass thing where the box stood before  this is to cause you to break that glass thing groping in the dark and get yourself into trouble  they are for ever and ever moving the furniture  when you come in in the night you can calculate on finding the bureau where the wardrobe was in the morning  and when you go out in the morning if you leave the slopbucket by the door and rockingchair by the window when you come in at midnight or thereabout you will fall over that rockingchair and you will proceed toward the window and sit down in that sloptub  this will disgust you  they like that  no matter where you put anything they are not going to let it stay there  they will take it and move it the first chance they get  it is their nature  and besides it gives them pleasure to be mean and contrary this way  they would die if they couldnt be villains  they always save up all the old scraps of printed rubbish you throw on the floor and stack them up carefully on the table and start the fire with your valuable manuscripts  if there is any one particular old scrap that you are more down on than any other and which you are gradually wearing your life out trying to get rid of you may take all the pains you possibly can in that direction but it wont be of any use because they will always fetch that old scrap back and put it in the same old place again every time  it does them good  and they use up more hairoil than any six men  if charged with purloining the same they lie about it  what do they care about a hereafter  absolutely nothing  if you leave the key in the door for convenience sake they will carry it down to the office and give it to the clerk  they do this under the vile pretense of trying to protect your property from thieves but actually they do it because they want to make you tramp back downstairs after it when you come home tired or put you to the trouble of sending a waiter for it which waiter will expect you to pay him something  in which case i suppose the degraded creatures divide  they keep always trying to make your bed before you get up thus destroying your rest and inflicting agony upon you but after you get up they dont come any more till next day  they do all the mean things they can think of and they do them just out of pure cussedness and nothing else  chambermaids are dead to every human instinct  if i can get a bill through the legislature abolishing chambermaids i mean to do it       aurelias unfortunate young manwritten about 1865  the facts in the following case came to me by letter from a young lady who lives in the beautiful city of san josé she is perfectly unknown to me and simply signs herself aurelia maria which may possibly be a fictitious name  but no matter the poor girl is almost heartbroken by the misfortunes she has undergone and so confused by the conflicting counsels of misguided friends and insidious enemies that she does not know what course to pursue in order to extricate herself from the web of difficulties in which she seems almost hopelessly involved  in this dilemma she turns to me for help and supplicates for my guidance and instruction with a moving eloquence that would touch the heart of a statue  hear her sad story  she says that when she was sixteen years old she met and loved with all the devotion of a passionate nature a young man from new jersey named williamson breckinridge caruthers who was some six years her senior they were engaged with the free consent of their friends and relatives and for a time it seemed as if their career was destined to be characterized by an immunity from sorrow beyond the usual lot of humanity  but at last the tide of fortune turned young caruthers became infected with smallpox of the most virulent type and when he recovered from his illness his face was pitted like a wafflemold and his comeliness gone forever  aurelia thought to break off the engagement at first but pity for her unfortunate lover caused her to postpone the marriageday for a season and give him another trial  the very day before the wedding was to have taken place breckinridge while absorbed in watching the flight of a balloon walked into a well and fractured one of his legs and it had to be taken off above the knee again aurelia was moved to break the engagement but again love triumphed and she set the day forward and gave him another chance to reform  and again misfortune overtook the unhappy youth  he lost one arm by the premature discharge of a fourth of july cannon and within three months he got the other pulled out by a cardingmachine  aurelias heart was almost crushed by these latter calamities  she could not but be deeply grieved to see her lover passing from her by piecemeal feeling as she did that he could not last forever under this disastrous process of reduction yet knowing of no way to stop its dreadful career and in her tearful despair she almost regretted like brokers who hold on and lose that she had not taken him at first before he had suffered such an alarming depreciation  still her brave soul bore her up and she resolved to bear with her friends unnatural disposition yet a little longer  again the weddingday approached and again disappointment overshadowed it caruthers fell ill with the erysipelas and lost the use of one of his eyes entirely  the friends and relatives of the bride considering that she had already put up with more than could reasonably be expected of her now came forward and insisted that the match should be broken off but after wavering awhile aurelia with a generous spirit which did her credit said she had reflected calmly upon the matter and could not discover that breckinridge was to blame  so she extended the time once more and he broke his other leg  it was a sad day for the poor girl when she saw the surgeons reverently bearing away the sack whose uses she had learned by previous experience and her heart told her the bitter truth that some more of her lover was gone  she felt that the field of her affections was growing more and more circumscribed every day but once more she frowned down her relatives and renewed her betrothal  shortly before the time set for the nuptials another disaster occurred there was but one man scalped by the owens river indians last year  that man was williamson breckinridge caruthers of new jersey  he was hurrying home with happiness in his heart when he lost his hair forever and in that hour of bitterness he almost cursed the mistaken mercy that had spared his head  at last aurelia is in serious perplexity as to what she ought to do  she still loves her breckinridge she writes with truly womanly feelingshe still loves what is left of himbut her parents are bitterly opposed to the match because he has no property and is disabled from working and she has not sufficient means to support both comfortably  now what should she do she asked with painful and anxious solicitude  it is a delicate question it is one which involves the lifelong happiness of a woman and that of nearly twothirds of a man and i feel that it would be assuming too great a responsibility to do more than make a mere suggestion in the case  how would it do to build to him  if aurelia can afford the expense let her furnish her mutilated lover with wooden arms and wooden legs and a glass eye and a wig and give him another show give him ninety days without grace and if he does not break his neck in the mean time marry him and take the chances  it does not seem to me that there is much risk anyway aurelia because if he sticks to his singular propensity for damaging himself every time he sees a good opportunity his next experiment is bound to finish him and then you are safe married or single  if married the wooden legs and such other valuables as he may possess revert to the widow and you see you sustain no actual loss save the cherished fragment of a noble but most unfortunate husband who honestly strove to do right but whose extraordinary instincts were against him  try it maria i have thought the matter over carefully and well and it is the only chance i see for you  it would have been a happy conceit on the part of caruthers if he had started with his neck and broken that first but since he has seen fit to choose a different policy and string himself out as long as possible i do not think we ought to upbraid him for it if he has enjoyed it  we must do the best we can under the circumstances and try not to feel exasperated at him       after jenkins  a grand affair of a ballthe pioneerscame off at the occidental some time ago  the following notes of the costumes worn by the belles of the occasion may not be uninteresting to the general reader and jenkins may get an idea therefrom  mrs w m was attired in an elegant pâté de foie gras made expressly for her and was greatly admired  miss s had her hair done up  she was the center of attraction for the gentlemen and the envy of all the ladies mrs g w was tastefully dressed in a tout ensemble and was greeted with deafening applause wherever she went  mrs c n was superbly arrayed in white kid gloves  her modest and engaging manner accorded well with the unpretending simplicity of her costume and caused her to be regarded with absorbing interest by every one  the charming miss m m b appeared in a thrilling waterfall whose exceeding grace and volume compelled the homage of pioneers and emigrants alike  how beautiful she was  the queenly mrs l r  was attractively attired in her new and beautiful false teeth and the bon jour effect they naturally produced was heightened by her enchanting and wellsustained smile  miss r p with that repugnance to ostentation in dress which is so peculiar to her was attired in a simple white lace collar fastened with a neat pearlbutton solitaire  the fine contrast between the sparkling vivacity of her natural optic and the steadfast attentiveness of her placid glass eye was the subject of general and enthusiastic remark  miss c l b  had her fine nose elegantly enameled and the easy grace with which she blew it from time to time marked her as a cultivated and accomplished woman of the world its exquisitely modulated tone excited the admiration of all who had the happiness to hear it       about barbers  all things change except barbers the ways of barbers and the surroundings of barbers  these never change  what one experiences in a barbers shop the first time he enters one is what he always experiences in barbers shops afterward till the end of his days  i got shaved this morning as usual  a man approached the door from jones street as i approached it from maina thing that always happens  i hurried up but it was of no use he entered the door one little step ahead of me and i followed in on his heels and saw him take the only vacant chair the one presided over by the best barber  it always happens so  i sat down hoping that i might fall heir to the chair belonging to the better of the remaining two barbers for he had already begun combing his mans hair while his comrade was not yet quite done rubbing up and oiling his customers locks  i watched the probabilities with strong interest when i saw that no 2 was gaining on no 1 my interest grew to solicitude  when no 1 stopped a moment to make change on a bath ticket for a newcomer and lost ground in the race my solicitude rose to anxiety  when no 1 caught up again and both he and his comrade were pulling the towels away and brushing the powder from their customers cheeks and it was about an even thing which one would say next first my very breath stood still with the suspense  but when at the culminating moment no 1 stopped to pass a comb a couple of times through his customers eyebrows i saw that he had lost the race by a single instant and i rose indignant and quitted the shop to keep from falling into the hands of no 2 for i have none of that enviable firmness that enables a man to look calmly into the eyes of a waiting barber and tell him he will wait for his fellowbarbers chair  i stayed out fifteen minutes and then went back hoping for better luck of course all the chairs were occupied now and four men sat waiting silent unsociable distraught and looking bored as men always do who are waiting their turn in a barbers shop  i sat down in one of the ironarmed compartments of an old sofa and put in the time for a while reading the framed advertisements of all sorts of quack nostrums for dyeing and coloring the hair  then i read the greasy names on the private bayrum bottles read the names and noted the numbers on the private shavingcups in the pigeonholes studied the stained and damaged cheap prints on the walls of battles early presidents and voluptuous recumbent sultanas and the tiresome and everlasting young girl putting her grandfathers spectacles on execrated in my heart the cheerful canary and the distracting parrot that few barbers shops are without finally i searched out the least dilapidated of last years illustrated papers that littered the foul centertable and conned their unjustifiable misrepresentations of old forgotten events  at last my turn came  a voice said next and i surrendered tono  2 of course  it always happens so  i said meekly that i was in a hurry and it affected him as strongly as if he had never heard it  he shoved up my head and put a napkin under it  he plowed his fingers into my collar and fixed a towel there  he explored my hair with his claws and suggested that it needed trimming  i said i did not want it trimmed  he explored again and said it was pretty long for the present stylebetter have a little taken off it needed it behind especially  i said i had had it cut only a week before  he yearned over it reflectively a moment and then asked with a disparaging manner who cut it  i came back at him promptly with a you did i had him there  then he fell to stirring up his lather and regarding himself in the glass stopping now and then to get close and examine his chin critically or inspect a pimple  then he lathered one side of my face thoroughly and was about to lather the other when a dogfight attracted his attention and he ran to the window and stayed and saw it out losing two shillings on the result in bets with the other barbers a thing which gave me great satisfaction  he finished lathering and then began to rub in the suds with his hand  he now began to sharpen his razor on an old suspender and was delayed a good deal on account of a controversy about a cheap masquerade ball he had figured at the night before in red cambric and bogus ermine as some kind of a king  he was so gratified with being chaffed about some damsel whom he had smitten with his charms that he used every means to continue the controversy by pretending to be annoyed at the chaffings of his fellows  this matter begot more surveyings of himself in the glass and he put down his razor and brushed his hair with elaborate care plastering an inverted arch of it down on his forehead accomplishing an accurate part behind and brushing the two wings forward over his ears with nice exactness  in the mean time the lather was drying on my face and apparently eating into my vitals  now he began to shave digging his fingers into my countenance to stretch the skin and bundling and tumbling my head this way and that as convenience in shaving demanded  as long as he was on the tough sides of my face i did not suffer but when he began to rake and rip and tug at my chin the tears came  he now made a handle of my nose to assist him shaving the corners of my upper lip and it was by this bit of circumstantial evidence that i discovered that a part of his duties in the shop was to clean the kerosenelamps  i had often wondered in an indolent way whether the barbers did that or whether it was the boss  about this time i was amusing myself trying to guess where he would be most likely to cut me this time but he got ahead of me and sliced me on the end of the chin before i had got my mind made up  he immediately sharpened his razorhe might have done it before  i do not like a close shave and would not let him go over me a second time  i tried to get him to put up his razor dreading that he would make for the side of my chin my pet tender spot a place which a razor cannot touch twice without making trouble but he said he only wanted to just smooth off one little roughness and in the same moment he slipped his razor along the forbidden ground and the dreaded pimplesigns of a close shave rose up smarting and answered to the call  now he soaked his towel in bay rum and slapped it all over my face nastily slapped it over as if a human being ever yet washed his face in that way  then he dried it by slapping with the dry part of the towel as if a human being ever dried his face in such a fashion but a barber seldom rubs you like a christian  next he poked bay rum into the cut place with his towel then choked the wound with powdered starch then soaked it with bay rum again and would have gone on soaking and powdering it forevermore no doubt if i had not rebelled and begged off  he powdered my whole face now straightened me up and began to plow my hair thoughtfully with his hands  then he suggested a shampoo and said my hair needed it badly very badly i observed that i shampooed it myself very thoroughly in the bath yesterday  i had him again  he next recommended some of smiths hair glorifier and offered to sell me a bottle  i declined  he praised the new perfume joness delight of the toilet and proposed to sell me some of that  i declined again  he tendered me a toothwash atrocity of his own invention and when i declined offered to trade knives with me  he returned to business after the miscarriage of this last enterprise sprinkled me all over legs and all greased my hair in defiance of my protest against it rubbed and scrubbed a good deal of it out by the roots and combed and brushed the rest parting it behind and plastering the eternal inverted arch of hair down on my forehead and then while combing my scant eyebrows and defiling them with pomade strung out an account of the achievements of a sixounce blackandtan terrier of his till i heard the whistles blow for noon and knew i was five minutes too late for the train  then he snatched away the towel brushed it lightly about my face passed his comb through my eyebrows once more and gaily sang out next  this barber fell down and died of apoplexy two hours later  i am waiting over a day for my revengei am going to attend his funeral       party cries in ireland  belfast is a peculiarly religious community  this may be said of the whole of the north of ireland  about onehalf of the people are protestants and the other half catholics  each party does all it can to make its own doctrines popular and draw the affections of the irreligious toward them  one hears constantly of the most touching instances of this zeal  a week ago a vast concourse of catholics assembled at armagh to dedicate a new cathedral and when they started home again the roadways were lined with groups of meek and lowly protestants who stoned them till all the region round about was marked with blood  i thought that only catholics argued in that way but it seems to be a mistake  every man in the community is a missionary and carries a brick to admonish the erring with  the law has tried to break this up but not with perfect success  it has decreed that irritating party cries shall not be indulged in and that persons uttering them shall be fined forty shillings and costs  and so in the police court reports every day one sees these fines recorded  last week a girl of twelve years old was fined the usual forty shillings and costs for proclaiming in the public streets that she was a protestant  the usual cry is to hell with the pope or to hell with the protestants according to the utterers system of salvation  one of belfasts local jokes was very good  it referred to the uniform and inevitable fine of forty shillings and costs for uttering a party cryand it is no economical fine for a poor man either by the way they say that a policeman found a drunken man lying on the ground up a dark alley entertaining himself with shouting to hell with  to hell with  the officer smelt a fineinformers get half  whats that you say   to hell with  to hell with who  to hell with what  ah bedad ye can finish it yourselfits too expinsive for me  i think the seditious disposition restrained by the economical instinct is finely put in that       the facts concerning the recent resignation written about 1867  washington december 1867  i have resigned  the government appears to go on much the same but there is a spoke out of its wheel nevertheless  i was clerk of the senate committee on conchology and i have thrown up the position i could see the plainest disposition on the part of the other members of the government to debar me from having any voice in the counsels of the nation and so i could no longer hold office and retain my selfrespect if i were to detail all the outrages that were heaped upon me during the six days that i was connected with the government in an official capacity the narrative would fill a volume  they appointed me clerk of that committee on conchology and then allowed me no amanuensis to play billiards with  i would have borne that lonesome as it was if i had met with that courtesy from the other members of the cabinet which was my due  but i did not  whenever i observed that the head of a department was pursuing a wrong course i laid down everything and went and tried to set him right as it was my duty to do and i never was thanked for it in a single instance  i went with the best intentions in the world to the secretary of the navy and said  sir i cannot see that admiral farragut is doing anything but skirmishing around there in europe having a sort of picnic  now that may be all very well but it does not exhibit itself to me in that light if there is no fighting for him to do let him come home  there is no use in a man having a whole fleet for a pleasure excursion  it is too expensive  mind i do not object to pleasure excursions for the naval officerspleasure excursions that are in reasonpleasure excursions that are economical  now they might go down the mississippi on a raft  you ought to have heard him storm  one would have supposed i had committed a crime of some kind  but i didnt mind  i said it was cheap and full of republican simplicity and perfectly safe  i said that for a tranquil pleasure excursion there was nothing equal to a raft  then the secretary of the navy asked me who i was and when i told him i was connected with the government he wanted to know in what capacity  i said that without remarking upon the singularity of such a question coming as it did from a member of that same government i would inform him that i was clerk of the senate committee on conchology  then there was a fine storm  he finished by ordering me to leave the premises and give my attention strictly to my own business in future  my first impulse was to get him removed  however that would harm others besides himself and do me no real good and so i let him stay  i went next to the secretary of war who was not inclined to see me at all until he learned that i was connected with the government  if i had not been on important business i suppose i could not have got in i asked him for alight he was smoking at the time and then i told him i had no fault to find with his defending the parole stipulations of general lee and his comrades in arms but that i could not approve of his method of fighting the indians on the plains  i said he fought too scattering  he ought to get the indians more togetherget them together in some convenient place where he could have provisions enough for both parties and then have a general massacre  i said there was nothing so convincing to an indian as a general massacre  if he could not approve of the massacre i said the next surest thing for an indian was soap and education  soap and education are not as sudden as a massacre but they are more deadly in the long run because a halfmassacred indian may recover but if you educate him and wash him it is bound to finish him some time or other  it undermines his constitution it strikes at the foundation of his being  sir i said the time has come when bloodcurdling cruelty has become necessary  inflict soap and a spellingbook on every indian that ravages the plains and let them die  the secretary of war asked me if i was a member of the cabinet and i said i was  he inquired what position i held and i said i was clerk of the senate committee on conchology  i was then ordered under arrest for contempt of court and restrained of my liberty for the best part of the day  i almost resolved to be silent thenceforward and let the government get along the best way it could  but duty called and i obeyed  i called on the secretary of the treasury  he said  what will you have  the question threw me off my guard  i said rum punch  he said if you have got any business here sir state itand in as few words as possible  i then said that i was sorry he had seen fit to change the subject so abruptly because such conduct was very offensive to me but under the circumstances i would overlook the matter and come to the point  i now went into an earnest expostulation with him upon the extravagant length of his report  i said it was expensive unnecessary and awkwardly constructed there were no descriptive passages in it no poetry no sentimentno heroes no plot no picturesnot even woodcuts  nobody would read it that was a clear case  i urged him not to ruin his reputation by getting out a thing like that  if he ever hoped to succeed in literature he must throw more variety into his writings  he must beware of dry detail  i said that the main popularity of the almanac was derived from its poetry and conundrums and that a few conundrums distributed around through his treasury report would help the sale of it more than all the internal revenue he could put into it  i said these things in the kindest spirit and yet the secretary of the treasury fell into a violent passion  he even said i was an ass  he abused me in the most vindictive manner and said that if i came there again meddling with his business he would throw me out of the window  i said i would take my hat and go if i could not be treated with the respect due to my office and i did go  it was just like a new author  they always think they know more than anybody else when they are getting out their first book nobody can tell them anything  during the whole time that i was connected with the government it seemed as if i could not do anything in an official capacity without getting myself into trouble  and yet i did nothing attempted nothing but what i conceived to be for the good of my country  the sting of my wrongs may have driven me to unjust and harmful conclusions but it surely seemed to me that the secretary of state the secretary of war the secretary of the treasury and others of my confreres had conspired from the very beginning to drive me from the administration  i never attended but one cabinet meeting while i was connected with the government  that was sufficient for me  the servant at the white house door did not seem disposed to make way for me until i asked if the other members of the cabinet had arrived  he said they had and i entered  they were all there but nobody offered me a seat  they stared at me as if i had been an intruder  the president said  well sir who are you  i handed him my card and he read the hon  mark twain clerk of the senate committee on conchology  then he looked at me from head to foot as if he had never heard of me before  the secretary of the treasury said  this is the meddlesome ass that came to recommend me to put poetry and conundrums in my report as if it were an almanac  the secretary of war said it is the same visionary that came to me yesterday with a scheme to educate a portion of the indians to death and massacre the balance  the secretary of the navy said i recognize this youth as the person who has been interfering with my business time and again during the week  he is distressed about admiral farraguts using a whole fleet for a pleasure excursion as he terms it  his proposition about some insane pleasure excursion on a raft is too absurd to repeat  i said gentlemen i perceive here a disposition to throw discredit upon every act of my official career i perceive also a disposition to debar me from all voice in the counsels of the nation  no notice whatever was sent to me today  it was only by the merest chance that i learned that there was going to be a cabinet meeting  but let these things pass  all i wish to know is is this a cabinet meeting or is it not  the president said it was  then i said let us proceed to business at once and not fritter away valuable time in unbecoming faultfindings with each others official conduct  the secretary of state now spoke up in his benignant way and said young man you are laboring under a mistake  the clerks of the congressional committees are not members of the cabinet  neither are the doorkeepers of the capitol strange as it may seem  therefore much as we could desire your more than human wisdom in our deliberations we cannot lawfully avail ourselves of it  the counsels of the nation must proceed without you if disaster follows as follow full well it may be it balm to your sorrowing spirit that by deed and voice you did what in you lay to avert it  you have my blessing  farewell  these gentle words soothed my troubled breast and i went away  but the servants of a nation can know no peace  i had hardly reached my den in the capitol and disposed my feet on the table like a representative when one of the senators on the conchological committee came in in a passion and said  where have you been all day  i observed that if that was anybodys affair but my own i had been to a cabinet meeting  to a cabinet meeting  i would like to know what business you had at a cabinet meeting  i said i went there to consultallowing for the sake of argument that he was in any wise concerned in the matter  he grew insolent then and ended by saying he had wanted me for three days past to copy a report on bombshells eggshells clamshells and i dont know what all connected with conchology and nobody had been able to find me  this was too much  this was the feather that broke the clerical camels back  i said sir do you suppose that i am going to work for six dollars a day  if that is the idea let me recommend the senate committee on conchology to hire somebody else  i am the slave of no faction  take back your degrading commission  give me liberty or give me death   from that hour i was no longer connected with the government  snubbed by the department snubbed by the cabinet snubbed at last by the chairman of a committee i was endeavoring to adorn i yielded to persecution cast far from me the perils and seductions of my great office and forsook my bleeding country in the hour of her peril  but i had done the state some service and i sent in my bill       the united states of america in account with      the hon clerk of the senate committee on conchology   dr           to consultation with secretary of war  50           to consultation with secretary of navy  50           to consultation with secretary of the treasury  50           cabinet consultation no charge           to mileage to and from jerusalem via egypt                algiers gibraltar and cadiz                14000 miles at 20c a mile  2800           to salary as clerk of senate committee           on conchology six days at 6 per day  36                           total  2986  territorial delegates charge mileage both ways although they never go back when they get here once  why my mileage is denied me is more than i can understand  not an item of this bill has been paid except that trifle of thirtysix dollars for clerkship salary  the secretary of the treasury pursuing me to the last drew his pen through all the other items and simply marked in the margin not allowed  so the dread alternative is embraced at last  repudiation has begun  the nation is lost  i am done with official life for the present  let those clerks who are willing to be imposed on remain  i know numbers of them in the departments who are never informed when there is to be a cabinet meeting whose advice is never asked about war or finance or commerce by the heads of the nation any more than if they were not connected with the government and who actually stay in their offices day after day and work  they know their importance to the nation and they unconsciously show it in their bearing and the way they order their sustenance at the restaurantbut they work  i know one who has to paste all sorts of little scraps from the newspapers into a scrapbooksometimes as many as eight or ten scraps a day  he doesnt do it well but he does it as well as he can  it is very fatiguing  it is exhausting to the intellect yet he only gets eighteen hundred dollars a year  with a brain like his that young man could amass thousands and thousands of dollars in some other pursuit if he chose to do it  but nohis heart is with his country and he will serve her as long as she has got a scrapbook left and i know clerks that dont know how to write very well but such knowledge as they possess they nobly lay at the feet of their country and toil on and suffer for twentyfive hundred dollars a year  what they write has to be written over again by other clerks sometimes but when a man has done his best for his country should his country complain  then there are clerks that have no clerkships and are waiting and waiting and waiting for a vacancywaiting patiently for a chance to help their country outand while they are waiting they only get barely two thousand dollars a year for it  it is sadit is very very sad  when a member of congress has a friend who is gifted but has no employment wherein his great powers may be brought to bear he confers him upon his country and gives him a clerkship in a department  and there that man has to slave his life out fighting documents for the benefit of a nation that never thinks of him never sympathizes with himand all for two thousand or three thousand dollars a year  when i shall have completed my list of all the clerks in the several departments with my statement of what they have to do and what they get for it you will see that there are not half enough clerks and that what there are do not get half enough pay       history repeats itself  the following i find in a sandwich island paper which some friend has sent me from that tranquil faroff retreat  the coincidence between my own experience and that here set down by the late mr benton is so remarkable that i cannot forbear publishing and commenting upon the paragraph  the sandwich island paper says  how touching is this tribute of the late hon t h benton to his mothers influencemy mother asked me never to use tobacco i have never touched it from that time to the present day  she asked me not to gamble and i have never gambled  i cannot tell who is losing in games that are being played  she admonished me too against liquordrinking and whatever capacity for endurance i have at present and whatever usefulness i may have attained through life i attribute to having complied with her pious and correct wishes  when i was seven years of age she asked me not to drink and then i made a resolution of total abstinence and that i have adhered to it through all time i owe to my mother  i never saw anything so curious  it is almost an exact epitome of my own moral careerafter simply substituting a grandmother for a mother  how well i remember my grandmothers asking me not to use tobacco good old soul  she said youre at it again are you you whelp  now dont ever let me catch you chewing tobacco before breakfast again or i lay ill blacksnake you within an inch of your life  i have never touched it at that hour of the morning from that time to the present day  she asked me not to gamble  she whispered and said put up those wicked cards this minutetwo pair and a jack you numskull and the other fellows got a flush  i never have gambled from that day to thisnever oncewithout a cold deck in my pocket  i cannot even tell who is going to lose in games that are being played unless i deal myself  when i was two years of age she asked me not to drink and then i made a resolution of total abstinence  that i have adhered to it and enjoyed the beneficent effects of it through all time i owe to my grandmother i have never drunk a drop from that day to this of any kind of water       honored as a curiosity  if you get into conversation with a stranger in honolulu and experience that natural desire to know what sort of ground you are treading on by finding out what manner of man your stranger is strike out boldly and address him as captain  watch him narrowly and if you see by his countenance that you are on the wrong track ask him where he preaches it is a safe bet that he is either a missionary or captain of a whaler i became personally acquainted with seventytwo captains and ninetysix missionaries  the captains and ministers form onehalf of the population the third fourth is composed of common kanakas and mercantile foreigners and their families and the final fourth is made up of high officers of the hawaiian government  and there are just about cats enough for three apiece all around  a solemn stranger met me in the suburbs one day and said  good morning your reverence  preach in the stone church yonder no doubt no i dont  im not a preacher  really i beg your pardon captain  i trust you had a good season  how much oil  oil  why what do you take me for  im not a whaler  oh  i beg a thousand pardons your excellency  majorgeneral in the household troops no doubt  minister of the interior likely  secretary of war  first gentleman of the bedchamber  commissioner of the royal  stuff man  im not connected in any way with the government  bless my life  then who the mischief are you what the mischief are you and how the mischief did you get here and where in thunder did you come from  im only a private personagean unassuming strangerlately arrived from america  no  not a missionary not a whaler not a member of his majestys government not even a secretary of the navy  ah  heaven it is too blissful to be true alas i do but dream  and yet that noble honest countenancethose oblique ingenuous eyesthat massive head incapable ofof anything your hand give me your hand bright waif  excuse these tears  for sixteen weary years i have yearned for a moment like this and  here his feelings were too much for him and he swooned away  i pitied this poor creature from the bottom of my heart  i was deeply moved i shed a few tears on him and kissed him for his mother  i then took what small change he had and shoved       first interview with artemus wardwritten about 1870  i had never seen him before  he brought letters of introduction from mutual friends in san francisco and by invitation i breakfasted with him  it was almost religion there in the silvermines to precede such a meal with whisky cocktails  artemus with the true cosmopolitan instinct always deferred to the customs of the country he was in and so he ordered three of those abominations  hingston was present  i said i would rather not drink a whisky cocktail  i said it would go right to my head and confuse me so that i would be in a helpless tangle in ten minutes  i did not want to act like a lunatic before strangers  but artemus gently insisted and i drank the treasonable mixture under protest and felt all the time that i was doing a thing i might be sorry for  in a minute or two i began to imagine that my ideas were clouded i waited in great anxiety for the conversation to open with a sort of vague hope that my understanding would prove clear after all and my misgivings groundless  artemus dropped an unimportant remark or two and then assumed a look of superhuman earnestness and made the following astounding speech  he said  now there is one thing i ought to ask you about before i forget it  you have been here in silver landhere in nevadatwo or three years and of course your position on the daily press has made it necessary for you to go down in the mines and examine them carefully in detail and therefore you know all about the silvermining business  now what i want to get at isis well the way the deposits of ore are made you know for instance  now as i understand it the vein which contains the silver is sandwiched in between casings of granite and runs along the ground and sticks up like a curb stone  well take a vein forty feet thick for example or eighty for that matter or even a hundredsay you go down on it with a shaft straight down you know or with what you call incline maybe you go down five hundred feet or maybe you dont go down but two hundredanyway you go down and all the time this vein grows narrower when the casings come nearer or approach each other you may saythat is when they do approach which of course they do not always do particularly in cases where the nature of the formation is such that they stand apart wider than they otherwise would and which geology has failed to account for although everything in that science goes to prove that all things being equal it would if it did not or would not certainly if it did and then of course they are  do not you  think it is  i said to myself  now i just knew how it would bethat whisky cocktail has done the business for me i dont understand any more than a clam  and then i said aloud  iithat isif you dont mind would youwould you say that over again  i ought  oh certainly certainly  you see i am very unfamiliar with the subject and perhaps i dont present my case clearly but i  no nono noyou state it plain enough but that cocktail has muddled me a little  but i willno i do understand for that matter but i would get the hang of it all the better if you went over it againand ill pay better attention this time  he said why what i was after was this  here he became even more fearfully impressive than ever and emphasized each particular point by checking it off on his fingerends  this vein or lode or ledge or whatever you call it runs along between two layers of granite just the same as if it were a sandwich very well  now suppose you go down on that say a thousand feet or maybe twelve hundred it dont really matter before you drift and then you start your drifts some of them across the ledge and others along the length of it where the sulphuretsi believe they call them sulphurets though why they should considering that so far as i can see the main dependence of a miner does not so lie as some suppose but in which it cannot be successfully maintained wherein the same should not continue while part and parcel of the same ore not committed to either in the sense referred to whereas under different circumstances the most inexperienced among us could not detect it if it were or might overlook it if it did or scorn the very idea of such a thing even though it were palpably demonstrated as such  am i not right  i said sorrowfully i feel ashamed of myself mr  ward  i know i ought to understand you perfectly well but you see that treacherous whisky cocktail has got into my head and now i cannot understand even the simplest proposition  i told you how it would be  oh dont mind it dont mind it the fault was my own no doubtthough i did think it clear enough for  dont say a word  clear  why you stated it as clear as the sun to anybody but an abject idiot but its that confounded cocktail that has played the mischief  no now dont say that  ill begin it all over again and  dont nowfor goodness sake dont do anything of the kind because i tell you my head is in such a condition that i dont believe i could understand the most trifling question a man could ask me  now dont you be afraid  ill put it so plain this time that you cant help but get the hang of it  we will begin at the very beginning leaning far across the table with determined impressiveness wrought upon his every feature and fingers prepared to keep tally of each point enumerated and i leaning forward with painful interest resolved to comprehend or perish  you know the vein the ledge the thing that contains the metal whereby it constitutes the medium between all other forces whether of present or remote agencies so brought to bear in favor of the former against the latter or the latter against the former or all or both or compromising the relative differences existing within the radius whence culminate the several degrees of similarity to which  i said oh hang my wooden head it aint any useit aint any use to tryi cant understand anything  the plainer you get it the more i cant get the hang of it  i heard a suspicious noise behind me and turned in time to see hingston dodging behind a newspaper and quaking with a gentle ecstasy of laughter  i looked at ward again and he had thrown off his dread solemnity and was laughing also  then i saw that i had been soldthat i had been made a victim of a swindle in the way of a string of plausibly worded sentences that didnt mean anything under the sun  artemus ward was one of the best fellows in the world and one of the most companionable  it has been said that he was not fluent in conversation but with the above experience in my mind i differ       cannibalism in the carswritten about 1867  i visited st louis lately and on my way west after changing cars at terre haute indiana a mild benevolentlooking gentleman of about fortyfive or maybe fifty came in at one of the waystations and sat down beside me  we talked together pleasantly on various subjects for an hour perhaps and i found him exceedingly intelligent and entertaining when he learned that i was from washington he immediately began to ask questions about various public men and about congressional affairs and i saw very shortly that i was conversing with a man who was perfectly familiar with the ins and outs of political life at the capital even to the ways and manners and customs of procedure of senators and representatives in the chambers of the national legislature  presently two men halted near us for a single moment and one said to the other  harris if youll do that for me ill never forget you my boy  my new comrades eye lighted pleasantly  the words had touched upon a happy memory i thought  then his face settled into thoughtfulness almost into gloom  he turned to me and said  let me tell you a story let me give you a secret chapter of my life a chapter that has never been referred to by me since its events transpired  listen patiently and promise that you will not interrupt me  i said i would not and he related the following strange adventure speaking sometimes with animation sometimes with melancholy but always with feeling and earnestness                            the strangers narrative  on the 19th of december 1853 i started from st louis on the evening train bound for chicago  there were only twentyfour passengers all told  there were no ladies and no children  we were in excellent spirits and pleasant acquaintanceships were soon formed  the journey bade fair to be a happy one and no individual in the party i think had even the vaguest presentiment of the horrors we were soon to undergo  at 11 pm it began to snow hard  shortly after leaving the small village of welden we entered upon that tremendous prairie solitude that stretches its leagues on leagues of houseless dreariness far away toward the jubilee settlements  the winds unobstructed by trees or hills or even vagrant rocks whistled fiercely across the level desert driving the falling snow before it like spray from the crested waves of a stormy sea  the snow was deepening fast and we knew by the diminished speed of the train that the engine was plowing through it with steadily increasing difficulty  indeed it almost came to a dead halt sometimes in the midst of great drifts that piled themselves like colossal graves across the track  conversation began to flag  cheerfulness gave place to grave concern  the possibility of being imprisoned in the snow on the bleak prairie fifty miles from any house presented itself to every mind and extended its depressing influence over every spirit  at two oclock in the morning i was aroused out of an uneasy slumber by the ceasing of all motion about me  the appalling truth flashed upon me instantlywe were captives in a snowdrift  all hands to the rescue every man sprang to obey  out into the wild night the pitchy darkness the billowy snow the driving storm every soul leaped with the consciousness that a moment lost now might bring destruction to us all shovels hands boardsanything everything that could displace snow was brought into instant requisition  it was a weird picture that small company of frantic men fighting the banking snows half in the blackest shadow and half in the angry light of the locomotives reflector  one short hour sufficed to prove the utter uselessness of our efforts the storm barricaded the track with a dozen drifts while we dug one away and worse than this it was discovered that the last grand charge the engine had made upon the enemy had broken the foreandaft shaft of the drivingwheel  with a free track before us we should still have been helpless  we entered the car wearied with labor and very sorrowful we gathered about the stoves and gravely canvassed our situation  we had no provisions whateverin this lay our chief distress  we could not freeze for there was a good supply of wood in the tender  this was our only comfort  the discussion ended at last in accepting the disheartening decision of the conductor viz that it would be death for any man to attempt to travel fifty miles on foot through snow like that we could not send for help and even if we could it would not come  we must submit and await as patiently as we might succor or starvation i think the stoutest heart there felt a momentary chill when those words were uttered  within the hour conversation subsided to a low murmur here and there about the car caught fitfully between the rising and falling of the blast the lamps grew dim and the majority of the castaways settled themselves among the flickering shadows to thinkto forget the present if they couldto sleep if they might  the eternal nightit surely seemed eternal to uswore its lagging hours away at last and the cold gray dawn broke in the east  as the light grew stronger the passengers began to stir and give signs of life one after another and each in turn pushed his slouched hat up from his forehead stretched his stiffened limbs and glanced out of the windows upon the cheerless prospect  it was cheerless indeednot a living thing visible anywhere not a human habitation nothing but a vast white desert uplifted sheets of snow drifting hither and thither before the winda world of eddying flakes shutting out the firmament above  all day we moped about the cars saying little thinking much  another lingering dreary nightand hunger  another dawninganother day of silence sadness wasting hunger hopeless watching for succor that could not come  a night of restless slumber filled with dreams of feastingwakings distressed with the gnawings of hunger   the fourth day came and wentand the fifth  five days of dreadful imprisonment  a savage hunger looked out at every eye  there was in it a sign of awful importthe foreshadowing of a something that was vaguely shaping itself in every hearta something which no tongue dared yet to frame into words  the sixth day passedthe seventh dawned upon as gaunt and haggard and hopeless a company of men as ever stood in the shadow of death  it must out now  that thing which had been growing up in every heart was ready to leap from every lip at last  nature had been taxed to the utmostshe must yield  richard h gaston of minnesota tall cadaverous and pale rose up  all knew what was coming  all preparedevery emotion every semblance of excitementwas smotheredonly a calm thoughtful seriousness appeared in the eyes that were lately so wild  gentlemen it cannot be delayed longer  the time is at hand  we must determine which of us shall die to furnish food for the rest   mr john j williams of illinois rose and said gentlemeni nominate the rev james sawyer of tennessee  mr wm r adams of indiana said i nominate mr daniel slote of new york  mr charles j langdon i nominate mr samuel a  bowen of st louis  mr slote gentlemeni desire to decline in favor of mr john a van nostrand jun of new jersey  mr gaston if there be no objection the gentlemans desire will be acceded to  mr van nostrand objecting the resignation of mr slote was rejected the resignations of messrs sawyer and bowen were also offered and refused upon the same grounds  mr a l bascom of ohio i move that the nominations now close and that the house proceed to an election by ballot   mr sawyer gentlemeni protest earnestly against these proceedings they are in every way irregular and unbecoming  i must beg to move that they be dropped at once and that we elect a chairman of the meeting and proper officers to assist him and then we can go on with the business before us understandingly  mr bell of iowa gentlemeni object  this is no time to stand upon forms and ceremonious observances  for more than seven days we have been without food  every moment we lose in idle discussion increases our distress  i am satisfied with the nominations that have been madeevery gentleman present is i believeand i for one do not see why we should not proceed at once to elect one or more of them  i wish to offer a resolution  mr gaston it would be objected to and have to lie over one day under the rules thus bringing about the very delay you wish to avoid  the gentleman from new jersey  mr van nostrand gentlemeni am a stranger among you i have not sought the distinction that has been conferred upon me and i feel a delicacy  mr morgan of alabama interrupting i move the previous question  the motion was carried and further debate shut off of course  the motion to elect officers was passed and under it mr gaston was chosen chairman mr blake secretary messrs  holcomb dyer and baldwin a committee on nominations and mr r m howland purveyor to assist the committee in making selections  a recess of half an hour was then taken and some little caucusing followed  at the sound of the gavel the meeting reassembled and the committee reported in favor of messrs george ferguson of kentucky lucien herrman of louisiana and w messick of colorado as candidates the report was accepted  mr rogers of missouri mr presidentthe report being properly before the house now i move to amend it by substituting for the name of mr herrman that of mr lucius harris of st louis who is well and honorably known to us all  i do not wish to be understood as casting the least reflection upon the high character and standing of the gentleman from louisianafar from it  i respect and esteem him as much as any gentleman here present possibly can but none of us can be blind to the fact that he has lost more flesh during the week that we have lain here than any among usnone of us can be blind to the fact that the committee has been derelict in its duty either through negligence or a graver fault in thus offering for our suffrages a gentleman who however pure his own motives may be has really less nutriment in him  the chair the gentleman from missouri will take his seat  the chair cannot allow the integrity of the committee to be questioned save by the regular course under the rules  what action will the house take upon the gentlemans motion  mr halliday of virginia i move to further amend the report by substituting mr harvey davis of oregon for mr messick  it may be urged by gentlemen that the hardships and privations of a frontier life have rendered mr davis tough but gentlemen is this a time to cavil at toughness  is this a time to be fastidious concerning trifles  is this a time to dispute about matters of paltry significance  no gentlemen bulk is what we desiresubstance weight bulkthese are the supreme requisites nownot talent not genius not education  i insist upon my motion  mr morgan excitedly mr  chairmani do most strenuously object to this amendment  the gentleman from oregon is old and furthermore is bulky only in bonenot in flesh  i ask the gentleman from virginia if it is soup we want instead of solid sustenance if he would delude us with shadows if he would mock our suffering with an oregonian specter i ask him if he can look upon the anxious faces around him if he can gaze into our sad eyes if he can listen to the beating of our expectant hearts and still thrust this faminestricken fraud upon us  i ask him if he can think of our desolate state of our past sorrows of our dark future and still unpityingly foist upon us this wreck this ruin this tottering swindle this gnarled and blighted and sapless vagabond from oregons inhospitable shores  never applause  the amendment was put to vote after a fiery debate and lost  mr harris was substituted on the first amendment  the balloting then began five ballots were held without a choice  on the sixth mr harris was elected all voting for him but himself  it was then moved that his election should be ratified by acclamation which was lost in consequence of his again voting against himself  mr radway moved that the house now take up the remaining candidates and go into an election for breakfast  this was carried  on the first ballot there was a tie half the members favoring one candidate on account of his youth and half favoring the other on account of his superior size  the president gave the casting vote for the latter mr messick  this decision created considerable dissatisfaction among the friends of mr ferguson the defeated candidate and there was some talk of demanding a new ballot but in the midst of it a motion to adjourn was carried and the meeting broke up at once  the preparations for supper diverted the attention of the ferguson faction from the discussion of their grievance for a long time and then when they would have taken it up again the happy announcement that mr harris was ready drove all thought of it to the winds  we improvised tables by propping up the backs of carseats and sat down with hearts full of gratitude to the finest supper that had blessed our vision for seven torturing days  how changed we were from what we had been a few short hours before  hopeless sadeyed misery hunger feverish anxiety desperation then thankfulness serenity joy too deep for utterance now  that i know was the cheeriest hour of my eventful life  the winds howled and blew the snow wildly about our prison house but they were powerless to distress us any more  i liked harris  he might have been better done perhaps but i am free to say that no man ever agreed with me better than harris or afforded me so large a degree of satisfaction  messick was very well though rather highflavored but for genuine nutritiousness and delicacy of fiber give me harris messick had his good pointsi will not attempt to deny it nor do i wish to do itbut he was no more fitted for breakfast than a mummy would be sirnot a bit  leanwhy bless meand tough  ah he was very tough  you could not imagine ityou could never imagine anything like it  do you mean to tell me that do not interrupt me please  after breakfast we elected a man by the name of walker from detroit for supper  he was very good  i wrote his wife so afterward  he was worthy of all praise  i shall always remember walker  he was a little rare but very good  and then the next morning we had morgan of alabama for breakfast he was one of the finest men i ever sat down tohandsome educated refined spoke several languages fluentlya perfect gentlemanhe was a perfect gentleman and singularly juicy for supper we had that oregon patriarch and he was a fraud there is no question about itold scraggy tough nobody can picture the reality  i finally said gentlemen you can do as you like but i will wait for another election  and grimes of illinois said gentlemen i will wait also  when you elect a man that has something to recommend him i shall be glad to join you again  it soon became evident that there was general dissatisfaction with davis of oregon and so to preserve the good will that had prevailed so pleasantly since we had had harris an election was called and the result of it was that baker of georgia was chosen  he was splendid  well wellafter that we had doolittle and hawkins and mcelroy there was some complaint about mcelroy because he was uncommonly short and thin and penrod and two smiths and bailey bailey had a wooden leg which was clear loss but he was otherwise good and an indian boy and an organgrinder and a gentleman by the name of buckminstera poor stick of a vagabond that wasnt any good for company and no account for breakfast  we were glad we got him elected before relief came  and so the blessed relief did come at last  yes it came one bright sunny morning just after election  john murphy was the choice and there never was a better i am willing to testify but john murphy came home with us in the train that came to succor us and lived to marry the widow harris  relict of  relict of our first choice  he married her and is happy and respected and prosperous yet  ah it was like a novel sirit was like a romance this is my stoppingplace sir i must bid you goodby  any time that you can make it convenient to tarry a day or two with me i shall be glad to have you  i like you sir i have conceived an affection for you i could like you as well as i liked harris himself sir  good day sir and a pleasant journey  he was gone  i never felt so stunned so distressed so bewildered in my life  but in my soul i was glad he was gone  with all his gentleness of manner and his soft voice i shuddered whenever he turned his hungry eye upon me and when i heard that i had achieved his perilous affection and that i stood almost with the late harris in his esteem my heart fairly stood still  i was bewildered beyond description  i did not doubt his word i could not question a single item in a statement so stamped with the earnestness of truth as his but its dreadful details overpowered me and threw my thoughts into hopeless confusion  i saw the conductor looking at me i said who is that man  he was a member of congress once and a good one  but he got caught in a snowdrift in the cars and like to have been starved to death  he got so frostbitten and frozen up generally and used up for want of something to eat that he was sick and out of his head two or three months afterward  he is all right now only he is a monomaniac and when he gets on that old subject he never stops till he has eat up that whole carload of people he talks about  he would have finished the crowd by this time only he had to get out here  he has got their names as pat as a b c  when he gets them all eat up but himself he always says then the hour for the usual election for breakfast having arrived and there being no opposition i was duly elected after which there being no objections offered i resigned  thus i am here  i felt inexpressibly relieved to know that i had only been listening to the harmless vagaries of a madman instead of the genuine experiences of a bloodthirsty cannibal       the killing of julius caesar localizedwritten about 1865  being the only true and reliable account ever published taken from the roman daily evening fasces of the date of that tremendous occurrence  nothing in the world affords a newspaper reporter so much satisfaction as gathering up the details of a bloody and mysterious murder and writing them up with aggravating circumstantiality  he takes a living delight in this labor of lovefor such it is to him especially if he knows that all the other papers have gone to press and his will be the only one that will contain the dreadful intelligence  a feeling of regret has often come over me that i was not reporting in rome when caesar was killedreporting on an evening paper and the only one in the city and getting at least twelve hours ahead of the morningpaper boys with this most magnificent item that ever fell to the lot of the craft  other events have happened as startling as this but none that possessed so peculiarly all the characteristics of the favorite item of the present day magnified into grandeur and sublimity by the high rank fame and social and political standing of the actors in it  however as i was not permitted to report caesars assassination in the regular way it has at least afforded me rare satisfaction to translate the following able account of it from the original latin of the roman daily evening fasces of that datesecond edition   our usually quiet city of rome was thrown into a state of wild excitement yesterday by the occurrence of one of those bloody affrays which sicken the heart and fill the soul with fear while they inspire all thinking men with forebodings for the future of a city where human life is held so cheaply and the gravest laws are so openly set at defiance  as the result of that affray it is our painful duty as public journalists to record the death of one of our most esteemed citizensa man whose name is known wherever this paper circulates and whose fame it has been our pleasure and our privilege to extend and also to protect from the tongue of slander and falsehood to the best of our poor ability  we refer to mr j caesar the emperorelect  the facts of the case as nearly as our reporter could determine them from the conflicting statements of eyewitnesses were about as followsthe affair was an election row of course  ninetenths of the ghastly butcheries that disgrace the city nowadays grow out of the bickerings and jealousies and animosities engendered by these accursed elections  rome would be the gainer by it if her very constables were elected to serve a century for in our experience we have never even been able to choose a dogpelter without celebrating the event with a dozen knockdowns and a general cramming of the stationhouse with drunken vagabonds overnight it is said that when the immense majority for caesar at the polls in the market was declared the other day and the crown was offered to that gentleman even his amazing unselfishness in refusing it three times was not sufficient to save him from the whispered insults of such men as casca of the tenth ward and other hirelings of the disappointed candidate hailing mostly from the eleventh and thirteenth and other outside districts who were overheard speaking ironically and contemptuously of mr caesars conduct upon that occasion  we are further informed that there are many among us who think they are justified in believing that the assassination of julius caesar was a putup thinga cutanddried arrangement hatched by marcus brutus and a lot of his hired roughs and carried out only too faithfully according to the program  whether there be good grounds for this suspicion or not we leave to the people to judge for themselves only asking that they will read the following account of the sad occurrence carefully and dispassionately before they render that judgment  the senate was already in session and caesar was coming down the street toward the capitol conversing with some personal friends and followed as usual by a large number of citizens  just as he was passing in front of demosthenes and thucydides drug store he was observing casually to a gentleman who our informant thinks is a fortuneteller that the ides of march were come  the reply was yes they are come but not gone yet  at this moment artemidorus stepped up and passed the time of day and asked caesar to read a schedule or a tract or something of the kind which he had brought for his perusal  mr decius brutus also said something about an humble suit which he wanted read  artexnidorus begged that attention might be paid to his first because it was of personal consequence to caesar  the latter replied that what concerned himself should be read last or words to that effect  artemidorus begged and beseeched him to read the paper instantlymark that it is hinted by william shakespeare who saw the beginning and the end of the unfortunate affray that this schedule was simply a note discovering to caesar that a plot was brewing to take his lifehowever caesar shook him off and refused to read any petition in the street  he then entered the capitol and the crowd followed him  about this time the following conversation was overheard and we consider that taken in connection with the events which succeeded it it bears an appalling significance  mr papilius lena remarked to george w cassias commonly known as the nobby boy of the third ward a bruiser in the pay of the opposition that he hoped his enterprise today might thrive and when cassias asked what enterprise he only closed his left eye temporarily and said with simulated indifference fare you well and sauntered toward caesar  marcus brutus who is suspected of being the ringleader of the band that killed caesar asked what it was that lena had said  cassias told him and added in a low tone i fear our purpose is discovered  brutus told his wretched accomplice to keep an eye on lena and a moment after cassias urged that lean and hungry vagrant casca whose reputation here is none of the best to be sudden for he feared prevention  he then turned to brutus apparently much excited and asked what should be done and swore that either he or caesar would never turn backhe would kill himself first  at this time caesar was talking to some of the backcountry members about the approaching fall elections and paying little attention to what was going on around him  billy trebonius got into conversation with the peoples friend and caesarsmark antonyand under some pretense or other got him away and brutus decius casca cinna metellus cimber and others of the gang of infamous desperadoes that infest rome at present closed around the doomed caesar  then metellus cimber knelt down and begged that his brother might be recalled from banishment but caesar rebuked him for his fawning conduct and refused to grant his petition  immediately at cimbers request first brutus and then cassias begged for the return of the banished publius but caesar still refused  he said he could not be moved that he was as fixed as the north star and proceeded to speak in the most complimentary terms of the firmness of that star and its steady character  then he said he was like it and he believed he was the only man in the country that was therefore since he was constant that cimber should be banished he was also constant that he should stay banished and hed be hanged if he didnt keep him so  instantly seizing upon this shallow pretext for a fight casca sprang at caesar and struck him with a dirk caesar grabbing him by the arm with his right hand and launching a blow straight from the shoulder with his left that sent the reptile bleeding to the earth  he then backed up against pompeys statue and squared himself to receive his assailants cassias and cimber and cinna rushed upon him with their daggers drawn and the former succeeded in inflicting a wound upon his body but before he could strike again and before either of the others could strike at all caesar stretched the three miscreants at his feet with as many blows of his powerful fist  by this time the senate was in an indescribable uproar the throng of citizens in the lobbies had blockaded the doors in their frantic efforts to escape from the building the sergeantatarms and his assistants were struggling with the assassins venerable senators had cast aside their encumbering robes and were leaping over benches and flying down the aisles in wild confusion toward the shelter of the committeerooms and a thousand voices were shouting police  police in discordant tones that rose above the frightful din like shrieking winds above the roaring of a tempest  and amid it all great caesar stood with his back against the statue like a lion at bay and fought his assailants weaponless and hand to hand with the defiant bearing and the unwavering courage which he had shown before on many a bloody field billy trebonius and caius legarius struck him with their daggers and fell as their brotherconspirators before them had fallen  but at last when caesar saw his old friend brutus step forward armed with a murderous knife it is said he seemed utterly overpowered with grief and amazement and dropping his invincible left arm by his side he hid his face in the folds of his mantle and received the treacherous blow without an effort to stay the hand that gave it  he only said et tu brute and fell lifeless on the marble pavement  we learn that the coat deceased had on when he was killed was the same one he wore in his tent on the afternoon of the day he overcame the nervii and that when it was removed from the corpse it was found to be cut and gashed in no less than seven different places  there was nothing in the pockets  it will be exhibited at the coroners inquest and will be damning proof of the fact of the killing  these latter facts may be relied on as we get them from mark antony whose position enables him to learn every item of news connected with the one subject of absorbing interest oftoday  later while the coroner was summoning a jury mark antony and other friends of the late caesar got hold of the body and lugged it off to the forum and at last accounts antony and brutus were making speeches over it and raising such a row among the people that as we go to press the chief of police is satisfied there is going to be a riot and is taking measures accordingly       the widows protest one of the saddest things that ever came under my notice said the bankers clerk was there in corning during the war  dan murphy enlisted as a private and fought very bravely  the boys all liked him and when a wound by and by weakened him down till carrying a musket was too heavy work for him they clubbed together and fixed him up as a sutler  he made money then and sent it always to his wife to bank for him  she was a washer and ironer and knew enough by hard experience to keep money when she got it  she didnt waste a penny  on the contrary she began to get miserly as her bankaccount grew  she grieved to part with a cent poor creature for twice in her hardworking life she had known what it was to be hungry cold friendless sick and without a dollar in the world and she had a haunting dread of suffering so again  well at last dan died and the boys in testimony of their esteem and respect for him telegraphed to mrs murphy to know if she would like to have him embalmed and sent home when you know the usual custom was to dump a poor devil like him into a shallow hole and then inform his friends what had become of him  mrs  murphy jumped to the conclusion that it would only cost two or three dollars to embalm her dead husband and so she telegraphed yes  it was at the wake that the bill for embalming arrived and was presented to the widow  she uttered a wild sad wail that pierced every heart and said sivintyfoive dollars for stooffin dan blister their sowls  did thim divils suppose i was goin to stairt a museim that id be dalin in such expinsive curiassities  the bankers clerk said there was not a dry eye in the house       the scriptural panoramistwritten about 1866  there was a fellow traveling around in that country said mr nickerson with a moralreligious showa sort of scriptural panorama and he hired a woodenheaded old slab to play the piano for him after the first nights performance the showman says  my friend you seem to know pretty much all the tunes there are and you worry along first rate  but then didnt you notice that sometimes last night the piece you happened to be playing was a little rough on the proprieties so to speakdidnt seem to jibe with the general gait of the picture that was passing at the time as it werewas a little foreign to the subject you knowas if you didnt either trump or follow suit you understand  well no the fellow said he hadnt noticed but it might be he had played along just as it came handy  so they put it up that the simple old dummy was to keep his eye on the panorama after that and as soon as a stunning picture was reeled out he was to fit it to a dot with a piece of music that would help the audience to get the idea of the subject and warm them up like a campmeeting revival  that sort of thing would corral their sympathies the showman said  there was a big audience that nightmostly middleaged and old people who belong to the church and took a strong interest in bible matters and the balance were pretty much young bucks and heifersthey always come out strong on panoramas you know because it gives them a chance to taste one anothers complexions in the dark  well the showman began to swell himself up for his lecture and the old mudjobber tackled the piano and ran his fingers up and down once or twice to see that she was all right and the fellows behind the curtain commenced to grind out the panorama  the showman balanced his weight on  his right foot and propped his hands over his hips and flung his eyes over his shoulder at the scenery and said  ladies and gentlemen the painting now before you illustrates the beautiful and touching parable of the prodigal son  observe the happy expression just breaking over the features of the poor suffering youth so worn and weary with his long march note also the ecstasy beaming from the uplifted countenance of the aged father and the joy that sparkles in the eyes of the excited group of youths and maidens and seems ready to burst into the welcoming chorus from their lips  the lesson my friends is as solemn and instructive as the story is tender and beautiful  the mudjobber was all ready and when the second speech was finished struck up                      oh well all get blind drunk                     when johnny comes marching home  some of the people giggled and some groaned a little  the showman couldnt say a word he looked at the pianist sharp but he was all lovely and serenehe didnt know there was anything out of gear  the panorama moved on and the showman drummed up his grit and started in fresh  ladies and gentlemen the fine picture now unfolding itself to your gaze exhibits one of the most notable events in bible historyour saviour and his disciples upon the sea of galilee  how grand how aweinspiring are the reflections which the subject invokes  what sublimity of faith is revealed to us in this lesson from the sacred writings  the saviour rebukes the angry waves and walks securely upon the bosom of the deep  all around the house they were whispering oh how lovely how beautiful and the orchestra let himself out again                      a life on the ocean wave                     and a home on the rolling deep  there was a good deal of honest snickering turned on this time and considerable groaning and one or two old deacons got up and went out the showman grated his teeth and cursed the piano man to himself but the fellow sat there like a knot on a log and seemed to think he was doing firstrate  after things got quiet the showman thought he would make one more stagger at it anyway though his confidence was beginning to get mighty shaky  the supes started the panorama grinding along again and he says  ladies and gentlemen this exquisite painting represents the raising of lazarus from the dead by our saviour  the subject has been handled with marvelous skill by the artist and such touching sweetness and tenderness of expression has he thrown into it that i have known peculiarly sensitive persons to be even affected to tears by looking at it  observe the halfconfused halfinquiring look upon the countenance of the awakened lazarus  observe also the attitude and expression of the saviour who takes him gently by the sleeve of his shroud with one hand while he points with the other toward the distant city before anybody could get off an opinion in the case the innocent old ass at the piano struck up                      come rise up william riiley                     and go along with me  wheew  all the solemn old flats got up in a huff to go and everybody else laughed till the windows rattled  the showman went down and grabbed the orchestra and shook him up and says  that lets you out you know you chowderheaded old clam  go to the doorkeeper and get your money and cut your stickvamose the ranch ladies and gentlemen circumstances over which i have no control compel me prematurely to dismiss the house       curing a coldwritten about 1864  it is a good thing perhaps to write for the amusement of the public but it is a far higher and nobler thing to write for their instruction their profit their actual and tangible benefit  the latter is the sole object of this article  if it prove the means of restoring to health one solitary sufferer among my race of lighting up once more the fire of hope and joy in his faded eyes or bringing back to his dead heart again the quick generous impulses of other days i shall be amply rewarded for my labor my soul will be permeated with the sacred delight a christian feels when he has done a good unselfish deed  having led a pure and blameless life i am justified in believing that no man who knows me will reject the suggestions i am about to make out of fear that i am trying to deceive him  let the public do itself the honor to read my experience in doctoring a cold as herein set forth and then follow in my footsteps  when the white house was burned in virginia city i lost my home my happiness my constitution and my trunk  the loss of the two first named articles was a matter of no great consequence since a home without a mother or a sister or a distant young female relative in it to remind you by putting your soiled linen out of sight and taking your boots down off the mantelpiece that there are those who think about you and care for you is easily obtained  and i cared nothing for the loss of my happiness because not being a poet it could not be possible that melancholy would abide with me long  but to lose a good constitution and a better trunk were serious misfortunes  on the day of the fire my constitution succumbed to a severe cold caused by undue exertion in getting ready to do something  i suffered to no purpose too because the plan i was figuring at for the extinguishing of the fire was so elaborate that i never got it completed until the middle of the following week  the first time i began to sneeze a friend told me to go and bathe my feet in hot water and go to bed  i did so  shortly afterward another friend advised me to get up and take a cold showerbath  i did that also  within the hour another friend assured me that it was policy to feed a cold and starve a fever  i had both  so i thought it best to fill myself up for the cold and then keep dark and let the fever starve awhile  in a case of this kind i seldom do things by halves i ate pretty heartily i conferred my custom upon a stranger who had just opened his restaurant that morning he waited near me in respectful silence until i had finished feeding my cold when he inquired if the people about virginia city were much afflicted with colds  i told him i thought they were  he then went out and took in his sign  i started down toward the office and on the way encountered another bosom friend who told me that a quart of saltwater taken warm would come as near curing a cold as anything in the world  i hardly thought i had room for it but i tried it anyhow  the result was surprising  i believed i had thrown up my immortal soul  now as i am giving my experience only for the benefit of those who are troubled with the distemper i am writing about i feel that they will see the propriety of my cautioning them against following such portions of it as proved inefficient with me and acting upon this conviction i warn them against warm saltwater  it may be a good enough remedy but i think it is too severe  if i had another cold in the head and there were no course left me but to take either an earthquake or a quart of warm saltwater i would take my chances on the earthquake  after the storm which had been raging in my stomach had subsided and no more good samaritans happening along i went on borrowing handkerchiefs again and blowing them to atoms as had been my custom in the early stages of my cold until i came across a lady who had just arrived from over the plains and who said she had lived in a part of the country where doctors were scarce and had from necessity acquired considerable skill in the treatment of simple family complaints  i knew she must have had much experience for she appeared to be a hundred and fifty years old  she mixed a decoction composed of molasses aquafortis turpentine and various other drugs and instructed me to take a wineglass full of it every fifteen minutes  i never took but one dose that was enough it robbed me of all moral principle and awoke every unworthy impulse of my nature  under its malign influence my brain conceived miracles of meanness but my hands were too feeble to execute them at that time had it not been that my strength had surrendered to a succession of assaults from infallible remedies for my cold i am satisfied that i would have tried to rob the graveyard  like most other people i often feel mean and act accordingly but until i took that medicine i had never reveled in such supernatural depravity and felt proud of it  at the end of two days i was ready to go to doctoring again  i took a few more unfailing remedies and finally drove my cold from my head to my lungs  i got to coughing incessantly and my voice fell below zero i conversed in a thundering bass two octaves below my natural tone i could only compass my regular nightly repose by coughing myself down to a state of utter exhaustion and then the moment i began to talk in my sleep my discordant voice woke me up again  my case grew more and more serious every day  a plain gin was recommended i took it  then gin and molasses i took that also  then gin and onions i added the onions and took all three  i detected no particular result however except that i had acquired a breath like a buzzards  i found i had to travel for my health  i went to lake bigler with my reportorial comrade wilson  it is gratifying to me to reflect that we traveled in considerable style we went in the pioneer coach and my friend took all his baggage with him consisting of two excellent silk handkerchiefs and a daguerreotype of his grandmother  we sailed and hunted and fished and danced all day and i doctored my cough all night by managing in this way i made out to improve every hour in the twentyfour  but my disease continued to grow worse  a sheetbath was recommended  i had never refused a remedy yet and it seemed poor policy to commence then therefore i determined to take a sheetbath notwithstanding i had no idea what sort of arrangement it was  it was administered at midnight and the weather was very frosty my breast and back were bared and a sheet there appeared to be a thousand yards of it soaked in icewater was wound around me until i resembled a swab for a columbiad  it is a cruel expedient  when the chilly rag touches ones warm flesh it makes him start with sudden violence and gasp for breath just as men do in the deathagony  it froze the marrow in my bones and stopped the beating of my heart  i thought my time had come  young wilson said the circumstance reminded him of an anecdote about a negro who was being baptized and who slipped from the parsons grasp and came near being drowned  he floundered around though and finally rose up out of the water considerably strangled and furiously angry and started ashore at once spouting water like a whale and remarking with great asperity that one o dese days some genlmans nigger gwyne to get killed wid jis such damn foolishness as dis  never take a sheetbath  never  next to meeting a lady acquaintance who for reasons best known to herself dont see you when she looks at you and dont know you when she does see you it is the most uncomfortable thing in the world  but as i was saying when the sheetbath failed to cure my cough a lady friend recommended the application of a mustard plaster to my breast  i believe that would have cured me effectually if it had not been for young wilson  when i went to bed i put my mustard plaster which was a very gorgeous one eighteen inches squarewhere i could reach it when i was ready for it  but young wilson got hungry in the night and here is food for the imagination  after sojourning a week at lake bigler i went to steamboat springs and besides the steambaths i took a lot of the vilest medicines that were ever concocted  they would have cured me but i had to go back to virginia city where notwithstanding the variety of new remedies i absorbed every day i managed to aggravate my disease by carelessness and undue exposure  i finally concluded to visit san francisco and the first day i got there a lady at the hotel told me to drink a quart of whisky every twentyfour hours and a friend uptown recommended precisely the same course  each advised me to take a quart that made half a gallon  i did it and still live  now with the kindest motives in the world i offer for the consideration of consumptive patients the variegated course of treatment i have lately gone through  let them try it if it dont cure it cant more than kill them       a curious pleasure excursion  published at the time of the comet scare in the summer of 1874  we have received the following advertisement but inasmuch as it concerns a matter of deep and general interest we feel fully justified in inserting it in our readingcolumns  we are confident that our conduct in this regard needs only explanation not apologyed n y herald   advertisement  this is to inform the public that in connection with mr barnum i have leased the comet for a term of years and i desire also to solicit the public patronage in favor of a beneficial enterprise which we have in view  we propose to fit up comfortable and even luxurious accommodations in the comet for as many persons as will honor us with their patronage and make an extended excursion among the heavenly bodies  we shall prepare 1000000 staterooms in the tail of the comet with hot and cold water gas lookingglass parachute umbrella etc in each and shall construct more if we meet with a sufficiently generous encouragement we shall have billiardrooms cardrooms musicrooms bowlingalleys and many spacious theaters and free libraries and on the main deck we propose to have a driving park with upward of 100000 miles of roadway in it  we shall publish daily newspapers also                             departure of the comet  the comet will leave new york at 10 pm  on the 20th inst and therefore it will be desirable that the passengers be on board by eight at the latest to avoid confusion in getting under way  it is not known whether passports will be necessary or not but it is deemed best that passengers provide them and so guard against all contingencies  no dogs will be allowed on board  this rule has been made in deference to the existing state of feeling regarding these animals and will be strictly adhered to  the safety of the passengers will in all ways be jealously looked to  a substantial iron railing will be put up all around the comet and no one will be allowed to go to the edge and look over unless accompanied by either my partner or myself                               the postal service  will be of the completest character  of course the telegraph and the telegraph only will be employed consequently friends occupying staterooms 20000000 and even 30000000 miles apart will be able to send a message and receive a reply inside of eleven days  night messages will be halfrate  the whole of this vast postal system will be under the personal superintendence of mr hale of maine  meals served at all hours  meals served in staterooms charged extra  hostility is not apprehended from any great planet but we have thought it best to err on the safe side and therefore have provided a proper number of mortars siegeguns and boardingpikes  history shows that small isolated communities such as the people of remote islands are prone to be hostile to strangers and so the same may be the case with                            the inhabitants of stars  of the tenth or twentieth magnitude  we shall in no case wantonly offend the people of any star but shall treat all alike with urbanity and kindliness never conducting ourselves toward an asteroid after a fashion which we could not venture to assume toward jupiter or saturn  i repeat that we shall not wantonly offend any star but at the same time we shall promptly resent any injury that may be done us or any insolence offered us by parties or governments residing in any star in the firmament although averse to the shedding of blood we shall still hold this course rigidly and fearlessly not only toward single stars but toward constellations  we shall hope to leave a good impression of america behind us in every nation we visit from venus to uranus  and at all events if we cannot inspire love we shall at least compel respect for our country wherever we go  we shall take with us free of charge                         a great force of missionaries  and shed the true light upon all the celestial orbs which physically aglow are yet morally in darkness  sundayschools will be established wherever practicable  compulsory education will also be introduced  the comet will visit mars first and proceed to mercury jupiter venus and saturn  parties connected with the government of the district of columbia and with the former city government of new york who may desire to inspect the rings will be allowed time and every facility  every star of prominent magnitude will be visited and time allowed for excursions to points of interest inland                                  the dog star  has been stricken from the program  much time will be spent in the great bear and indeed in every constellation of importance  so also with the sun and moon and the milky way otherwise the gulf stream of the skies  clothing suitable for wear in the sun should be provided  our program has been so arranged that we shall seldom go more than 100000000 of miles at a time without stopping at some star  this will necessarily make the stoppages frequent and preserve the interest of the tourist  baggage checked through to any point on the route  parties desiring to make only a part of the proposed tour and thus save expense may stop over at any star they choose and wait for the return voyage  after visiting all the most celebrated stars and constellations in our system and personally inspecting the remotest sparks that even the most powerful telescope can now detect in the firmament we shall proceed with good heart upon                              a stupendous voyage  of discovery among the countless whirling worlds that make turmoil in the mighty wastes of space that stretch their solemn solitudes their unimaginable vastness billions upon billions of miles away beyond the farthest verge of telescopic vision till by comparison the little sparkling vault we used to gaze at on earth shall seem like a remembered phosphorescent flash of spangles which some tropical voyagers prow stirred into life for a single instant and which ten thousand miles of phosphorescent seas and tedious lapse of time had since diminished to an incident utterly trivial in his recollection  children occupying seats at the first table will be charged full fare                                firstclass fare  from the earth to uranus including visits to the sun and moon and all the principal planets on the route will be charged at the low rate of 2 for every 50000000 miles of actual travel  a great reduction will be made where parties wish to make the round trip  this comet is new and in thorough repair and is now on her first voyage  she is confessedly the fastest on the line  she makes 20000000 miles a day with her present facilities but with a picked american crew and good weather we are confident we can get 40000000 out of her  still we shall never push her to a dangerous speed and we shall rigidly prohibit racing with other comets  passengers desiring to diverge at any point or return will be transferred to other comets  we make close connections at all principal points with all reliable lines  safety can be depended upon it is not to be denied that the heavens are infested with                             old ramshackle comets  that have not been inspected or overhauled in 10000 years and which ought long ago to have been destroyed or turned into hailbarges but with these we have no connection whatever  steerage passengers not allowed abaft the main hatch  complimentary roundtrip tickets have been tendered to general butler mr shepherd mr richardson and other eminent gentlemen whose public services have entitled them to the rest and relaxation of a voyage of this kind  parties desiring to make the round trip will have extra accommodation  the entire voyage will be completed and the passengers landed in new york again on the 14th of december 1991  this is at least forty years quicker than any other comet can do it in  nearly all the backpay members contemplate making the round trip with us in case their constituents will allow them a holiday  every harmless amusement will be allowed on board but no pools permitted on the run of the comet no gambling of any kind  all fixed stars will be respected by us but such stars as seem to need fixing we shall fix  if it makes trouble we shall be sorry but firm  mr coggia having leased his comet to us she will no longer be called by his name but by my partners  n bpassengers by paying double fare will be entitled to a share in all the new stars suns moons comets meteors and magazines of thunder and lightning we may discover patentmedicine people will take notice that                            we carry bulletinboards  and a paintbrush along for use in the constellations and are open to terms  cremationists are reminded that we are going straight tosome hot placesand are open to terms  to other parties our enterprise is a pleasure excursion but individually we mean business  we shall fly our comet for all it is worth                            for further particulars  or for freight or passage apply on board or to my partner but not to me since i do not take charge of the comet until she is under way it is necessary at a time like this that my mind should not be burdened with small business details                                                         mark twain       running for governorwritten about 1870  a few months ago i was nominated for governor of the great state of new york to run against mr john t smith and mr blank j blank on an independent ticket  i somehow felt that i had one prominent advantage over these gentlemen and that wasgood character  it was easy to see by the newspapers that if ever they had known what it was to bear a good name that time had gone by  it was plain that in these latter years they had become familiar with all manner of shameful crimes  but at the very moment that i was exalting my advantage and joying in it in secret there was a muddy undercurrent of discomfort riling the deeps of my happiness and that wasthe having to hear my name bandied about in familiar connection with those of such people  i grew more and more disturbed  finally i wrote my grandmother about it  her answer came quick and sharp  she said       you have never done one single thing in all your life to be ashamed      ofnot one  look at the newspaperslook at them and comprehend      what sort of characters messrs  smith and blank are and then see      if you are willing to lower yourself to their level and enter a      public canvass with them  it was my very thought  i did not sleep a single moment that night but after all i could not recede  i was fully committed and must go on with the fight  as i was looking listlessly over the papers at breakfast i came across this paragraph and i may truly say i never was so confounded before       perjuryperhaps now that mr mark twain is before the people as a      candidate for governor he will condescend to explain how he came to      be convicted of perjury by thirtyfour witnesses in wakawak cochin      china in 1863 the intent of which perjury being to rob a poor      native widow and her helpless family of a meager plantainpatch      their only stay and support in their bereavement and desolation      mr twain owes it to himself as well as to the great people whose      suffrages he asks to clear this matter up  will he do it  i thought i should burst with amazement  such a cruel heartless charge i never had seen cochin china  i never had heard of wakawak  i didnt know a plantainpatch from a kangaroo  i did not know what to do  i was crazed and helpless  i let the day slip away without doing anything at all  the next morning the same paper had thisnothing more       significantmr  twain it will be observed is suggestively      silent about the cochin china perjury  memduring the rest of the campaign this paper never referred to me in any other way than as the infamous perjurer twain  next came the gazette with this       wanted to knowwill the new candidate for governor deign to      explain to certain of his fellowcitizens who are suffering to vote      for him the little circumstance of his cabinmates in montana      losing small valuables from time to time until at last these      things having been invariably found on mr twains person or in his      trunk newspaper he rolled his traps in they felt compelled to      give him a friendly admonition for his own good and so tarred and      feathered him and rode him on a rail and then advised him to leave      a permanent vacuum in the place he usually occupied in the camp      will he do this  could anything be more deliberately malicious than that  for i never was in montana in my life  after this this journal customarily spoke of me as twain the montana thief  i got to picking up papers apprehensivelymuch as one would lift a desired blanket which he had some idea might have a rattlesnake under it one day this met my eye        the lie nailedby the sworn affidavits of michael oflanagan      esq of the five points and mr snub rafferty and mr catty      mulligan of water street it is established that mr mark twains      vile statement that the lamented grandfather of our noble      standardbearer blank j blank was hanged for highway robbery is      a brutal and gratuitous lie without a shadow of foundation in fact      it is disheartening to virtuous men to see such shameful means      resorted to to achieve political success as the attacking of the      dead in their graves and defiling their honored names with slander      when we think of the anguish this miserable falsehood must cause the      innocent relatives and friends of the deceased we are almost driven      to incite an outraged and insulted public to summary and unlawful      vengeance upon the traducer  but no let us leave him to the agony      of a lacerated conscience though if passion should get the better      of the public and in its blind fury they should do the traducer      bodily injury it is but too obvious that no jury could convict and      no court punish the perpetrators of the deed  the ingenious closing sentence had the effect of moving me out of bed with despatch that night and out at the back door also while the outraged and insulted public surged in the front way breaking furniture and windows in their righteous indignation as they came and taking off such property as they could carry when they went and yet i can lay my hand upon the book and say that i never slandered mr blanks grandfather  more i had never even heard of him or mentioned him up to that day and date  i will state in passing that the journal above quoted from always referred to me afterward as twain the bodysnatcher  the next newspaper article that attracted my attention was the following       a sweet candidatemr  mark twain who was to make such a      blighting speech at the massmeeting of the independents last night      didnt come to time  a telegram from his physician stated that he      had been knocked down by a runaway team and his leg broken in two      placessufferer lying in great agony and so forth and so forth      and a lot more bosh of the same sort  and the independents tried      hard to swallow the wretched subterfuge and pretend that they did      not know what was the real reason of the absence of the abandoned      creature whom they denominate their standardbearer  a certain man      was seen to reel into mr  twains hotel last night in a state of      beastly intoxication  it is the imperative duty of the independents      to prove that this besotted brute was not mark twain himself  we      have them at last  this is a case that admits of no shirking  the      voice of the people demands in thunder tones who was that man  it was incredible absolutely incredible for a moment that it was really my name that was coupled with this disgraceful suspicion  three long years had passed over my head since i had tasted ale beer wine or liquor of any kind  it shows what effect the times were having on me when i say that i saw myself confidently dubbed mr delirium tremens twain in the next issue of that journal without a pangnotwithstanding i knew that with monotonous fidelity the paper would go on calling me so to the very end  by this time anonymous letters were getting to be an important part of my mail matter  this form was common       how about that old woman you kiked of your premises which      was beging                             pol pry  and this       there is things which you have done which is unbeknowens to anybody      but me  you better trot out a few dols to yours truly or youll      hear through the papers from                                              handy andy  this is about the idea  i could continue them till the reader was surfeited if desirable  shortly the principal republican journal convicted me of wholesale bribery and the leading democratic paper nailed an aggravated case of blackmailing to me  in this way i acquired two additional names twain the filthy corruptionist and twain the loathsome embracer  by this time there had grown to be such a clamor for an answer to all the dreadful charges that were laid to me that the editors and leaders of my party said it would be political ruin for me to remain silent any longer   as if to make their appeal the more imperative the following appeared in one of the papers the very next day       behold the manthe independent candidate still maintains silence      because he dare not speak  every accusation against him has been      amply proved and they have been indorsed and reindorsed by his own      eloquent silence till at this day he stands forever convicted      look upon your candidate independents  look upon the infamous      perjurer the montana thief the bodysnatcher  contemplate your      incarnate delirium tremens your filthy corruptionist your      loathsome embracer  gaze upon himponder him welland then say if      you can give your honest votes to a creature who has earned this      dismal array of titles by his hideous crimes and dares not open his      mouth in denial of any one of them  there was no possible way of getting out of it and so in deep humiliation i set about preparing to answer a mass of baseless charges and mean and wicked falsehoods  but i never finished the task for the very next morning a paper came out with a new horror a fresh malignity and seriously charged me with burning a lunatic asylum with all its inmates because it obstructed the view from my house  this threw me into a sort of panic  then came the charge of poisoning my uncle to get his property with an imperative demand that the grave should be opened this drove me to the verge of distraction  on top of this i was accused of employing toothless and incompetent old relatives to prepare the food for the foundling hospital when i was warden  i was waveringwavering and at last as a due and fitting climax to the shameless persecution that party rancor had inflicted upon me nine little toddling children of all shades of color and degrees of raggedness were taught to rush onto the platform at a public meeting and clasp me around the legs and call me pa  i gave it up  i hauled down my colors and surrendered  i was not equal to the requirements of a gubernatorial campaign in the state of new york and so i sent in my withdrawal from the candidacy and in bitterness of spirit signed it truly yours once a decent man but now                      mark twain ip mt bs dt fc and le       a mysterious visit   the first notice that was taken of me when i settled down recently was by a gentleman who said he was an assessor and connected with the u s internal revenue department  i said i had never heard of his branch of business before but i was very glad to see him all the same  would he sit down  he sat down  i did not know anything particular to say and yet i felt that people who have arrived at the dignity of keeping house must be conversational must be easy and sociable in company  so in default of anything else to say i asked him if he was opening his shop in our neighborhood  he said he was  i did not wish to appear ignorant but i had hoped he would mention what he had for sale  i ventured to ask him how was trade  and he said soso  i then said we would drop in and if we liked his house as well as any other we would give him our custom  he said he thought we would like his establishment well enough to confine ourselves to itsaid he never saw anybody who would go off and hunt up another man in his line after trading with him once  that sounded pretty complacent but barring that natural expression of villainy which we all have the man looked honest enough  i do not know how it came about exactly but gradually we appeared to melt down and run together conversationally speaking and then everything went along as comfortably as clockwork  we talked and talked and talkedat least i did and we laughed and laughed and laughedat least he did  but all the time i had my presence of mind about mei had my native shrewdness turned on full head as the engineers say  i was determined to find out all about his business in spite of his obscure answersand i was determined i would have it out of him without his suspecting what i was at  i meant to trap him with a deep deep ruse  i would tell him all about my own business and he would naturally so warm to me during this seductive burst of confidence that he would forget himself and tell me all about his affairs before he suspected what i was about  i thought to myself my son you little know what an old fox you are dealing with  i said  now you never would guess what i made lecturing this winter and last spring  nodont believe i could to save me  let me seelet me see   about two thousand dollars maybe  but no no sir i know you couldnt have made that much   say seventeen hundred maybe  ha ha  i knew you couldnt  my lecturing receipts for last spring and this winter were fourteen thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars  what do you think of that  why it is amazingperfectly amazing  i will make a note of it  and you say even this wasnt all  all  why bless you there was my income from the daily warwhoop for four monthsaboutaboutwell what should you say to about eight thousand dollars for instance  say  why i should say i should like to see myself rolling in just such another ocean of affluence  eight thousand  ill make a note of it why manand on top of all this am i to understand that you had still more income  ha ha ha  why youre only in the suburbs of it so to speak theres my book the innocents abroadprice 350 to 5 according to the binding  listen to me  look me in the eye  during the last four months and a half saying nothing of sales before that but just simply during the four months and a half weve sold ninetyfive thousand copies of that book  ninetyfive thousand  think of it  average four dollars a copy say  its nearly four hundred thousand dollars my son  i get half  the suffering moses  ill set that down  fourteensevenfifty eighttwo hundred  total saywell upon my word the grand total is about two hundred and thirteen or fourteen thousand dollars  is that possible  possible  if theres any mistake its the other way  two hundred and fourteen thousand cash is my income for this year if i know how to cipher  then the gentleman got up to go  it came over me most uncomfortably that maybe i had made my revelations for nothing besides being flattered into stretching them considerably by the strangers astonished exclamations but no at the last moment the gentleman handed me a large envelope and said it contained his advertisement and that i would find out all about his business in it and that he would be happy to have my customwould in fact be proud to have the custom of a man of such prodigious income and that he used to think there were several wealthy men in the city but when they came to trade with him he discovered that they barely had enough to live on and that in truth it had been such a weary weary age since he had seen a rich man face to face and talked to him and touched him with his hands that he could hardly refrain from embracing mein fact would esteem it a great favor if i would let him embrace me  this so pleased me that i did not try to resist but allowed this simplehearted stranger to throw his arms about me and weep a few tranquilizing tears down the back of my neck  then he went his way  as soon as he was gone i opened his advertisement  i studied it attentively for four minutes  i then called up the cook and said  hold me while i faint  let marie turn the griddlecakes  by and by when i came to i sent down to the rummill on the corner and hired an artist by the week to sit up nights and curse that stranger and give me a lift occasionally in the daytime when i came to a hard place  ah what a miscreant he was  his advertisement  was nothing in the world but a wicked taxreturna string of impertinent questions about my private affairs occupying the best part of four foolscap pages of fine printquestions i may remark gotten up with such marvelous ingenuity that the oldest man in the world couldnt understand what the most of them were driving atquestions too that were calculated to make a man report about four times his actual income to keep from swearing to a falsehood  i looked for a loophole but there did not appear to be any  inquiry no 1 covered my case as generously and as amply as an umbrella could cover an anthill       what were your profits during the past year from any trade      business or vocation wherever carried on  and that inquiry was backed up by thirteen others of an equally searching nature the most modest of which required information as to whether i had committed any burglary or highway robbery or by any arson or other secret source of emolument had acquired property which was not enumerated in my statement of income as set opposite to inquiry no 1  it was plain that that stranger had enabled me to make a goose of myself it was very very plain and so i went out and hired another artist by working on my vanity the stranger had seduced me into declaring an income of two hundred and fourteen thousand dollars  by law one thousand dollars of this was exempt from income taxthe only relief i could see and it was only a drop in the ocean  at the legal five per cent i must pay to the government the sum of ten thousand six hundred and fifty dollars income tax  i may remark in this place that i did not do it  i am acquainted with a very opulent man whose house is a palace whose table is regal whose outlays are enormous yet a man who has no income as i have often noticed by the revenue returns and to him i went for advice in my distress  he took my dreadful exhibition of receipts he put on his glasses he took his pen and prestoi was a pauper  it was the neatest thing that ever was  he did it simply by deftly manipulating the bill of deductions  he set down my state national and municipal taxes at so much my losses by shipwreck fire etc at so much my losses on sales of real estateon live stock soldon payments for rent of homesteadon repairs improvements intereston previously taxed salary as an officer of the united states army navy revenue service and other things  he got astonishing deductions out of each and every one of these matterseach and every one of them  and when he was done he handed me the paper and i saw at a glance that during the year my income in the way of profits had been one thousand two hundred and fifty dollars and forty cents  now said he the thousand dollars is exempt by law  what you want to do is to go and swear this document in and pay tax on the two hundred and fifty dollars  while he was making this speech his little boy willie lifted a twodollar greenback out of his vest pocket and vanished with it and i would wager anything that if my stranger were to call on that little boy tomorrow he would make a false return of his income  do you said i do you always work up the deductions after this fashion in your own case sir  well i should say so  if it werent for those eleven saving clauses under the head of deductions i should be beggared every year to support this hateful and wicked this extortionate and tyrannical government  this gentleman stands away up among the very best of the solid men of the citythe men of moral weight of commercial integrity of unimpeachable social spotlessnessand so i bowed to his example  i went down to the revenue office and under the accusing eyes of my old visitor i stood up and swore to lie after lie fraud after fraud villainy after villainy till my soul was coated inches and inches thick with perjury and my selfrespect gone for ever and ever  but what of it  it is nothing more than thousands of the richest and proudest and most respected honored and courted men in america do every year  and so i dont care  i am not ashamed  i shall simply for the present talk little and eschew fireproof gloves lest i fall into certain dreadful habits irrevocably
