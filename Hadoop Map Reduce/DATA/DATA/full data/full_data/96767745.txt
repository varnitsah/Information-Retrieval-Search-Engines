96767745	the fugitives by rm ballantyne   a group of people from a british ship have gone ashore to stretch their legs when enemies approach the ships boat retreats to the ship and they are left stranded ashore  the book deals with their efforts to find what they hope will be civilisation in the capital of the island of madagascar which is something like the size of france  unfortunately the reigning queen has a hatred of christianity which had been brought to the island by missionaries some forty years before our heroes find themselves assisted by a christian network but when they get to the capital they are appalled by the carnage and torture they find when the queen has one of her rages against christianity  based on fact the story told here of the repression of christianity in an emerging nation was all too true  the queen died in 1867 and was succeeded by her son an altogether different person at which point our heroes take ship for england and the story ends  the story is full of action the only quibble being the long and rather similar names the malagasy people who appear in the story have  this makes it sometimes rather hard to make out what is happening   the fugitives by rm ballantyne    preface  it is almost allowable i think to say that this is a true story for fiction has only been introduced for the purpose of piecing together and making a symmetrical whole of a number of most interesting facts in regard to madagascar and the terrible persecutions that took place there in the early part and middle of the present century  i have ventured to modify time and place somewhat as well as to mix my characters and their deeds a little in order to suit the conditions of my tale but in doing so i have striven to avoid exaggeration and to produce a true picture of the state of affairs at the period treated of in what may be styled one of the most interesting and progressive islands of the world  i take this opportunity of thanking the rev  george cousins of the london missionary society and formerly of madagascar for kindly supplying me with much valuable information and of acknowledging myself indebted among others to the works of messrs sibree ellis and shaw  r m ballantyne  harrowonthehill 1887    chapter one  introduces the chief actors and a few mysteries  intense action is at all times an interesting object of contemplation to mankind  we therefore make no apology to the reader for dragging him unceremoniously into the middle of a grand primeval forest and presenting to his view the curious and stirring spectacle of two white men and a negro running at their utmost possible speed with flashing eyes and labouring chestsevidently running for their lives  though very different in aspect and condition those men were pretty equally matched as runners for there was no apparent difference in the vigour with which they maintained the pace  the track or footpath along which they ran was so narrow as to compel them to advance in single file  he who led was a tall agile youth of nineteen or thereabouts in knickerbocker shootinggarb with short curly black hair pleasantly expressive features and sinewy frame  the second was obviously a trueblue tara regular seadogabout thirty years of age of samsonian mould and albeit running for very life with grand indignation gleaming in his eyes  he wore a blue shirt on his broad back white ducks on his active legs and a straw hat on his head besides a mass of shaggy hair which apparently not finding enough of room on his cranium overflowed in two brown cataracts down his cheeks and terminated in a voluminous beard  the third fugitive was also a young man and a negro short thickset square tough as indiarubber and black as the emperor of zahara goodhumour wrinkled the corners of his eyes the milk of human kindness played on his thick lips and rippled his sable brow and intense sincerity like a sunbeam suffused his entire visage  james gingerfor that was his name though his friends preferred to call him ebonyscorned a hat of any kind his simple costume consisting merely of two garmentscanvas trousers and a guernsey shirt  the sailor wore a cutlass in his belt  ebony was unarmed  the youthful leader carried a short fowlingpiece  a yell in the far distance as if from a hundred fiends told that the pursuers had discovered the trail of the fugitives and were gaining on them  well have to fight for it doctor growled the sailor in a savage tone better stop while weve got some wind left  the wood seems more open ahead replied the youth lets push on a bit further  hi exclaimed the negro in surprise not unmingled with alarm as they suddenly emerged on an open space and found themselves on the edge of a stupendous precipice  the formation of the region was curious  there was a drop in the land as it were to a lower level  from their elevated position the three men could see a turbulent river rushing far below at the base of the cliffs on the edge of which they stood  beyond lay a magnificent and varied stretch of forest scenery extending away to the horizon where the prospect terminated in a blue range of hills  no path was at first visible by which the fugitives could reach the plain below  the precipice was almost perpendicular  they were about to leap recklessly over and trust to descending by means of an occasional bush or shrub which grew on the rocky face when the negro uttered one of his falsetto exclamations  hi here am a track  he dashed aside the branches of an overhanging bush and ran along a narrow path or ledge which sloped gently downwards  it was a fearfully giddy position but this in the circumstances and to men accustomed to mastheads and yardarms was of small moment  on they ran at a more cautious pace indeed but still with anxious haste until about a quarter of the distance down the face of the precipice when to their horror they came to a turn in the path where it suddenly ended a mass of rock apparently detached from the cliff by recent rains had fallen from above and in its thundering descent had carried away fully ten yards of the path into the stream below where they could see its shattered fragments in the rushing river  the gap in front of them was absolutely impassable  on the right the cliff rose sheer upwards  on the left it went sheer down  a sort of groan escaped from the doctor  whats to be done now hockins he asked sharply turning to the sailor  die replied hockins in a tone of savage bitterness  stuff an nonsense we no die yit said the negro pointing to the snakelike branches of a climbing plant which spreading over the naked face of the cliff turned into a crevice and disappeared round a jutting point  will it bear our weight lad asked the sailor doubtfully  it leads to nothing that i can see said the young doctor and would only ensure our being dashed to pieces instead of speared  nebber fear massa breezy  dis not de fus time is hoed troo de forests  if you stop here you die  james gingah he go on an lib  go on then ebony we will follow returned breezy slinging his gun on his shoulder so as to leave his hands free  a yell of disappointment on the cliffs above accelerated their movements  it was evident that the pursuers had come out on the open plateau but had not observed the path by which they descended  as it was certain however that they would find it in a few minutes ebony sprang upon the creeping plant and clambered along its tortuous limbs like a monkey  young breezy followed and hockins came last  the plant was tough  it stood the strain well  if it had given way death on the jagged rocks below would have been the result  but death by savage spears was behind them so they did not hesitate  a few seconds and all three had passed round the jutting rock and into the crevice where they were completely hidden from the view of any one standing on the path they had just left  in the crevice they found a ledge or platform sufficiently large to admit of their standing together  they had scarcely obtained a footing on it when another shout announced that the pursuer had traced their trail to the head of the track  we know not reader whether you have ever experienced that heartmelting qualm which comes over one at the sudden and unexpected approach of what at least appears to be death  if you have you will be able to understand the intense relief and thankfulness felt by the fugitives when safe from immediate danger they listened to their pursuers as they held excited conversation at the end of the broken track  not knowing the language they could not of course understand what was said and being just beyond the range of visionowing to the jutting cliff that concealed themthey could not see what their pursuers were doing but they heard a suggestive crash and a sharp exclamation  had they been able to see they would have understood the situation well enough without the aid of language  two of the natives who were darkskinned and almost naked savages had come to the place where the track had been broken away  they gazed at the profound depths on the left and the inaccessible cliffs on the right and then glanced at each other in solemn surprise  no doubt the creeping plant would in a few seconds have attracted special attention had not an incident turned their minds in another direction  while the foremost savage was craning his neck so as to see as far round the projecting cliff as possible the piece of rock on which his advanced foot was dislodged and he had the narrowest possible escape from plunging headlong after the rock which went bounding and crashing into the gulf below  instantly the faces of the two men gleamed with intelligence they nodded with energy grinned with satisfaction and pointed to the abyss in front of them with the air of men who had no doubt that their enemies were lying down there in quivering fragments  something of this james ginger did indeed manage to see  curiosity was so powerfully developed in that sable spirit that at the imminent risk of his life he reached out by means of a branch and so elongated his black neck that he got one of his brilliant eyes to bear for a moment upon his foes  he appreciated the situation instantly and drew back to indulge in a smothered laugh which shut up both his eyes and appeared to gash his face from ear to ear  whats wrong with you ebony whispered mark breezy who was in anything but a laughing mood just then  oh nuffin nuffin massa only dem brown niggers are sitch asses dat dey blieve amost anyting  black niggers aint so easy putt off de scent  dey tinks wes tumble ober de precipis an busted ourselbes  lucky for us that they think so said hockins in a soft tone of satisfaction  but now what are we to do  it was bad enough clamberin up here in blazin excitement to save our lives but it will be ten times worse gettin down again in cold blood when theyre gone  time enough to consider that when they are gone muttered breezy hush  listen  the sounds that reached their place of concealment told clearly enough that a number of the savages had descended the cliffs presumably to look at the place over which the white men had fallen  then there was much eager conversation in an unknown tongue mingled with occasional bursts of laughteron hearing which latter the huge mouth of our negro enlarged in silent sympathy  after a while the voices were heard to retire up the narrow track and become fainter until they died away altogether leaving no sound save the murmur of the rushing river to fill the ears of the anxious listeners who stood like three statues in a niche on the face of that mighty precipice  now you know said breezy with a sigh of relief this is very satisfactory as far as it goes and we have reason to be thankful that we are neither speared nor dashed to pieces nevertheless we are in an uncomfortable fix here for night is approaching and we must retrace our steps somehow or other unless we make up our minds to sleep standing  thats so doctor  theres not room to lie down here assented the sailor glancing slowly round an to tell ee the plain truth i feel as funky about trustin myself again to that serpentlike creeper as i felt the first time i went up through the lubberhole the year i went to sea  what yous fraid ob mr ockins asked ebony  afraid o the nasty thing givin way under my weight  if it was a good stout rope now i wouldnt mind but every crack it gave when i was comin aloft made my heart jump amost out o my mouth  what have ee found there doctor asked the seaman on observing that his companion was groping behind a mass of herbage at the back part of the niche in which they stood  theres a big hole here hockins  perhaps we may find room to stay where we are after all till morning  come here ebony youve got something of the eel about you  try if you can wriggle in  the negro at once thrust his head and shoulders into the hole but could not advance  bery strange he said drawing out his head and snorting once or twice like a dog that has halfchoked himself in a rabbithole  seems to me deres a big block o wood dere stoppin de way  strange indeed ebony  a block of wood could not have grown there are you sure it is not a big root  sartin sure massa  i hab studied roots since i was a babby  hold on i try again  the negro tried again and with such vigour that he not only displaced the block of wood but burst in several planks which concealed the entrance to a cavern  they fell on the stone floor with a crash that aroused a multitude of echoes in the dark interior  at the same moment something like a faint shriek or wail was heard within causing the hearts of the three listeners to beat faster  did you hear that hockins  ay i heard it sure enough  what is it think ee lad said the seaman to the negro  ebony who was gazing into the dark cavern with glaring eyeballs and distended nostrils replied  my advice to you is lets go back de way we come  dis no place for spectable christians  do you fear ghosts asked mark smiling yet at the same time bringing his gun into a convenient position with his finger ready on the trigger  i fears nuffin returned the negro with a proud look while beads of perspiration stood on his brow  then yere a braver man than i am ebony for i fear that climbin plant worse than a ghost so here goes to find out what it is  although the sailor spoke thus boldly and tried to look cool it is certain that he also was afflicted with sensations of an unusual description which of course he would have scorned to admit were the result of fear  his power of will however was stronger than his fears  drawing his cutlass he was about to enter the cavern when mark laid a hand on his shoulder  come hockins you have accepted my lead hitherto  it is not fair to take it out of my hands at this critical point  so saying he glided past his comrade and was almost lost to sight immediately in the deep gloom  softly softly doctor whispered the seaman as he followed there may be holes or pits within  all right im feeling my way carefully  keep close  as he spoke a slight indescribable sound was heardalmost like a sigh  hist  did ee hear that said hockins in the lowest possible whisper  oh massa lets go back de way we come urged ebony in the same low but earnest tone  mark breezy did not reply but the click of his gun as he cocked it showed that he was on the alert  for nearly a minute the three men stood in absolute silence listening for a repetition of the mysterious sound and though it did not recur there was an indescribable feeling in the heart of each that they were not alone in that cavern  have you not flint and steel asked mark  yes but to strike a light would only show our whereabouts if there is any one here  the seaman accidentally touched ebony on the elbow as he spoke and sent that worthys heart or something like it into his throat with such violence as nearly to choke him  git along massa he said in a gaspy whisper when able to articulate wes got to go troo wid it now  acting on this advice the young man continued to advance cautiously feeling his way step by step and fully expecting every moment to reach the inner wall of the cavern  presently the explorers were again brought to a stand by the sudden appearance of a light in the far distance  as however it did not move they continued to advance and soon were convinced that it was daylight shining through an opening in that direction  every step convinced them more and more that they were right and their spirits rose with the hope of escaping though the light made no appreciable difference as yet in the darkness that surrounded them  suddenly a sharp loud short cry filled the cavern for an instant and almost froze their blood  the loudness and abrupt stoppage of the cry left the impression that the creature which uttered it had been suddenly and effectively killed for it ended in a sharp gasp or gurgle and then all was stillbut only for a moment for the shock to marks nerves was such that his finger inadvertently pressed the trigger of his gun which exploded with a deafening crash and awoke shrieks and cries that were not to be accounted for by mere echoes  this was too much for ordinary human beings  fabled knights of old in armour of proof might have stood it but the two white men and the black being ordinary heroes regardless of pride and honour went in for a regular stampede and it is but simple justice to say that ebony won for he reached the outlet of the cavern first and sprang through it into daylight like a black thunderbolt  it is also due to his comrades to add that they were not far behind him  their courage however was soon restored  daylight has a celebrated power of restoring courage  on clearing the bushes which concealed the entrance to the cave they simultaneously stopped turned round and resolutely faced their foe  but no foe was to be seen  once again all was still as death  after glaring for a few seconds at the spot whence the expected enemy should have issued the three fugitives relaxed their frowning brows and turned inquiring eyes on each other  dis beats cockfightin amost said ebony with a sigh of intense relief  ay an every other sort o fightin as i ever heard on responded hockins  come friends said their young leader whatever it may have been it behoves us to get as far away from this spot as possible and that as fast as we can    chapter two  harks back a little  the spot where our adventurers found themselves on issuing from the mysterious cave was a peculiarly rugged one  it formed a sort of hollow or depression in the forestland in which we introduced the three men as fugitives  from this hollow there descended a narrow track or pathway to the extensive valley which had been seen from the summit of the precipice that barred their flight and had so nearly proved fatal  so confused was the nature of the ground here and so intricate were the tracksoriginally formed no doubt by wild animals though made use of by wandering menthat it became impossible for mark breezy to know in what direction he was leading his comrades as he wound in and out among large rocks and fallen trees  in fact it was more by chance than guidance that they ultimately hit upon the path which finally led them to the lower region or plateau of forestland and it is certain that they would have found it impossible to find their way back to the cave even had they desired to do so  their chief object however was to put as much space as possible between themselves and their late pursuers and to this end they pushed forward at their best speed until they reached a small river which appeared to be a tributary to or a branch of that which they had seen from the heights earlier in the day    come to a ribbercouldnt git across   gib a couple o dollars for an old blind hoss  murmured ebony quoting an ancient ditty  we shall have to swim it i fear remarked breezy for there is no horse here blind or otherwise  perhaps that fallen tree may prove strong enough to serve as a bridge  he pointed to a slender tree which had evidently been placed there with several others for the purpose of forming a rough and ready bridge but its companions had been removed by floods for they lay tossed on the bank further down among other wreckage  itll be somethin like tightrope dancin said the sailor  well have to repair the bridge  nuffin ob de sort  look here  ebony ran to the tree referred to and skipped over with admirable agility though it bent under him not unlike a tightrope  but i cant do that said hockins not bein a black monkey dee see  with a sudden expression of intense pity the negro exclaimed  oh  i beg pardin  didnt i forgot yous ony a white man  but stop i come ober agin an took you on my back  he pretended to be on the point of recrossing but the sailor had already got upon the bridge and with much balancing and waving of his long arms passed over in safety  mark was about to follow when hockins called out better pitch over the powderflask in case you fall in  thats true for i maynt be as good as you or ebony on the tightrope look out  he pulled the powderflask out of his pocket and threw it towards his comrades  unfortunately the branch of an overhanging bush had touched his hand  the touch was slight but it sufficed to divert the flask from its proper course and sent it into the middle of the stream  ebony followed it head first like an otter but soon reappeared gasping and unsuccessful  again and again he dived but failed to find the flask without which of course their gun was useless and at last they were obliged to continue their flight without it  this was a very serious loss for they had not an ounce of provisions with them and were in a land the character and resources of which were utterly unknown at least to two of them while the youth who had become their leader knew very little more than the fact that it was the island of madagascar that it lay about 300 miles off the eastern shores of africa and that the tribes by whom they were surrounded were little if at all better than savages  that day they wandered far into the depths of a dark and tangled forest intentionally seeking its gloomiest recesses in order to avoid the natives and at night went supperless to rest among the branches of an umbrageous tree not knowing what danger from man or beast might assail them if they should venture to sleep on the ground  although possessed of flint and steel as well as tinder they did not use them for fear of attracting attention  as they had nothing to cook the deprivation was not great  fortunately the weather at the time was pleasantly warm so that beyond the discomfort of not being able to stretch out at full length the occasional poking of awkward knots and branches into their ribs and the constant necessity of holding on lest they should fall off their circumstances were not insufferable and might have been worse  while they are enjoying their repose we will tell in a few sentences who they were and how they got there  when mark breezy in the closing years of his medicalstudent career got leave to go on a voyage to china in one of his fathers ships the eastern star for the benefit of his health and the enlargement of his understanding he had no more idea that that voyage would culminate in a bed up a tree in the forests of madagascar than you reader have that you will ultimately become an inhabitant of the moon  the same remark may with equal truth be made of john hockins when he joined the eastern star as an able seaman and of james gingeralias ebonywhen he shipped as cook  if the captain of the eastern star had introduced those threewho had never seen each other beforeand told them that they would spend many months together among savages in the midst of terrestrial beauty surrounded by mingled human depravity and goodness selfdenial and cruelty fun and tragedy such as few men are fated to experience they would have smiled at each other with goodnatured scepticism and regarded their captain as a facetious lunatic  yet so it turned out though the captain prophesied it notand this was the way of it  becalmed off the coast of madagascar and having through leakage in one of the tanks run short of water the captain ordered a boat with casks to be got ready to go ashore for water  the young doctor got leave to land and take his gun for the purpose of procuring specimensfor he was something of a naturalistand having a ramble  dont get out of hail doctor said the captain as the boat shoved off  all right sir i wont  an take a couple o the men into the bush with you in case of accidents  ay ay sir responded mark waving his hand in acknowledgment  and that was the last that mark breezy and the captain of the eastern star saw of each other for many a day  who will go with me asked mark when the boat touched the shore  me massa eagerly answered the negro cook who had gone ashore in the hope of being able to get some fresh vegetables from the natives if any were to be found living there  seems to me deres no black mans here so mays well try de woods for wild wegibles  no no ebony said the first mate who had charge of the boat youll be sure to desert if we let you gounless we send hockins to look after you  hes the only man that can keep you in order  well ill take hockins also said mark you heard the captain say i was to have two men  will you go hockins  ay ay sir answered the seaman sedately but with a wrinkle or two on his visage which proved that the proposal was quite to his taste  all the men of the boats crew were armed either with cutlass or carbinein some cases with both for although the natives were understood to be friendly at that part of the coast it was deemed prudent to be prepared for the reverse  thus john hockins carried a cutlass in his belt but no firearm and the young doctor had his doublebarrelled gun with powderflask and shotbelt but ebonybeing a freeandeasy jovial sort of niggerwent unarmed saying he didnt want to carry no harms seein he would need all harms he had to carry back de fresh wegibles wid  thus those three went into the bush promising to keep well within earshot and to return instantly at the first summons  that summons camenot as a shout as had been expected but as a shot about an hour after the landing  our explorers ran to the top of a neighbouring mound in some surprise not unmixed with anxiety  before they reached the summit a volley from the direction of the sea followed by fierce yells told that some sort of evil was going on  another moment and they reached the eminence just in time to behold their boats crew pulling off shore while a band of at least a hundred savages attacked themsome rushing into the water chestdeep in order to seize the boat  cutlass and carbine however proved more than a match for stone and spear  the fight had scarce lasted a minute and our trio were on the point of rushing down to the rescue when a white cloud burst from the side of the eastern star the woods and cliffs echoed with the roar of a big gun and a shot plunging into the crowd of natives cut down many of them and went crashing into the bushes  it was enough  the natives turned and fled while the boat pulled to the ship  uncertainty as to what should be done kept mark breezy and his companions rooted for a few seconds to the spot  indecision was banished however when they suddenly perceived a band of thirty or forty natives moving stealthily towards them by a circuitous route evidently with the intention of taking them in rear and preventing them from finding shelter in the woods  it was the first time that the young students manhood had been put severely to the test  there was a rush of hot blood to his forehead and his heart beat powerfully as he saw and realised the hopelessness of their case with such tremendous odds against them  we can die but once he said with forced calmness as he cocked his gun and prepared to defend himself  is not agoin to die at all said the negro hastily tightening his belt is agoin to squatilate  and you said mark turning to the seaman  run says i of coorse replied hockins with something between a grin and a scowl ye know the old songhim wot fights an runs away may live to fight another day  come along then cried mark who felt that whether they fought or ran he was bound to retain the leadership of his little party  as we have seen they ran to some purpose  no doubt if they had started on equal terms the lithe hardy and almost naked savages would have soon overtaken them but fortunately a deep gully lay between them and the party of natives who had first observed them  before this was crossed the fugitives were over the second ridge of rolling land that lay between the thick woods and the sea and when the savages at last got upon their track and began steadily to overhaul them the white men had got fairly into the forest  still there would have been no chance of ultimate escape if they had not come upon the footpath down the precipice which we have described as having been partly carried away by falling rocks thus enabling hockins and his companions to make a scramble for life which no one but a sailor a monkey or a hero would have dared and the impossibility of even attempting which never occurred to the pursuers who concluded as we have seen that the white men had been dashed to pieces on the rocks far below  whether they afterwards found out their mistake or not we cannot tell  the reasonlong afterwards ascertainedof this unprovoked attack on the boats crew was the old story  a party of godless white men had previously visited that part of the coast and treated the poor natives with great barbarity thus stirring up feelings of hatred and revenge against all white menat least for the time being  in this way the innocent are too often made to suffer for the guilty  we will now return to our friends in the tree    chapter three  describes the deed of an amateur matador and the work of a roughandready shoemaker  when the day began to break hockins awoke and his first impulse was to shout hold on  ebonys first action was to let go thereby bringing himself to the ground with an awful thud which would have told severely on any one less akin to indiarubber  for a few minutes mark breezy holding tight to his particular branch looked down at his companions yawned heavily and smiled a little then a sudden impulse of memory caused him to look grave  come he said dropping lightly from his perch these natives may have been searching for us all night and are perhaps nearer than we suppose  i vote that we push on at once  agreed said hockins stretching himself  no fear massa remarked the negro  if it wur moonlight dey might ave search but whar de nights am dark dey knows better  de niggahs in dis yer island hab got skins an eyes an noses  if dey was to go troo such woods in de dark dey hab no skins or eyes or noses in de mornin leaswise nuffin wuth mentionin  cause why  deyd all git knocked into a sorter mush  plenty ob time for breakfast fore we start  thats true boy said hockins but wheres the breakfast to come from  what you no bringed nuffin in your pockits asked the negro with a look of visible anxiety on his expressive face  hockins turned his various pockets inside out by way of reply  i am equally destitute said mark  the negro groaned as he slowly drew from his breeches pockets two seabiscuits and a cold sausage  i meant dat he said as a light lunch for one yisterday  itll have to do dooty then as a heavy breakfast for three this morning ebony  come divide and lets have fair play  here massa said ebony handing the food to mark you divide i aint got de moral courage to do it fair  number one is too strong in me when is hungry  with a laugh at this candid admission the youth did his best at a fair division  in a few minutes the scanty meal was finished and the fugitives proceeded straight into the interior of the country at the utmost speed which was compatible with sustained exertion  they could see the faint outlines of a mountain range in the far distance and towards that they directed their steps knowing that in the event of sustained pursuit they had a much better chance of escaping among the rugged fastnesses of a mountain region than in the forests or on the plains  but they saw plainly that there was many a weary mile to traverse before the sheltering mountains could be reached  at first they walked rapidly and in silence one behind the othermark leadingbut as time passed and the danger of being overtaken decreased they fell more into line and began to talk of their plans and prospects  of course they thought about the eastern star and the possibility of her hanging about the coast in the hope of picking them up but as there was no certainty upon that point and a return to the coast would be like rushing into the very jaws of the lion from which they were fleeing they soon dismissed the idea as untenable  now then the question is sir wot are we agoin for to do said hockins  ay dats de question added ebony with much force and more than shakespearean brevity  well now lads said mark ive been thinking over that and it seems to me that theres not much to choose between  unfortunately i know uncommonly little about this islandnot that my geographical education has been neglected but the classbooks i have used did not give much information about madagascar  i know however that the mozambique channel which divides us from africa is a little too wide to swim  i also know that there is a capital somewhere near the middle of the island the name of which begins with an ant and ends with a rivo there are some syllables between i believe but how many is more than i can tell  theres a government in it however and a queen and some christian missionaries  now it strikes me that where theres a government a queen and christian missionaries there must be more or less of civilisation and safety so i would advise that we make straight for the capital  right you are sir said hockins  as i know nothin whotsomever about the place ill take my sailin orders from you captain an steer a straight course for antywhateversheisarivo where i hope well arrive oall alive o in the course o time  what say you ebony  is agreeable dont care much for nuffin when it dont trouble me but is gettin awful hungry an i dont see nuffin to eat in dis yer forestnot even fruitdough its pritty enough to look at  the scenery through which they were passing at the time was indeed more than pretty  it was gorgeous and would certainly have claimed more attention from the travellers had they been less anxious to advance and perhaps less hungry  by that timenear middaythey had got through the densest part of the woods and were come to a part where occasional openings in the foliage lighted them up  they had also discovered a narrow track or footpath which they gladly followed for although by so doing they ran the risk of coming suddenly upon natives who might be foes just as well as friends the comparative ease of travelling was too great to be neglected  this path struck over hill and down dale in a somewhat dogged and straightforward manner scorning to go round hillocks save when too precipitous for unwinged animals  at times it wound in and out among trees of great beauty and variety and of tropical aspect elsewhere it plunged into denser stretches of forest where the profusion of vegetable life was extraordinaryhere a dense undergrowth of shrubs treeferns and dwarfpalms there trees of higher growth and shooting high above them all the slender trunks of many varieties of palms whose graceful crowns and feathery leaves were pictured vividly on the blue sky  elsewhere innumerable creeping plants interlaced the branches producing a wild and beautiful network their tendrils crossing in all directions and producing a green twilight in places  the whole was enriched by orchids the abundant pink and white waxlike flowers of which contrasted well with other wildflowers innumerable and with many large and gorgeous flowering trees  different species of bamboos gave quite a peculiar aspect to the scenery in some places and still greater variety was secured by long pendant masses of feathery grey moss and lichens  some of the trees were of enormous height one palm with a straight stem in particular being estimated as not less than a hundred feet high to the spot where the leaves sprouted  tis a perfect paradise exclaimed mark stopping suddenly and looking around with admiration  yes massa murmured ebony with solemn looks if dere was ony a few wegiblescooked  flowers is all bery well to look at but we cant heat him  well if we cant eat we can at all events sleep returned mark i believe it is usually thought wise in tropical countries to cease work and rest about noon so as i feel rather tired ill have a snooze  what say you  no objection being made the party again climbed into the branches of a low spreading tree in order to avoid snakes scorpions or any other noxious creatures though they knew not at the time whether such existed on the island  in less than five minutes they were sound asleep  awaking after about two hours repose they descended wished for something to eat sighed put a bold heart on it tightened their belts to suit diminishing waists and continued their journey  perseverance is sure to be rewarded  if that is not a proverb it ought to be  at all events the perseverance of our travellers was rewarded at this time by their coming suddenly out of the woods into a wide grassy plain on which was browsing a herd of wild cattleat least they judged them to be wild from the fact of their being discovered in such a wild place and resolved to treat them as wild because of the wolves inside of them which clamoured so wildly for food  beef exclaimed hockins in some excitement as he pointed to the animal nearest to them which happened to be a black sleek fat young bull with slender limbs and fierce eyes  neber mind the wegibles massa shot un exclaimed ebony in an excited whisper as he turned his glaring eyeballs on his leader  hush dont speak returned mark drawing quietly back into coverfor the animal had not observed them  we must consult what is to be done because you know we have lost our powderflask the two charges in my gun are all i have got and these are only small shoti have no bullets  grave concern overspread the face of the sturdy seamanblank dismay that of the seacook  might as well blaze at the beast wi sand said hockins  or wid nuffin sighed ebony  nevertheless i will try said mark quickly  we shall be starved to death at this rate  yonder is a line of bushes that runs close out to the brute  ill stalk it  when close i will make a dash at it get as near as i can clap the muzzle against its ribs if possible andwell we shall see  you two had better stop here and look on  no massa said the negro firmly i go wid you  if you is to die we die togidder  what are you thinking of hockins asked the youth observing that the seaman stood staring at the ground with knitted brows as if in deep thought  ill go with you too he replied drawing his cutlass and feeling its point with his finger  you may need help  heave ahead sir  mark could not avoid smiling at the way in which this was said although he was sufficiently impressed with the hopelessness it might even be the danger of the attempt he was about to make  they found no difficulty in approaching to within about thirty yards of the animal being well concealed by the line of bushes before mentioned but beyond that point there was no cover  here therefore mark cocked his gun and gathered himself up for a rush and hockins drew his cutlass  so agile was our young doctor that he actually reduced the thirty yards to ten before the astonished bull turned to fly  another moment and the contents of both barrels were lodged in its flank  the effect was to produce a bellow of rage a tossup of the hindquarters and a wild flourish of the tail as the animal scurried away after the rest of the herd which was in full flight  poor breezy stopped at once with a feeling of mingled disgust and despair  ebony also stopped and looked with wide sympathetic eyes in his leaders face as though to say well massa yous done your best  but hockins ran on with persistent vigour although the creature was leaving him further behind at every stride  absurd murmured mark as he gazed at him  no use wassomiver said ebony  it did indeed seem as if the seamans exertions would prove abortive but something in the spirit of the wounded bull suddenly changed the aspect of affairs  whether it was the stinging pain of the small shot in its flank or the indignation in its breast that influenced it we cannot tell but in a moment it wheeled round with a furious roar and charged its pursuer  hockins stopped at once and his comrades fully expected to see him turn and run but our seaman was made of better stuff than they gave him credit for and the situation was not so new to him as they imagined in the course of his voyaging to many lands hockins had been to a bullfight in south america  he had seen with fascination and some surprise the risks run by the footmen in the arena he had beheld with mingled anger and disgust the action of the picadors who allowed their poor horses to be gored to death by the infuriated bulls and he had watched with thrilling anxiety not unmingled with admiration the cool courage of the matadors as they calmly stood up to the maddened and charging bulls and received them on the points of their swords stepping lightly aside at the same moment so as to avoid the dangerous horns  the seamans purpose now was to act the part of a matador  he knew that he possessed coolness and nerve sufficient for the deed he hoped that he had the skill he felt that hunger could no longer remain unsatisfied he feared that death by starvation might be the lot of himself and his companions and he preferred to meet death in actionif meet it he must  all things considered he resolved to face the bovine thunderbolt with unflinching front like a trueblue british tar  his coolness in the circumstances was evinced by the remarks muttered to himself in a growly tone as the bull approached  three futtthatll be enough  i dont rightly remember how near them mattydoors let him come before they putt their helms hard down an let him go by but i think three futtll do  this decision was barely reached when the bull was upon him with lowered head and erect tail  it was an awful rush but hockins stood like a rock with the cutlass pointed  at the prearranged moment he stepped to one side but instead of letting the momentum of the animal do the work he could not resist the impulse to drive the cutlass deeper into the bulls neck  the result was that though he escaped the creatures horn by a very narrow shave the cutlass was wrenched violently from his grasp and he was sent head over heels upon the plain  seeing this mark and the negro ran to the rescue the one howling like a maniac the other clubbing his gun but their aid was not required for the work of the amateur matador had been effectively done  after receiving the deadly thrust the bull plunged forward a few paces and then fell dying upon the ground while hockins got up and began to feel himself all over to make sure that no bones were broken  it need scarcely be told that they rejoiced greatly over their success and that they cut off some of the flesh immediately with which they returned to the forest to enjoy a muchneeded meal  we must kindle a fire now said mark stopping at an open space in the midst of a very secluded spot at the foot of a magnificent palmtree you see im not prepared to act like a cannibal or eskimo and eat the meat raw  there wont be much fear now said hockins especially if we make the fire of dry wood an keep it small  just look at that doctor  he held out his cutlass for inspection  it had been seriously bent in the recent encounter  aint that a cryin shame to the owners now to send us poor fellows to the eastern seas where we may meet pirates any day with tin cutlashes like that  you kin put him straight de next bull you kills said ebony as he prepared some touchwood youve ony got to stick im on the left side an hell twis it all right  now massa is ready bring de gun an snap de flints ober dat  hockins straightened his weapon between the branches of a tree his comrades managed to capture a spark in a mass of dry combustibles which soon burst into a flame  as the seaman had recommended only the driest wood was used and just enough of that to enable them to halfroast what food they required  then they returned to the carcass of the bull and cut off a large quantity of meat using the cutlass as well as their claspknives in the operation  cut the meat in thin slices said mark breezy when they began this work  why you so ticklar massa asked ebony  is fond o tick slices wen hims not too tough  because then we can dry the meat in the sun or over a slow fire and so be able to keep it longer without spoiling  we must spend the night here for the purpose and perhaps part of tomorrowwhy hockins what are you about  makin a pair o shoes sir you see them old dancin pumps as i left the ship with wouldnt hold out another day o this rough travellin so im makin a noo pair of shoes when ive got the chance  they will be a primitive pair observed mark  if that means a good pair youre right sir  they are after the pattern first made by adam for eveleaswise its supposed her first pair o dancin pumps was made this fashion  ill make a simlar pair for you sir wen your boots give out  in case the reader should ever be reduced to extremities in the matter of footgear we may explain the seamans method  selecting what he believed to be the thickest part of the bulls hide he cut off a small portion about eighteen inches square  spreading this on the ground with the hair upwards he planted his naked foot on it and marked the shape thereon  then with his knife he cut away the hide all round the footmark at four inches or so from the outline of the foot next he bored little holes all round the margin through which he ran a line or lace also made of raw hide  then planting his foot again in the middle of the hide he drew the line tight causing the edges to rise all round the foot and almost cover it  there you are sir he said stretching out his limb and admiring the contrivance roughanready you see but soon finished  it aint recorded in ancient history what eve said when adam presented her wi the little testimonial of his affection but if i might ventur a guess i should opine that she said puckery  hm  dey aint a tight fit observed ebony  is ob opinion dat your corns are quite safe in em  having completed his shoemaking work the ingenious seaman assisted his companions to prepare the dried meat which they afterwards tied up in three convenient little parcels to be slung on their backs  that night they found a more commodious tree to sleep in  under the pleasant influence of a good supper they enjoyed unbroken rest and awoke the following morning greatly refreshed  they were thus both physically and mentally prepared for the events of that day to which as they afterwards had a most important bearing on their fortunes in the island we will devote a separate chapter    chapter four  the doctor finds unexpected work in the wilderness and a mysterious stranger is introduced  it has been said that the travellersfor we cannot now appropriately style them fugitiveshad reached a more open country and that hockinss fight with the wild bull had taken place on the margin of a wide grassy plain  this plain however was limited  in front of them the scenery was undulating and beautifully variedalmost parklike in its character and only in one directionto the rightdid it extend like a sea of waving grass to the horizon  behind them lay the dense forest through which they had passed  the forest also curved round to their left and stretched away apparently unbroken on to still faroff mountains  after they had breakfasted packed their dried meat and sallied forth on the journey of another day they walked in silence until they reached the edge of the plain where there was room to walk abreast  now comrades said mark breezy we will go to the top of yon mound see how the land lies and hold a council of war  just so capn take our bearins an lay our course assented hockins  they soon reached the spot and found the view from it unexpectedly beautiful  the whole landscape was clothed with tropical verdure  past the foot of the mound ran a considerable stream which opened out into a series of lakelets in the hollows beyond the waters of which seemed to be the home of considerable numbers of wildfowlbut there was no sign of the presence of man  strange said mark in a low voice that such a lovely scene should have been created a solitude with no one to profit by or enjoy it  well now sir remarked the sailor dee know that same thought has puzzled me now an again for although my purfession is the sea ive travelled a good bit on the landspecially in south americaand ive seen miles on miles o splendid country that made me think of adam an eve in paradise with never a soul as you say to make use of or enjoy it  ive often wondered what it was all made for  dont you tink said ebony with his head a little on one side and his earnest eyes betraying the sincerity of his nature dont you tink dat praps de ducks an geese an sitchlike makes use ob an enjoys it to say nuffin oh de beasts hinsects an fishes  you may be right ebony returned hockins with an approving nod we human beings is apt to think too much of ourselves  moreover it has come into my mind that great britain was a solitood onceor much about itan its anything but that now so mayhap them lands will be swarmin wi towns an villages some day or other  what dee think doctor  but the young doctor said nothing for while his companions were thus indulging in speculations he was anxiously considering what course they should pursue  you see comrades he said turning to them abruptly if we go to the right and traverse this fine country we may very likely fall in with villages but the villagers may be savages like those we met on the coast  on the other hand if we go to the left we shall have to traverse the somewhat dark and difficult forests but then we shall be making for the mountains and tablelands of the interior and as the capital antant  antyallaliveo suggested hockins  no s not dat  it ends wid arrive o wich is just what we wants  well whatever may be its name i know that it is in the centre of the island somewhere and the centre of any land always means the mountains so i think we had better decide to go to the left and  hallo look yonder sir said hockins pointing towards a low cliff which rose in front of them not a quarter of a mile from the spot where they stood  turning in the direction indicated they observed a man running swiftly as if in pursuit of something  they could see that he was clothed and that he carried several spears from which they judged that he was a hunter  coming to the foot of the cliff before mentioned the man ascended the face of it with wonderful agility and had almost gained the top when a treacherous root or stone gave way causing him to lose his hold and roll violently to the bottom  poor fellow hes killed cried mark running towards the fallen hunter who lay on the ground motionless  he was not killed however though stunned and bleeding profusely from a deep wound in the arm caused by one of his own spears while in the act of falling  when the three strangers suddenly appeared the hunter grasped one of the spears and made a vigorous attempt to rise evidently under the impression that he was about to be attacked but the fall and the loss of blood were too much for him  he sank back with a groan yet there was a look of quiet dignity about him which showed that he gave way to no craven spirit  our young doctor kneeling down beside him proceeded at once to staunch the wound and bind up the arm with his pockethandkerchief  while he was thus engaged hockins brought some water from a neighbouring stream in a cup which he had extemporised out of a piece of bark and applied it to the mans lips  ebony stood by with a look of profound pity on his face ready for whatever might be required of him  the hunter showed by the expression of his handsome brown features that he was grateful for these attentions  yet at the same time there seemed to be something of perplexity if not surprise in his looks as he gazed on the white mens faces  but he did not utter a word  when the dressing of the arm was completedof course in a most businesslike mannerhe again attempted to rise but was so weak from loss of blood that he fell back fainting in the doctors arms  this is a most awkward business said mark as he laid the man carefully on the ground and put a bundle of grass under his head for a pillow  it behoves us to push on our journey without delay yet it will never do to leave him here alone and we cant very well take him on with us  what is to be done  both hockins and the negro looked their incapacity to answer that question  just then the answer came in the form they least expected for a sound of many voices in clamorous talk suddenly broke on their ears  the speakers whoever they might be were still distant and the formation of the ground prevented our travellers being seen by them  savages exclaimed mark and hockins in the same breath  hide cried ebony with a roll of his huge eyes as he suited the action to the word and leaped into the bushes  the others followed his example and running about a hundred yards back into the woods climbed into the branches of a lofty tree from which outlook well screened by leaves they saw a band composed of some hundreds of natives walking smartly over the open plain  from the manner of their approach it was evident that they searched for some one and as they made straight for the cliff where the wounded man lay it seemed probable that they were following up his trail  were done for said mark in a tone of despair as he noted this  why dee think so doctor asked hockins who did not by any means seem to take such a gloomy view of their case  dont you see  savages can follow up peoples trails almost as well as dogs  theyll easily trace us to the foot of this tree by our footprints and then theyve only to look up  thats true  i had forgotten that  deres time to drop down yit massa and squatilate suggested the negro excitedly  mark shook his head  might as well try to run from tigers as from savages he returned unless youve got a good start  but they aint all savages sir whispered hockins as the band drew nearer  some o the naked black fellows look savage enough no doubt but theres a lot of em lightish brown in the skin an clothed in fine though queer garments  they carry themselves too like gentlemen praps wed better go forard an trust them  trust to em ockins said ebony with a decided shake of the head trust men wid brown faces  nebber  the whispered conversation ceased at this point for a loud shout of surprise mingled with alarm was raised as the band came to the foot of the cliff and found what appeared to be the dead body of the wounded man  evidently they were friends for while some of them kneeled down beside the injured hunter to examine him others gave way to gestures and exclamations of grief  presently the watchers observed that one of those who kneeled beside the body looked up with a smile and a nod of satisfaction as he pointed to his chest  theyve discovered that hes not dead said mark  yes massa an deyve diskivered de bandaged arm  ay an it seems to puzzle em added the seaman  it did more than puzzle them  they had not observed it at first because just before running into the woods mark had covered it with a loose shawla sort of linen plaidwhich the man had worn round his shoulders  when they removed this and saw the bandage which was wound round the limb in the most careful and perfect manner they looked at each other in great surprise then they looked solemn and spoke in low tones glancing round now and then with saucerlike eyes as if they expected to see something frightful  i do believe doctor whispered the seaman that they think your work has been done by a goblin of some sort  it would indeed seem as if some such idea had entered the minds of the band for instead of examining the ground for footprints and following them upas was natural to have donethey silently constructed a litter of branches covered it with some of their garments and quietly bore the wounded and still unconscious man away in the direction of the plains  with thankful hearts our travellers slid to the ground and hurried off in the opposite direction towards the mountains  that night they came to a deeplyshaded and rugged piece of ground in the heart of the forest where there were caverns of various sizes  here the solitude seemed to be so profound that the fear of pursuit gradually left them so they resolved to kindle a cheerful fire in one of the caves cook a good supper and enjoy themselves  finding a cave that was small dry and well concealed they soon had a bright fire blazing in it round which they sat on a soft pile of branchesmark and hockins looking on with profound interest and expectation while the negro prepared supper  if i only had a quid o baccy now said hockins id be as happy as a king  i have the advantage of you friend for i am as happy as a king without it said the young doctor  well theres no denyin returned the seaman that you have the advantage o me but if i only had the baccy id enjoy my disadvantage praps theres a bit left in some corner o  he plunged his hands into each pocket in his garments one after another but without success until he came to the left breastpocket of his coat  when he had searched that to its deepest recesses he stopped and looked up with a beaming countenance  ho got im asked ebony with interest  hockins did not reply but slowly and tenderly drew forthnot a quid buta little piece of brown wood about five or six inches long  a penny whistle exclaimed mark  speak with reverence doctor returned the sailor with a quiet smile it aint a penny whistle its a flageolet  i stuck it here the last time i was amoosin the crew o the eastern star an forgot i hadnt putt it away  wait a bit you shall hear  saying this hockins put the tiny instrument to his lips and drew from it sounds so sweet so soft so melodious and tuneful that his companions seemed to listen in a trance of delight with eyes as well as with ears  splendid exclaimed mark enthusiastically when the sailor ceased to play  why hockins i had no idea you could play like that  of course i knew that you possessed musical powers to some extent for i have heard the tooting of your flageolet through the bulkheads when at sea but two or three inches of plank dont improve sweet sounds i suppose  ho massa didnt i tell you tree or four times dat he play mos awrful well  true ebony so you did but i used to think your energetic praise was due to your enthusiastic disposition and so paid no attention to your invitations to go forard an listen  well i confess i was a loser you must have played the instrument a long time surelyturning to the seaman  yes ever since i was a small boy  my father played it before me and taught me how to finger it  he was a splendid player  he used sometimes to go to the back of the door when we had a small blowout an astonish the company by playin up unexpectedly  he was great at scotch tunesspecially the slow ones like this  he put the little instrument to his lips again and let it nestle as it were in his voluminous beard as he drew from it the pathetic strains of wanderin willie to the evidently intense enjoyment of ebony who regarded music as one of the chief joys of lifenext perhaps to cooking  but mark and ebony were not the only listeners to that sweet strain just outside the mouth of the cave there stood a man who to judge from the expression of his face was as much affected by the music as the negro  though he stood in such a position as to be effectually screened from the view of those within a gleam of reflected light fell upon his figure showing him to be a tall handsome man in the prime of life  he was clothed in what may be styled a mixed european and native costume and a gun on which he rested both hands seemed to indicate him a hunter he carried no other weapon except a long knife in his girdle  the mixed character of his garb extended also to his blood for his skin though dark and bronzed from exposure was much lighter than that of most natives of the island and his features were distinctly european quiet gravity was the chief characteristic of his countenance and there was also an expression of profound sadness or pathos which was probably caused by the music  when hockins finished his tune the three friends were almost petrified with astonishmentnot unmingled with alarmas they beheld this man walk coolly into the cave rest his gun on the side of it and sit gravely down on the opposite side of the fire  the first impulse of our three friends of course was to spring up but the action of the man was so prompt and withal so peaceful that they were constrained to sit still  dont be alarmed  i come as a friend  may i sit by your fire  he spoke in good english though with a decidedly foreign accent  you are welcome since you come as a friend said mark though i must add that you have taken us by surprise  well now stranger said hockins putting his musical instrument in his pocket how are we to know that you are a friendexcept by the cut o your jib which i admit looks honest enough and your actions which we cant deny are peaceable like  the seaman put this question with a halfperplexed halfamused air the stranger received it without the slightest change in his grave aspect  you have no other means of knowing he replied except by my jib and my actions  dats a fact anyhow murmured ebony  who are you and where do you come from asked mark  i am an outlaw and i come from the forest  thats plainspeakin an no mistake said hockins with a laugh an deserves as plain a return  we cant say exactly that we are outlaws but we are outanouters an were going through the forest totoantyallaliveo or some such namethe capital you know  antananarivo suggested the outlaw  thats it  thats the namei couldnt recall said mark quickly we are going there if we can only find the way  i know the way returned the outlaw and my reason for coming here is to offer to show it you  indeed  but how came you to know our intentions and what makes you take so much interest in us asked mark with a look of suspicion  my reason for being interested in you returned the stranger is a matter with which you have nothing to do  how i came to know your intentions it is easy to explain for i have followed you from the seacoast step by step  i saw you escape from the savages saw you frightened out of the cave by my friends the outlaws who dwell in it followed you while you traversed the forest listened to your conversations witnessed your exploit with the bull and observed you when you helped and bandaged the wounded native  it would be difficult to describe the looks or feelings with which the three friends received this information  ebonys eyes alone would have taken at least halfanhour of the pencil to portray  butbutwhy stammered mark  never mind the why continued the outlaw with a pleasant look  you see that i know all about youat least since you landedand i also know that you have been several times in unseen danger from which i have shielded you  now you have arrived at a part of the forest which is swarming with brigands into whose hands you are sure to fall unless i am with you  i therefore come to offer myself as your guide  will you have me  it seems to me returned mark with something of scorn in his tone that we have no choice for you have us at your mercywe cannot refuse  i suppose you are the brigand chief and are guarding us for some sinister purpose of your own  i said not that i was a brigand returned the stranger quietly i said i was an outlaw  what else i am and my motives of action i choose not to tell  you say trulyi have you in my power  that is one reason why i would befriend you if you will trust me  the outlaw rose up as he spoke  there was such an air of quiet dignity and evident sincerity in the man that mark was strongly impressed  rising promptly he stretched his hand across the fire saying we will trust you friend even though we were not in your power  the outlaw grasped the youths hand with a gratified look  now he added as he took up his gun i will go  in the morning at daybreak i will return  sleep well till then  with something like a courtly salute the mysterious stranger left them and disappeared into the depths of the forest    chapter five  the outlaws friends  threatened danger curiously averted  as might be supposed the unexpected appearance of the outlaw as well as his sudden departure tended somewhat to interfere with the sleep which he had wished the travellers at parting and the night was far advanced before they grew tired of wondering who he could be speculating as to where he came from and commenting on his personal appearance  in short at the close of their discourse they came to the conclusion which was well embodied in the remark of ebony when he said its my opinion founded on obsarvashun dat if we was to talk an tink de whole night long we would come no nearer de troot so ill turn in  he did turn in accordingly and after exhausting the regions of conjecture the powers of speculation and the realms of fancy mark and hockins followed his example  one consequence of their mental dissipation was that they slept rather beyond the hour of daybreak and the first thing that recalled the two white men to consciousness was the voice of their black comrade exclaiming  ho hi hallo  i smells a smell  they lifted their three heads simultaneously and beheld the outlaw sitting calmly beside the fire roasting steaks  for the first time the mysterious stranger smiledand it was a peculiarly sweet halfgrave sort of attractive smile as far removed from the fiendish grin of the stage bandit as night is from day  i knew you would be hungry and guessed you would be sleepy he said in a deep musical voice so i have prepared breakfast  are you ready  ready repeated hockins rising with a mighty yawn and stretching himself as was his wont i just think we are  leastwise i am  good luck to ee mister outlaw what have ee got there  beef marrowbones and rice replied the man  you may call me samuel if you like  it was my fathers first name but im best known among my friends as ravoninohitriniony  well that is a jawbreaker exclaimed hockins with a laugh as they all sat down to breakfast  ravowhat did ee say  better not try it till arter breakfast suggested ebony  couldnt we shorten it a bit said mark beginning to consult a marrowbone  what say you to the first halfravonino  as you please replied the outlaw who was already too much absorbed with steaks to look up  not a bad notion said hockins  saml ravoninoive heerd wuss anyhow its better than the entire complicationeh ebony  mush better assented the negro deres no use wotsomediver for de hitrihitrifolderolony bit of it  now ockins fair play wid de marrowbones  hand me anoder  is it far mr ravonino asked mark from here to the capitalto antananarivo  you cleared im that time doctor murmured hockins wiping his mouth with a bunch of grass which he carried as a substitute for a pockethandkerchief  yes it is a long way said the outlaw many days journey over mountain and plain  and are you going to guide us all the way there  no not all the way  you forget i am an outlaw  it would cost me my life if i were to appear in antananarivo  mark was on the point of asking why but remembering the rebuff of the previous night forbore to put questions relative to his new friends personal affairs  indeed he soon found that it was useless to do so for whenever he approached the subject ravonino became so abstracted and deaf that no reply could be drawn from him  as if to compensate for this however the man was exceedingly communicative in regard to all other subjects and there was a quiet urbanity in his manner which rendered his conversation exceedingly attractive  moreover to the surprise of mark this mysterious stranger gave evidence of a considerable amount of education  he also gratified hockins by his evident delight in the flageolet and his appreciation of nautical stories and lingo while he quite won the heart of ebony by treating him with the same deference which he accorded to his companions  in short each of our travellers congratulated himself not a little on this pleasant acquisition to the partythe only drawback to their satisfaction being their inability to reconcile the existence of such good qualities with the condition of an outlaw  however remarked hockins after a long talk with his comrades on this subject when ravonino was absent its none of our business what hes bin an done to other people  what weve got to do with is the way he behaves to us dee see  hes a trump said ebony with a nod of decision  i agree with you said mark and i only wish he was a little more communicative about himself  however we must take him as we find him and try to win his confidence  during the whole of that first day their guide conducted them through such intricate and evidently unfrequented parts of the forest that their advance was comparatively slow and toilsome but being young and strong and wellfed they did not mind that  in fact mark breezy enjoyed it for the wilder and more tangled the scenery was through which they forced their way the more did it accord with the feelings of romance which filled him and the thought too of being guided through the woods by an outlaw tended rather to increase his satisfaction  are all the roads in your island as bad as these he asked after plumping up to the knees in a quagmire out of which he scrambled with difficulty  no many of them are worse and some better answered the guide but i keep away from them because the queens soldiers and spies are hunting about the land just now  oho thought mark i begin to see you are a rebel  then aloud your country then is governed by a queen  misgoverned returned ravonino in a tone of bitterness which however he evidently tried to restrain  fearing to tread again on forbidden ground mark forbore to put questions about the guides objections to his queen but simply asked her name and if she had reigned long  her name said ravonino is ranavalona  she has reigned for twentyseven yearstwentyseven long and weary years  i was a little boy when she usurped the throne  now my sun has reached its meridian yet she is still there a blight upon the land  but god knows what is best  he cannot err  this was the first reference that ravonino had made to the creator and mark was about to push his inquiries further when a confused sound of voices was heard not far in advance of them  ravonino who had been walking with an easy nonchalant air ahead of the party on a very narrow footpath suddenly stopped to listen with a look of anxiety  a moment later and he entered the bush that fringed the path and overhung it  come he said in a low voice follow me close  without a word of explanation he strode into the dense undergrowth through which he went with the agility of a panther and the sinuosity of a serpent  the others being as we have said very active and strong kept close at his heels though not without difficulty  coming at last to a place where the shrubbery was so intertwined that it was impossible to see more than a yard or two in advance they suddenly found themselves stopped by a sheer precipice  only for a few seconds however was their progress arrested while their guide turned to explain  there is another and an easier way to the place i am making for but it is much longer and more exposed  i take for granted that you have strong arms and steady heads but if not speak out for i would not lead you into danger  lead on said mark promptly wherever you go we will follow  with something like an amused twinkle of the eye ravonino began to climb up the face of the precipice holding on to roots and ropelike creepers like a monkey  if this here sort o cordage was only a bit more taut i wouldnt mind it so much growled hockins as he lost his footing at one place and swung off the face of the precipiceholding on to a stout creeper however with seamanlike grip and coolness  he quickly caught hold of another creeper and drew himself again into comparative safety  a minute later and they all stood on a ledge high up on the face of the cliff and close to what appeared to be the mouth of a cavern  look there said their guide pushing aside the bushes which overhung the cliff in all directions  they looked and through the opening beheld a band of men moving in single file along the track they had just left  they were most of them nearly naked with only short calico breeches which did not quite reach to their knees but all had muskets on their shoulders and crossbelts on their dark bodies one of which belts sustained apparently a cartridgebox the other a bayonet  their own thick hair was all the cap they wore excepting two or three men of superior rank who wore cloths wrapped in turban fashion on their heads and a voluminous plaidlike garment on their shoulders  these carried swords instead of muskets  the soldiers of the queen said ravonino in answer to mark breezys look  they are out hunting  what do they hunt for asked mark  men and women  by which i suppose you mean rebels  no they are not rebels they are the queens most loyal subjects  but loyal subjects do not usually fly from their rulers objected mark  true but loyal subjects sometimes fly from tyranny returned the guide  come i will introduce you to some fugitives from tyranny  he turned as he spoke and led the way into the cave before mentioned profound darkness did not prevent his advancing with a firm unhesitating step  as he led mark by the hand hockins and ebony held on to him and to each other and had no difficulty in following  presently they came to a wooden obstruction which proved to be a door  voices in conversation were heard on the other side of it  a knock from the guide produced sudden silence  another knock drew from those within an exclamation of surprise and next moment the heavy door swung open on creaking hinges  yes it is ravoninohitriniony  i knew his knock  he is come exclaimed a girlish voice as a pair of arms were seen dimly to encircle the guides neck  of course the girl spoke in the native tongue which was quite incomprehensible to our travellers but if we are to enlighten our readers we must needs translate as we go along  my sister raruth said the guide presenting her to his new friends she was a lady in the palace of the queen once  now she is an outlaw like myselfhas fled from tyranny and perhaps death  all in this cave are in the same casefugitives from our tyrant queen  they reached the interior of the place as he spoke and ravonino pointing to a bundle of dried ferns bade his companions rest there until he had explained some private matters to the people  nothing lothfor they were all somewhat fatigued by their recent exertionsour travellers flung themselves on what proved to be a luxurious couch and observed what went on around them  truly it was a strange scene romantic enough even to satisfy the longings of mark breezy  the cavern itself was a curious one being in the form of a vast hall with three smaller chambers opening out of it  the central hall seemed to have no roof for although brightly lighted by several torches fixed to its rugged walls the upper part was lost in profound obscurity  this strange abode was peopled by a considerable number of men and womennatives of the islandwho from the variety in their costume features and complexion evidently belonged to different tribes  some were strong tall and rather harshfeatured others were more slender in build and with refined countenances  a few were almost black others of a light olive colour and several made that approach to whiteness of skin which in england is known as brunette  all were more or less characterised by that quiet gentleness and gravity of demeanour which one is accustomed to associate with humbly borne misfortune  it was evident from the appearance of the large chamber that its inhabitants were associated in groups or families spaces being marked off by an arrangement of logs and household goods etcetera as if to indicate the habitation of each group and from certain indications in the smaller chambers it was equally evident that these had been apportioned as the sleepingplaces of the females  a larger space at the end of the cave opposite to that on which mark and his comrades reclined seemed to be a general meetingplace  to this spot it was that ravonino went leading his little sister raruth by the hand and followed by all the inmates of the place who were eager to know what news he had brought  that the news was the reverse of good soon became evident from the bowed heads and frequent sighs with which it was received  of course our travellers could make no use of their ears but they made the best use of their eyes and were deeply interested in the expressions and actions of the various members of the group who successively spoke after the guide had told his story  poor little raruth whose age might have been about seventeen was not one of the speakers  she was evidently a timid as well as a pretty little creature for she clung to and nestled against her stout brothers arm while he was speaking and hid her face now and then in the masses of her luxuriant brown hair  close to her sat a young woman whose appearance and manner formed a striking contrast  she was much darker in complexion but her features were of classical beauty and her air calm and selfpossessed  when she had occasion to speak she arose displaying a tall elegantlyformed figure which moved with queenlike dignity while she gesticulated with graceful animation and frequently pointed upwards as if appealing to god  when she was speaking raruths timidity seemed to vanish for she shook back her hair and fixed her eyes on the others face with a gaze that told of ardent love as well as admiration  the next who spoke was a young man who in face and figure so strongly resembled the last speaker that it was impossible to resist the conclusion that they were brother and sister  there was the same tall commanding figure of course on a larger scale the same noble cast of feature and the same dignified mien  but in the man more than in the woman there was an air of gentle modesty which contrasted well with his powerful frame  he did not gesticulate much in speaking and judging from the brevity of his speech he had not much to say but what he said was listened to with profound respect by all  after this youth several others took part in the debate  then they all stood up and to the surprise of their visitors began to singvery sweetlyan old familiar hymn  it minds me o home whispered hockins scarce able to restrain the tears that filled his eyes  the hymn was nearly finished when a rushing sound and a subdued cry were heard to issue from a dark passage the mouth of which was close to the couch of our travellers  the singing ceased instantly  next moment a man rushed into the chamber with labouring breath and flashing eyes springing towards ravonino he spoke several words eagerly at the same time pointing in the direction of the passage just referred to  lights out and silence cried the guide authoritatively in the native tongue  another moment and the cave was in total darkness and a silence so profound reigned there that the three visitors could hardly persuade themselves the whole affair was not a strange dream  the voice of ravonino however soon dispelled that idea  be still whispered the guide laying his hand on marks shoulder our foes have discovered our retreat  theres a lot of stout fellows here returned mark also in a whisper we will help you if you have to fight  we may not fight replied ravonino softly  if it be gods will we must die  hush  they come  once more total silence prevailed in the cavern and the sound of distant voices could be heard  in a few minutes a tiny light was seen at the end of the dark passage  it gradually increased in size revealing a soldier who bore a torch  he advanced on tiptoe and with slightly scared looks into an outer cavern which formed a sort of vestibule to the large inner cave  the soldier was brave no doubt and would have faced an army in the field but he was extremely superstitious and advanced with a palpitating heart the torch held high above his head and eyes glancing nervously from side to side  a crowd of comrades similarly affected more or less followed the torchbearer and pushed him on  nothing here said the leading man of course in malagasy  let us be gone then said one of his comrades  no observed a third who seemed bolder than the rest perhaps there is another cave beyond pointing to the dark passage through which though unseen mark and his companions with the guide were gazing anxiously at their foes  give me the torch  the soldier seized the light and advanced quickly towards the opening another minute and all must have been revealed  a feeling of despair took possession of ravoninos breast and he gave vent to an involuntary sigh  the sound reached the ear of the soldier with the torch and for a moment arrested him but thinking probably that the sound was in his imagination he again advanced  the case was now desperate  just then a gleam of light flashed into the mind of hockins  next moment to the consternation of his comrades and the guide a strain of the sweetest music floated softly in the air  the soldiers stood stillspellbound  it was not an unfamiliar air for they had often heard the hated christians sing it but the sweet liquidwe might almost say tinytones in which it was conveyed were such as had never before reached their ears or even entered their imaginations  it was evident from their countenances that the soldiers were awestricken  the seaman noted this  he played only a few bars and allowed the last notes of his flageolet to grow faint until they died away into absolute silence  for a minute or two the soldiers stood rooted to the spot gazing up into the roof of the cave as if expecting a renewal of the sounds  then they looked solemnly at each other  without uttering a word they turned slowly round retreated on tiptoe as they came and finally disappeared  we need hardly say that the astonishment of the people in the cave at the mode of their deliverance from the threatened danger was intense  when the torches were relighted the men and women assembled round ravonino with looks little less solemn than those of the soldiers who had just taken their departure  surely said the handsome young man whom we have already introduced surely god has wrought a miracle and sent an angels voice for our deliverance  not so laihova replied ravonino with a slight smile  we are too apt to count everything that we fail to understand a miracle  god has indeed sent the deliverance but through a natural channel  yet we see not the channel ravoninohitriniony said laihovas queenlike sister ramatoa  true ramatoa  nevertheless i can show it to you  come hockins he added in english clear up the mystery to them  thus bidden our seaman at once drew forth the little instrument and began to play the hymn they had just been singing with the air of which as we have said he chanced to be well acquainted  it would be hard to say whether surprise or pleasure predominated in the breasts of his audience  at last the latter feeling prevailed and the whole assembly joined in singing the last verse of the hymn which appropriately terminated in praise ye the lord  but our retreat is no longer safe said ravonino when the last echo of their thanksgiving had died away  we must change our abodeand that without delay  get ready  by the first light of morning i will lead you to a new home  these soldiers will not return but they will tell what they have seen and others less timorous will come here to search for us  immediately the people set about collecting together and packing up what may be termed their household goods leaving the guide and their visitors to enjoy supper and conversation in their own corner of the cave    chapter six  the guide becomes communicative and tells of terrible doings  during the progress of supper which consisted of cold dried meat and rice the quartette seated on the ferns in the corner of the cave were unusually silent  mark breezy and ravonino continued to eat for some time without speaking a word  ebony although earnestly absorbed in victuals rolled his eyes about as he looked from time to time at his companions with unwonted solemnity and john hockins frowned at his food and shook his shaggy head with an air of dissatisfied perplexity  ravonino at length said the last looking up and using his grass pockethandkerchief it seems to me bein a plain straightforard sort o seaman that theres somethin not exactly fair an aboveboard in all them proceedins  of course its not for me to say what a independent man should do or say but dont you think that wen a man like you professes to be honest an asks other men to trust him he should at least explain some o the riddles that surround him  im a loyal man myself an ill stand up for my queen an country no matter what may be the circumstances in wich im placed so that wen i sees another man admittin that hes a outlaw an finds the soldiers of his queen ahuntin all about the country arter him and his comrades seems to me theres a screw loose somewheres  dats my sentments zactly said the negro with a decisive nod  mark took no notice of this speech but silently continued his supper for a few moments the guide did not speak or look up  then laying down his knife and clasping his hands over one of his knees he looked earnestly into the seamans face  you tell me you are loyal he said  hockins nodded  if your queen continued ravonino were to tell you to give up the service of god and worship idols would you do it  cernly not replied the seaman promptly for she has no right to rule over my soul  my duty to the king of kings stands before my duty to the queen of england  again the guide was silent for a few minutes  then he said  hockins by gods blessing you have saved the lives of all our party this dayat least it seemed so for another step and that soldier would have discovered us if your little pipe had not stopped him  you are therefore entitled to expect some gratitude and from what i have seen of you and your comrades i have reason to believe you will not betray us even if you get the chance  right you are friend i will never betray an honest man an i may speak for my comrades as well as self for theyre trueblue to the backbone  furder nor dat interposed ebony troobloo to de marrow  dont you shove in your oar till youre ordered you nigger  well as i was asayin well never betray honest men but i give you fair warnin if youre not honest well have nothin to do wi your secrets an if our duty to god an man requires us to go against you well do it without flinchin  so be it  i am satisfied returned ravonino calmly  i will tell you as much as i think you are entitled to know  it may have reached your ears perhaps that there has been terrible persecution in this island for many years  here mark breezy took up the conversation  no said he with something of a deprecatory air we did not know it for my part i am ashamed to say so but i will say in excuse that the british empire is widely extended in every quarter of the globe and her missions are so numerous that average men can scarcely hope to keep up with the details of all of the persecutions that occur  rumours indeed i have heard of doings in madagascar that vie with the persecutions of the scottish covenanters but more than this i know not though of course there are men connected with our missionary societies and many people no doubt interested in missionswho know all about the persecutions in madagascar  is it in connection with this that you have been outlawed  it is  ranavalona the bloodstained usurper our present queen is filled with such bitter hatred of christianity that she has for many years persecuted the native christians who have been taught by white missionaries from your land  hundreds of men and women have been murdered by her orders because they refused to forsake christ others have been banished to regions so unhealthy that they have died and many have been sold into slavery  the eyes of the guide gleamed for a moment and his stern countenance flushed as he thus referred to the sorrows of his people but by a strong effort he controlled his feelings and his countenance resumed its habitual quietude  my mother and my sister and i he continued were sold into slavery my mother was a native lady high in station and a member of the court of king radama the first who was very favourable to missionaries  i was an infant at that time my little sister was not born  my father was an english trader skilled in many handicrafts and a great favourite with the king who fostered the christian religion and helped those who came to teach us  our teachers learned our language taught us the love of god and through the power of the holy spirit brought many of us to the saviour  but they were persevering and wise as well as good  having learned our languagein which my father helped them muchthey taught us to read translated many parts of the word of god into our tongue sent home for presses and types and had these printed as well as the pilgrims progress and other books  peace joy and prosperity were spreading in our land  idolworship and cruel customs were being uprooted and everything was going well when the king diedwhether a christian or not who can tell for although favourable to he never professed christianity  the lord knoweth them that are his  the rightful heir to the throne according to our customs was rakotobea good young man who had been taught by the missionaries and was nephew to the king but ranavalona one of the kings wives resolved to seize the opportunity  a bold bad woman with a powerful will and no principle she carried her point by reckless bloodshed  there were men at court as bad as herself who agreed to aid her  when she boldly claimed the throne four loyal nobles asserted the claim of rakotobe  they were instantly speared in the palace  the rightful heir was not present  soldiers were sent to his residence to seize and kill him before he should hear of what was going on  not content with shedding blood the cruel monsters dug the poor youths grave before his eyes  when they were thus engaged rakotobe kneeled down to pray and while he was in this position they speared him and cast him into his grave  soon after the father and mother of rakotobe were murderedthe last being starved to death  the brother of radama was destroyed in like manner  he lingered eight days in agony before death came to his relief  then rakotobes grandmother and other relations were slain by ranavalonas orders and thus the murderess waded through blood to the throne of madagascar  think you continued the guide with a passing gleam of the anger which he strove to restrain think you that i owe allegiance to such a queen  truly ye do not answered the seaman stoutly  my only wonder is that the people suffer her to reign  scarce heeding the reply the guide continued with suppressed excitement but she did not rest content  it was in the year 1829 that she usurped the throne  since then she has persecuted the christians for more than a quarter of a century and at times blood has flowed like water in our land  bad as she is however she would have been worse but for her love to her son  ay the woman whose heart is a stone to most people is soft towards the young prince rakota in spite of the fact that this youth is favourable to the christians and has often stood between them and his mother  about nine years after the queens coronation my little sister was born and was secretly baptisedthe name of ruth being given to her it is our custom to prefix ra to many namesso she is raruth  look at her  he pointed to a group not faroff where the delicate and graceful girl was busily assisting an elderly woman in her packing arrangements  see you the lady beside her with the grey hair and the sad worn face  that is my mother  i have said she was high at the court of radama the first  she was young then  i was born the year that radama died  ranavalona was fond of her though she loved not her christianity so she continued at the palace  the queen also became very fond of my little sister when she began to grow to womanhood but raruth could not return the affection of one whose hands were stained so deeply with christian blood  i was an officer in the palace at the time but would gladly have left only my doing so might have roused the queens wrath against my father and mother  at last the missionaries were ordered to quit the capital  in 1849 a great persecution took place  the queen became furious because her people would not cease to love and serve jesus  she ordered many men and women to be speared and burned and tossed over precipices but all without avail because greater is he who is for us than all who can be against us  my father was away on a trading expedition at this time  one day in attempting to cross a lake he was drowned  the guides voice deepened as he went on he was a good loving father to me  he taught me nearly all i know and he was no mean scholar  he also sent me to the missionary schools  after his death the queen hardened her heart against us and as we refused to give up praying to god and singing his praise we were cast out of the palacemy mother and sister and i with several others among whom were laihova and his sister ramatoa  we were sold into slavery in the public market  our purchaser was cruel  he put us to the hardest menial work  we remained for several years with him  the health of my poor mother and sister began to give way  then he sold me to another man and we were separated  this was too much i suppose for the english blood in me to endure quietly  i made my escape  i went back to my old owner and in the night induced my mother and sister to fly  many persecuted christians have fled since then and are now hiding in dens and caves like hunted beasts  we soon found some of these in the depths of the forests and agreed to band together  they made me their leader and i brought them here where we have lived and worshipped god in peace but as you have seen we are liable to be captured at any moment  and if captured said mark would the queen really put you to death  i fear she would nay i am certain of it because one who recently escaped from antananarivo has just brought the news that the queen has been visited with a fresh burst of anger against the christians has thrown many into prison and sent out troops to scour the country in search of those who have fled  but if that is so said hockins earnestly whats the use o you riskin your life by goin with us to antantallaliveo  ill never git that name into my head  why not just sketch us out a rough chart o the island on a bit o bark give us the bearins o the capital an let us steer a straight course for it  ill be bound that well make our port easy enough  yes hockins speaks wisely added mark  it is very kind of you to take so much trouble for us but there is no need to run such great risk on our account  you do not consider replied ravonino that it is more difficult for sailors to cross the wild forest than to find their way on the trackless sea and you forget also that the way is long that madagascar is larger than great britain and ireland put together  there are many tribes too some of which are not so hospitable as others  you could not avoid the dangers of this wilderness easily without a guide  besides i do not mean to enter the capital  i will merely guide you to within sight of it and then leave you  fortunately you require no assistance from natives not being encumbered with this worlds goods  das troo ha haa cried ebony opening his portentous mouth and shutting his eyes weve got no luggidge  well we shall only be too glad of your company said mark with some feeling and we thank you most heartily for your disinterested kindness  my conduct is not altogether disinterested returned the guide  the truth is i had no intention at first of doing more than guiding you to the right pass in the mountains but since i have been with you my feelings have been modified and the news which we have just received hashas filled me with anxiety and raised in my mind the idea that that i may even make use of you  thats right exclaimed mark heartily im glad if there is the smallest chance of our serving you in any way  in what way can we do so  for some moments the guide displayed a degree of hesitancy which his friends had not before noticed in him  then he spoke slowly  well the truth is that i have a friend in the palace who is i have been told in great danger owing to the wrath of ranavalona  i thought that somehow perhaps you might give warning to this friend and say that samuel ravoninohitriniony is in the neighbouring forest and  here the guide stopped short and seemed to be in some perplexity  mark breezy whose young and romantic spirit was deeply stirred by the prospect of adventure which his words had opened up assured him with enthusiasm that whatever was possible for man to accomplish he might depend upon being at least vigorously attempted  to which assurance john hockins begged to putt the word ditto and the negro fervently added das some too  but how are we to find your friend asked mark seeing that we dont know him and have never seen him  my friend is not a man but aa woman a young girl said ravonino with the slightest possible symptom of confusion which opened the eyes of mark instantly and still further stirred his sympathies  ravonino he exclaimed suddenly grasping the guides hand treat me as a friend and trust me  you love this young girl  is it not so nay man dont be angry with me  i cant help sympathising  why i know something of youryouracondition myself  the morning i left england the very last person i said goodbye to was a fair young girl with golden hair and a rosebud mouth and such lovely blue  das right massa burst in ebony with a crow of admiration  it doos my bery heart good to see a man as is proud ob his sweetart  is got one too bress you but she aint fair  no shes black as de kitchen chimbly wid a bootiful flat nose a mout like a coalscuttle an such eyesoh  hold your tongue ebony  now am i not right ravonino  you are right answered the guide gravely yet without displeasure my rafaravavy is in danger and i must save her from this murderess at all hazards  it is right however to tell you that if you attempt to aid me you will encounter both difficulty and danger  dont mention that friend  no true man would shrink from either in a good cause said mark  but when must we set out on this expedition  by daybreak tomorrow  our new hidingplace is on our way so the change will not delay us and from what the fugitives have told us i hopeindeed i feel surethat the queen will do no further mischief for some weeks to come  but now comrades said the guide rising we must rest if we would work tomorrow  follow me  he led them into one of the side caves when the whole of the people followed as if by preconcerted arrangement  here a muchsoiled book in a leathern cover was produced  it was a portion of the bible in the malagasy language  a few verses were reverently read by the guide a brief earnest prayer was offered by a very old man a hymn was sung and then the people dispersed to their several sections of the cave finally the lights were extinguished and the place was left in silence and darkness profound    chapter seven  describes a meek mother and crocodileson  journey resumed and strange treatment of the king of the waters  dawn was still struggling to assert itself in the far east and the depths of the forest were still shrouded in almost midnight gloom when the strange band of outlaws emerged from their cave and led by ravonino went forth to search for a safer dwellingplace in the still more inaccessible fastnesses of the wilderness  they had not much difficulty in finding a suitable spot for the particular region to which they had fled from persecution was exceedingly wild and broken in form and abounded with concealed caverns having outlets in several directions so that pursuit and discovery were alike difficult  we may not delay here however to tell of their wanderings  like the christians of other lands and more ancient times they were hunted like wild beasts though their only crime was a desire to serve and worship god according to the dictates of their consciences  it is the old familiar story and comment is needless to those who understand it    mans inhumanity to man   makes countless thousands mourn  there is only one other member of the party of whom we will make mention just now because she appears again somewhat prominently in our tale this was a little elderly female who seemed utterly destitute of the very common human attribute of selfassertion and in whose amiable almost comical countenance one expression seemed to overbear and obliterate all others namely that of gushing goodwill to man and beast  those who did not know renimamba thought her an amiable imbecile  those who knew her well loved her with peculiar tenderness her modesty and selfabnegation were not so far as any one knew the result of principle  she was too unassertive to lay claim to principle we are not sure that she understood the meaning of principle  before christianity in its doctrinal form reached her she had only one source of discomfort in life and that was that in everything she failed  failed to do as much as she wanted to do for other people failed to express herself always as affectionately as she felt failed to avoid giving slight occasions of offence although she never never meant to do it  in short she was strange to say a victim to selfcondemnation  when the gospel of jesus came to her telling as it does that god is love that christ came to sweep away for ever the very sins that troubled her and that his holy spirit would fight for and in her so as to make her more than conqueror she caught it to her heart as the very thing she needed  she did not indeed condemn herself lessnay she rather condemned herself more than formerlybut the joy of being on the winning side of knowing that all sin was pardoned for his sake of feeling assured of progressive victory now and complete victory in the end thoroughly scattered her old troubles to the winds  her very name was characteristic  it is a common and curious custom in madagascar for parents sometimes to drop their own names and take the name of their eldest child with the word raini father of or reni mother of prefixed  now this amiable little elderly woman had been married young and it so happened that her husband was away on an expedition to the coast when the first and only son was born  one of the first things that the child did after opening its black eyes on this life was to open its uncommonly large mouth with the intention no doubt of howling  but circumstances apparently induced it to change its mind for it shut its mouth without howling  the effect of the gape on the mother was to remind her of one class of inhabitants of her native riversthe crocodileand cause her laughingly to style the child her young crocodile  the malagasy word for crocodile is mamba and thus the child came by his name with the usual prefix ramamba  after a time his mother became so proud of her young crocodile that she dropped her own name entirelycongenially as it were obliterated herselfand ever after was known as renimamba mother of the crocodile  at the time we write of mamba we will drop the ra was a stalwart handsome youth of over twenty with no resemblance whatever to his namesake except a goodlysized mouth and an amazing strength of appetite  need we say that his mothers gushing powers were expended upon him with the force of a norwegian millrace  it is gratifying to be able to add that the crocodile was keenly responsive  the father of little mambaandrianivohad returned to the capital soon after his sons birth  he was a man in good position among the aristocracy of the land and occupied a post of trust in the queens service  at that time the first great persecution of the christians had begun  it was known that andrianivo favoured the christians  on the question being put to him he frankly admitted that he was one of them he was therefore despoiled of all he possessed and banished into perpetual exile and slavery  he was sent in chains to a pestilential part of the island with the intention that toil and disease should end his life  so secretly and promptly was he spirited away that no one could tell the precise locality to which he had been banished  his heartbroken wife and child were also sold but were taken to a more healthy region where the child grew and became a stout boy his little mother meanwhile acting the part of a meek and faithful slave  she would probably have lived and died in this condition had not her stout son when he grew up resolved to become free  his mother had taught him what she knew of the christian religion  from ravonino he learned more and heard of the escaped christians who found a refuge in forests and mountains  finally he persuaded his mother to run away with him and thus it came about that we find them with the band of which ravonino was leaderlaihova being lieutenant of the band  an occasion for the display of his affectionate nature was afforded to mamba on the morning we write of  active as a kitten though middleaged renimamba was skipping from rock to rock in a very rugged part of their route when her foot slipping she fell and sprained her ankle badly  mamba was close to her  mother he exclaimed hurrying forward and raising her carefully why jump about like the squirrel  are you hurt  my son help me to rise  gently the youth lifted her and set her on her feet whereupon she sank down again with a little shriek and looked up with an expression of mingled humour and pain  my leg i think is broken said reni  for the sake of brevity we will drop the mamba  surely not mother it has been too tough and strong to break ever since i knew it  mamba spoke encouragingly nevertheless he examined the limb with anxious care  being ignorant of surgery his examination was not of much use but fortunately just then mark breezy who had lingered behind to gather some plants arrived on the scene  he found the injury to be a bad sprain and did the best he could for the poor woman in the circumstances  now we must carry her he said to the guide for she wont be able to walk for many days  on this being translated mamba gathered his mother up as if she had been a bundle of clothes or a baby and marched away with her  stop stop cried ravonino you cant carry her more than a few miles on such ground as i shall soon lead you over  we must arrange for her a filanzana  the guide here referred to the sort of palanquin used by travellers in a country where there were no roads  it consisted of a shallow oblong basket with light wooden framework filled in with plaited strips of sheepskin and hung between two light poles or bamboos  as several such machines were used by some of the party to carry their few household necessaries one of them was at once emptied and reni put therein by her affectionate son  four stout young men put the ends of the poles on their shoulders and the party once more advanced mamba walking by the side of the filanzana to be ready to assist in cases of difficulty or danger and to relieve the bearers occasionally  that afternoon they arrived at their new abodea large dry cavernthe entrance to which was not only well concealed on the face of a cliff in the heart of a dense jungle but so difficult of access that a mere handful of men might easily have maintained it against a host  here ravonino made no further delay than was necessary to see the party fairly settled  then he left them but not before receiving many an earnest and affectionate message to friends and kindred of the fugitives still at the capital but who had as yet managed to elude the vigilance and escape the malignity of queen ranavalona and her spies some of the women even wept as they bade the guide farewell saying that they felt sure he would at last fall a victim to the relentless fury of the queen and that they should see his face no more  with these the guide gently remonstrated  think you not he said that god is as able to protect me in antananarivo as here in the wilderness  i go because i think that duty calls me  i expect no miracle in my behalf  i will take all possible precautions  farewell  once more our three travellers found themselves advancing rapidly in single file through the forest with the guide in advance  before the sinking sun compelled them to encamp under the trees that night they had put many miles between them and the hidingplace of the outlawed christians  next day as they were about to resume their journey ravonino told them that about noon they would come to a large river on the other side of which there was a village where they could spend the night for the people and their chief were friendly  are they christians asked mark  noat least the most of them are not though there may be a few secret converts among them for this hot persecution at the capital has scattered the christians far and wide through the land so that the knowledge of the blessed gospel spreads  thus our god makes the wrath of man to praise him  the remainder of wrath he has promised to restrain  if he wills it otherwise are we not prepared to die at his bidding  many of our people have died already under the bloody reign of ranavalona the usurper  how many more shall perish who can tell  but how do it come about asked hockins that this here chief is friendly  because i had occasion to render him good service at one time and he is grateful  good  das allers de right way remarked ebony with an approving nod wen a mans grateful hes safeyous sure ob im  is dat de ribber you refur to jes now  he pointed to an opening among the trees ahead through which the sheen of water glittering in the sunlight could be seen  before the guide could reply a loud shout startled them and next moment they were surrounded by halfnaked savages who brandished their spears threateningly  quick as lightning according to a prearranged plan in case of sudden attack mark hockins and the negro stood backtoback facing in all directionsthe first with his gun advanced the seaman pointing his cutlass at the foe and ebony levelling a spear with which he had provided himself little would their courage have availed them however if ravonino had not been there for a flight of spears would have ended their resistance in a moment  voalavo your chief is my friend said the guide calmly without putting himself in an attitude of defence or showing the slightest symptom of alarm  is voalavo with you  voalavo comes they replied at once lowering their weapons and pointing in the direction of the river whence proceeded sounds as of the lowing of cattle  we have been to visit our enemies said one of the party who from his tones and bearing appeared to be a leader  we have smitten them and we have brought away their cattle  as he spoke another native was seen approaching  he was a large burly joviallooking man somewhere about forty years of age armed with a spear and enveloped in the native lamba a garment used much in the same way as the scottish plaid which it resembled in form though of much lighter material  the ornamentation of this garment proclaimed the wearer a person of distinction and the evident satisfaction that beamed on his broad jovial countenance when he recognised and greeted ravonino showed that it was voalavo himselfthe chief of the village they were approaching  im sorry to see said the guide after the first few words of salutation that my friend still delights in war and robbery  dont be sorry friend dont be sorry returned the chief with a hearty laugh as he gave the other a slap on the shoulder  sorrow does no good  it only puts water in the eyes and makes them red  look at mejust returned from war and robbery and as happy as a squirrel if a man does not delight in war and robbery what is there in the world to delight in  if i am not sorry why should you be  if you cant help itthen laugh at it and try to enjoy your sorrow  thats the way i do  it suits me  i grow fat on it  he certainly did grow fatif not on laughing at sorrow certainly on something elseand his followers although respectfully silent showed by their smiling faces that they sympathised with their chiefs hilarious mood  but where did you fall in with the white men asked voalavo turning suddenly towards mark and hockins who stood listening with interest and curiosity to the rapid flow of his unintelligible talk  such pale flowers do not grow in our forests  in a few words ravonino explained the history of our adventurers as far as he knew it and the chief on learning that they were his friends friends bade them welcome and shook hands heartily in the european fashiona mode of expressing friendship which had probably been learned from the missionaries who after spending many years in madagascar had about the time we write of been all banished from the island  come now cried the chief the rice will soon be readythat wont make you sorry ravonino will itand we have yet to cross the river with the cattle in the face of the hungry crocodileswhich wont make them sorry  come  turning impulsively in the brusque careless manner which characterised him voalavo led the way to the banks of the rivera considerable streamwhere the cattle were assembled and guarded by a band of over a hundred warriors  cattle seem to be plentiful in these parts said mark to the guide as they walked along  they are numerous everywhere in madagascar  in truth a large part of our exports to the mauritius and elsewhere consists of cattlelook the chief was right when he said the crocodiles would not be sorry to see the cattle crossing  he pointed to a ripple on the water caused by the ugly snout of one of the creatures referred to  it seemed by the activity of its movements to be already anticipating a feast  crocodiles continued the guide are numerous in many of our lakes and rivers and dangerous too though they are naturally timid and can be easily frightened away  i remember a curious instance of this kind happening on the east coast where a european trader was cleverly imposed ondeceived or what you call  humbugged suggested hockins  well yeshumbugged  he was a big ignorant fellow this trader strong and energetic enough but full of conceitthought he knew almost everything but in reality knew next to nothing yet selfwilled and obstinate enough totoyou know the sort of man  yes yes a stoopid cockscomb said hockins  i know the breed well lots of em everywhere  jus soa born idjit go on massa said ebony who was always charmed at the prospect of a story or anecdote  well this trader continued the guide was on his way from antananarivo to the coast with cattle for exportation and one day they came to a place where they had to cross a narrow part of a lake  the natives of that place advised him not to venture without trying the effect of their ody or charms on the crocodiles  these they said and believed would protect the cattle in crossing  but the trader scouted the idea and laughing at their superstitions gave orders to drive the bullocks into the water  he quickly repented his obstinacy for no sooner were they in than the crocodiles seized nine of them and dragged them down  oh bring the odywork the odyquick cried the anxious man fearing lest all the cattle should be seized  the ody was worked instantly and to his astonishment as well as the triumph of the natives the rest of the cattle crossed in safety  even those that had been nearly drowned escaped and passed over  but how was dat asked ebony with a perplexed air  if de ody was nuffin how could it do suffin  simply enough returned the guide  the charm consisted merely in noise  the natives in canoes and on both sides of the lake shouted furiously and beat the water with branches of trees so that the poor crocodiles were scared away  seethere is something of the same sort going to be performed just now  previous to this process however the chief voalavo went through a singular ceremony to propitiate the crocodiles  the malagasy like the ancient egyptians regard the crocodile with superstitious veneration they esteem him the king of the waters and to dispute his right to reign would they believe expose them to his vengeance  hence they seldom kill crocodiles and rather avoid whatever is likely to provoke them  it is their custom also sometimes to make solemn speeches and vows to the crocodiles when about to cross rivers  voalavo who was unusually reckless freeandeasy and regardless in ordinary affairs was nevertheless remarkably superstitious  before giving orders to cross the river therefore he advanced to the waters edge and mumbled incantations or made vows in a low tone for nearly halfanhour  then elevating his voice so as to be heard across the river he continued addressing the crocodiles  now i pray you good mamba to do me no injury and particularly to spare my cattle for you do not know what trouble i have had to get them  no doubt you know how anxious i and my people are to eat them for you have much of the same desire but i beseech you to exercise selfdenial  you dont know how pleasant that will make you feel remember that i have never done your royal race any injurynever waged war with you or killed you  on the contrary i have always held you in the highest veneration  if you do not remember this but forget it i and my whole race and all my relatives will declare war and fight against you for ever more  so be good and do what i tell you  now my men he cried turning round drive in the cattle work the ody and make all the dogs bark  in the midst of an indescribable hubbub the herds were then driven into the river and the mensome in canoes and some on both banksenacted the very scene which ravonino had described  in a few minutes the whole herd was got over in safety  halfanhour later and our travellers were seated in the chiefs house regaling themselves with beefsteaks and marrowbones chickens and rice    chapter eight  a friend appears unexpectedly and our travellers spend a disturbed night  whatever ethereal persons may say to the contrary there can be no doubt whatever that the consumption of food is an intellectual treat inasmuch as it sets the body free from the cravings of appetite and by stimulating those nervous influences which convey vigour and vitality to the brain not only becomes the direct cause of physical gratification but induces that state of mind which is most favourable to the development of the interesting creations of fancy and the brilliant coruscations of imagination  we might pursue this subject further did time and space permit but our objection to skipping is so great that we shrink from giving the reader even a shadow of excuse for doing so  moreover we dread the assault of the hypercritical reader who will infallibly object that it is not the consumption of food but the resulting mental effect which is the intellectual treat  as if we did not know that  but we would retort with scorn can any cause be separated from its effect without bringing about so to speak the condition of nonentity  passing to the subject which gave rise to these erratic thoughts we have to relate that the whole party entertainers and entertained did ample justice to the rice beef chicken and marrowbones after which hockins wafted the natives to the seventh heaven of delight and wonder by means of his flageolet  it was very late that night before they retired to rest  it was later still before they went to sleep  the native village at which our travellers had arrived was a rude poorlooking place inhabited by a brave and warlike tribe who depended more for defence on their personal prowess and the difficulties presented by their forests than upon ditches or ramparts  the village was however surrounded by a fence of trees growing so close together that it would have been almost impossible to carry the place by assault if resolutely defended from within  the huts were roughly constructed of bamboos plastered with clay and lined with mattingalso with the large leaves of the travellers tree and thatched with rushes  the chiefs hut in which the white guests were feasted was of course larger and somewhat better in construction than the others  its floor composed of hardbeaten clay was covered with matting clean pieces of which were spread for the visitors to squat upon for there were no chairs stools or tables  in the northwest corner was the heartha square of between two and three feet with a few large stones for supporting the cooking utensils but without chimney of any kind  smoke was allowed to find an exit as it best could by crevices in the roof and by a small window or hole in the north gable  a few cookingpots earthen jars ricebaskets some knives a wooden chest and several spears completed the furniture  against the northern roofpost hung a small bottleshaped basket which contained the household sampey or god or charm  in madagascar this usually consists of a meaningless stone sometimes a chip of wood the leaf of a tree or a flower and this is what the natives pray to and profess to trust in  our travellers found after supper was over that they were not to sleep in the chiefs house for they were led to that of a headman of the village and told they were to rest with him  this man was old and seemed to have no wife or family for the only person at home at the time besides himself was an old woman perhaps his sister who looked after the household  he was a hospitable old man however and made them heartily welcome to their beds of matting in the north end of the hut  unfortunately the south end of it was usually occupied by pigs and poultry  these were expelled for the occasion but they insisted several times on returning to their own abode being unable apparently to believe that their expulsion was really intended  as there were several openings in the hut the difficulty of excluding the animals was great for when expelled at one hole amid remonstrative shrieks and screams they quickly reentered at another with defiant grunts and cacklings  by stopping up the holes however the enemy was finally overcome  then the old man having retired to his corner and the sister having departed mark breezy john hockins james ginger and ravonino drew round the fire heapedon fresh logs lay down at full length on their mats and prepared to enjoy that sleepy chat which not unfrequently precedes sometimes even postpones repose  that was a curious speech that voalavo made to the crocodile ravonino said mark  do you really think he believed it did any good  yes truly he believed it  this is a land of charms and superstition voalavo is of too honest and straightforward a nature to practise what he does not believe in  does you blieve in charms an soopistition asked ebony with expectant eyes  what need to ax that you stoopid nigger said hockins dont you know hes a christian  das true ockins  i hoed an forgot  but tell me ravonino are de crokindiles awrful rampageous when deyre roused  yes they are pretty bad said the guide clearing his throat for he was fond of expatiating on the wonders and beauties of his native land and although they look sluggish enough when sprawling on mudbanks halfasleep in the sun you would be surprised to see them go after fish which is their principal food  their favourite haunts are the deep rugged banks of a river or lake overhung with trees where they can hide themselves and watch for prey  it is not only in water that they are dangerous  they fasten their teeth if they get the chance on any animal that comes to the river to drink  they sometimes get hold of bullocks when drinking and often do so when the cattle are swimming across  they are unnaturally ferocious too for they will devour their own young  oh de brutes exclaimed ebony poking the fire with a bit of stick savagely  dont de mudders fight for de young uns  not they  the mothers lay their eggs in the sand and leave them to look after themselves  the others are sly and  dats de fadders brudders an unkles ob de eggs you mean  yes thats what i mean  the old hecrocodiles watch where the eggs are laid an when its about time for them to break an let the young ones out these monsters go into the water at the edge and wait  when the babycrocodiles get out of prison they make straight for the water where the old villains are ready to receive an devour them  some times the young ones are stupid when they are born they take the wrong road and escape their relations teeth only to get to the ricegrounds and fall into the hands of the natives  many of the eggs too are destroyed before they are hatched by vultures and other birds as well as by serpents  men also gather them by hundreds boil them and dry them in the sun to preserve them for use or sale  the miserable young things seem to have a poor chance of life then said mark sleepily  das so massa  id rader be a nigger dan a crokindile  hockins said nothing being sound asleep  what makes that rattling among the cookingpots asked mark looking round lazily  rats replied the guide  didnt you see them running along the roof when you came in  no i didnt  look up now then and youll see them on the beams  mark and ebony both looked up and beheld a row of rats on the beam overheadtheir beadlike eyes glittering as they gazed over one side of the beam and their long tails just showing on the other  das funny said the negro who was in sympathy with the whole brute creation  mark thought it very much the reverse of funny but held his peace  dars a ole grey un massa right ober ockinss heada tremenjous big un  dont you see im wid a griggy young un beside im  whether the griggy young one was also larky we cannot tell but while the negro was speaking it executed a flourish whether intentional or otherwise who can say which knocked the big grey rat off the beam and caused it to fall with a heavy flop on hockinss face  three others fell off in their anxiety to observe the result  hockins leapt up with an indignant roar and the rats leaped among the pots and pans with a horrified squeak while ebony and the others looked on with excruciating enjoyment  the scurrying of many little feet among the household implements told that the grey rats friends were numerous though unseen and the angry grunting of pigs proved that other slumbers had been broken  of course the whole party were thoroughly awakened by this incident but they took it goodhumouredly and after replenishing the fire lay down again and resolutely shut their eyes and ears  slumber was once more stealing over them when a noise at the door of the hut awakened them  next moment they started up for two warriors of the tribe entered with a prisoner between them  we caught this man entering our village said one of the warriors fiercely to the guide we would have taken him to our chief but he says that you are his friendyet i think he lies  he speaks the truth returned ravonino calmly  he is my friend doubtless he has good reasons for coming here  leave him with us we will guard him till morning  the warriors at once released their prisoner and retired while the man stepping forward into clearer light revealed the handsome countenance of laihova  sit down my brother said ravonino to the youth in tones of unusual tenderness and let me know what brings you here so unexpectedly  i come to offer my service replied the youth with a modest air you have told me that you go to antananarivo to rescue rafaravavy your face is known to every one in the town  if you enter it your death will be certain  but i do not intend to enter it said ravonino these my white friends will aid me  the white men may be wise and brave but they know not how to aid you i am not so wellknown in the town  i will venture into it and will show them where to go and what to do  the guide shook his head and was silent for some moments  he seemed uncertain how to act  what says laihova asked mark breezy at this point for the conversation having been conducted in the native tongue they as yet understood nothing  the guide briefly explained and then turned to the young man  but how can you think of leaving your friends in the cave laihova they may require your strong arm and my sister is  it was my friends who advised me to leave them said the youth quickly and raruth bade me go  besides have we not entered into the covenant of blood  well you may come with us  after all raruth is right  what does he mean by the covenant of blood asked mark when the guide explained what had just been said  it means that he and i are united by one of the closest ties that bind the men of this island  no doubt you will think it a strange alliance nevertheless it is a true and a strong bond of brotherhood  it is meant to unite two people in sacred friendship so that ever afterwards they feel bound to help and defend each other  when two persons agree to form this bond a meeting is arranged for the performance of the ceremony and taking the vow  some gunpowder and a ball are brought with a little ginger a spear and two particular kinds of grass  a fowl is also used  its head is nearly cut off and it is left to bleed during the ceremony  then a long vow of mutual friendship assistance and defence is pronounced  after this each man drinks a few drops of the others blood  to obtain it they make a small cut in the skin of the centre of the bosom which they call the mouth of the heart  and did you go through this ceremony with laihova asked mark  i did many years ago when we were little more than boys  he saved my life by jumping into a deep pool in a lake and rescuing me from the crocodiles  i had fallen in off the steep bank  i could not swim and he could  after that we made the alliance of brotherhood  laihova was not a christian at that time  since then god has made use of me to rescue him from a more awful death than that which threatened me laihova is grateful and knowing that i run much risk in going near the capital has come as you see to help me  not a bad style of brotherhood that said hockins with a tremendous yawn  eh ebony  what dee think of you an me goin in for the same sort o thing  praps answered ebony with a responsive yawn which threw that of hockins quite into the shade praps black blood mightnt agree wid your stummick  but i say massa breezy don you tink it amost time we was goin to sleep  as the night was far spentor rather the morning far advancedby that time the whole party willingly assented  laihova was supplied with a separate mat the embers of the woodfire were drawn together and they all lay down once more to make the most of what remained of the period of repose  but circumstances were against them  true being tired and healthy men they dropped off at once with the facility of infants and during a quarter of an hour or so while the fire continued to emit an occasional flicker all went well but when the last vestige of flame died away the rats again came out with beadlike eyes and cautious tread  gradually they became bolder impunity never fails to encourage presumption  in short they soon began to hold a sort of carnival  the pots and pans became as it were musical to the evident distress of the slumbering seamanespecially when the large grey rat fairly overturned a small ricejar which in its fall removed several props from other utensils and caused a serious clatter  still the wearied men slept through it all until the enemy took to scampering over their bodies  then the enraged ebony being partially awakened made a fierce grasp at one of the foe and caught hockins by the ear  of course the result was a howl and a sleepy request from mark to stop that noise  but even that incident failed to arouse them thoroughly though it filled the rats with temporary horror and caused them to flee  the last word reminds us that there were others there that night besides rats to disturb the sleepers dreamsbut we merely make a suggestive hint at that  soon the rats returned in greater force and more demonstrative hilarity than ever  they evidently went in for a game of hideandseek round and over the slumberers causing the sleepy growls of john hockins to resemble the fitful mutterings of distant thunder  thus they went on until the grey dawn of morning appeared  then an extremely large cock in the southeast corner of the hut feeling that it had enjoyed a sufficiently good nights rest flapped its ungainly wings stretched out its neck and gave vent to a clarioncrow which  brute exclaimed hockins not even giving us time to finish the sentence  he said no other word but seizing a piece of wood sent it forth with such true and effective aim that he cleared not only the cock but all his wives off their perch and sent them in cackling consternation out of the hut by the nearest hole in the wall  after that the muchtried party slumbered in peace until the sun was high    chapter nine  a jovial chief and new experiences of various kinds  the friendly hospitality of the chief of this village was found to be likely to cause delay for he would not hear of his visitors departing until they had been feasted and entertained with games and hunting  as they were completely in his power there was nothing for it but to submit with the best grace possible although ravonino was naturally anxious to push on  you see it wont do to look as if we were indifferent to his hospitality said the guide  he would be greatly offended for you must know that the malagasy pride themselves on their hospitality come we will go and have a look at the neighbouring woods while they are preparing breakfast for us and i will tell you a story about the late king radama  was that the good king you told us about who did so much for the missionaries though he wasnt a christian himself asked hockins as they all passed through the enclosure of the village and entered the woods  yes the same replied the guide though whether he was a christian or not i cannot tell  i judge no man  he made no profession of christianity but he was kind to the missionariesvery different from ranavalona  das de oosurper what you call er said ebony  just so returned the guide  well as i was saying our people are very hospitable  everywhere almost throughout the country when a traveller enters a village a present is usually brought to him of rice poultry or fruit or whatever they have on hand  youll find out that for yourselves as you go along  a bery proper state ob tings remarked ebony  and whatever house you come to continued ravonino the owner will invite you politely to enter and make you welcome  of course there are greedy and surly people here and there but these are an exception to the rule  well on one occasion king radama heard of some people of that sort  you must know that our chiefs have always required that they should be entertained on the best the people could provide  it is an old custom  well radama made a law that all the provisions and other kinds of property should belong to the people but all the houses in the country should belong to the sovereign and he ordered the inhabitants to furnish lodgings to his servants and soldiers wherever they went  in order to make sure that his orders were obeyed the king soon after went in disguise to a village some distance off and towards evening entered a peasants house and asked to be taken in for the night  the heads of the family did not refuse but rendered their hospitality in such a way as showed that he was not welcome  next day he went to another house  there he was kindly welcomed civilly treated and the best they had in the house was set before him  in the morning when taking leave he made himself known no less to the surprise than consternation of the family and he left assuring them that their hospitality should not be forgotten  the king kept his word for he afterwards sent his officers to the village with a stern reproof to his first entertainer and a handsome present to the other  just as the guide finished his anecdote a resplendent butterfly of enormous size rose from the bushes and mark to whom it was quite a new specimen bounded after it but failed to effect a capture  neber mind massa said the sympathetic ebony youll hab better luck nex timepraps  besides added the guide there are plenty more where that came from for we have got into a good region for insects  seems to me said hockins its a good region for everything  look at that nowhe pointed to an object in front of him  i would say that was a spider if it warnt as big as a bird and hadnt set up a fishinnet for a web  although not strictly correct the seamans description had a foundation in truth for some of the spiders of madagascar are enormous and their webs so thick that it requires a considerable effort to break them moreover they are said to be poisonous and the bite of some even deadly  the contemplation of those creatures however had to be cut short at that time as they did not dare to risk keeping voalavo waiting breakfast for them  we are going to stick pigs and hunt wild cattle said the jovial chief with his mouth full of chicken and rice when they arrived  we will show the white men some fun  on this being translated ebony hoped that the black man was included in the white and mark asked if the huntingground was faroff  a long way said the chief we shant reach it till night  but thats no matter for night is our time to hunt  he said this with a twinkle in his eye for he saw well enough that his guests were impatient to be gone  but continued he on observing that they did not seem cheered by the prospect our road to the huntingplain lies on your way to antananarivo so you wont lose time  as he spoke he opened a small box containing a brown sort of dust of which he put as much as he possibly could between the teeth of his lower jaw and the lip  what in all the world is he doin asked hockins of the guide in a low tone  he is taking snuff  i always sposed remarked ebony dat snuff was tooken by de nose  so it is they tell me in england but we have a different fashion here as you see and quite as foolish  you dont mean that its tobacco he treats in that way exclaimed mark  not pure tobacco but tobacco mixed with other thingssomething like the cheap cigars which you english are said to smoke replied ravonino with something of a humorous twinkle in his eyes  but we dont smoke we only snuff  in making our snuff we first dry the tobacco leaves and grind them to powder  then to this we add the ashes of the leaves of a sweetsmelling herb the mixture being twice as much tobacco as ashes a small quantity of potash or salt is added and then it is considered fit for use  dont your people smoke at all asked hockins  not much and never tobaccoexcept those on the coast who have been corrupted by europeans  some of us used to smoke rongona a kind of hemp  it is a powerful stimulant and used to be taken by warriors before going out to battle because it drove them nearly mad and so fitted them for their bloody work  government has lately forbidden its usebut it is still used in secret  theyve got baccy an dont smoke murmured hockins to himself in a kind of meditative surprise as though he had just been told that the natives possessed food and did not eat  but you dont smoke remarked the guide  thats cause i haint got baccy nor pipe  you give me pipe and baccy an ill smoke you into fits in no time  do you feel the want of it much  not much  at first i did most awful but now im gettin over it  the guide was silent  he might have remarked yet now if you had the chance you would enslave yourself again but not being of an argumentative turn of mind he merely shook his head and changed the subject  it was well for hockins was one of those people who if convinced against their will remain of the same opinion still  after breakfast while the young men of the tribe armed themselves and made preparation for the expedition ravonino took his friends through the village the inhabitants of which were evidently as deeply interested in seeing the white men as the latter were in seeing the brown for each were objects of curiosity to the other  during the stroll our friends saw the weaving of the lambathe large plaidlike garment of hempen cloth worn extensively in the island  the looms were rude and simple but the fabrics produced were wonderfully good in appearance and texture some being made of a kind of coarse silk  many of them were ornamented and rendered very heavy with immense quantities of small leaden beads fastened to the garment either in straight or curved rows the lead having been procured from traders at the coast and the beads having been manufactured by themselves these natives wore but little clothingmerely a cloth round the loins and sometimes a jacket made of coarse material  the lamba is usually worn over the shoulders in the cool of the morning but at the time we write of most of the men who used the garment had bound it tightly round their waists  our travellers were made acquainted at this time with a game which interested them greatlyespecially arousing the enthusiasm of the negro  it was a kicking game played by some of the more active among the young men who having got ready for the field quickly were waiting for their slower companions  the chief peculiarity of the game consisted in the mode of kicking namely backwards in the horse or donkey fashion  the guide explained that the name of the game when literally translated was striking blue with the sole of the foot it is a desperate game and when played as it frequently is by hundreds of active and powerful young men the results are sometimes sprained ankles broken legs etcetera  oh das de game for me cried the enthusiastic ebony who could hardly be restrained from joining  de sole ob my foots awrful broad an i could strike black as well as blue  do let me try massa  fortunately perhaps for our negro the chief came out of his hut at that moment and gave the signal for the hunters to advance thus bringing the game and ebonys aspirations to an abrupt end  the young men at once fell to the rear and the whole party sallied forth into the forest  it was magnificent weather with just cloud enough to prevent the sun being overpoweringly hot and the tract of country over which they passed was surpassingly beautiful  to mark breezy it seemed as if all the winged insects in the island had come forth to welcome him  there were butterflies of various sizes and brilliant colours flitting to and fro among the wildflowers besides dragonflies grasshoppers of exquisite beauty spiders with coats of gold and silver caterpillars halfafoot long in gorgeous array of black scarlet and yellow and many other creatures which we may not pause to describe here though mark and the guide frequently paused to look at them insomuch that they were often left a considerable way behind  one of the butterflies which mark caught at that time was very beautiful and a slow flier  it actually measured eight inches across the extended wings  of larger animals they saw none and it may be as well to remark here that there are no large carnivora in madagascarno lions tigers leopards panthers or creatures of that sortnothing larger than a wildcat and a wolf being known  neither are there elephants giraffes rhinoceroses hippopotami antelope nor deer the only large animals being two species of ox and the wildboar goats and sheep and crocodiles  there are also huge bats an animal of the monkey tribe called the lemur hedgehogs and rabbits  the lemurs are very pretty little things and being gentle affectionate creatures are sometimes tamed and kept as pets  the scenery we have said was beautiful  at one turn of the road in particular a landscape of such beauty appeared suddenly before them that mark was arrested as if spellbound it was such a gorgeous combination of luxuriant foliageferns and palms and bamboos interlaced with creepers and enlivened by streams which brawled and tumbled in picturesque cascades over which hundreds of butterflies sported in the sunshine  from the height of land on which they stood a wide wellwatered plain was seen to extend far below them  it was hemmed in on either side by wooded hills and backed by the interior highlands far down the hillside their companions could be seen wending their way through the tangled shrubbery just in rear of the native hunters led by their energetic chief voalavo  as the men carried spears the points of which glittered in the sun the party had quite a martial aspect  to our young student the whole scene was enchanting  it had the effect of subduing and solemnising his feelings in a way which he had never before experienced  the earnest religious cast of his companions spirit also tended not a little to deepen this feeling and induce him for the first time in his life to understand that natures god was in very truth present with him  is not the hand of the master here said ravonino after a long silence  truly my friend it is replied the young man and your remark puts me to shame  for many a time through the microscope and the human frame and the surrounding world might i have seen this masterhand everywhereif my eyes had been open  the guide turned on mark an earnest inquiring look  friend he said impressively if this be so you are now very specially awakened to the truth  if you have passed through and seen so much without recognising god in his creatures you have been brought for the first time to know yourself  turn nownowto the saviour and you will henceforth see a glory in all things that you never saw before turn my friendfor now is the accepted time  ravonino spoke with such an earnest look and tone that the youth could not doubt the sincerity of his belief in the saviour whom he so affectionately held up to his view  ravonino i believe you are right  god help me to turn  he has helped you already said the guide  that prayer if true never yet came from an unrenewed heart  as he spoke a shout from those further down the hillside stopped the conversation and obliged the friends to resume the descent  that is the plain i am told said ravonino where they expect to find wild cattle and where we shall have to encamp no doubt till night enables us to hunt  not a very cheerful time to go sporting said mark  they do not count it sport remarked his comrade gravely  they are short of meat and hunt for food  a few minutes later and the party was encamped in the thick woods that bordered the plain    chapter ten  tells of a grand hunt and other things  while the party of hunters awaited the approach of night for the wild cattle feed chiefly at night they kept as quiet as possible  the scouts had brought news that a large herd was feeding on a part of the plain which was not far distant although concealed from view by the formation of the land  still thinking of the recent conversation which he had had with the guide mark breezy retired a little from the rest of the party and flung himself on the ground under a tree to rest and meditate  he was not left long however in solitude for hockins and ebony soon discovered his retreat  each of these worthies was armed with a spear  hallo doctor exclaimed the former as he came up are you not supplied with a weapon  yes i am replied mark pointing to a native spear which lay at his side but i think i wont use it  why not massa asked ebony  because i dont yet know how to go about this style of hunting and if i were to attempt anything i might spoil the sport  i intend merely to look on  right you are sir remarked the sailor  praps itll be as well for all of us to keep in the background  pooh ejaculated ebony turning up his nosea needless action as it was wellturned up alreadypooh  i not keep in de background  youre all wrong  wen you knows nuffin jest you wait till you knows suffinebber so littlean den go at im  thats just what i said i should do ebony  i will merely look on at first  but how long does you prepose to look on massa  aint five or six minits enuff  dis is what is agwine to do  ill foller close on de chiefwhat you call imvollyvoan wen i sees him stick one hox das nuff for me  i den go at im on my own hook an stick away right an left  ill give you a wide berth then for its as like as not that youll stick some o the hunters in the dark said hockins rising for just then there was a stir in the camp as if preparation was being made to go out  a few minutes later and laihova came to them with the news that he had heard the chief say they were getting ready as it was necessary to make a long round through the woods to get well to leeward of the cattle  this process of getting ready consisted in every man stripping and washing himself all over in order to get rid of the smell of the smoke of their huts  even the guests were obliged to conform to the custom then they set off in profound silence every man being armed with a couple of spears excepting the guests who were allowed only one spear each it being feared that if they carried two they might chance to rattle them together and thus alarm the game for the kind of cattle they were about to attack are exceedingly active and suspiciousalways on the alert continually snuffing and snorting at the bare idea as it were of an approaching enemy  unlike the tame cattle of the island these animals have no hump but strongly resemble the ordinary cattle of england save that their horns are shorter and their bellowings deeper they are however very savage and when wounded or annoyed are apt to attack their enemies with terrible ferocity  to mark breezy and his companions the expedition proved to be full of excitement for apart from the novelty of the situation and uncertainty as to what lay before them or was expected of them the extreme darkness of the night and the quick silent stealthy motion of the almost invisible hunters filled their minds withif we may say soawfully pleasurable anticipations  the whole band followed their chief in single file and as he was intimately familiar with the topography of the region the only anxiety of each man was to tread carefully in his footsteps  as for ebony his whole soul and spirit were in the enterprise as well as his black body and the varying expression of his mobile features would have charmed the heart of a physiognomist had such a man been there with light enough to enable him to see  as there was no physiognomist and no light the reader must fall back on imagination  intent on carrying out his prearranged plans our negro walked close behind the chiefso close indeed that he inadvertently brought his spear down rather heavily on the left shoulder of that fiery person for which he received a buffet on the ear and an order to keep further back  in other circumstances the plucky spirit of ebony would have been roused to indignationperhaps to retaliation but a sense of justice was strong in that negros breast  overwhelmed with shame at his clumsiness and eager to rectify the erroryet not daring to speak for silence had been strictly enjoinedhe raised the spear over his shoulder and turned the point backwards thereby bringing it down on the head of the man in the rear  doubly shocked at this he raised his weapon to the perpendicular and knocked some tropical bird violently off the lower branches of a tree it fluttered screeching to the ground and bounced angrily into the bushes  the whole band of hunters came to a sudden and breathless halt but no word was uttered  in a few moments the chief resumed his silent march and the ghostly column moved onebony greatly subdued but by no means crushed keeping his weapon at such a slope as would prevent its doing damage to birds above or men below  thus they proceeded for nearly an hour at the end of which time they could hear the wild cattle roaring and bellowing not faroff  when the hunters had got completely to leeward and were beginning to draw quite near to the feedingground they advanced with increased caution and some of the men began to pull the tops of the grass with their hands as they went in order to mimic as nearly as possible the noise made by an ox grazing  the instant this sound reached the ears of the cattle they became absolutely silent neither bellowing nor feeding  it was evident that they were listening with the utmost attention  understanding this the hunters stood quite still without a whisper but a few of those who were adepts at the art continued their imitation of cropping the grass after listening for a time the animals appeared to arrive at the conclusion that it was a false alarm for they recommenced feeding and the hunters continued their stealthy approach  soon they came to the thinly scattered shrubbery which marked the termination of the woods and the beginning of the plain  and now profoundly dark though the night was they could faintly perceive the forms of their game looming black against the dark sky beyond themselves being quite invisible however owing to their background of forest  nearer and nearer the men moved still cropping the grass as they advanced until they fairly got up to the herd and were less liable to disturb them for being almost invisible they were no doubt mistaken for members of the family  as the hunters now scattered ebony had some difficulty in keeping close enough to the chief to observe his movements  voalavo himself was too intent upon his work to think of anything else or to care who was near him  gradually he approached close enough to an animal to thrust his spear deep into its side  it sprang from the ground and made a noise as if hurt by the horn of a comrade but this is so common an event that the rest of the cattle were in no way disturbed by it  the chief saw by the staggering of the animal that it was mortally wounded and that there was no need to follow it up as it could be easily tracked and found in daylight  he therefore turned to attack another animal that was close at hand  now den said ebony to himself mentally your times come  go at im  lowering his weapon to the charge he glanced round and observed the indistinct form of an animal on his right  it was apparently a little one  weal is as good as beef thought ebony as he made a silent but furious rush scarcely able to restrain a shout of anticipated victory  the spearpoint missed the animal just grazing its back and went deep into the ground while the negro plunged with crushing violence on the back of john hockins who had been trying to approach his game a la red indian  to say that poor ebony was filled with horror as well as shame and selfabhorrence is but a feeble statement  dont speak you black monster whispered the seaman in his ear as he seized him by the throat  the rush of apology which had sprung from ebonys heart was checked abruptly at the lips  hockins released him picked up his spear and resumed his creeping way by this time several of the hunters had dealt silent death around them but still the herd failed to take alarm  being left alone ebonys courage returned and with it his enthusiasm  come he muttered mentally as he drew the spear from the ground ockins not killed yet  das one good job  no use to cry for noting you try again ginjah  better luck nixt time  greatly encouraged by these thoughts he advanced on tiptoespear at the chargeeyes glancing sharply all round  suddenly a tall form seemed to rise up right in front of him  the negros heart leaped violently  he was on the point of charging when a doubt assailed him the creature before him though scarce distinguishable from the surrounding gloom was not longbodied like an ox  he could perceive that clearly  it was tall like a manvery tall  perhaps it was mark breezy  the recent mistake made him think anything possible  is dat you massa he whispered in anxious alarm  a furious bellow was the reply followed by a still more furious charge ebony had forgotten that an ox end on and head up is tall and not long  happily in stepping back he tripped and the animal went right over him  but the alarm had been given and a sudden thundering of feet told that the entire herd had taken to flight while the shouting and cries of the hunters added to the confused roaring showed that there was now no need for concealment  when the musterroll was called it was found that nobody was missing or hurt though several had to tell of narrow escapes especially john hockins whose account of ebonys exploit formed at the feast that followed subject of interesting converse and much comment during the brief intervals of relaxation between beefsteaks and marrowbones  daylight revealed the fact that somewhere between thirty and forty animals had been killed outright besides a dozen or so which having been fatally wounded were afterwards followed up and some of them secured  but daylight also brought a large party of men from a distant village with a pressing invitation to voalavo and his men to pay them a visit and a possibly disinterested offer to assist him in the consumption of the cattle which he had slain for it chanced that several young men of this village were encamped in the woods that night near the spot where the hunters attacked the cattle  knowing full well what was being done these youths hurried home to tell what was going on  the headman of the village was on good terms with voalavo at the time besides being a distant relative  hence the message and the invitation  as our happygolucky chief was out in what may be termed a larky state of mind and had nothing particular to do he accepted the invitation the meat was slung to bamboo poles hoisted on the shoulders of his men and away they went over the plains to pay this visit  happily the village lay on the way to the capital so that the guide and his party could still accompany them without losing ground  the plain over which they passed was a very wide one seeming to extend to the very base of the distant mountains of the interior but our travellers were mistaken in their ideas about it  the plain was itself part of the mountain region into which they had already advanced but by so gradual an ascent that they had scarcely perceived the rise in the landa deception which was increased somewhat by the frequent descents they had to make when passing over ridges  on the way hockins pushed up alongside of ravonino who was walking beside mark  ravvy said the seaman for to this had he at last curtailed the guides name where do these fellows fall in wi the iron to make their spearheads and other things  in the earth answered the guide  what  dee mean to say that you manufacture your own iron in them parts  of course we do  think you that no people can work in iron except the british  we have plenty iron ore of good quality in the island  one of our mountains is so full of ore that we call it the iron mountain  it is named in our language the mountain of ambohimiangavo  an how dee work the ore o this amambobobominableavo mountain asked the sailor  we smelt it of course  we break the lumps of ore into smallish bits and spread them on charcoal layer and layer about in a hollow in the ground  this is covered over with a topdressing of stone and clay then we set it on fire and keep the blast going with wooden bellows till the metal is melted and runs in a mass to the bottom of the hole this we break into smaller pieces purify them with more fire and run them into bars convenient for use  our bellows continued the guide are not like yours with two boards and leather between  the rats would soon make short work with these  they are two cylinders formed from the trunk of a tree with a piston in each packed with coarse cloth and having valves  an old musketbarrel carries the air to the furnace and by pumping them time about the blow is kept going continuously  why how do you come to know so much about valves pistons cylinders and such like asked mark  you forget that my father was an englishman returned the guide and besides being a trader was a sort of jackofalltrades  he taught me many things about which the kinsfolk of my mother know very little  you must not suppose that because some of us are only halfcivilised we can do nothing neatly or well  many of our men are skilful workers in metal and we owe much of our power in that way to english missionaries who brought christian mechanics to the capital  there is hardly anything in the shape of wrought ironwork that we cannot execute if we have a model or pattern  we can work also in copper and brass  but it is not only in metals that we can work fairly wellindeed very well if we are to take the word of some of your own countrymen who have seen and judged our workwe are also pretty good at pottery and cabinetmaking  as you have seen we can weave good cloth of cotton and silk and some of our ingenious men have even tried their hands at clockmaking and musical instruments  from what you say madagascar will soon become a great country i should think said mark somewhat amused as well as interested by the evident enthusiasm of the guide  ravonino shook his head  my country might become great he returned but there are some things much against her  the system of forced service to the government instead of taxes is one  this tends to repress ingenuity for the cleverer and more ingenious a man is the more will be demanded of him both by the government and his own feudal superior  then the love of strong drink is too common among us and last as well as most serious great multitudes of our people have no regard at all for their maker  why ravonino said mark with something of a smile from the way you speak of our people and my country i fear you think more of your malagasy than your english extraction  for a few moments the guide was silent  at length he said slowly england has indeed done us a service that we can never repay  she has sent us the blessed gospel of jesus christ  she is also the land of my father and i reverence my father  he was very kind and good to me but this is the land of my mother  i am a man of madagascar  it was evident from the expressive features of ebony who had joined them that he heartily approved of this maternal preference but the gravity of the guides countenance no less than his pathetic tones prevented his giving the usual candid vent to his everready opinion  towards the afternoon the party arrived at the native village where grand preparations for festivities had been made  it was evident also that some parts of the festive libations had been taken in advance for the headman had reached the solemnised point of intoxication and some of his young men the owlish condition  in some parts of this island of madagascar as in other parts of the world the people reduced themselves to great poverty through strong drink  though they had abundance of rice and much beef which latter was salted for exportation they sold so much of their food for arrack imported by traders from mauritius and bourbonthat little was left for the bare maintenance of life and they with their families were often compelled to subsist on roots  they did not understand moderate drinking  intoxication was the rule until the arrack was done  the wise king radama the first attempted to check the consumption of ardent spirits by imposing a heavy duty on them but his efforts were only partially successful  the tribe to which our travellers were at this time introduced had just succeeded in obtaining a quantity of the coarse and fiery spirits of the traders  their native visitors being quite ready to assist in the consumption thereof there was every prospect of a disgusting exhibition of savagery that night  dont you think we might escape this feast said mark to the guide after the ceremony of introduction was over by urging the importance of our business at antananarivo  not easily  voalavo is one of those determined and hearty men who insist on all their friends enjoying themselves as they themselves do tomorrow we may persuade him to let us go  besides i do not object to stay for i intend to preach them a sermon on ungodliness and intemperance in the middle of the feast  mark could scarcely forbear smiling at what he deemed the originality of the guides intention as well as the quiet decision with which he stated it  dont you think he said that this way of bearding the lion in his den may rouse the people to anger  i know noti think not but it is my business to be instant in season and out of season replied ravonino simply  mark said no more  he felt that he had to do with a christian of a somewhat peculiar type and thereafter he looked forward with not a little curiosity and some anxiety to the promised sermon  he was doomed like the reader to disappointment in this matter for that night had not yet run into morning when an event occurred which modified and hastened the proceedings of himself and his friends considerably    chapter eleven  an uninvited guest appears with news that demands instant action  the villagers and their guests were still in the midst of the feast and the arrack had not yet begun to stimulate their imaginations so that the deeds of their ancestorswhich formed the chief subject of conversationwere still being recounted with some regard to modesty and truth when voalavo said to the assemblage with a beaming countenance that he had a treat in store for them  you are all fond of music he said  who does not know that the malagasy are good singers  the songs you have already sung have delighted my ears and the clapping of your hands has been in the best of time but you shall soon have music such as the idols would enjoy i have no doubt when in a merry mood  the chief uttered the last sentence with an air of goodnatured contempt for he was what we may style an unbeliever in all godsnot an uncommon state of mind in men of superior intelligence when they think seriously of the debasing absurdities of idolatry  now my friend he said turning to john hockins with an air and tone of command let them hear the little pipe on which youyou tootleootle  hockins had much ado to keep his gravity as he drew out the flageolet and every eye was instantly fixed on him in glaring expectancy  it need hardly be said that the effect of the sweet instrument was very powerful and it is probable that the party of admirers might have taxed the seamans powers of performance to the uttermost if they had not been suddenly interrupted by the entrance of a tall wildlooking man who was evidently in a state of tremendous excitement  he wore the usual cloth round the loins and the lamba which was thrown like a scottish chieftains plaid over his left shoulderbut these garments bore evidence of rough usage and hard travel  the man was not a stranger for as he suddenly stood panting vehemently in the midst of the party with his long arms outstretched voalavo addressed him in tones of surprise  razafil he exclaimed  glad are we to see the bard of imarina  your coming is welltimed  we are feasting and singing and storytelling words from the poet will be welcome  notwithstanding the friendly reception thus accorded to the bard of imarina it was evident that the words were thrown away upon him for he continued for some time to glare and pant while perspiration rolled down his face and it became clear to every one that something was wrong with him  at last he spoke in a kind of low singing tone which harmonised with his appearance    vain man  observst thou not the dead   the morning warmth from them has fled   their midday joy and toil are oer   though near they meet fond friends no more  he paused and looked wildly yet tremblingly round as if in search of some one but took no notice of his friends many of whom were present at the gathering  then he continued in the same strain    a gate of entrance to the tomb we see   but a departure thence there neer shall be   the living waves his signal high   but wheres the loved ones fond reply   ah where are those thus doomed to die    vain man observst thou not the dead   no more their homeward path they tread   the freeman lost may ransomd be   by silvers magic power set free   but once the deadly hand has laid them low   no voice can move them for they cease to know   regardless of our love they lie   unknown the friends that oer them sigh   oh where are those thus doomd to die  again the poor man paused and gasped as if some terrible agony were rending his bosom yet no tear moistened his eyes from which there seemed to gleam the wild light of insanity  his appearance and words had sunk like a pall upon the festive party but no one spoke or moved it was as if they were spellbound  once more the poet spoke and this time in tones of deepest pathos    vain man why groan ye for the dead   to be with jesus they have fled   with shattered limbsmid scorching flame   they sang the praises of his name   now joy unspeakable they tread the shore   whence ransomd sinners shall depart no more   but ah while mangled corpses lie   our trembling riven hearts will cry   why why were those thus doomd to die  the man ceased his arms fell listlessly by his side and his chin sank on his breast  i fear much whispered ravonino to mark that i understand but too well what he means  without waiting for a reply the guide rose  going up to razafil he laid his hand gently on his arm and said  my brother  the bard looked at him earnestly for a few seconds then grasped him by the wrist as with a grip of iron  ravoninohitriniony he said fiercely my little one is dead  she is gone  they took hera mere childthey tortured her but she would not yield  hear what i say  you knew her wellthe soft one the tender one who was always so pliable so unselfish so easily ledshe would not yield  they led her to the place of execution they tied her to a stake and kindled the fire about her beautiful limbsmy little child raniva  i saw the skin upon her flesh blacken and crack and blaze  but she sang sang loud and clear  i would have rushed into the fire to her but they held me backfour strong men held me  when she was consumed they led me away to the torturebut i burst from themescapedi know not howi care not for my little one is lostlost  nay razafilnot lost said ravonino in a quiet but firm tone for he saw the gleam increasing in the poor fathers eyes  did you not say just now that she is singing with joy unspeakable the praises of his name  the words were fitly spoken  the fathers agonised soul was quieted but as quietness partly returned to him a new expression appeared on his countenance  listen he said still holding the guides wrist in his powerful grasp  i go to my poor wife  she is safe in the cave with renimamba  not in the cave you think of interrupted the guide explaining the change of abode which had been recently made by the christian fugitives  no matter returned the bard i know all the caves and can find the one she has gone to  but now i must warn youwarn all of you who are christians he added with emphasis looking round upon the natives if there be any such among youthat queen ranavalona has got one of her bad fits again  she has ordered that no one is to sing or pray to jesus or to read the word of god on pain of imprisonment death or being sold into slavery  many have been sold already and some have died  things would have been even worse for the english missionary has left antananarivo but prince rakota remains our friend  still he cannot save every one  he could not save my raniva  now he added turning to the guide abruptly as if anxious to keep his mind from dwelling on his terrible bereavement you must go to antananarivo with all haste if you would save rafaravavy for she is in great danger  the bard had touched a cord in ravoninos breast which vibrated sensitively  she has not confessed  she is not in prison he asked quickly with emotion which was too powerful to be entirely suppressed  as to confessing returned razafil there is no need for her to do that for it is wellknown that she is a christian but the queen is fond of her and wishes to spare her  nevertheless she is so exceeding mad against us just now that there is no saying when her forbearance may come to an end  if you would save rafaravavy you must get her out of the palace without delay  the guide did not reply for a few seconds  it was evident from the knitted brows and the pallor of his countenance that he was endeavouring to make up his mind to some course of action  suddenly the frown passed from his brow his countenance became perfectly calm and his eyes closed  he is speaking with god whispered laihova to one who sat near him  laihova may have been right  if so the prayer was a very brief one for the guide turned almost immediately to voalavo and explained that in the circumstances it was absolutely necessary for him and his comrades to depart at once for the capital  the chief being a sympathetic as well as a hilarious soul made no objection but rather urged him to make haste  ravonino then turned to his white companions who could of course only guess at the meaning of all that had been said and explained to them the whole matter  they rose at once and having no preparations to make professed to be ready to start there and then  now while they were yet speaking the festive party received another surprise or alarm which was even more exciting than the previous one  a young man suddenly burst into the village with the announcement that a body of the queens soldiers were close at hand  they had been sent off in pursuit of razafil with directions to scour the country and bring in as many christian fugitives as possible and hethe young manbeing a fast runner had been sent in advance by some friends of the bard to warn him of his danger  i would not try to avoid them if i stood alone said razafil softly should i shrink from dying for jesus after seeing my raniva go to him in a chariot of fire  but i stand not alone  my wife claims my support and my little boy  while he was speaking it was seen that a few of the hunters as well as one or two inhabitants of the village rose quietly and left the place these were either professing or suspected christians who were anxious to make their escape from the danger that threatened  after bidding voalavo farewell the guide and his friends left the village and struck into the woods  they were accompanied by the bard a short distance until a point was reached where their routes diverged and here after a few words of brotherly sympathy and counsel from ravonino the bereaved man went on his solitary way and the others directed their course towards the capital  poor man said ebony who looked over his shoulder with profound sorrow in his earnest eyes as long as the tall figure of the bard was in sight is most awrful sorry for im  why dont dey hang randalvalona or shot er  history teaches that its not always so easy as one might think to get rid of objectionable queens in that way said mark  hm  id teach history suffin diffrent if i had my way returned the negro  but surely the great men around her might have some sort o power to clap a stopper on er said hockins  they have some power but not much returned the guide for ranavalona is a passionate selfwilled cruel woman and when such a woman happens to be a despotic queen nothing short of a revolution or her death can save the country  she usurped the throne in 1829 we have now reached 1857 so she has been reigning more than twentyseven years and a bitter reign it has been  there have been many persecutions of the christians since it began  hundreds have been slain thousands have been sold into slavery many more have been banished to pestilential districts where disease has laid them low god grant that this mad fit may not be the forerunner of another burst of cruelty  but do you really think said mark that rafaravavy is in great danger  did not the bard say that she is a favourite with the queen  that is some security but not much for ranavalona is changeable as well as cruel  but my dear one is in the hands of god  no harm can come to her unless he permits  nevertheless our god works not by miracles but by means therefore it is my business having the opportunity given me to hasten to her rescue  and it is mine to help you said mark an impulse of youthful enthusiasm and sympathy swelling his heart as his mind suddenly reverted to the morning when he left england and said his last goodbye to the fair one with the golden hair and the rosebud mouth and such lovely blue eyes  but how he continued shall we best aid you in this matter  that question i cannot answer immediately  when we draw near to the capital and hear what is going on i shall be able to form a plan  what we have to do just now is to travel fast  you are strong stout men all of you  do you think you can walk fast and far with little rest or sleep and without breaking down  i think so answered mark modestly  is cocksure ob it said ebony if wes allowed lots o grub  im not quite so sure said hockins you must remember ive only got sealegs onbut ill try  and he did try and so did the others with such success too that before the sun set that evening they had penetrated into the very heart of the mountain range which runs through the centre of the island  there had not been much conversation on the way for hillclimbing all day at topspeed is not compatible with small talk  besides the obvious anxiety of ravonino rendered his companions less inclined than usual to engage in desultory remarks  nevertheless there were occasionsduring momentary halts to recover breath or when clear bubbling springs tempted them to drinkwhen the prolonged silence was broken  putty stiff work dis hillclimbin massa said ebony during one of these brief halts as he wiped the perspiration from his sable brow with the back of his hand  lucky is used to it  used to it repeated mark  yes  dint i tell you i was born an raised among de andes in sout ameriky  to be sure i forgot that but there must be a considerable difference between the two mountain ranges  das troo massa but de diffrence dont make much diffrence to de legs  you see wild rugged ground much de same wheder de mountains rise a few tousand foot like dese or poke der snowtopped heads troo de clouds right away up into de blue sky like de andes  rugged ground is rugged ground an hard on de legs all de same an dis am rugged nuff even for ockins  the negro opened his huge mouth in an amiable laugh at his companion who had taken advantage of the brief halt to give a hearty rub to his colossal limbs  rugged enough it is no doubt said the sailor gravely an it makes my sealegs raither stiffish  but never you fear ebony theyre tough an will last as long as yours anyhow  yous right ockins  deyll last longer dan mine by eight or ten hinchesif not more  your jokes are small ebony which is more than can be said for your mouth  shut it man or some of usll go tumblin into it by accident  while these two were indulging their little pleasantries the guide and his friend laihova had gone to the top of a neighbouring bluff to consult as to the best route to adopt in the present troubled state of the country  the view from the commanding height on which they stood was indeed marked by a rugged grandeur which might have done credit even to the giant andes themselves and offered a variety of routes or rather obstructions to routes which might well perplex men who were eager to cross country swiftly  the point which they had reached and much of the range they had crossed was formed of basalt in various stages of decomposition but in the country before them for several miles in advance huge masses of granite and fragments of quartz indicated a change in the nature of the prevailing rock  the position of these masses as well as their size gave a wild titanic aspect to much of the scenery  many enormous stones projected out of the ground at various angles  one of these stood out horizontally to the distance of between twenty and thirty feet forming a cave under it in which it was evident from sundry suggestive appearances that wayfarers were accustomed to lodge the neighbourhood of this cave formed one of the most romantic and picturesque scenes they had yet seen  it was a dark narrow vale in many places not less than five hundred feet deep with a considerable stream at the bottom which brawled among detached and shattered rocks or was partly lost to view in its meanderings among the beautiful green shrubs which clothed its banks  various kinds of birds twittered among the bushes and wherever water expanded in the form of pond or lakelet numerous waterfowl sported on the surface  a glorious prospect exclaimed mark as he joined the guide and his friend and a splendid place i should think for fugitives from persecution  he pointed as he spoke to the scene on his right where masses of rock varying from thirty to fifty feet in length projected from the side of the ravine  on the top of these rested other masses in a position that seemed to threaten destruction to all who ventured beneath them  the caves of this region said the guide have served to shelter the christians many a time  it looks as if god had provided these blocks of granite for this very purpose for the caverns which extend beneath them are dark and intricate having many entrances and being lighted in some places by openings between the blocks while in other places they are profoundly dark and of unknown extent  see also if you look at the stream below they form a splendid bridge  at this distance they do not seem large but some of these blocks are not less than a hundred feet long  this whole region is infested by robbers but the recent act of the queen in sending troops out to scour the country for fugitive christians seems to have driven them away  but if they had been here we should have had little to fear for robbers are not usually fond of attacking even small parties of men who are well able to defend themselves besides they do not injure the outlawed christians much perhaps they have a sort of fellowfeeling for us  at this point laihova spoke a few words to the guide in the native tongue  the latter nodded approval and turning to mark said  we have been consulting about our route  there are two roadsone rugged roundabout and safe which would take us a longer time however to reach the capital than the other which is the regular beaten path through the villages  but this latter way lays us open to the danger of meeting with soldiers and of my being captured along with my friend laihova  there would be no danger to you and your friends for you are strangers  ravonino said mark quickly do what is best for rescuing rafaravavy  we have no will but yours  we will follow wherever you choose to lead  a quiet look of satisfaction played on the guides features as he turned to his friend  what says laihova  the englishmen are willing to do whatever we wish  let us go by the villages  let us push on by night as well as by day said laihova  time flies  ranavalona is mad  rafaravavy is in danger  it was finally arranged that at this place which was considerably to the south of antananarivo they should diverge to the right so as to avoid certain points of danger and arrive ultimately at the eastern side of the capital  having settled this point the three men rejoined their comrades who were still conversing amicably beside the spring  thereafter they all descended into the valley by a steep and rugged pathway    chapter twelve  a narrow escape and threatening clouds  their progress after leaving the spot described in the last chapter was not so rapid as could have been desired by anxious men for it was absolutely necessary to proceed with extreme caution  not only were the queens troops out in various directions but many of her spies had been seen prowling about like the evil one they served seeking whom they could devour  of this the travellers were made aware at the first villages they came to and as ravonino had formerly been wellknown at the capital it became necessary for him not only to disguise himself but to keep as much as possible out of sight  disguising himself was not very difficult owing to the fact that when he lived in antananarivo he had like his father worn a bushy beard this had made him a marked man for the malagasy as a rule have little beard and what little they possess is usually pulled out by the roots since he became a fugitive the guide had shaved closely  this of itself went a long way to change his appearance but when in addition he had modified the arrangement of his hair and stained his face of a darker hue he had made himself almost unrecognisable even by his best friends  his chief difficulty was with his voice which had a mellow sweetness in it that resisted modification  however by keeping silence or speaking low he hoped to escape recognition until he should reach the vicinity of the capital where he had friends who would gladly receive and conceal him even at the risk of their lives  as to the great object that lay nearest his heart he hoped to manage that through his friend laihova without himself entering the capital  our travellers soon reached the inhabited part of the country where being surrounded by men and women going about as well as journeying towards the antananarivo market with provisions etcetera they ceased to attract much attention  of course the englishmen were subjects of curiositysometimes of inquirybut as laihova reported that they were men who had been cast on the southern coast of the island and whom he was guiding to the capital suspicion was not aroused  laihova at this point became leader of the party in order to enable the guide more easily to fall into the background and he was all the more fitted for the position in that he had acquired a smattering of english from his friend ravonino and could both understand much of what was said to him and also make himself pretty well understood by his white friends  this part of the journey was by no means without adventure sometimes of a kind that filled them with anxiety  one evening they approached a small hamlet or group of cottages where they learned among other things that two of the queens spies were at that moment in the neighbourhood searching for two ladies of the court who had fled because ranavalona had threatened them with imprisonment  are they young asked ravonino forgetting his caution in his anxiety  i know not replied the man who had informed them of the fact  i think some one told me they were not youngbut i forget  the guide said no more  he regretted having said so much for the man glanced at him suspiciously  affecting an air of unconcern he turned away and bade his comrades follow  come he said when out of earshot of the man we must pass through this village quickly for we know not in what house the spies may have taken up their quarters  but don you tink suggested ebony dat we five could wallop any oder five men in de univarse to say noting ob two spies  a grim smile was all the reply that the guide gave him as he walked quickly along the path that led out of the hamlet  i have a friend he said to mark who lives in a solitary cottage halfamile further on  he is rich and i think a christian manbut secretly for fear of the queen  we will call at his house in passing  as he spoke they approached a large house by the roadside the owner of which a brown old gentleman was enjoying himself with his wife and family in front of it  is that your friend asked mark  no he lives in the house just beyond  we shall see it on clearing this group of trees  the track which they were following led close past the large house above referred to necessitating compliance with a custom of the country which greatly surprised and not a little amused the englishmen  we have spoken of the residence as a house because it belonged to one owner but it would be more correct to call it a farmsteading or a group of buildings  except among the very poorest people a malagasy family has usually two or three houses in its enclosurefrequently more for young married people often live beside their parents and some houses are appropriated to slaves while others are used as kitchens etcetera the whole being surrounded by a wall of clay  where a house is near the public road they have usually a little square platform called the fijerena in an angle of the wall or at the gate with steps leading up to it  here the family sits when the work of the day is over to watchand doubtless to criticisethe passersby also to do the polite according to malagasy ideas for it must be told that these people are very courteous  even the poorest have a natural dignity and ease of manner about them  as our travellers approached the house they were observed with much interest by the brown old gentleman and his comfortablelooking wife and his pretty little lightbrown daughter and a very uncomfortablelooking elderly female with her head tied up who were all squatted on the fijerena  when within hearing laihova stopped and said in the politest tone and manner possible  will you allow me to pass sir  pray proceed sir replied the old gentleman with a gracious smile  this interchange of civilities was entirely formal and stood in the place of the englishmans opening remarks on the weather to which a malagasy would as soon think of referring in this connection as he would to the hatching of crocodiles eggs  then followed the conventional inquiry how are you  how is it with you which politenesses in a number of variations unknown to western speech would have been continued in ordinary circumstances until the passersby were beyond the range of hearing but the appearance of the englishmen induced the brown old gentleman on this occasion to beg the travellers to stop and accept his hospitality  this they declined to do with many expressions of regret on the ground that their business at the capital was urgent  it would have gratified me much said the old gentleman to have entertained you  but you are all well i hope  yes we are very well answered laihova and how do you feel  i feel as well as possible  and is it well with you  it is well with us  but it does not seem to be well with the lady returned laihova glancing at the uncomfortable female with her head tied up  no it is not well with her  she has toothache on the north side of her head  farewell said the brown old gentleman resquatting on the fijerena as the travellers moved on may you live he shouted after them when nearly out of earshot and reach old age  great was the amusement of our travellers at all this especially when ravonino explained about the toothache  you must know he said that almost all the houses in the central provinces of the island are built with their length running north and south or nearly so and the people use the points of the compass in describing the position of things thus if they tell a slave to look for a thing in the house they will say look in the north south east or west corner or side and they apply this rule to the person also  i once heard the member of a mission from england told by his host that some rice was sticking to his moustache  the missionary wiped the wrong side  no said the host it is on the southern side of your moustache  do you know said mark breezy that is not so strange to me as you might suppose for i was once told by a friend who lived in the scottish highlands that an old woman there actually said to her that she had toothache on the east side of her head  further comment on this point was arrested by their coming suddenly in sight of the house where the guides friend dwelt  you had better stay here at the edge of this wood while i go forward alone said the guide because although the man is kind and has always professed to be my friend i am not quite sure of him  it is well to be cautious  if i wave my hand to you come up to the house all will be well  if things dont seem favourable i will return to youbut keep close dont show yourselves needlessly  you see my friend is an officer of the palace  if friendly he can be very useful to us if unfriendly he can be dangerous  but why run risk by going near him at all asked mark  we must run risk when life and death are in the balance replied the guide shortly  concealed by the bushes the travellers watched their companion as he went up to the house  before he reached it a man opened the door and stepped out  suddenly this man seemed to burst into a furious passion he grasped ravonino by the throat almost threw him on his back and seizing a stick began to belabour him violently while two other men appeared at the door of the house and from their inordinate laughter seemed fully to enjoy the scene  hi exclaimed ebony in shrill falsetto as he jumped up in blazing wrath intending to rush to the rescue but hockins grasped his woolly head and pulled him back  obey orders you black grampus  dee think hes a babby as cant take care of himself  didnt he tell us to keep close  great as had been the surprise of the watchers at this sudden and unprovoked assault it was as nothing compared with their astonishment when they saw their guide fairly turn tail and run towards them closely followed by the furious man who continued to thrash him all the time  as ravonino drew near the angry man seemed to have exhausted himself for he fell behind and finally stopped  the guide ran on at full speed until he reached the wood but did not even then slacken his speed  as he ran past his friends however he exclaimed in a sharp stern voice  follow me  laihova obeyed with the unquestioning readiness of a faithful hound the others followed suit with the open eyes of perplexity and amazement  reaching a sequestered dell in a few minutes ravonino suddenly stopped and turned round with a calm air of satisfaction  well dis am de most awrful supprise ise had since my mudder give me my fust wollopin  the expression on the negros face rendered the remark needless  it was well done said the guide seating himself on the trunk of a fallen tree  amost too well done returned hockins with a touch of sarcasm  do you know continued the guide gravely ive had a narrow escape the two men you saw laughing at the door are the very men we have been trying to avoidthe queens spieswhom i have long known and who would certainly have discovered me in spite of my shaved and stained face if we had come to talk to each other in the same room  luckily my friend is smart as well as true  he knew my voice at once  to have talked with me or warned me or let me enter his house would have been fatal  his only resource lay in thrashing me off his premisesas you have seen  how he will explain matters to the spies i know not but i can trust him for that  das most awrful clebber exclaimed ebony his every feature broadening with delight at the success of the ruse  but what are we to do now asked mark  wait till he comes here  he told me to wait  what  told you  ayyou dont suppose he let his tongue lie idle while he was using his stick  of course i was myself taken aback at first when he seized me by the throat but two or three muttered words in the midst of his anger opened my eyes and i ran at once  all the way as he ran after and belaboured me he was giving me important information in furious tones the spies are only staying with him for a short rest  when they are gone he will come and find us here  hes a born actor said hockins  trueand he acted some of his blows heavier than i could have wished in his anxiety to impress his information on me said the guide  what is his name asked mark  fisatra  he is named after a great chief who lived in this district not long agobut here he comes to speak for himself  at that moment a tall finelooking man of very dark complexion and clad in the ample folds of a beautiful lamba approached them  his whole countenance was wrinkled with the lines of fun and his brilliant teeth glistened as he smilingly held out his hand to the englishmen and asked them to accept his hospitality  as they passed into the house they saw two slavegirls pounding rice in a large wooden mortar with two enormous wooden pestles while the savoury steam that arose from some invisible kitchen served to put a finer edge on their already sharpened appetites  when the mats were spread and the feast was being enjoyed ravonino asked the host how he had got rid of the spies and how he managed to explain his conduct without raising their suspicions  nothing easier said fisatra while his broad shoulders heaved with an inward chuckle  you know that i used to be feared in the palace in days gone bye because of my violent nature and the way in which i used to knock about the furniture and make the household slavessometimes the household troopsscurry when i was in a rage  yet im sure you know very well he looked sheepishly innocent here that i never was an angry manat least not a cruel one  but thats all changed  i am one of your set now though no one suspects it  since i met mr ellis  is mr ellis here just now interrupted ravonino anxiously  not now answered fisatra he departed some weeks ago but i believe has not yet left the coast  and now there is no check on the queens violence  well as i was about to say i took to the old habit in pretence as you have seen and when i returned from thrashing you i went storming through the house kicking about the pots and pans and foaming at the mouth in such a way that i not only stopped the spies laughing but put them in fear of their lives  again the funwrinkles corrugated the visage of fisatra and his mighty shoulders heaved with internal explosions  after i had calmed down a bit he continued the spies ventured to ask timidly if that was a great enemy that i had beaten  this set me into a worse passion than ever  enemy  i shouted nononot an enemyhehes aa but i got no further than that for i didnt know what to say and i wouldnt lie so i took to foaming and stamping again  at last i said dont speak to me about himexcuse me my friends i cant stand itandand the rice is nearly ready  you must be hungry  i said this with a look and tone as if another fit was coming on  they excused themselves  no they said we are not hungry and we have yet far to go this day before the sun descends  the queens orders will not wait  and off they went glad to get out of my way  truly if it is sinful to get in a rage it is useful sometimes to act it  so now my friends eateatwhile you have the chance and fear not the return of the spies  tell me said the guide anxiously are you sure that rafaravavy is still safe  she is still safebut no one knows how long that may be for she is fearless and utters the forbidden prayers even in the presence of the queen  if it had not been for the love that ranavalona bears her she would have been tossed from the rock of hurling long ago  faithful even unto death said the guide with a look and tone in which pathos and triumph were strangely blended  she has not yet been tried to that extent but if she is god will enable her to stand firm said fisatra whose grave childlike sincerity when talking of religious subjects was not less impulsively honest and natural than were the outbursts of his fun when another humour stirred his feelings  the rock to which he alluded was a frightful precipice at one side of the city from which criminals were usually hurleda spot which is hallowed by the blood of many christian martyrs who perished there during the long reign of that tyrant queen ranavalona  has then the queen forbidden the christians to pray asked ravonino  have you not heardbut of course you have not being an outlaw and having only just returned  recently a very bad fit has come over the queen  you know that for some years past there have been a few french people living in antananarivo who by their knowledge and skill in mechanics and mercantile matters have made themselves useful to our government  these men lately tried to dethrone the queen on pretence of delivering the country from her cruelties and establishing a french protectorate  they gained over some of our chief men collected in one of their houses a large quantity of weapons and ammunition and had even fixed the night when the palace was to be invaded the queen seized and the protectorate set up  fortunately the plot came to my knowledge  i say fortunately because a bad queen is better than a french protectorate for the first will die but the latter might never end well i at once informed the queen who had the conspirators seized and banished from the country for ever  among them were a roman catholic lady and two jesuits  the anger of the queen was of course very great and she has had as i have said a very bad fit against the christians for as these unprincipled conspirators have the name though none of the reality of christians she naturally mixed us all up togetherand i know not what the end will be but i have much fear because the queen is very angry  has she done nothing yet asked ravonino  nothingexcept threaten and fume  but when the black cloud is overhead and muttering thunder is heard one knows too well what to expectespecially when one has been exposed to the storm in former years  the sun is shining behind the black cloud and it will break through when the master wills said laihova joining in the conversation for the first time that evening and looking earnestly at his friend ravonino as if the words were meant for his ear aloneas indeed they were  thanks thanks my friend for the comforting words said ravonino and i take shame to myself that my faith is so weak  you will spend the night with me said their host to the guide  no fisatra i dare not delay  even now i may be too late  i will journey all night  ravonino rose quickly and prepared to go  the others followed his example and soon the party was proceeding rapidly along the highroad towards the capital under a cloudless sky and a galaxy of twinkling stars    chapter thirteen  arrival at the capitalqueen ranavalonas troubles and perplexities  towards sunrise on the following morning our travellers on passing out of a rather dense piece of plantation which crowned the brow of a low hill came in sight of the capitalantananarivo  it was still in the far distance with many a ricefield and garden between but distinctly visible for it occupies the summit and slopes of a considerable hill  here then through the goodness of god we have reached the end of our journey said ravonino halting and i must remain behind while you my friends push on to the city  fain would i go with you but that would ruin all for i am a known and marked man  laihova will now guide you and tell you what to do  i have just one word for you at parting be peaceful do not take offence  interfere not with our customs  use not the fist and commit your way to god  the guide looked so pointedly at ebony while he spoke that that sable comrade could not help noticing it  what you looks so hard at me for hey demanded the negro  because you are somewhat hottempered and apt to get people into scrapes answered ravonino with a slight twinkle in his eye  me ottempered exclaimed ebony in surprise with an appealing glance at his comrades  id knock you down ravonino for sayin dat only it would be like as if what you says true  ob all de niggers on art is de meekest quietestjest like a babby why my moder always said so an surely she ought to know  no doubt she knew whatever she said observed hockins with a laugh  we will be careful said mark  but are your people then so particular that we should require this caution  well they are not very different from other people replied the guide and if things had been as usual i should have had no fear but when queen ranavalona has one of her bad fits theres no saying what she may do  her banishing the europeans is a bad sign  i would that i had not brought you here but there is no help for it now  we have been seen by many people  the news will spread to the town and if you did not soon appear you would be suspected as spies and the country would be scoured in search of you  no there is nothing for it now but a bold face and an honest purpose  humph ejaculated ebony yous a fine feller to talk bout bold faces an honest purpusses wen youre goin to steal a young ooman out ob de pallis fro under de bery nose ob do queen  to help rafaravavy to escape of her own free will is not theft replied the guide gravely  when we are persecuted in one city scripture advises us to flee to another  das true ravonino  no offence meant  gib us your flipper old boy  grasping the guides hand the negro shook it warmly and at the same time vowed that he would be most awrful careful and that he would bring rafaravavy to his feet dead or alive though he should have to fight the whole town singlehanded to effect his object  it was a thursday evening when they stood thus conversing  they had kept count of the days because of the guides quiet but firm determination to rest in camp on the sabbatha plan which although they had no very strong principle on the subject commended itself to the rest of the party because of the pleasant effect of the days rest on both soul and body for it afforded opportunity to have long and earnest talks with ravonino about the former days of persecution as well as quiet strolls alone or in couples andit must be admitted occasional slumbers in the cool shade of bush or tree  i have purposely contrived said the guide that by walking all night you shall arrive early tomorrowfridaybecause it is marketday in the town and you will be less noticed as well as more amused by what you see than if you were to arrive on any other day go and god go with you  i shall be found in the cave that laihova knows of  farewell  he turned with a wave of his hand as he spoke and reentered the bush while the others taking the most direct route to antananarivo descended into the open country  soon they were involved in the crowds which were passing along all the roads leading to the city  the people were either taking their goods for sale or going to make purchases mayhap to meet friends or kindred  all night laihova led his friends at a smart pace  next day as the first object of our travellers was to get into the town without attracting attention they kept in the thick of the throng all the way up to the marketplace  of course the people nearest them took special note of the two englishmen and some were inquisitive but by telling the simple facts regarding their arrival in madagascar laihova removed any unpleasant suspicions that might have arisen regarding them  the crowds increased as they advanced and the numbers were still further augmented as well as diversified by the hova army which they came upon exercising on a plain just below the city  ascending the sides of the steep hill on which antananarivo stands they obtained a magnificent view of the animated scene which conveyed the impression rather of a grand holiday than an ordinary marketday  this no doubt was largely owing to the operations of the soldiers whose manoeuvres hockins watched with a critical eye for his father having been a soldier had made him intimately acquainted with the drill as practised in the british army at that period  why i do believe the fellers are speakin english he said in some surprise  not wonder much for ingleesh drilld um said laihova who since they parted from ravonino had begun to use his broken english to the best of his power  it must be said that that power was not great even at the best  he explained to his friends that radama the firstthat wise king who had been so fond of the english and had done so much to aid the missionaries abolish the slavetrade and civilise his peoplehad among other changes remodelled his army after the british pattern and had obtained the services of noncommissioned officers from the mauritius to drill his troops  these organised them into divisions brigades regiments companies etcetera and as they found no native words suitable to express military evolutions they introduced their own english words of command which have remained in use ever since  by means of this army of hova troops and the flintlock weapon known familiarly as brown bess radama succeeded in subduing all the native chiefs of madagascar with only a few exceptions and thus became the recognised king of an island considerably larger than great britain being an enlightened and welldisposed monarch he made good use of the power thus acquired  it was only after his death in 1828 that a retrograde movement set in as we have said under the wicked queen ranavalona  it is one of the misfortunes of our fallen condition that rectitude in any course however good cannot long be maintainedat least in reasonable perfection  the army which had enabled radama to pursue on the whole a beneficent course ere long began to make its creator know its power  feeling his dependence on it radama adopted the unwise policy of increasing the military influence and weakening that of the civil officials the heads of the people and other functionaries whose position was derived from ancient political arrangements  public offices of honour and importance were given to military officers rather than to civilians and this unfair exaltation of the military over the civilian class led as it always does to tyranny and injustice  the system of service was in itself a gross form of injustice to the people for although the theory of service does not at first sight appear unjust the practice of it was very much so  more than the halfperhaps nearly twothirdsof the whole effective male population of the central province were enrolled either as officers or privates these received no pay except an occasional gift of a lamba and about a weeks rice during the year  the soldiers were indeed freed from money taxes in consideration of their service but this was small compensation for the hardships that it entailed  although the drills at ordinary times did not occur more frequently than for a day or two every fortnight much time was taken up in passing to and from the exercises especially in the case of those who lived at a distance and thus found it almost impossible to cultivate their own ricefields  frequently also the officers would not allow the men to return home without a money bribe  in short the private soldier was little better than a slavein some cases worsewhile the officers of the highest rank possessed unreasonable power  military rank was founded on a system which led to some absurdities  it was reckoned by numbers commencing with one honour for the private two honours for the corporal three for the sergeant and so on up to thirteen for a fieldmarshal of the higher ranka few having sixteen honours  those thus highly honoured were not numerous but the number of officers of lower grade was much greater in proportion to privates than in the british army  indeed from a third to a fourth of the army was composed of officers so that ta phairshon with his excess of pipers over fighting men would not have appeared very outrageous in the eyes of the malagasy troops  these officers had an eye to profitable business when not on service it is stated by the missionaries that when engaged in building their churches and schools they sometimes found they had a fieldmarshal for a foreman a colonel for mason or carpenter a major for bricklayer and so on  above the thirteenth rank the numbers were very few and of the sixteenth there were not above halfadozen  good stout courageous fellows were the men whom john hockins and his comrades saw that day manoeuvring below them on the plain of imahamasina men who although by no means comparable to european troops in precision of movement understood their work nevertheless and would have proved themselves formidable opponents to deal with in war laihova further informed them that the first man who organised the force was a sergeant brady who began his work in the year 1816 carried it on for many years and rose to the rank of majorgeneral in the service of king radama  after general bradys death the native officers continued the work on the same lines  but in costume and appearance these soldiers were what is familiarly known as a queer lot  the uniform of the rank and file consisted of a tunic and trousers of white material with a narrowbrimmed straw hat painted white crossbelts and cartoucheboxby no means an unbecoming dress  but it was worn only at drills and reviews and state ceremonies at other times when on duty soldiers went about almost naked and the contrast of their dirtywhite crossbelts with their brown breasts was curious to say the least while their straw hats and slovenly gait suggested anything but soldierly bearing  the variety of dress indulged in however by the crowd of officers was outrageous as well as mirthprovoking  why it seems to me said mark that every officer may put on what seemeth right in his own eyes  i see old regimental red coats and pantaloons hats and shakos that must have been worn a hundred years ago  i even see what looks at this distance like naval uniforms and cocked hats and no two of them seem to be dressed alike  mark looked inquiringly at laihova as he spoke but that dignified native merely smiled and made a slight inclination of his head as if to say just so thats the way we do it here  why do they let civilians mix wi them asked hockins pointing to a particular part of the field  to keep em cibil i spose suggested ebony  where asked laihova with a puzzled look  theredont you see em  fellers all in blackwith belltoppers beaverschimneypots oni dont know what you call em here  them be officers too said laihova  and this was true for the higher grades of officers usually appeared at drill in a full suit of black cloth with the common black silk hat doing duty as a helmet and contrasting oddly enough with the rough homemade scabbardless sword which was carried naked in the hand  on some occasions as our travellers afterwards learned these regiments turned out in every variety of costume with coats hats vests and trousers of all colours and patternsas if they had been got up by an extensive dealer in old clothes  this passion for variety even extended to the officers of the palace with whom however the material was of the best as well as gayestfor they were all gorgeously clad in blue and scarlet cloth and velvet with gold and silver lace embroidery feathers etceterabut what nation even in the socalled civilised world is free from barbarism in this respect  one pair of eyes beheld this review on that friday with something of fiendish satisfaction  these belonged to no less a personage than queen ranavalona herself  high up on the balcony of her palace she sat under the shade of a scarlet umbrella  that very day she had had an angry interview with her prime minister rainiharo in reference to her only child prince rakota who was a young man of mild gentle disposition as kind to the christians as his mother was cruel and unjust  indeed it was believed that he himself was among the christians for he dared openly to defend them before his mother and often protected them secretly from her violence  rainiharo the prime minister on the contrary was their bitter foe and in his interview with the queen above mentioned had ventured to accuse the prince of aiding in the protection of those who practised the proscribed religion  the one redeeming point in the character of ranavalona was her love for this son  when asked to punish the prince for his conduct she would say in tones of tenderness that seldom issued from her lips is he not my sonmy only son  alas she had little pity for the son or daughter of any one else whether only or otherwise  the dress of ranavalona as she sat in her balcony under her scarlet umbrella observing the troops was gorgeous but the greater part of it was hidden under the voluminous folds of the scarlet lamba of finest english broadcloth with which her person was enveloped  here and there however portions of a rich silk dress of european manufacture could be seen as well as various gold and silver rings bracelets chains charms and ornaments of ivory  scarlet being the royal colour only the sovereign is entitled to wear the scarlet lamba or use the scarlet umbrella  the queens lamba was ornamented heavily with goldlace  her head was not much decorated but her hair was anointed with that hideous horror of the sickroom castoroil the odour of which however was disguised or rather mixed with a leaf which smelt like nutmeg  i will submit to this no longer said the queen with a stern frown have i not said it  is the will of ranavalona to be thwarted  this remark was in the conversation above mentioned made to the prime minister a stern old man dressed in a scarlet coat with huge gold epaulettes and profusely braided with goldlace blue pantaloons also goldlaced and a magnificent brazensheathed sword  he stood at the queens elbow with a perplexed expression of countenance being the bearer of news about the effect of which he felt uncertain  but rainiharo was a bold man as well as a bad one  your will madam is sure to be thwarted he replied as long as you suffer prince rakota to act as he pleases  your son is a christian  he prays with the christians and encourages them in this new doctrine  we are lost if your majesty does not stop the prince in his strange selfwilled ways  but repeated the queen he is my sonmy only my beloved son  let him do what he pleases  if he wishes to be a christian let himhe is my beloved son  but madam urged rainiharo who hated rakota if your son resists your will what becomes of the government  i know that rakota  cease to speak to me of rakota interrupted the queen impatiently he is my son i tell you  i love him  let him alonehe will not disobey me  prince ramonja it is said has also joined the christians continued the minister with a slightly cynical expression  is this true demanded ranavalona fiercely while she seemed to grind her teeth in wrath  i have reason to believe it  let inquiry be made and if it proves to be true said the queen sternly let ramonja be deprived of all his military honours reduce him to the ranks and fine him heavily  but he is your own nephew madam returned the minister simply yet with a touch of sarcasm in his tone  it matters not  it is of our mercy that he does not die as many others have died before him  let my orders be obeyed if ramonja is guilty  let him be a warning to others in the palace for it has come to my ears that some of our courtiers are hankering after this religion that seems to have turned my people mad  indeed it is said that some related to yourself are among them  she looked pointedly at rainiharo as she spoke and the prime minister winced for he had lately discovered that his own son was among the number of the praying people  recovering himself in a moment however he merely said that he was not aware of any of his kindred having fallen away from the customs of their ancestors  i hope not returned the queen darkly for degradation and slavery if not death await them if they do  go  let a proclamation be made today in the marketplace  let my people and the army know that i have resolved to extinguish christianity  tell those officers who have become christians or have taken any part in religious teaching that they shall lose their honours  they have transgressed my laws and deserve death but through the supplications of the people of imerina their lives are spared  but their honours i say shall be thrown into the river and carried over the cataract of ifarahantsana for they are trying to change the customs of our ancestors  of some half the honours shall be thrown into the river  of others onethird of their honours shall be thrown in and some shall lose all their honours the precise number shall be in proportion to their offences  moreover continued the angry woman as she worked herself into a state of great wrath there must be no more praying no more psalmsinging among my people no more  she stopped suddenly and listened while the veins in her neck and forehead seemed to swell almost to bursting for at that moment the clear notes of a sweet female voice came from some distant part of the palace and broke softly on her ear  there was no mistaking the nature of the music for the queen had long been familiar with the music of the psalms in which the praying people were wont to sing praise to the name of jesus  who sings she asked with a fierce look at rainiharo  the prime minister again gave vent to a very slight touch of sarcasm as he replied i think it is rafaravavy  this time the queen noted the tone and sharply ordered her minister to be gone and do her bidding  now rafaravavy was a lady of the palace as we have said and a great favourite with her royal mistress but the queens affection for the girl had been severely tested since the latter showed symptoms of a leaning towards the christian religion  it is probable that ranavalona would have cared little as to what her favourite thought about christianity if she had only kept quiet but rafaravavy was one of those earnest straightforward souls who are prone to act in accordance with their conscientious beliefs without regard to consequences  she did not indeed go about endeavouring to proselytise the household for she was naturally timid softhearted and meek but she made no attempt to conceal her opinions and her sympathy with the persecuted christians she had even gone the length of interceding for them once or twice when she found her mistress in an amiable mood but the explosion of wrath which resulted warned her not to presume again in that way  for some time ranavalona sat brooding over the mystery of that religion which notwithstanding all her power and cruelty she had after so many years of tyranny been unable to suppress  then she sent for rafaravavy  the girl who in a few minutes entered her presence was possessed of no ordinary beauty  her delicate features and oval face were much lighter in complexion than those of the other ladies of the court resembling rather those of a spanish brunette than a hova beauty  her eyes were large soft and lustrous her nose was straight and thin and her mouth small with an expression of habitual gravity which made her smile when it came all the more attractive  little wonder that poor ravonino had lost his heart to her for besides beauty of countenance the girl was endowed with a sylphlike form a sprightly disposition and the sweet grace of humility  you have disobeyed me rafaravavy said the queen as she entered  forgive me answered the girl in a low musical voice  i did not think my song of praise would reach your ear  it was meant only for my god and saviour  is your god then deaf that you must sing so loud asked the queen sharply  he is not deaf blessed be his name exclaimed the maiden with enthusiasm neither is his arm shortened that it cannot save  oh if you  stop cried the angry queen you have presumed to talk to me thus too often  you deserve to die for singing psalms  have you given up praying since i forbade it  there was that in the voice of ranavalona which alarmed the girl and caused her to tremble as she replied with some hesitation that she still prayed  instead of giving way to another burst of passion the queen adopted a bantering tone and said  come rafaravavy tell me what you pray for  i pray for the pardon of my sins  is that all  surely you pray for something more than that  something nice that you want very much  yes continued the girl becoming somewhat pale yet praying silently for courage even while she spoke  yes i pray for the pardon ofof your sins and  go on  why do you stop  and that your eyes may be opened that you may see the king in his beauty and be drawn to him by the cords of love so that you may cease to persecute the christians and learn to join with them in praising the name of jesus who redeemed us from destruction and is ready and willing to save us from our sins  while rafaravavy was speaking ranavalona put her hand over her eyes when the former ceased she did not remove the hand but said in a tone which the poor girl could not quite understand  go  enough  leave me  as rafaravavy left the balcony a prepossessing youth of delicate form and gentle mien emerged upon it by another door  mother he said earnestly do do give me leave to recall your proclamation  i have just heard of it from rainiharo  believe me many of the nobles are not so goodi mean so guiltyas you think  and the poor christianswhy should they not pray and sing  it is all that you have left to them for they no longer dare to worship together in the churches  no rakota i will not recall it  your constant pleading worries me it is enough to say that the people shall be examinedby the tangena ordeal if necessaryand they shall be punished according to their deserts  is that all that you come here for my son  it was evident from her tone that ranavalona relented a little though her words were firmly spoken  i came also to tell you said the prince that the europeans whom your spies brought news of some time ago have arrived  they are even now in the marketplace  by my orders the guards have let them pass without question  always interfering rakota said the queen angrily  why were they not seized and guarded till i should find time to speak with them  because mother that would scarcely be a civil way of receiving strangers  strangers  spies you should have said  have you forgotten the ungrateful frenchmen who so lately tried to overturn my government  but these are not frenchmen  they are english said the prince and i will answer for them being good and true men  no doubt english are better than frenchat least i hate them less but they are all palefaced liars and christians and none of them shall remain in my land  but how can you tell boy that they are good and true men  have you had speech with them  not i returned the prince  i have only seen them as they entered the town but that was enough  one glance satisfied me of their being true men  when the sun rises it needs not much wisdom to know that there is heat and light  an honest face is like the sun  you cannot fail to know it  go foolish boy  you are too confident  i will not tolerate europeans  these men shall be arrested  hence and send hither an officer  finding that the queen was not in a temper to be trifled with rakota wisely made no reply but bowed and went his way  in delivering the message to the officer however he whispered such words to him as secured a little delay in the execution of the royal commands    chapter fourteen  the prime minister lays deep plansso does his nephewthe great marketplacea friend in deadly peril and our three heroes come to grief  returning to his own quarters in the palace and chafing to find that some one had informed the queen about his sons defection rainiharo encountered a favourite nephew named soa who had also unknown to his uncle given up idolatry and like prince ramonja been led to embrace the gospel through the instrumentality of prince rakota  well met soa said the premier i have a proclamation to make which will bring sorrow to the hearts of some of these hated christians  he paused a moment as if in thought and soa a finelooking young man of pleasant countenance and agile frame seemed about to reply but checked himself  now my boy resumed the old man i have a piece of work for you to do  you have heard of the arrival of the englishmen  yes uncle  well i have reason to believe that they have been led hither by that son of a thunderbolt ravoninohitriniony and that he is even now in hiding in the neighbourhood  at the gate you will find one of our spies who will conduct you to the cavern in which he lies concealed of course i could have him seized at once if i chose but i have a deeper game to play and want to make ravoninohitriniony an unwitting instrument  it seems that more of the people in the palace are christians than i knew of  it has come to my ears that some of these intend going stealthily to the cave to meet ravoninohitriniony for they are fond of this son of a wildboar and probably hope to have news by him of their banished kindred  lest it should be supposed that we are putting flippant expressions into the mouth of rainiharo we may explain that the malagasy define an ungrateful man as the son of a thunderbolt and sometimes as the offspring of a wildboar becauseso they saythe young of the wildboar when running by the side of its dam continually gets in advance and turns round to bite her  the ingratitude of which our friend ravonino was supposed to be guilty consisted in his having forsaken the idols of the country and renounced the favour of the queen by becoming a christian preferring like moses to suffer affliction with the banished people of god  no doubt continued the premier they will be praying and psalmsinging  now knowing your detestation of these christians i have resolved to send you to their meeting as a christian  you are wise enough to know how to act when among them  take note of the men and women you see there whether high or low make out a list of them and bring it to me  death and chains shall be their portion for i am fully more determined than the queen is to stamp out this religion  go and do as i bid ye as quickly as you can  for a few seconds the youth stood perplexed and irresolute  then he said suddenly yes uncle i will go according to your bidding as a christian and hastily left the room  meanwhile mark breezy and his companions led by laihova followed the throng of countryfolk to the marketplace  they had passed the guard at the gate by means of that potent talisman silver before which few gates are permanently closed  if the party had sought to pass with any pomp or circumstance or if they had carried merchandise along with them they could not have passed so easily but laihova had only to bestow some bits of silver on the guard and the way was at once clear they might have passed without it however had they known of rakotas interference in their favour  we speak of bits of silver advisedly for the malagasy take the simplest and most literal way of making small change they clip their dollars into little pieces of various sizes and therewith transact the business that in other lands is settled with pence  as these clippings are not very accurate however they weigh the pieces and for this purpose every one carries about with him a tiny pair of scales in his waistcloth  these dollars were all foreign coins for the malagasy at that time had and we believe still have no native coinage  all silver that comes to their net is considered good fish  the standard coin is the spanish dollar but one will find every variety of european and american money in circulation among them  the method of clipping and weighing the small change might be thought somewhat cumbrous in european markets for the dollar is cut up into eight sikajy each about sixpence the sikajy into nine eranambatra and each eranambatra into ten varyventy each of which last is about the weight of a plump grain of rice  four weights marked with a government stamp are used in weighing the money  these weights are equal respectively to about a halfadollar a quarterdollar sixpence and fourpence  other amounts are obtained by varying these in the opposite scales and adding grains of rice  but all this forms no difficulty in madagascar  like most easterns the natives there dearly love to haggle and prolong a bargainas our travellers found to their amusement that day for not only were the principals vociferous in their disputatious but the bystanders entered into the spirit of the thing and volunteered their opinions  profound was the interest of the white men in this market and deep was the absorption of ebony for that amiable negro had a faculty of totally forgetting himself and absolutely projecting himself into the shoes of other people thus identifying himself with their interestsa faculty which cost him many anxious indignant pathetic and hilarious moments  das a most straornary sight he said looking round with glistening eyes and expanded lips at the crowds of people who pressed along the road leading to zoma the great marketplace  by the way they stare at you ebony said hockins they evidently think you something straornary  not at all ockins  yous wrong as usual retorted the negro  dey quite used to black mans but i tink dis de fust time dat some ob dem hab saw a man wid a face like putty  there was indeed some ground for the negros remark for the people crowded round our heroes and gazed at them with undisguised interest  the marketplace was well suited to give some idea of the various types of countenance among the different tribes from distant parts of the island also for making acquaintance with the products of the country and the manufactures of the people  it was a sort of museum and centre of commerce combined with all the varied incidents comical semitragic and otherwise for which markets in general are more or less famed  here were to be seen great heaps of earthenware of red claypans for cooking rice waterjars bottles and dishes of all sorts as well as english crockery especially that with the old willowpattern design there were great varieties of straw hats beautifully made of rice and other straw  elsewhere might be seen ironwork of native manufacture some of it displaying considerable taste and skilful workmanship  there were also beds with wellturned posts made of a wood like mahogany and the mattresses for these were stuffed with down from a certain flower which made soft and comfortable couches  lambas of many kinds were also to be seen from those of coarse rofia cloth to those of finer and more ornamental materialthough the finest silk lambas and the more expensive european goods were not often exposed for sale there but were to be had at the houses of the traders and manufacturers  one part of the market was devoted to wood for the rafters and framework of houses another to the sale of vegetables and fruitsamong which were sweet potatoes manioc beans maize peaches bananas mangoes pineapples oranges lemons pumpkins melons grapes cape gooseberries mulberries guavas pomegranates and many others besides breadfruit and ricewhich last is the staple food of the people  oh  i say ockins whispered ebony at this point my mouts awaterin  well mines somethin in the same way returned the seaman but we havent a rap to buy with  whether laihova overheard the whisper or not we cannot tell but he stopped at that moment purchased a large quantity of the tempting fruit and handed it without a word to his friends who received it with becoming gratitude  yous a trump hovey said the negro as he put a whole peach into his capacious mouth  ditto said hockins performing the same feat with a banana  do i hear music said mark breezy  an dont i smell rum remarked hockins  an doesnt i hear cackling inquired ebony  by way of answer to all three laihova turned round the corner of a stall when the party reached a spot which was devoted to the sale of native rum or toakaa coarse fiery spirit made from sugarcane and sold at a very low price  here a native musician was discovered twanging a native guitar either as an accompaniment to the cackling of hundreds of fowls and the gobbling of innumerable turkeys or as a desperate effort to beat these creatures at their own game of noise  on inquiry mark found that fowls were sold at from fourpence to eightpence apiece geese and turkeys from a shilling to eighteenpence also that beef and vegetables were proportionally cheap  it seems to me remarked hockins as they moved slowly along enjoying the fruit and the scene that this here island is a sort of paradise  before many minutes were over the seaman had reason to change his views considerably on this point for their guide led them to a spot where the slavemarket was held  the sights they witnessed there were such as filled the hearts of the white men with deep sorrow and indignation while it drew tears from the eyes of the sympathetic negro  for the men and women and children were no mere criminals who might in some sense be deserving of their fatethough such there were also amongst thembut many of the men were guilty of political offences only and not a few both of men and women were martyrs who because they had left the faith of their fathers and become followers of jesus christ were sold into temporaryin some cases perpetualslavery with their wives and families  at sight of these unfortunates laihova was evidently much affected though he made strenuous efforts to conceal his feelings  you are grieved i see said mark in a tone of profound sympathy which touched his guides heart  grieved  yesverily said laihova whose broken english was much interlarded with scriptural words and expressions for does i not see my friends there  but com  they must not know me  it is danger com  he led them quickly away from the slavemarket and as they walked along he explained that some of the poor slaves whom they had just seen thus publicly exposed for sale were among the nobles of the landnot only in regard to human rank but in right of that patent which man can neither give nor take awayan upright regenerated soul  he further explained as best he could that slaves in his land were derived from three or four different sourcesnamely captives taken in war persons condemned to slavery for crime for political offences and for religious opinions people who had been sold for debt and the descendants of all of these  they had gradually quitted the market while thus engaged in conversation and were ascending one of the steeper parts of the city when their attention was attracted by a shouting not faroff  presently they observed a number of men and boys running in and out amongst the houses and the low walls which surrounded them as if in chase of something  soon a man was seen to dart along the road they were following  as he drew near they observed that he stumbled as he ran yet forced the pace and panted violentlylike one running for his life  a few moments more and the crowd was close at his heels pelting him with stones and yelling like wild beasts  the fugitive turned up a narrow lane between high walls close to where our party stood  he was closely followed by the crowd  at this point some of the pursuers stopped as if from exhaustion  what has he done said laihova to one of these  he has been stealing in the market by cutting a lamba  it is the practice to carry money tied up in a corner of the lamba and thieves by cutting off this corner sometimes manage to secure the money  a great cry arose just then and some of the pursuers came running back  he is down said one  he is dead said another  now our friend hockins was one of those men who have at all times an irresistible tendency to take the part of the weak against the strong without much regard to the cause of battle  he instantly without a word ran off at full speed to the rescue  ebony ran after him from sympathy  mark breezy followed from the natural desire to keep by his comrades and back them up while laihova followedno doubt from goodfellowship  they soon came upon the poor man who was completely naked bruised and bleeding and surrounded by a crowd of youths who were deliberately stoning him as if he were a dangerous animal or a mad dog  with a roar like a lion hockins went at them  he tripped up some halfdozen big boys flattened still more the flat noses of some of the men stretching them flat on their backs and then standing astride the fallen man flourished his enormous fists and invited the entire population of antananarivo to come on  the population refused the invitation and retired  ebony was not slow to follow suit with this variation that instead of roaring he yelled and instead of bestriding the fallen man he gave sudden chase hither and thither with powerful effect rendering the rout complete  meanwhile mark attended to the injured man who seemed to be dead turning him over on his back he discovered to his inexpressible amazement that he was no other than their old friend mambathe crocodilewhom they had left with his mother and the others in the cave many days before  how is it possible he exclaimed while dressing his wounds that he can have arrived at the same time with us for we started before him and have travelled fast  laihova explained that mamba was one of the fleetest men in the island and that he could easily have passed them though starting later than they did  but why he had come and why he had passed instead of overtaking and travelling with them he could not even guess  as most of poor mambas wounds were bruises and the few cuts were not deep his four friends raised him and carried him quickly into a neighbouring house the door of which was immediately shut  laihova explained that it was the house of a personal friend of his own who was also a christian but secretly for fear of the queen  here mamba was sufficiently brought round by marks ministrations to be able to sit up and answer questions but at first he seemed disinclined to speak and then gave evasive replies  why this secrecy my friend asked laihova in the native language  if i could answer said mamba there would be no secrecy  true and i would not pry into your secrets returned laihova but we would help you if we can  you cannot help me returned mamba in a somewhat sad tone  i have business in hand which requires haste  i have tried to keep clear of you to prevent delay and to avoid mixing myself up in your dangers for you are in danger here  i would not have come near the town at all but i required to make a purchase in the market and hoped to do so without being recognised  unfortunately an old enemy saw me  he fell on the device of cutting off the corner of his own lamba and then raising the cry of thief pretended that i had done it  i ran  you know my speed of foot  i trusted to that instead of trusting to my god  they surrounded me  you know the end  while mamba was yet speaking a loud knocking was heard at the door and a stern voice demanded admittance  on hearing it mamba leaped from the couch on which he had been laid as if nothing were the matter with him  he glanced hastily round  the owner of the house seemed to divine his wishes for he pointed to a small window which opened into what appeared to be a court at the back of the dwelling  the window was merely a square opening which appeared scarcely wide enough to let a mans shoulders pass but mamba did not hesitate  to the amazement of mark and his friends he took what is familiarly known as a header through the windowa la harlequinand disappeared  to the still greater amazement of mark and his friends laihova instantly followed suit without a word of explanation  indeed there was no time for that  a moment after the owner of the dwelling opened the door with a very submissive look and admitted a band of armed men  the leader of the band from his dress and bearing was evidently a man of position  he carried in his hand a large spear highly ornamented with silver  this weaponas mark afterwards learnedwas an official spear with the queens name engraven on it  the bearer of it as well as the spear itself was named tsitialainga which means hater of lies  turning to the owner of the house the hater of lies sternly asked some questions of him but as he spoke in the native tongue he was unintelligible to our travellers whose spirits were not cheered by the scowling looks of the armed men  whatever the question was the answer appeared to be unsatisfactory for the hater of lies immediately turned to his men and pointing with the silver spear to the three strangers gave them a command  instantly they sprang upon mark and his companions and seized them both hockins and ebony were for a moment paralysed by surprise then their impulsive souls being stirred by a sudden gush of indignation they gathered themselves up for a mighty burst which would certainly have resulted in disaster of some sort if mark had not recovered presence of mind in time  submitsubmit he shouted in a loud voice of authority  then in a sharp but lower tone it is our only chance  dont resist  with feelings of something like despair the two men obeyed  a few minutes more and they were bound led through the streets surrounded by a guard which alone protected them from death at the hands of the angry populace  then they were cast into a dark prison loaded with chains and left to their reflections    chapter fifteen  the spies and the secret meetingthe prime minister foiled by the prince  the sun was setting the air was balmy the face of nature was beautiful the insects and birds were buzzing humming and chirping happily as if there were no such things as care and sorrow in the wide world when soa the prime ministers nephew with his guide approached the forest in which was the cavern where the persecuted christians had arranged to hold their secret meeting  i am to go as a christian thought soa as he walked on swiftly and in silence as a christian hypocrite and spy  the young mans countenance relaxed into something like a smile as he thought thus then it became solemnised as he offered the silent prayer lord enable me to do the work honestly and well  the way was long but the youths limbs were strong and agile so that night had not long overspread the land when he reached the end of his journey  the night was unusually darkwell adapted for deeds of secrecy and crime  if it had been lighter the two spies would have seen a number of men and women and even children hurrying along stealthily in the same direction with themselves  they observed only two or three of these however who chanced to fall in their way  they loomed up suddenly like spectres out of the surrounding darkness and as quickly melted into it again  soa paid no attention to these apparitions neither did he utter a word to his companion during the journey  most of the way he kept a pace or two in advance of his guide but when they reached the more intricate and broken grounds of the forest he fell behind and suffered the other to lead  at last the path wound so much among broken rocks and over steep knolls that their progress became very slowall the more so that the overshadowing trees rendered the darkness profound  sometimes they had to clamber up steep places on hands and knees  suddenly they were arrested by what seemed to them a faint cry or wail listening intently they perceived that the sounds were musical  the christians are singing said the spy in a tone which low though it was betrayed a touch of contempt  they hold their meeting in a cave on the other side of this mound  remain here then till i return to you said soa  they know you to be a spy  they will not suppose that i have come in such a capacity  the man gave vent to a slight laugh at the supposed joke and sat down while the courtier advanced alone  on the other side of the mound the sounds which had reached the listeners ears as a wail now swelled upon the young man as a wellknown hymn in which he had many times joined  a feeling of joy almost amounting to triumph filled his heart as he stood there listening  while he listened he observed several indistinct forms glide past him and enter the cave  he crept after them  a strange sight met his eyes  the cave was so large and high that the single torch which burned in it merely lighted up a portion of the wall against which it was fixed  even in the immediate neighbourhood of the torch things were more or less indistinct while all else was shrouded in darkness profound  here more than a hundred dusky figures were assembledthose furthest from the light melting as it were into the darkness and leaving the imagination to people illimitable space with similar beings  soa slipped in and sat down on a jutting rock near the entrance just as the hymn was closing  few people observed him  immediately after an old man who sat nearest the light rose to pray  beside him stood our friend ravonino  on the other side sat a young man with a remarkably intelligent countenance  with intense earnestness and great simplicity the old man prayed in the name of jesus that the holy spirit might bless their meeting and deliver them from the power of their enemies  he also prayed with much emphasis that their enemies might be turned into christian friendsat which petition a loud amen arose from the worshippers  now totosy will speak said the old man after a brief pause turning to the young man with the intelligent countenance  let the word be brought forth  stop cried a man rising in the midst of the crowd it may not be safe to bring out the word just now  why not my son asked the old man  are not all here tonight our friends  i think not returned the man  as i came along i saw one of the queens spies who is wellknown to me  he was walking with the nephew of our deadly foe rainiharo and soa himself sits there  he turned as he spoke and pointed straight at soa who rose at once and advanced to the front  my friends he said in a gentle voice the last speaker is right  i am here and i was led here by one of the queens spies  but the spy is not here  he awaits me outside  let two of your young men guard the entrance of the cave so that our conference may not be overheard  two stalwart youths rose at once and hurried to the outside of this primitive meetinghouse where they mounted guard  i have been sent continued soa by my uncle with orders to enter your meeting as a christian take note of your names and report them to him  there was a tendency on the part of some to shrink into the background on hearing this  now continued soa i have come to obey only part of his orders  i have come as a christian to warn you of the dangers that surround you  the queen is exceeding mad against you  it will be your wisest course to refrain from meeting together just now and rest content with worshipping in your own homes  but let not this distress you my friends  the god whom we love is able to turn darkness into light and to make crooked things straight  neither let it break up our meeting just now  we are safe at present  let us get out the word and enjoy the worship of our saviour while we may  there were murmurs of assent and satisfaction at the close of this brief address and one of the young men with gravealmost mysteriouslooks took up a small spade and went towards that part of the wall where ravonino sat  the latter rose to let the young men get at a particular spot which was marked on the wall with a smallalmost imperceptible red square  here after turning up a few spadefuls of earth he struck upon a stone  lifting it he disclosed a hole about a foot square  the old man who presided at the meeting thrust his hands into this hole and gently lifted out a thick volume which he laid reverently upon a flat rock that formed a sort of natural table in front of him  this was the word to which reference had been madean old muchsoiled and worn malagasy bible which had been buried there so that whatever might become of its christian owners it might escape being found and condemned to the flames as so many of its fellows had been  it was a curious bible this in more respects than one  in madagascar the bible was printed first in sections by the natives under the superintendence of the missionaries these sections got scattered for teaching purposes and various editions of different sizes were printed at different times  the original ownerif we may not call him fabricatorof the bible now referred to as having been dug up in the cave must in his desire to possess the word of god complete have been at considerable pains to secure every fragment and leaf that came in his way and then had them all bound together  a clasp of leather and a european hookandeye fastened the edges  the different portions of course did not fit exactly and some of the verses necessarily overlapped  nevertheless a nearly complete and substantial bible was the result of his labours  see note 1  taking up the treasured book with great care the young man before mentioned by the name of totosy opened it and selected a text  fear not little flock it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom  from this he preached an admirable sermon full of hope and consolation to men and women situated as his companions were at that time and holding up jesus not only as the deliverer of the world from sin but from fear of physical death  strengthening of this sort truly was muchneeded for during the previous persecutions of 1837 and 1849 queen ranavalona had given terrible evidence of her fierce and relentless nature so that christians were now well aware of what they had to expect if another cruel fit came upon her  the sermon finished another hymn was sung followed by a prayer after which before finally breaking up and dispersing the worshippers collected in various groups and exclamations of surprise joy and fervent thanksgiving were heard now and again when friends who had parted as enemies on account of religious differences unexpectedly met as brothers in the lord  it has ever been a result of persecution that the persecuted cause has made progressnaturally so for trial and suffering winnow out the chaff and leave the good seed to flourish with increased vigour  few false professors attended those midnight meetings which were so full of joy and danger and none of these ever got the length of ranavalonas fiery stakes or the fearful rock of hurling  for fully a quarter of a century from 1836 to 1861 did the persecution of the native christians last in madagascar  during most of that dark period queen ranavalona the first endeavoured by cruel prohibitive laws torture and death to stamp out the love of christ from her dominions  through most of that period she tried to prevent her people from meeting for worship praying to god in the name of christ or reading the scriptures or any other christian book and those who disobeyed her did so at the risk of losing property liberty or life  nevertheless in spite of this worship was kept up in secretin secluded villages in recesses of the forest in caves even in riceholes the word was read faithful natives preached and baptism and the lords supper were continuously observed  small portions of scriptureeven leaveswere carefully treasured and passed from hand to hand until these calamities were past and now at the present time the church in madagascar is ten times stronger than ever it was before  of course active persecution was not maintained throughout the whole period of twentyfive years  the volcano smouldered at times  for brief periods it almost seemed as if about to become extinct but at intervals it burst forth with renewed violence  at the time of which we write 1857 there were mutterings of the volcano and portents in the air which filled the persecuted ones and those who loved them with grave anxiety  in a dark corner of the cavern soa and ravonino stood apart after the service was over and conversed in subdued tones  do you think the lives of my comrades are in danger asked the latter anxiously  it is difficult to answer that replied soa  the queen fears to offend the english by putting european subjects to death but she is in a savage mood just now and your friends have intermeddled with matters that they would have been wise to let alone  banishment is more likely to be their fate but that will be almost equal to death  how so asked ravonino  because ranavalona will probably treat them as she treated the europeans who lately tried to overthrow her government  she sent them down to the coast with orders to their conductors to keep them so long on the wayespecially on the unhealthy feverstricken parts of the routethat sickness might have time to kill them  and was the plan successful  not quite for the white people turned out to be tough  they managed to get away from our island alive but in a state of health i believe that will very likely prevent them from ever wishing to return  i have much love for these men said ravonino after a pause  you have influence with rainiharo  can you not befriend them  i shall have little influence now with my uncle returned soa sadly for i am a christian and he will soon discover that  but i will help them if i canfor your sake  and rafaravavy said ravonino in a lower voice do you think she can be induced to fly  if she were brought to me here i should have little difficulty in taking her to a place of safety  the difficulties in your way are greater than you suppose said soa the queens spies and soldiers are out all over the land  even now were it not that i am your friend and brother in jesus you would have been caught here as in a trap  besides there is the greater difficulty that rafaravavy is filled with fidelity to her royal mistress and pities her so much that she will not leave her  you know that she openly confesses christ in the palace yet so great is the queens regard for her that she will not listen to my uncle who would gladly see her tossed over the rock of hurling  i had converse with her the other day and i see that she even hopes to be the instrument of the queens conversion to christianity  god bless her exclaimed ravonino fervently  amen returned soa and i doubt not that the blessing will come though it may not come in the way we hope  it is no easy matter to say thy will be done when we are suffering  prince rakota has done much for the christians in time past urged poor ravonino who felt that all hope of delivering the girl he loved at the present time from the dangers that surrounded her was gradually slipping away from him surely he can and will protect her  i fear he has not the power answered soa  he has interfered in behalf of the christians so often of late that the queen is losing patience and you know that if she once gives way to her cruel rage the life of rakota himself is not safe  but you may trust me my friend i will do my best to move him to aid youand your friends also  most of the people had left the cave while these two were conversing with the understanding that they were not to return as it was no longer a safe retreat  another and more distant rendezvous was however appointed the treasured bible was not restored to its old place of concealment but carried off by totosy the young preacher to be reburied in a new place of refuge  do you follow them asked soa of ravonino when the others had all gone and they were about to part  no  my companions will come here expecting to find me if they escape i must remain whatever befalls  if the soldiers come i will see them before they arrive and give them the slip  if they give chase they will find it troublesome to catch me  when soa returned to the city he went straight to the apartments of the prime minister whom he found impatiently awaiting him  you have been long said the latter  the distance is great replied the nephew  well exclaimed the uncle inquiringly  you ordered me to act as a christian returned the young man with a slight smile and you know it takes time to do that  truetrue  and you have brought me the list  no uncle  what mean you boy  i mean that i have obeyed your first command i have been to the christian meeting as a christian  a puzzled inquiring look overspread the premiers countenance  well what then  well then of course i acted the part of a christian to the best of my power  i told them why i had been sent warned them of the evil intended them and advised them to escape for their lives but as no immediate danger was to be feared i joined them in their worship  and you have brought no list  none  rainiharos visage while his nephew spoke was a sight to behold for the conflicting emotions aroused produced a complexity of expression that is quite indescribable  young man he said sternly you have disobeyed my orders  why have you done this  your head must fall for you show that you are a christian  with great simplicity and gentleness soa said  yes my uncle i am a christian and if you please you may put me to death for i do pray to jesus  utterly confounded by this straightforward and fearless reply rainiharo stood for some moments gazing in silent wonder at the youth who thus calmly stood prepared to abide the consequences of his confession  at first it almost seemed as if in his anger he would with his own hand then and there inflict the punishment he threatened but once again as in the case of ranavalona love proved more powerful than anger  no no boy he said turning away with a wave of his hand as if to dismiss the subject finally you shall not die  it is a delusion  you deceive yourself  go  leave me  soa obeyed and went straight to the apartment of prince rakota to relate to that fast friend and comrade his recent adventures and consult with him about the dark cloud that threatened to burst in persecution over the unhappy land    note 1  a bible of the kind here described may now be seen in the museum of the british and foreign bible society 146 queen victoria street london just as it was dug up out of the earth where it had been buried by christian natives who probably perished in the persecutions  the new testament bears the date of 1830 the old testament that of 1835    chapter sixteen  in prisoneffects of a first sight of torture  a new day had begun cattle were lowing on the distant plain and birds were chirping their matutinal songs in bush and tree when mark breezy john hockins and james gingeralias ebonyawoke from their uneasy rest on the prison floor and sat up with their backs against the wall their chains rattled sharply as they did so  well now said hockins gasping forth his morning yawn in spite of circumstances ive many a time read and heard it of other folk but i never did think i should live to hear my own chains rattle  right you are ockins ob course is got de same sentiments zactly said the negro lifting up his strong arm and ruefully surveying the heavy iron links of native manufacture that descended from his wrist  mark only sighed  it was the first time he had ever been restrained even by bolt or bar much less by manacles and the effect on his young mind was at first overwhelming  bright though the sun was outside very little of its light found a passage through the chinks of their all but windowless prisonhouse so that they could scarcely see the size or character of the place  but this mattered little  they were too much crushed by their misfortune to care  for some time they sat without speaking each feeling quite incapable of uttering a word of cheer to his fellows  the silence was suddenly but softly broken by the sound of song  it seemed to come from a very dark corner of the prison in which nothing could be seen  to the startled prisoners it sounded like heavenly musicand indeed such it was for in that corner sat two christian captives who were spending the first minutes of the new day in singing praise to god  the three comrades listened with rapt attention for although the words were unintelligible with the exception of the name of jesus the air was quite familiar being one of those in which englishspeaking christians are wont to sing praise all the world over  when the hymn ceased one of the voices was raised in a reverent and continuous tone which was obviously the voice of prayer  just as the petition was concluded the sun found a loophole in the prison and poured a flood of light into it which partly illumined the dark corner and revealed two men seated on the ground with their backs against the wall  they were finelooking men nearly naked and joined together by means of a ponderous piece of iron above two feet long with a heavy ring at either end which encircled their necks  the rings were so thick that their ends must have been forced together with sledgehammer and anvil after being put round the mens necks and then overlapped and riveted  thus it became impossible to free them from their fetters except by the slow and laborious process of cutting them through with a file  several old and healedup sores on the necks and collarbones of both men indicated that they and their harsh couplings had been acquainted for a long time and one or two inflamed spots told all too clearly that they had not yet become quite reconciled  see note 1  now isnt that awful said john hockins in a low voice with a sort of choke in it to think that these poor fellowswi that horrible thing that cant be much under thirty pounds weight on their necks an that must ha bin there for months if not for yearsare singin an prayin to the almighty an here am i john hockins with little or nothin to complain of as yet havent given so much as a thought to  the choke got the better of our sailor at this point and he became suddenly silent  das so burst in ebony with extreme energy  is wid you dere  i tell you what it is ockins dem brown niggers is true kistians an we white folks is nuffin but hipperkrits  i hope were not quite so bad as that ebony said mark with a sad smile  nevertheless hockins is rightwe are far behind these poor fellows in submission and gratitude to our maker  while he spoke the heavy door of the prison opened and a jailor entered with two large basins of boiled rice  the largest he put on the ground before our three travellers the other in front of the coupled men and then retired without a word  well thank god for this anyhow said mark taking up one of the three spoons which lay on the rice and going to work with a will  just so responded the seaman  im thankful too and quite ready for grub  curious ting ockins remarked ebony dat your happytite an mine seems to be allers in de same statesharp  the seamans appetite was indeed so sharp that he did not vouchsafe a reply  the prisoners in the dark corner seemed much in the same condition but their anxiety to begin did not prevent their shutting their eyes for a few seconds and obviously asking a blessing on their meal  hockins observed the act and there passed over his soul another wave of selfcondemnation which was indicated by a deprecatory shake of his rugged head  observing it ebony paused a moment and said  yous an awrful sinner ockins  true ebony  das jist what i is too  quite as bad as you  praps wuss  i shouldnt wonder if you are rejoined the seaman recovering his spirits somewhat under the stimulating influence of rice  the recovery was not however sufficient to induce further conversation at the time for they continued after that to eat in silence  they had scarcely finished when the jailor returned to remove the dish which he did without word or ceremony and so quickly that ebony had to make a sudden scoop at the last mouthful he secured it filled his mouth with it and then flung the spoon at the retiring jailor  that was not wise said mark smiling in spite of himself at the tremendous pout of indignation on the negros face the man has us in his power and may make us very uncomfortable if we insult him  das true massa said ebony in sudden penitence but if deres one thing i cant stand its havin my wittles took away afore im done wid em  youll have to larn to stand it boy said hockins else youll have your life took away whichll be wuss  the probability of this latter event occurring was so great that it checked the rise of spirits which the rice had caused to set in  what dee think theyll do to us sir asked the sailor in a tone which showed that he looked up to the young doctor for counsel in difficulty  the feeling that in virtue of his education and training he ought to be in some sort an example and guide to his comrades in misfortune did much to make mark shake off his despondency and pluck up heart  god knows hockins what they will do he said  if they were a more civilised people we might expect to be let off easily for so slight an offence as rescuing a supposed criminal but you remember that ravonino once said when telling us stories round the campfire that interference with what they call the course of justice is considered a very serious offence  besides the queen being in a very bad mood just now and we being christians it is likely we shall be peculiarly offensive to her  i fear that banishment is the least we may count on  its a hard case to be punished for bein christians when we hardly deserve the name  i cant help wonderin said the seaman that lovey should have bolted as he did an left us in the lurch  he might at least have taken his risk along with us  anyhow he could have spoke up for us knowin both lingos  of course it was natral that poor mamba should look after number one seem that he was in no way beholden to us but lovey was our guide an pledged to stand by us  i cant help thinking said mark that you do injustice to laihova he is not the man to forsake a comrade in distress  that was my own opinion returned the sailor till i seed him go slap through yon porthole like a harlequin  praps he tink he kin do us more service wen free dan as a prisoner suggested ebony  theres somethin in that returned hockins lifting his hand to stroke his beard as was his wont when thoughtful  he lifted it however with some difficulty owing to the heavy chain  they were still engaged in conversation about their prospects when the prisondoor again opened and two men were ushered in  both wore white lambas over their other garments  one was tall and very dark  the other was comparatively slender and not so tall as his companion  for a moment the strangers stood contemplating the prisoners and marks attention was riveted on the smaller man for he felt that his somewhat lightcoloured and pleasant features were not unfamiliar to him though he could not call to mind where or when he had seen him  suddenly it flashed across him that this was the very man to whose assistance he had gone and whose wounds he had bound up soon after his arrival in the island  with a smile of recognition mark rose and extended his hand as far as his chain permitted  the young native stepped forward grasped the hand and pressed it warmly  then he looked round at his tall companion and spoke to him in his own tongue whereupon the tall man advanced a step and said in remarkably bad english  you save me frind life one taime ago  ver goodhim now you save  thank him for that promise said mark greatly relieved to find at least one friend among the natives in his hour of need  but continued the interpreter you muss not nottice me frind nowhar unerstand  oh yes i think i do returned mark with an intelligent look  i suppose he does not wish people to think that he is helping or favouring us  thats him yous got it replied the interpreter quite pleased apparently with his success in the use of english  my murmured ebony to hockins in an undertone if i couldnt spoke better english dan dat id swaller my tongue  wellgoodboy said the interpreter holding out his hand which mark grasped and shook smilingly as he replied thank you im glad you think im a goodboy  no nonot that exclaimed the interpreter good day not good boy goodnight good morning  we goes out me an me frind  hims name ravelo  again ravelo shook hands with mark despite the rattling chain nodded pleasantly to him after the english fashion and took his departure with his tall friend  well now i do think remarked hockins when the door had closed behind them that ravravewhatshisname might have took notice of me too as an old friend that helped to do him service  hm he seemed to forgit me altogidder remarked the negro pathetically  deres nuffin so bad as ingratitoodcept lockjaw das a little wuss  what dee mean by lockjaw bein wuss demanded hockins  wy dont you see  ingratitood dont feel thankee wereas lockjaw not ony dont feel but dont even say thankee  a sudden tumult outside the prison here interrupted them  evidently a crowd approached  in a few minutes it halted before the door which was flung open and four prisoners were thrust in followed by several strong guards and the execrations of the crowd  the door was smartly slammed in the faces of the yelling people and the guards proceeded to chain the prisoners  they were all young men and mark breezy and his friends had no doubt from their gentle expression and upright bearing that they were not criminals but condemned christians  three of them were quickly chained to the wall but the third was thrown on his back and a complex chain was put on his neck and limbs in such a way that when drawn tight it forced his body into a position that must have caused him severe pain  no word or cry escaped him however only an irrepressible groan when he was thrust into a corner and left in that state of torture  the horror of mark and his comrades on seeing this done in cold blood cannot be described  to hear or read of torture is bad enough but to see it actually applied is immeasurably worseto note the glance of terror and to hear the slight sound of the wrenched joints and stretched sinews followed by the deep groan and the upward glare of agony  with a bursting cry of rage hockins forgetting his situation sprang towards the torturers was checked by his fetters and fell with a heavy clang and clatter on the floor  even the cruel guards started aside in momentary alarm and then with a contemptuous laugh passed out  hockins had barely recovered his footing and managed to restrain his feelings a little when the door was again opened and the interpreter reentered with the jailor  i comebreak chains said the former  he pointed to the chains which bound our travellers  they were quickly removed by two underjailors and their chief  nowcom vis me  to the surprise of the interpreter mark breezy crossed his arms over his breast and firmly saidno  swiftly understanding his motive our seaman and ebony followed suit with an equally emphatic no  the interpreter looked at them in puzzled surprise  see said mark pointing to the tortured man in the corner we refuse to move a step till that poor fellows chains are eased off  for a moment the interpreters look of surprise increased then an indescribable smile lit up his swarthy features as he turned to the jailor and spoke a few words  the man went immediately to the curledup wretch in the corner and relaxed his chains so that he was enabled to give vent to a great sigh of relief  hockins and ebony uttered sighs of sympathy almost as loud and mark turning to the interpreter said with some emotion thank you  god bless you  now we will follow    note 1  the fetters here described may be seen in the museum of the london missionary society in blomfield street london along with an interesting collection of malagasy relics    chapter seventeen  mamba is succoured by one of the ancient soot and fulfils his mysterious mission  when laihova and mamba took the reckless headers which we have described in a former chapter they tumbled into a courtyard which was used as a sort of workshop  fortunately for them the owner of the house was not a man of orderly habits  he was rather addicted to let rubbish lie till stern necessity forced him to clear it away  hence he left heaps of dust shavings and other things to accumulate in heaps  one such heap happened to lie directly under the window through which the adventurous men plunged so that to their immense satisfaction and even surprise they came down soft and arose unhurt  instantly they slipped into an outhouse and there held hurried converse in low tones  what will you do now asked laihova  i will remain where i am till nightfall for i dare not show myself all bruised like this  when it is dark i will slip out and continue my journey to the coast  to tamatave asked laihova naming the chief seaport on the eastern side of madagascar  yes to tamatave  do you go there to trade  no  i go on important business  it was evident that whatever his business might be mamba for reasons best known to himself resolved to keep his own counsel  seeing this his friend said  well i go to the eastward also for ravoninohitriniony awaits me there but i fear that our english friends will be thrown into prison  do you think so asked mamba anxiously  if you think i can be helpful i will give up my important business and remain with you  you cannot help us much i think  perhaps your presence may be a danger instead of a help  besides i have friends here who have power and have we not god to direct us in all things  no brother as your business is important go  mamba was evidently much relieved by this reply and his friend saw clearly that he had intended to make a great personal sacrifice when he offered to remain  but now i must myself go forth without delay continued laihova  i am not wellknown here and once clear of this house can walk openly and without much risk out of the city  whatever befalls the englishmen ravoninohitriniony and i will help and pray for them  another minute and he was gone  passing the gates without arousing suspicion he was soon walking rapidly towards the forest in which his friend ravonino lay concealed  meanwhile mamba hid himself behind some bags of grain in the outhouse until nightfall when he sallied boldly forth and made his way to the house of a friend who although not a christian was too fond of him to refuse him shelter  this friend was a man of rank and ancient family  the soot hung in long strings from his rooftree  he was one of the ancient soot  the houses in the city are usually without ceilingopen to the ridgepole though there is sometimes an upper chamber occupying part of the space which is reached by a ladder  there are no chimneys therefore and smoke from the wood and grass fires settles upon the rafters in great quantities inside  as it is never cleared away the soot of course accumulates in course of time and hangs down in long pendants  so far from considering this objectionable the malagasy have come to regard it with pride for as each man owns his own house the great accumulations of soot have come to be regarded as evidence of the family having occupied the dwelling from ancient times  hence the old families are sometimes complimented by the sovereign in proclamations by being styled the ancient soot  the particular ancient soot who accorded hospitality that night to mamba was much surprised but very glad to see him  have you arrived he asked with a good deal of ceremonial gesticulation  i have arrived answered mamba  safely and well i hope  safely and well replied mambaceremonially of course for in reality he had barely arrived with life and certainly not with a sound skin  come in then said the ancient soot  and how are you  i hope it is well with you  behold spread a mat for him there one of you  and is it well with you  well indeed said mamba once again falsely but ceremonially  may you live to grow old resumed soot  and you have arrived safely come in  where are you going  im going yonderwestward replied mamba with charming conventional vagueness as he sat down on the mat  but it appears to me said ancient soot passing from the region of compliment into that of fact and looking somewhat closely at his friend it seems to me that you have been hurt  mamba now explained the exact state of the case said that he required a good long rest after that a hearty meal then a lamba and a little money for he had been despoiled of everything he had possessed by the furious crowd that so nearly killed him  his kind host was quite ready to assist him in every way  in a few minutes he was sound asleep in a little chamber on the rafters where he could rest without much risk of disturbance or discovery  all next day he remained in hiding  when it began to grow dusk his host walked with him through the streets and through the gates thus rendering his passage less likely to be observedfor this particular ancient soot was wellknown in the town  i will turn now  what go you to the coast for asked his friend when about to part  you would laugh at me if i told you said mamba  then tell me not returned his friend with much delicacy of feeling for i would be sorry to laugh at my friend  thus they parted  ancient soot returned to the home of his forefathers and mamba walked smartly along the road that leads to the seaport of tamatave  he spent that night in the residence of a friend the next in the hut of a government woodcutter  felling timber as might be supposed was and still is an important branch of industry in madagascar  forests of varied extent abound in different parts of the country and an immense belt of forest of two or three days journey in width covers the interior of the island  these forests yield abundance of timber of different colour and texture and of various degrees of hardness and durability  the woodcutter an old man was busy splitting a large tree into planks by means of wedges when our traveller came up  this wasteful method of obtaining planks is still practised by some natives of the south sea islands  formerly the malagasy never thought of obtaining more than two planks out of a single tree however large the tree might be  they merely split the tree down the middle and then chopped away the outside of each half until it was reduced to the thickness required  the advent of the english missionaries however in the early part of this century introduced light in regard to the things of time as well as those of eternityamong other things the pitsaw which has taught the natives to gather up the fragments so that nothing be lost  thick planks are still however sometimes procured in the old fashion  the woodcutter belonged to the seven hundred which constituted the government corps  the members of this corps felled timber for the use of the sovereign  they also dragged it to the capital for oxen were never employed as beasts of burden or trained to the yoke  the whole population around the capital was liable to be employed on this timberhauling workand indeed on any government workwithout remuneration and for any length of time  after the usual exhaustive questions and replies as to health etcetera the old man conducted his visitor to his hut and set food before him  he was a solitary old fellow but imbued with that virtue of hospitality which is inculcated so much among the people  having replied to the woodcutters first inquiry that he was going yonder mamba now saw fit to explain that yonder meant tamatave  i want to see the great missionary ellis before he leaves the country  the woodcutter shook his head  you are too late i fear  he passed down to the coast some weeks ago  the queen has ordered him to depart she is mad against all the praying people  are you one of the praying people asked mamba with direct simplicity  yes and i know that you are answered the woodcutter with a smile  how know you that  did i not see your lips move and your eyes look up when you approached me on arriving  true i prayed to jesus said mamba that i might be made use of to help you or you to help me  then your prayer is doubly answered returned the old man for we can each help the other  i can give you food and lodging  you can carry a message to tamatave for me  that is well  i shall be glad to help you  what is your message  it is a message to the missionary ellis if you find him still there but even if he is gone you will find a praying one who can help me long have i prayed to the lord that he would send one of his people here to take my message  some came who looked like praying people but i was afraid to ask them and perhaps they were afraid to speak for as you know the queens spies are abroad everywhere now and if they find one whom they suspect of praying to jesus they seize him and drag him away to the ordeal of tangenaperhaps to torture and death  but now you have come and my prayer is answered  he is faithful who has promised  look here  the old man went to a corner of the hut and returned with two soiled pieces of paper in his hand  sitting down he spread them carefully on his knees  mamba recognised them at once as being two leaves out of a malagasy bible  soiled worn and slightly torn they were from long and frequent use but still readable  on one of them was the twentythird psalm which the old woodcutter began to read with slow and intense interest  is it not grand he said looking up at his young guest with a flush of joy in his careworn old face to think that after this weary woodcutting is over we shall dwell in the house of the lord for ever no more toiling and hauling and splitting above all no more sin nothing but praise and work for him  and how hard i could work for him  strange said mamba while the old man gazed at the two soiled leaves as if lost in meditation strange that you should show this to me  i have comebut tell me he said breaking off abruptly what do you wish me to do  this said the old man pointing to the leaves as though he had not heard the question is all that i possess of the word of god  ah well do i remember the timemany years past nowwhen i had the whole bible it was such a happy time thenwhen good king radama reigned and the missionaries had schools and churches and meetingswhen we prayed and sang to our hearts content and the bible was printed by the wonderful machines brought by the white men in our own language and we learned to read it  i was young then and strong but i dont think my heart was so warm as it is now  learning to read was hardhard but the lord made me able and when i got a bible all to myself i thought there was nothing more to wish for  but the good radama died and ranavalona sits upon his throne  you know she has burned many bibles  mine was found and burned but she did not suspect me  i suppose i am too poor and worthless for her to care about  perhaps we did not think enough of the happy times when we had them  a brother gave me these two leaves  they are all that i have left now  again the old man paused and the younger forbore to interrupt his thoughts  presently he looked up and continued when the missionary ellis was on his way to the coast i met him and asked for a bible  he had not a spare one to give me  he was very sorry but said if i could find any one going to tamatave who would carry a bible back to me he would send one  now you have come  will you see the great missionary or if he is away find one of the other men of god and fetch me a bible  there was a trembling earnestness in the old woodcutters voice which showed how eager he was about the answer  mamba readily promised and then after singing and praying together these likeminded men retired to rest  next morning mamba pursued his way eastward with rapid step for he was anxiousyet with a glad heart for he was hopeful  many things of interest were presented to his gaze but though he observed them well he did not suffer them to turn him aside for a moment from his purpose which was to reach tamatave in the shortest possible time so as to meet and converse with the missionary before he should quit the island  mamba was of an inquiring disposition  in ordinary circumstances he would have paused frequently to rest and meditate and pray  he would have turned aside to examine anything peculiar in his track or even to watch the operations of a spider or the gambols of a butterfly but now he had business on hand and set his face like a flint to transact it  the distance from the capital to tamatave was nearly two hundred miles there were dangers in the way  as we have said the queens spies were everywhere  mambas wounds and bruises were still sufficiently obvious to attract attention and rouse curiosity if not suspicion  at one part of the journey he came upon some criminals in long chains which extended from their necks to their ankles  they were doing work on the roads under a guard  he would fain have conversed with these men but fearing to be questioned turned aside into the shelter of a plantation and passed stealthily by  at another place he came to a ferry where when he was about to enter the boat two men stepped in before him whom he knew to be government officers and suspected to be spies  to have drawn suddenly back without apparent reason would have proclaimed a guilty conscience  to go forward was to lay himself open to question and suspicion for he had prepared no tissue of falsehoods for the occasion  there was no time for thought only for prayer  he committed his soul to god as he entered the boat and then began to converse with the boatman in as easy and natural a tone of voice as he could assume  having to face the boatman for this purpose enabled him to turn his back upon the government officers  scarce knowing what he said in the perturbation of his spirit his first question was rather absurd  did you ever upset in crossing here he asked  of course not replied the boatman with a look of offended dignity  ha then continued mamba who quickly recovered his equanimity then you dont know what it is to feel the teeth of a crocodile  no i dont and hope i never shall  did you  oh yes returned mamba i have felt them  this was true for it happened that when he was a little boy his mother had taken him down to the side of a river where she had some washing to do and while she was not looking the urchin waded in and a crocodile made a snap at him  fortunately it failed to catch him but its sharp teeth grazed his thigh and left a mark which he never afterwards lost  where did that happen asked the boatman when the other had briefly stated the factfor the passage was too short to permit of a story being told  in the betsilio country  thats a long way off  yes a long way  i left my old mother there  im going to tamatave to buy her a present  now my friend said mamba in a bantering tone as the boat ran into the opposite bank take care never to upset your boat because crocodile teeth are wonderfully sharp  mamba had the satisfaction of hearing the two officers chuckle at his little joke and the boatman growl indignantly as he leaped ashore and sedately strode away with a sigh of relief and thankfulness for having made what he deemed a narrow escape  the road to tamatave was by no means lonely for being the highway from the seaport to the capital there was constant traffic both of travellers and of merchandise  there were also great droves of cattle making their way to the coastfor a large part of the wealth of the chiefs and nobles of the land consists of cattle which are exported to the islands of bourbon and mauritius and disposed of to the shipping that come there for supplies  at last mamba reached tamatave footsore worn and weary and went straight to the house of frienda native of wealth and importance in the town and one whom he knew to be a christian  from him he learned to his great joy that mr ellis had not yet left the place and that he hoped to be permitted still to remain there for some time  it was dark when mamba arrived and rather late but he was too anxious to transact his business to wait till morning  having ascertained where the missionary lived he went there direct and was ushered into his sittingroom  you wish to converse with me said mr ellis in a kind voice and in the native tongue as he placed a chair for his visitorwho however preferred to stand  yes i come from very far awayfrom the betsilio country  my mother dwells there and she is a praying onea follower of jesus  she loves the word of god  i heard that you had brought the bible to us from your own landprinted in our language and so i have come to ask you for a bible  have you come all that long journey to procure the word of god asked the missionary much interested  yesthat is my business replied mamba  although mr ellis liked the look of his visitor and was strongly disposed to believe him he had too much knowledge of the native character to place immediate confidence in him  besides the man being a stranger to him and possibly one of the government spies he feared to comply at once with his request lest he should hasten his own banishment from the island  he replied therefore with caution  i cannot give you what you want tonight he said but you may call on me again tomorrow and i will speak with you  this answer did not at all satisfy the eager heart of the poor fellow who had travelled so far and risked so much  his countenance showed the state of his feelings so strongly that the sympathetic missionary laid his hand kindly on his shoulder bade him cheer up and asked for his name as well as the name of some one in tamatave who knew him  now then mamba he said as they were about to part dont be cast down  come here to see me tomorrow  come early  comforted a littlemore by the missionarys look and tone than by his wordsmamba took his departure  meanwhile mr ellis made inquiries visited the friend to whom he had been referred and found that not only was mamba a good and true man but that many of his family feared the lord greatly  when therefore his anxious visitor returned very early the following morning he was ready for him  i am assured that you are a christian mamba he said as well as many of your kindred  yes i love the lord and so do many of my kinsmen  but my family is large and scattered  have any of them got the scriptures  they have seen and heard them returned mamba but all that we possess are a few pages of the words of david  these belong to the whole family  we send them from one to another and each after keeping them for a time passes them on until they have been read by all  they are in my hands just now  have you them with you asked the missionary  mamba did not reply at once  he seemed unwilling to answer but at last confessed that he had  will you not show them to me  surely you can trust me brother  mamba at length made up his mind  thrusting his hand deep into his bosom he drew a parcel from the folds of his lamba  this he slowly and carefully opened  one piece of cloth after another being unrolled there appeared at length a few leaves of the book of psalms which he cautiously handed to mr ellis  though it was evident that the greatest care had been taken of that muchprized portion of scripture the soiled appearance of the leaves worn edges and other marks of frequent uselike the two leaves owned by the woodcuttershowed how much they had been read  even mambas anxiety was allayed by the tender way in which the missionary handled his treasure and the interest in it that he displayed  now my friend said mr ellis still holding the tattered leaves which mamba seemed anxious to get back if you will give me these few words of david i will give you all his words and i will give you besides the words of jesus and of john and paul and peter  seehere they are  saying which he handed to his visitor a copy of the new testament and psalms in malagasy bound together  but mamba did not leap at this gift as might have been expected  either it seemed to him to be too good news to be true or he was of a sceptical turn of mind  at all events he was not satisfied until he had sat down with the missionary and assured himself that every verse in his ragged treasure was contained in the presented volume and a great deal more besides  then he let the old treasure go and joyfully accepted the new which he said he was going to carry back to his mother who greatly longed for it  before retiring with it however he mentioned his friend the woodcutter whom mr ellis remembered well and gladly gave another testament to be taken back to him  then uttering expressions of fervent gratitude mamba left the house  in the course of that day the missionary inquired after his visitor wishing to have further converse with him but the christians of tamatave told him that mamba had started off almost immediately after quitting him on his long return journey to betsiliolanddoubtless rejoicing as one that findeth great spoil  dust was not allowed to accumulate on the bibles of madagascar in those days    chapter eighteen  unexpected deliverance and several surprises  at the time when mamba started away on his expedition to tamatave ravonino as we have said lay concealed in the forest anxiously awaiting news from the town  at last the news camethe two white men and the negro had got involved in a row and were in prison  so said laihova on entering the cave and seating himself weary worn and dispirited on a ledge of rock beside his friend to whom he related all that had befallen  give not way to despondency said ravonino though he could not smooth the lines of anxiety from his own brow  does not the lord reign  let the earth rejoice  no evil can befall unless permitted and then it will surely work for good  let us now consider what is to be done  but first we will pray  in the gloom of the cavern the two men went down on their knees and in very brief but earnest sentences made known their wants to their creator  it is useless to remain here idle said the guide as they resumed their seat on the ledge  it is useless to go into the town returned laihova  i am known now as one of those who aided mamba to escape  but i am not knownat least not in my present guise said ravonino have you seen rafaravavy  no i tell you we had not been long in the town when this mischance befell  did not mamba tell you why he has undertaken so long a journey  he did not but i can guess answered laihova with a slight smile the night before we left our friends in the cave in betsilioland i heard his mother urging him to accompany us to the capital and fetch her if possible a copy of the word of god  she was joined in her persuasions by my sister ramatoa and you know he loves ramatoa  i have no doubt that the two overcame his objections  do you know why he objected asked ravonino  he said that he was afraid to quit his mother and the others at a time when she might sorely need his protection but other motives may have influenced him  if he said it he meant it returned the guide with some decision for mamba is open and true of heart  no doubt he had other motives but these were secondary  god grant him success and safe deliverance from the hands of his enemies  amen responded laihova  for some time the two friends sat there in silence meditating as to what they should do in the circumstances for each felt that action of some sort was absolutely necessary  my friend said the guide at last it seems to me that the lord requires me at this time to go with my life in my hand and give it to him if need be  i have led these englishmen into danger  i must do my best to succour them  rafaravavy also is in great danger of losing her lifefor the queens fondness for her may not last through the opposition to her will which she is sure to meet with  at all risks i will enter the town and try to meet with rafaravavy  but you my friend have no need to run so great a risk  the englishmen have no claim upon you  my sister raruth as well as the other banished ones need your arm to defend them all the more that mamba has left for a time  i counsel you to return to the betsilio country and leave me there is no fear  i am in the hands of god  for a few moments laihova was silent  then he spoke slowly  no  i will not leave you  are not our friends also in the hands of god  for them too there is no fear  at present they are far from danger and in safe hiding for even the outlawsthe robbers who infest the forests understand something of their case they have sympathy and will not molest them  besides all that ravoninohitriniony is there not the bloodcovenant between you and me  no i will not leave you  where you go i will go and if you die i will not live  seeing that his friends mind was made up the guide made no further effort to influence him and both men prepared themselves to go to the city  we return now to our friends mark breezy john hockins and james ginger whom we left in the act of quitting their prison after being the means of obtaining some extension of mercy to an unfortunate sufferer whom they left behind them there  the interpreter led them up several steep streets and finally brought them to a courtyard in which were several small houses  into one of these he ushered them having previously pointed out to them that the building occupied a prominent position not far from the great palace of the queen  soif you out goesgit lostedknow how to finds youself agin  das so said ebony  yous a clibber man  now you stop continued the interpreter paying no attention to the remark for git somesomevikvikvikleseh  vikles repeated mark with a puzzled air  yisyisvikles repeated the interpreter nodding his head smiling opening his mouth very wide and pointing to it  praps he means victuals suggested hockins  yisyisjus sovittles cried the interpreter eagerly wait for vittles  nowgoodboybyby he added with a broad grin at his blunder as he left the room and shut the door  the three friends stood in the middle of the room for a few seconds in silence looked at each other and smiled dubiously  lets see if we really are free to go and come as we choose said mark suddenly stepping to the door and trying it  sure enough it was open  they passed out and went a short distance along the street in which only a few natives were moving about  these strange to say instead of gazing at them in idle curiosity seemed to regard them with some show of respect  hold on sir said hockins coming to an abrupt halt you know that feller told us to wait for victuals and i am uncommon disposed for them victuals for to say truth the trifle of rice they gave us this mornin was barely enough to satisfy an average rat  better come back an do as were bid  obedience you know is the first law of natur  das wat i says too  wait for de wittles  agreed said mark turning on his heel  on reaching the house they found that two slaves had already begun preparations for the hopedfor feast  in a few minutes they had spread on the mat floor several dishes containing rice mingled with bits of chicken and other meats the smell of which was exceedingly appetising there was plain beef also and fowls and cooked vegetables and fruits of various kinds some of which were familiar to them but others were quite new  slaves being present our three travellers did not give full and free expression to their feelings but it was evident from the way that hockins smacked his lips and ebony rolled his tongue about not to mention his eyes and mark pursed his mouth that they were smitten with pleased anticipation while the eyes of all three indicated considerable surprise  there were no knives or forksonly horn spoons for the rice but as each man carried a large claspknife in his pocket the loss was not felt  in any other circumstances the singularity and unexpected nature of this good treatment would have stirred up the fun of ebony and the latent humour of hockins but they could not shake off the depression caused by the memory of what they had seen in the prisonthe heavy iron collars and the cruel binding chains  they tried to put the best face possible on it but after a few faint sallies relapsed into silence this however did not prevent their eating a sufficiently hearty meal  theres no sayin when we may git the chance of another was hockinss apologetic remark as he helped himself to another fowl  it is very mysterious that we should receive such treatment said mark  i can only account for it by supposing that our friend ravelo is an officer of some power  if so it was doubly fortunate that we had the opportunity of doing him a good turn  now you leave dem two drumsticks for me ockins said ebony wiping his mouth with the back of his hand  youll do yourself a injury if you heat de whole ob im  well i must confess to bein surprised summat said the seaman referring to marks observation not to ebonys  they were destined to receive some additional surprises before that day was over  the meal which they had been discussing was barely finished when their friend the interpreter again entered and bade them follow him  queen ranavalona wish sees you he said  what all on us exclaimed hockins with elevated eyebrows  yisall  oh nonsense he cried turning to mark  it must be you doctor she wants to see  what can she want with a ornary seaman like me  or a extraornary nigger like me said ebony with a look of extreme contempt  you kin stop in house if you choose remarked the interpreter with a quiet grin but you heads be splitted if you do  then i think ill go said hockins quietly  me too remarked the negro  accordingly they all wentwith a slight qualm however for they felt slightly doubtful whether under existing circumstances they might not after all be going to execution  the royal palaces to which they were led occupy a very conspicuous and commanding position on the summit of the hill and stand at an elevation of more than 500 feet above the surrounding plains  they are conspicuously larger than any of the other houses in the city are grouped together in a large courtyard and number about a dozen houseslarge and small  the chief palace named manjakamiadana is about 100 feet long by 80 broad and 120 high to the apex of its lofty roof  a wide verandah in three stories runs all round it  all is painted white except the balustrade  the building next in size to this is the silver house  on the eastern side of the courtyard are the palace gardens and around it stand a number of houses which are the residences of the chief officers of the army the secretaries of state and other members of the government  on reaching the palace gate two young officers approached to receive the visitors  they were dressed in splendid european regimentals much bedecked with goldlace tightfitting trousers wellington boots sash sword and cocked hat all complete  one of these to their surprise spoke english remarkably well  i learned it from the missionaries when i was leetle boy he explained to mark as he conducted the visitors through the archway and across the spacious courtyard into the palace  in the second storey of the verandah the queen was seen seated beneath that emblem of royalty the scarlet umbrella with her court around her  before entering the court the visitors had removed their hats  they were now directed to make a profound reverence as they passed and proceeded along the side of the building to the further end  a line of native troops was drawn up across the court but these wore no uniform only the lamba wound round their waists and white crossbelts on their naked bodies  they were armed with the old flintlock muskets and bayonets of the period  their conductor who was an undersecretary of state led them by a dark narrow stair to the balcony where the queen sat and in a few moments they found themselves in the presence of the cruel ranavalona of whom they had heard so much  she did not look cruel at that time however  she was dressed in a rich satin gown over which she wore the royal scarlet lamba and jewels of various kinds ornamented her person  she was seated in a chair raised two or three steps above the floor with her ladies on one side and her gentlemen on the other  the former among whom were some really goodlooking brunettes had all adopted the english fashion of dress with parts of native costume retained  some wore headdresses of gorgeous colouring composed of ribbons flowers and feathers in great profusion but as no headdress however strongly marked by barbaric splendour can excel the amazing feminine crests in present use among the civilised we refrain from attempting description  most of the men also wore european costume or portions thereof some being clad in suits of black broadcloth  the amount of ceremony displayed on all hands at court seemed to have infected our three adventurers for when led before the queen they approached with several profound bows to which hockins added the additional grace of a pull at his forelock  in this he was imitated by ebony  for some moments ranavalona eyed her visitorsperhaps we should say her captivessternly enough but there was also a slight touch of softness in her expression from which mark drew much comfort in silence for as yet the queen had given no indication as to whether the newcomers were to be treated as friends or spies and the recent banishment of the missionaries and harsh treatment of europeans by the queen left their minds in some doubt on the point  turning to the secretary who had introduced the party ranavalona spoke to him a few words  when she had finished the secretary turned to mark whom he at once recognised as the chief and spokesman of the trio  queen ranavalona bid me ask where you comes from he said  to which mark replied that they came from england that they were all english subjects though one was an african by descent  i have heard continued the queen through her interpreter that you have been shipwrecked that one of your number is a maker of medicine and that you helped one of my peopleeven saved his lifesoon after your arrival in my country  is that so  mark explained that they had not been shipwrecked but had been left on shore and obliged to fly from the natives of the coast that he was indeed a maker of medicine though his training had not been quite completed when he left england and that he had rendered a trifling service to an unfortunate man who had slipped in climbing a cliff but he could hardly be said to have saved the mans life  while he was speaking mark observed that his friend ravelo stood close to the queens chair in front of a group of officers from which circumstance he concluded that he must be a man of some note and that it was he who had procured the deliverance of himself and his friends from prison  tell the young maker of medicine said the queen in a loud voice so that all the court might hear that europeans have behaved very ill here of late so ill that they had to be banished from my country for i ranavalona permit no one whether his face be black brown or white to meddle with my government  they fancied i suppose that because i am a woman i am weak and ignorant and unable to rule  they have now found their mistake and christians shall not again be permitted to dwell in my country  but i am ranavalona and i will do what i please  if i choose to make an exception i will do it  if any one thinks to oppose my will he shall die  the man whose life was saved by this young maker of medicine is my son rakotamy beloved son  is it not so  the queen looked round as she spoke and the man whom we have hitherto styled ravelo bent his head and replied it is so whereupon there were murmurs of surprise and approval among the courtiers  now continued the queen as i am grateful and as i want a physician at court just now i appoint this young maker of medicine to that post and i appoint his black companion to be his servant  do you all hear that  all the courtiers made murmurs of assent  tell them all that secretary said the queen  mark breezy and his friends had considerable difficulty in concealing their astonishment when all that was explained to them but they had the presence of mind to acknowledge the information with a profound obeisance  at the same time mark explained with much modesty that he was not entitled to aspire to or to accept so high and honourable a position as he had not yet obtained the standing which entitled him to practise in his own country  tell him said the queen sternly that i ranavalona have nothing to do with the customs of england and have no regard for them  if he does not accept what i offer instant banishmentperhaps worsewill be his portion  oh massa accep him at once murmured ebony in an undertone and in much anxiety  mark took his advice and agreed to become physician to the court of the queen of madagascar without stipulating either as to salary or privileges  i am also told said the queen with a smile of condescension to her physician that your english companion is full of music and performs on a wonderful little instrument  i have a good band which was trained by your countrymen but they have no such little instrument  let the man of the sea perform  on this being translated mark looked at the man of the sea and could with difficulty restrain a burst of laughter at the expression of his countenance  what exclaimed hockins me play my whistle afore this here court unpossible  youll have to try said mark unless you wish for instant banishmentor something worse  oh  ockins blaze away at once murmured ebony with renewed anxiety for the something worse was to him suggestive of imprisonment torture and death  thus pressed the seaman put his hand into the inner pocket of his jacket and drew forth his cherished flageolet  in a few minutes the queen and all her courtiers were enthralled by the music  it was not only the novelty and birdlike sweetness of the instrument itself that charmed but also the fine taste and wonderful touch of the sailor  the warbling notes seemed to trill rise and fall and float about on the atmosphere as it were like fairy music filling the air with melody and the soul with delight  good let the man of the sea be also cared for  give them quarters in the palace and see that they all attend upon us in the garden tomorrow  so saying the queen arose swept into the palace and left her courtiers to follow  immediately prince rakota came forward and shook hands with mark  so then your highness said the latter we are indebted to you for all this kindness  it is only one small ting returned the prince in broken english  am i not due to you my life  come i go show you your house  on the way and after entering the house which was appropriated to their use mark learned from the prince that their approach to the capital had been discovered and announced by spies long before their arrival that it was they who had discovered and revealed to the queen hockinss wonderful powers with the little tube  also that it was wellknown who had guided them through the country and that ravoninohitriniony was being diligently sought for in his hidingplaces  this last piece of information filled the three friends with deep concern and anxiety  he has been so very kind to us said mark and i know is one of the most generously disposed and lawrespecting subjects of her majesty  that not help for him if he tumbles into the hands of my mother said the prince sadly  he is a christian  he has run to the forest and has made others to fly  but you have much power with the queen pleaded mark could you not induce her to pardon him  yesif he will give up christianityif not do thatno  that he will never do said mark firmly  i know him well  he will rather die than deny christ  he is likely to die then returned rakota for my mother is fixed to root up the religion of jesus from the land  but surely you dont agree with her broke in hockins at this point  no i not agree said the prince  but i can not command the queen some time it very hard to move her even a leetle  my only power with her is love  das de greatest power in de world chimed in ebony  it is returned the prince and you be very sure i use the power much as i can for save your friend    chapter nineteen  a malagasy garden partythe cloud grows blacker  the garden party is by no means a novelty of the present day  in the early part of this centuryif not much earliermalagasy sovereigns seem to have been wont to treat their court and friends to this species of entertainment  the order which the queen had given that her european visitors should attend upon her in the garden was neither more nor less than an invitation to a garden party or picnic to be held the following day at one of her surburban retreats named anosy about halfamile from the city  accordingly early in the morningfor the malagasy are early riserstheir friend the interpreter came to conduct them to the spot with a gift of a striped lamba for each of the white men  why she not send one for me demanded ebony poutingand ebonys pout was something to take note of  cause youre black and dont need no clothing said hockins awkwardly attempting to put the lamba on his broad shoulders  humph if she knowed what splendid lobscouse an plum duff i kin make returned the negro ranny valony would hab sent me a silk lamba an made me her chief cook  howsever deres a good time comin  i spose i aint to go to the party  yisyou muss go  all of you got to go  killdeadedif you dont go  im your man den for i dont want to be deaded yet a while moreover i want to see de fun returned the negro  meanwhile the interpreter showed them how to put on the lambawith one end of it thrown over the left shoulder like the spaniards cloakand then conducted them to the palace where they found three palanquinsor chairs supported by two stavesawaiting them  getting into them they set off preceded by the interpreter in a similar conveyance  ebony and his bearers brought up the rear  the queen and her court had already started some time  our party soon reached the scene of festivities at the southeast of the city  it was a charming spot having large gardens laid out in the european style with goodly trees overshadowing the pleasurehouse of anosy and an extensive lake  the house was on an island in the lake and was reached by a narrow causeway  at the entrance to the place two enormous letters r r formed in grass borders that surrounded flowerbeds indicated that radama rex the first king of that name had originated those gardens  and they did him credit for he had made great exertions to accumulate there specimens of the most useful and remarkable trees and plants in the countryespecially those that were of service in materia medica some immense camphorwood trees were among the most conspicuous and there were several specimens of a graceful fanpalm as well as clumps of the longleaved rofia  the lake was covered in part with a profusion of purple waterlilies and was well stocked with goldfish  in the garden and on the upper part of the grounds were luxuriant vines besides figs mangoes pineapples and coffeeplants  here to the strains of an excellent band hundreds of people in white and striped lambas and various gay costumes were walking about enjoying themselves conversing with animation or consuming rice chickens and beef on mats beneath the mango and figtrees  elsewhere the more youthful and lively among them engaged in various games such as racing jumping etcetera  come said their friend of the previous daythe secretaryto mark and his comrades breaking in on their contemplation of the animated scene the queen wishes to see you  her majesty who was dressed in a long robe of muslin embroidered with gold sat near the door of the gardenhouse surrounded by her ladies who all wore the simple but graceful native dress  a guard of soldiers stood near at hand  the queen merely wished to ask a few ceremonial questions of her visitors  while she was engaged with hockins and the secretary mark ventured to glance at the ladies of the court among whom he observed one who made a deep impression on him  she wore if possible a simpler dress than any of her companions and no ornaments whatever  her features were well formed and her rather pensive countenance was very beautiful  when they were retiring from the presence of the queen mark could not resist the temptation to ask the secretary who she was  that said he is our selfwilled little christian rafaravavy  she does not look very selfwilled returned mark  true and she is not really soonly in the matter of religion  i fear we shall lose her ere long for she minds not the queen and no one who defies ranavalona lives long  but come let us sit down under this mango tree and eat  you must be hungry  he led them as he spoke to a sequestered spot near a coppice which partially guarded them from public gaze on three sides and on the fourth side afforded them a charming view of the gardens the gay assemblage and the country beyond  at first both hockins and ebony hesitated to sit down to breakfast with so distinguished a person as an undersecretary of state  we aint used you see doctor observed the seaman in a low tone to feed wi the quality  das so massa chimed in ebony in the same tone wittles nebber taste so pleasant in de cabin as in de focsl  dont object to anything replied mark quickly just do as i do  hall right massa  neck or nuffinim your man  as for the seaman he obeyed without reply and in a few minutes they were busy with the secretary over drumsticks and rice  the freeandeasy sociability of that individual would have surprised them less if they had known that he had been specially commissioned by the queen to look well after them and gather all the information they might possess about the fugitive christians who were hiding in the forests  fortunately our young student was quickwitted  he soon perceived the drift of the secretarys talk and without appearing to evade his questions gave him such replies as conveyed to him no information whatever of the kind he desired  at the same time he took occasion when the secretarys attention was attracted by something that was going on to lay his finger on his lips and bestow a look of solemn warning on his comrades the effect of which on their intelligent minds was to make the negro intensely stupid and the seaman miraculously ignorant  now while our friends are thus pleasantly engaged we will return to rafaravavy whom we left standing among the queens ladies  of all the ladies there that little brunette was not only the bestlooking the sweetest the most innocent but also strange to say the funniest by which we do not mean to say that she tried to be funnyfar from it but that she had the keenest perception of the ludicrous and as her perceptions were quick and little jokes usually struck her in vulgar parlance all of a heap her little explosions of laughter were instantaneous and violently shortlived  yet her natural temperament was grave and earnest and her habitual expression as we have said pensive  indeed it would have been strange had it been otherwise considering the times in which she lived the many friends whom she had seen sacrificed by the violence of her royal mistress and the terrible uncertainty that hung over her own fate  after a time the queen dismissed some of her attendants to ramble about the groundsamong them rafaravavy who sauntered down one of the sidewalks by herself  she had not gone far when on reaching a turn of the road where a small thicket of shrubs concealed her from the more public part of the garden she heard her own name pronounced  stopping abruptly she listened with intense anxiety expressed on her countenance  rafaravavy repeated the voice again fear not  next moment the bushes were turned aside a man stepped on the path and ravonino stood before her  he seized her in his arms and printed a fervent kiss upon her lips  oh  samuel she said using her lovers christian name which she naturally preferred and speaking of course in her native tongue why did you come here  you know that it is death if you are caught  i would risk more than death if that were possible to see you rafaravavy  but i come to ask you to fly with me  our dear lords counsel is that when we are persecuted we should flee to a place of safety  impossible said the girl in a tone of decision that made her lovers heart sink  besides i am not persecuted  the queen is fond of me and bears much  fond of you she may well be my loved one she cannot help that but she is fonder of herself and the moment you go beyond a certain point she will order you out to execution  has she not done the same sort of thing before  she is capable of doing it again  she will surely do it again  come dearest let us fly nowthis moment  i have a lamba here which will conceal most of your dress  arrangements are made with some of our friends in the lord to aid us  bearers are ready  i will guide you to the caverns in the forest where my sister raruth is longing to receive you where many of your old friends are dwelling in security where we worship god and pray to jesus and sing the sweet old hymns in peace  come dear one will you not come  it was evident that the intense earnestness of the lover was exerting powerful influence over the affectionate maiden for she began to waver  oh do not persuade me thus she said  i know not what god would have me do  but the queen has been very kind to me in spite of my religion and sometimes i have thought that she listens to my pleading perhaps god may use me as the means of bringing her to jesus  think what that would benot only to her own soul but to the multitudes who are now suffering in  at that moment footsteps were heard on the gravel walk  they were evidently approaching the spot where the lovers stood  before ravonino could make up his mind to drag her into the thicket by main force rafaravavy had disengaged herself and bounded away  at the same moment ravonino glided into the shrubbery and disappeared  a few seconds later and mark breezy stood on the spot they had quitted he was alone  strange he muttered to himself i am almost certain that she took this path and i fancy that the mans voice sounded like that of ravonino  nothing more natural than that he should ferret her out  yet it seems to have been imagination  it was not imagination said a rather stern voice at marks elbow  he turned quickly  i was sure of it he exclaimed  if you were so sure of it said the guide with a touch of bitterness why did you interrupt us and scare the maiden away  you do me wrong in your thoughts replied the student flushing  one of the queens secretaries is even at this moment coming along this track in company with hockins and ebony  while seated at breakfast i saw rafaravavy walk in this direction and somehow i took it into my head that you would surely meet her herei know not why i thought so unless it be that in like circumstances i myself would have acted the same partso i hastened on in advance to warn you  hush do you not hear their steps  forgive me said ravonino extending his hand and grasping that of his friend  then speaking low and hurriedly you are in favour at court  will you befriend her  i will  you may depend on me  there was no time for more  already it was almost too late for the guide had barely disappeared in the thicket when his comrades and the secretary appeared  hallo doctor exclaimed hockins was ye arter a pretty girl that you bolted so all of a sudden  yes i was answered mark promptly  i saw one of the queens ladies come in this direction and ran after her  i suppose there is no harm in that mr secretary  you dont forbid men to look at your women do you like the arabs  certainly not replied the secretary with a slight smile and a ceremonial bow  come then let us follow the track we may yet meet her  so saying mark led the way along the path where rafaravavy had vanished not for the purpose of overtaking her but in order to give his friend time and opportunity to get out of the thicket unperceived  on the evening of that same day after the garden festivities were over queen ranavalona sat in her palace with a frown on her brow for despite her determination and frequent commands the christians in the town still persisted in holding secret meetings for worship  those who knew her moods saw plainly that she was fanning the smouldering fires of anger and that it needed but a small matter to cause them to burst out into a devouring flame  while she was in this critical frame of mind an influential courtier appeared before her  he seemed to be greatly excited  madam he said i request that a bright and sharp spear may be brought to me  somewhat surprised at the nature of the request the queen asked to know the reason  madam continued the courtier i cannot but see with grief the dishonour that is done not only to our idols but to the memory of your own predecessors by the doctrines of these foreigners  our ancient customs are being destroyed and the new faith is spreading on every hand  all this is but preparatory to the invasion of madagascar by europeans and as i would rather die than see my queen and country so disgraced i ask for a spear to pierce my heart before the evil day arrives  this speech had a powerful effect on the queen  she began to regard christianity as not merely a sacrilege but a political offence for were not people learning to despise the idols of their forefathers and to cease praying to the royal ancestors by whom the kingdom had been established and under whom the country had become great and powerful might they not eventually despise herself and learn to treat their living sovereign with contempt  for some time ranavalona remained silent leaning her forehead on her hand  suddenly she looked up with a flushed countenance  it is trueall true she said  when i was carried along in procession today did i not hear these christians singing one of their hated hymns  they will not cease till some of them lose their heads have you got with you the formal accusation that was made before my chief judge yesterday  no madam i have not  go  fetch it and read it to me  the courtier bowed left the apartment and speedily returned with a paper containing the accusations referred to  unfolding it he read as follows  first  the christians are accused of despising the idols  second they are always praying  third  they will not swear but merely affirm  fourth  their women are chaste  fifth  they are of one mind with regard to their religion  sixth  they observe the sabbath as a sacred day  strange to say this catalogue of socalled accusations deeply affected the queen with grief and rage  i swear she said with flashing eyes and clenched hands that i will root out this religion of the europeans if it should cost the life of every christian in the land  go  leave me  for a fortnight subsequent to this the palace and court appeared as if in mourning for some public calamity  no band played no amusements were allowed and a dread of impending evil seemed to weigh upon the spirits of all classes  during this time also measures were taken to effect the final destruction as far as possible of all that had been done in the country by the teaching of the missionaries and their converts  at last the storm burst  a kabary or immense general assembly of the nation was called by proclamation at the capital  the people were only too well aware of what this signified to doubt that the queen was thoroughly in earnest and in one of her worst moods  with trembling hearts they hastened to obey the summons    chapter twenty  a great kabary is held followed by dreadful martyrdoms  no rank or age was exempt from attendance at the great assembly soldiers were sent about the city and suburbs to drive the people towards the place of assembly near the palace and the living stream continued to pour onwards until many thousand souls were gathered together at imahamasina  here a body of troops fifteen thousand strong was posted and in the earlier part of the day the cannon along the heights of the city thundered out a salute to inspire the people with awe and respect for the royal authority  the highest civil and military officers were there in their varied and gay trappings but ranavalona herself did not appear in person  her message was conveyed to the people by one of the chief officers of state  it was interspersed here and there with the various titles of the queen and was to the following effect  i announce to you oh ye people  i am not a sovereign that deceives i therefore tell to you what i purpose to do and how i shall govern you  who then is that man who would change the customs of our ancestors and the twelve sovereigns in this country  to whom has the kingdom been left by inheritance by impoin imerina and radama except to me  if any then would change the customs of our ancestors i abhor that saith rabodonandrianimpoinimerina  after a good deal more to much the same effect the message went on to say  as to baptisms societies places of worship distinct from schools and the observance of the sabbath how many rulers are there in the land is it not i alone that rule  these things are not to be done they are unlawful in my country saith ranavalomanjaka for they are not the customs of our ancestors and i do not change their customs excepting as to things alone that improve my country  and then in your worship you say believe  follow the christian customs and thus you change the customs of the ancestors for you do not invoke all that is sacred in heaven and earth and all that is sacred in the twelve sovereigns and the idols  and is not this changing the customs of the ancestors  i detest that and i tell you plainly that such things shall not be done in my country saith ranavalomanjaka  now i decree that all bibles and books of the new religion shall be delivered up to be destroyed that all who are guilty shall come in classes according to the nature of their offences and accuse themselves of having been baptized of being members of the church of having taught slaves to readall shall come to the officers and confess but those who conceal their offence and are accused by others shall be subjected to the ordeal of the tangena and those who resist my commands shall die saith ranavalomanjaka  this message was no idle threat  the people were well aware of that and the city was filled with weeping and consternation  it was while things were in this state that mamba arrived at antananarivo with his precious new testament and psalms in the folds of his lamba  although well aware of what had taken place he recklessly visited his friends in the city  from them he learned more particulars and saw when too late that it would be impossible for him now to pass out of the gates with the testament on his person as the guards had been cautioned to search every one whom they had the slightest reason to suspect  hearing of the sudden exaltation of his english friends he formed the wise resolution to place his treasure in their hands  boldness is often successful where timidity would fail  without hesitation or even consultation with his friends mamba went straight to the palace and demanded permission to visit the maker of medicine he was allowed to pass and conducted by an official to the quarters of mark breezy who was seated with hockins and ebony at the time  great was their surprise at seeing their friend  why mamba  i thought you had gone to tamatave said mark shaking hands heartily with him  yisyisi hoed said mamba and then endeavoured to tell something of his doings in english but his knowledge of that language was so very imperfect that they could make nothing of it  they understood him however when he cautiously and lovingly drew the testament from its hidingplace and gave it into marks hands  what am i to do with it my poor friend said mark  i know that you have no chance of retaining it after the decree that has just been passed  keep imkeepfor me said mamba anxiously  i will do so if i can but it may not be possible answered mark  yis keepsafe  got im for me mudder  youre a brick cried ebony enthusiastically grasping the mans hand for he had a great love for his own mother and experienced a gush of sympathy  at that moment there was a loud knocking at the door and mark had barely time to slip the testament into his coat pocket when hateroflies entered with his silver spear and attendants  seizing hold of poor mamba without uttering a word they led him away  hockins instantly followed and ebony was about to do the same when mark laid his hand on his shoulder and checked him  what would you do ebony  look arter ockins massa  hockins is well able to look after himself  no doubt he has gone to see where they take mamba to  one pair of eyes is enough for that your company would only trouble him  a few minutes later the seaman returned with the information that the unfortunate man had been cast into the prison from which they had been so recently released  at this time the christians in the island possessed numerous entire copies of the scriptures besides a large number of testaments and psalms and books of a religious character which having been secreted had escaped the destruction of previous persecutions  some of these were now given up and destroyed  many of the more timid among the natives came forward as commanded and accused themselves thus escaping punishment but there were others who would neither give up their bibles nor accuse themselves  some of these were accused by their slaves others by their socalled friends and kindredin some cases falsely  next day the prime minister came to the queen and reported that one lady named rasalama who had not accused herself had been accused by some of her slaves of attending religious meetings  is it possible exclaimed the queen that there is one so daring as to defy me  go let her be put to death at once  the intercession of friends of the accused produced no effect on the queen and even the pleading of prince rakota failed in this instance to do more than delay the execution for a few days  meanwhile rasalama was cast into prison and loaded with chains  is it not strange she said to her jailors that i should be put in chains and some of my friends should be sent to perpetual slavery and some killed though we have done no evil  we have neither excited rebellion nor stolen the property of any nor spoken ill of anyyet we are treated thus and our property is confiscated  it will be wise if the persecutors think what they do lest they bring on themselves the wrath of god  but i do not fear  when hateroflies came to my house i rejoiced that i was counted worthy to suffer affliction for believing in jesus  when this speech was reported to the judges rasalama was ordered to be put into heavier irons and severely beaten  this cruel order was carried out and after her tender limbs had been additionally weighted her delicate skin was lacerated with terrible stripes  yet her fortitude never forsook her  nay morethrough the grace bestowed on her she actually sang hymns in the midst of her torment  sometimes indeed her physical strength failed for a brief space  at other times the song of triumph blended with a wail of agony but she always recovered to renew the hymn of praise  her tormentors were confounded  this was something quite beyond their understanding and their only solution of the mystery was that she must be under the influence of some powerful charm  others there were however who listened to her triumphant songs and beheld her calm steadfast countenance with widely different thoughts and feelings  but the sufferings of this poor creature had not yet terminated  the rage of her persecutors was not yet appeased  next day the ordinary chains she wore were exchanged for others consisting of rings and bars fastened around her wrists knees ankles and neck and these when drawn together forced her whole body into a position that caused intense agonysomething like that which we have described as having been seen by mark and his comrades in the same prisonhouse  in this posture it was impossible to use the voice in song but doubtless she was not even then prevented from making melody in her heart to the lord for whose name she suffered so much  all night long was this terrific trial endured but with the dawn of day came relief for then the chains were relaxed and so great was the change that poor rasalama looked forward to the fate which she knew awaited her with feelings of joy  that fate was not long delayed  soon they led her out of the prison and took the road which conducted towards the southern extremity of the hill on which the city stood where was the tremendous precipice down which many a criminal and many a christian martyr had already in ranavalonas evil reign been hurled out of time into eternity  yet this was not the gate through which rasalama was to pass into paradise  see note 1  as she walked along the poor martyr began again to sing a favourite hymn  when passing the place of worship at that time closed she exclaimed there have i heard the words of the saviour  hundreds of people accompanied her  some even ventured to whisper words of comfort to her as she went along although by doing so they imperilled their own lives and one young man utterly regardless of consequences walked boldly by her side speaking to her of the saviour till the place of execution was reached  to this spot mark breezy and his companions in exile had hastened for the secretary had told them that some of the christians were about to be executed and a fearful suspicion that their friend mamba might be among the number impelled them to hasten to the spot with some halfdefined intention of interfering in his behalf  for they had gradually and imperceptibly to themselves acquired a great liking for the young native whose earnest straightforward yet playful spirit together with his great kindness to his mother had deeply impressed them during the brief time they had sojourned together in the forest  will we fight for im massa asked ebony with anxious looks as they ran to the place of execution which was not faroff  that would be useless answered mark  if we were thirty samsons instead of three ordinary men we could not overcome the queens army  ive half a mind to try said hockins with something unusually fierce in his expression  many a man has run amuck before now  ive got to die once at any rate  and what good would that do to mamba asked mark  no i will try another plan  i have fortunately done service to the queen in saving the life of her son  if mamba is to be martyred i will throw my arms round him and ask the queen in return to spare the life of my friend  they had by that time mingled with the dense crowd that stood on the brow of the precipice of ambohipotsy to witness the execution  pushing to the front with breathless anxiety they were just in time to see rasalama led forward by two men armed with spears  in front of them was a shallow ditch and a little further on the brow of the precipice from which was seen a magnificent prospect of the surrounding country  but no prospect however sublime could have attracted the eyes of the three friends just then for in front of them stood two crosses supporting the bodies of two christians who had been crucified thereon the day before even these however lost their horrible power of fascination when they observed the cheerful holy expression of rasalamas countenance as she was led to the edge of the ditch which was to be her grave  the bottom of that grave was already strewn with the bloody remains and the bleaching bones of other martyrs who had preceded her  the crowd who had followed the procession with imprecations against the christians now ceased to shout  will you allow me a short time to pray asked rasalama of the executioners  her request being granted she kneeled on the rocky ground clasped her hands and raised to heaven a look of calm trustfulness as she held communion for the last time on earth with her redeemer  where is the god she prays to that he does not save her now whispered some  others held their peace but laid these things to heart  while the poor creature was thus engaged the two executioners without warning thrust their spears deep into her body  it was the custom of these men to plunge the spears into the loins of their victims on each side of the backbone in such a position that they did not produce immediate death but allowed the martyrs to tumble into the ditch and writhe there in agony for some time with the spears still sticking in them  happily in the case of rasalama the thrusts wereeither intentionally or accidentallymore effective than usual  after a very brief struggle her happy soul was set free to be for ever with the lord  in that ditch her poor mangled body was left to be devoured by the wild dogs that frequent all places in madagascar where criminals suffer see note 2  oh god exclaimed mark unable to repress a groan  let us quit this accursed spot  stay sir stay whispered the sailor at his elbow you forget mamba more are comin  more martyrs were indeed coming as the singing of hymns proved  close on the heels of rasalama a band of nine other christians were carried to the place of execution each with his feet and hands tied together and slung on a pole the ends of which were borne by two men straw had been stuffed into their mouths to prevent praying or singing but several of them managing to get rid of the straw burst into the triumphal songs which had attracted the attention of our seaman  arrived at the ditch the victims were asked if they would give up praying to jesus  in every case the answer was a decided no  they were then thrust into the ditch forced down on their knees and made to bend forward  while this was being done the shuddering friends of mamba perceived that he was not among the martyrs  one by one each unfortunate was stabbed in the loins close on either side of the backbone but not one was terrified into recanting although by so doing he might have been restored at once to life and liberty  the truth of that word as thy days thy strength shall be was clearly and wonderfully proved in the case of these sufferers  after all had fallen their heads were cut off and placed in a row on the edge of the ditch  five of the nine belonged to one family  one man who had been reserved to the last for some reason or other that was net explained was led to the brow of the precipice and the same question was put to him that had been put to his fellowmartyrs  from the spot on which he stood he could look down into the awful gulf a sheer descent of sixty feet first to a place where a ledge projected and then a further descent of still greater depth to the bottom where the ground was covered with rocks and debris from the cliffs  unfaltering in courage and allegiance to the master his no was distinct and decisive  next moment he was hurled over  with terrific force he struck the ledge and it must have been a lifeless body that was finally shattered on the plain below  as the people immediately began to disperse after this mark and his friends hastened sway from the place with an overwhelming sense of horror upon them but thankful as well as relieved to know that their friend mamba was not yet among the martyrs    note 1  rasalama was in truth the first martyr of madagascar  she was slain in the year 1837  we have only transposed the date  her story is given without variation worthy of mention from authentic records    note 2  close to the spot where the heroic rasalama knelt to pray and die a large memorial church now stands the spire of which forms a conspicuous object in every distant view of the city    chapter twenty one  mamba subjected to the ordeal of the tangena escapes but afterwards accuses himself and is condemned  if not yet among the martyrs it was soon evident that mamba stood a good chance of being among them before longand that the mother of whom he was so fond and for the gratification of whose spiritual longings he had risked so much would probably never receive the gospel of peace from his hands  while in prison under accusation of being a believer in the religion of the white man he had debated much with himself as to what was his duty in the present distress  was he bound to confess christ and take the consequencewhich of course he knew to be death  to deny him was out of the question  he at once dismissed that idea as untenable  but was there no other mode of escape  did not the word itself advise that when persecuted in one city he was not only entitled but advised to escape to another  but how am i to escape  oh god guide me he cried lifting his clasped hands as he converted the question into a prayer  the rattling of his chains seemed to bid him dismiss all hope but he did not lose faith  he continued to pray and meditate  and the longer he meditated the more anxiously did he long to be back in the cave beside his renihis humbleminded loving little motherand beside yes he made no attempt to conceal it from himselfbeside the beautiful queenlike sister of laihova  the more he meditated however the more hopeless did his case seem to become  to lie he would notnot even to gain ramatoa  to die he would rather not  to escape he could not  at last he hit upon an idea  he would refuse to answer  he would take refuge in absolute silence  as might have been expected this course of policy did not avail him much  when it was found that he would not say whether he was a christian or not it was resolved that the matter should be settled by an appeal to the ordeal of the tangena  this used to be a common and muchpractised ordeal in madagascar in days but recently past  it consisted in the administration of poison  other ordeals existed in the islandsuch as passing a redhot iron over the tongue or plunging the naked arm into a large pot of boiling water and picking out a pebble thrown therein for the purpose of trial  alas for both innocent and guilty subjected to either trial  but the ordeal most universally in favour was that of the tangena  the tangena is in fact a poisonous nut about the size of a chestnut which derives its name from the tree that bears it  if taken in small doses it acts as an emetic if in large doses it kills  many pages would be required to give a full and particular account of all the malagasy superstitions connected with the ordeal  let it suffice to say roughly that previous to the poison being administered the accused person is obliged to swallow whole or rather bolt three pieces of the skin of a fowl about the size of a dollar  then the decoction of tangena in ricewater is administered  if given strong it kills and the unfortunate is held to have been guilty  if not too strong and the sufferer be able to bear it vomiting is the result and the three pieces of skin are eagerly looked for  the finding of the pieces proves the accused to be innocent  the not finding of them proves him guilty and at once if he be a free man he is killed if a slave he is sold and got rid of in some distant market  there was a very complex system of combined profit and superstition surrounding the whole affair which it is difficult as well as useless thoroughly to understand but which it is easy to see afforded clever scoundrels the means of persecuting defrauding or killing any whom they chanced to dislike or who stood in their way  of course it was very easy to make the potion strong enough to kill or to dilute it with ricewater until it became almost harmless  now when mark breezy heard that mamba was condemned to swallow the tangena he went straight to his friend rakota  prince rakota he said earnestly if your expressions of gratitude to me are sincere you will save the life of this man  i will try returned the prince but the queen is very angry just now  when the prince pleaded for the mans life ranavalona asked of what he was accused  of praying to the christians god  does he admit the charge demanded the queen sternly  noi believe not  then let the tangena decide  it always speaks the truth  our ancestors thought so and i will not change the customs of our ancestors said this outrageously conservative queen  rakota however was a determined man and not easily foiled  going privately to those who had the management of the matter he made use of those mysterious arguments with which princes manage to attain their ends and afterwards told mark the result which was according to hockins that mambas grog was to be wellwatered  as mark could do nothing more for his friend he went with his companions to see the result  there was another man accused of stealing who was to be tested at the same time  he was a strong sturdy pugnaciouslooking man  a good deal of ceremonial of course preceded the ordeal  among other things the poison had to be tested on two fowls  it killed them both and was deemed too strong  being diluted it was tried on two other fowls and killed neither  it was therefore considered rather weak  at last having been reduced to the exact strength which killed one fowl and only sickened the other the potion was administered to the reputed thief after a long prayer or invocation  for two hours there was no result but at the end of that time the pains began and increased with much violence yet the man maintained his innocence  his agonies were soon extreme  amidst his torture he solicited medicine but this was refused  his bowels he said were writhing as if in knots  his groans were awful  his eyes seemed ready to start from their sockets  his countenance assumed a ghastly hue and his entire frame was convulsed with torture  then he vomited violently and fortunately for him the three pieces of skin which he had swallowed made their appearance  he was at once pronounced innocent and set free  poor mamba had to witness all this before his own turn came  once more he was questioned but continued dumb  then he was made to swallow his three pieces of skin and to drink the tangena  the state of mind of his friends as they watched him after what they had just seen may be conceived but cannot be described  in mambas case the poison acted differently  being well diluted its effects although severe were not to be compared with those experienced by the first sufferer  still they were bad enough and vomiting commenced much sooner  to the great satisfaction of his friends the three pieces of skin were ejected and mamba being pronounced innocent had his fetters removed and was set free  but when mark hastened to congratulate him what was his surprise to see the poor fellow clasp his hands and raise them to heaven while an expression of painvery different from that resulting from physical sufferingconvulsed his features  oh no no he exclaimed in a tone of agony i am not innocent  i am guilty guilty very wicked  i have denied thee dear lord by my looks though not with my lips  forgive me o god  then turning quickly to the officers of justice hereput on the chains again  i am a praying man  i love the lord jesus  he will save you as well as me if you will come to him  as this was spoken in the native language our englishmen did not understand it but they had little difficulty in guessing the drift of it when they saw the officers replace the chains and lead mamba back to prison where the last words the jailor heard as he left him were mother mother  ramatoa  i shall never more see your dear faces in this lifenever more  but in this mamba was mistaken as the sequel will show  meanwhile mark hurried back to the palace and told rakota what had occurred  the prince was not surprised  he had mingled much with the christians and knew well the spirit by which they were animated  he went at once to the queen who was enraged at first by his persistent pleading vowed that mamba should die and gave orders to that effect but on reconsidering the matter she commuted the sentence into lifelong slavery in long chains  there is usually but brief delay between a sentence and its execution in madagascar  the very next day heavy chains were riveted on mamba these at one end were attached to an iron collar round his neck at the other end to iron rings round his ankles  what sailors would call the slack of these heavy fetters was gathered up in one of the wearers hands and thus carried while he moved about at work  the poor fellow was first set to work on a piece of roadmending just outside the city gate with several othersmartyrs and criminalsin similar condemnation  and here mark and his companions met him unexpectedly before they were aware that the fearful punishment had begun  at the time poor mamba was toiling with pick and shovel  his heart was almost broken  death he could have faced without flinching but to be a lifelong slave in galling chains with the possibility even of seeing his mother and ramatoa without being permitted to go near or speak to them was almost more than he could bear  a deep groan burst from his overcharged breast as he cried oh lord jesus enable me to bear it  it was just then that ebony observed him and uttered a falsetto cry of astonishment  the secretary who was conducting mark and hockins on a visit to one of the suburban places of resort stopped and looked round  dars mamba massa cried ebony  mark ran to him at once but was stopped by the guard  a few words from the secretary however sufficed and mark was allowed to speak to the slave which he did through the secretary  despair was in mambas every tone and look for the crushing calamity was too recent and too tremendous to be borne with equanimity at first yet through it all there ran as it were a tiny silver thread of hope  for is it not true he said that with god all things are possible  my friend said mark in reply and with a burst of enthusiasm i will save you somehow  keep a good heart  mamba smiled faintly yet gratefully as he shook his head gathered up the superfluous links of his chain and resumed his toil  how will you save him asked the secretary with a peculiar halfamused look as they walked away  i know not answered mark  but we have a proverb where theres a will theres a way and i have a determined will to save my poor friend from this slavery  i will not cease to tryas we say in england i will leave no stone unturnedtill i have accomplished this thing moreover i will not cease to pray for this end  mambas trust in god puts me to shame  up to this time i have only recognised by name that saviour whom this man worships  god helping me i will henceforth follow the lord  to the surprise of the young man the secretary turned suddenly on him and grasped his hand and said in a low voice as he looked cautiously roundit gives me joy to hear you speak so  i too am a follower of jesus  i tell you this because i know now that you will not betray me  there are many of us in the palace besides prince rakota but we dare not speak out for the queen is very angry as you know  hush tell it not even to our companions  little birds have ears  if the queen suspects any of us in her present state of mind she will either ruin or kill us  i have heard something of this said mark from the friend who guided us to the capital  i know interrupted the secretary with an intelligent nod  it was ravoninohitriniony  he is wellknown to us  he loves rafaravavy and is now in the neighbourhood of the capital hoping to induce her to fly with him to the forests  you are surprised but you would not be so if you knew the number of spies that ranavalona has out everywhere  has my friend ravonino we call him so for brevity been seen in ini mean near the city lately asked mark anxiously  not in the city certainly returned the secretary  bold and daring though he is he would scarcely venture that but he has been seen and heard of more than once lately  mark felt relieved  it was evident the secretary neither knew of nor suspected the fact that ravonino had actually attended the garden party and met rafaravavy almost under the queens eyes  remembering however that the prime minister had sent soa to pretend to be a christian in order that he might discover the secrets of the christians and not having yet had much experience of the secretarys character he resolved to be very cautious in his reference to ravoninoindeed to any one with whom he had to do  acting on this resolve he changed the subject by asking questions about the extensive ricegrounds around the capital  the secretary was of a communicative disposition and evidently fond of airing his english  he willingly followed in conversation wherever the young doctor chose to lead and gave him and his friends a great deal of interesting information as to the manners and customs of the malagasy peopletheir habits beliefs and laws  among the latter he spoke of a curious fact in regard to criminals which gave mark a sudden inspiration  hockins afterwards styled it a wrinkle  ebony called it a dodge  but whatever might be said on that head it had the effect of very materially altering the conditions of some of the personages of this tale as the following chapters will show    chapter twenty two  the court physician prescribes for the queena blowup and mysterious preparations for tremendous surprises  about this time the anger of queen ranavalona against the christians was so great that she made herself quite ill and more than once had to send for her court physician mark breezy to prescribe for her  our youthful medico understood her complaint which was a simple one he prescribed much exercise change of air and amusement so as to distract her mind from the cares of state and the evil passions to which she was giving way  he hoped thus to serve the christians indirectly for he saw clearly that the mere mention of their existence made her ill  some slight administrations of physic also coupled with judicious alterations of diet put her majesty in a state of such excellent health and spirits that she began to entertain quite a warm regard for her court physician and congratulated herself not a little on the good fortune which had sent him to the capital  thus mark was enabled to disperse for a time the dark cloud which had been lowering over the landnot however in time to prevent many christians from being slain and some even of the officers and ladies of the palace from being degraded their honours taken from them and themselves and children sold as slaves  among the ladies rafaravavy had a narrow escape  for a time her life seemed to hang by a hair for she was rebellious as well as fearless and would sing her favourite hymns in spite of orders to the contrary love prevailed however as in the case of prince rakota and she was tolerated as a sort of spoilt child  being a favourite mark of course became a man of power in the capital this fact would have raised him a host of enemies had it not been for the kindness of his disposition and the urbanity of his manners  when a strapping powerful young fellow treats every one with respectful deference keeps in the background and neither by word nor look asserts himself but on the contrary seems to entertain kindly thoughts about every one it argues such an absence of selfishness that most people are irresistibly attracted to him  thus unwittingly he escaped jealousy and enmity in a palace where both were rife and holding in his hands as he did the power to alleviate many of the ills that flesh is heir to he secured a good deal of warm friendship  being also an ingenious youth he devised many little plans for amusing ranavalona and preventing her mind from dwelling on dangerous memories among other things he induced her to go in for a series of garden parties and encouraged the people to practise their national games at these gatherings in a systematic way  what all this was ultimately to lead to he did not knowindeed at first he had no particular end in view save the great one of preventing the queen from ordering any more of the horrible scenes of bloodshed which he and his friends had so recently witnessed  but as time ran on his ideas became more definite and concentrated  it occurred to him that ravonino would inevitably venture to attend the garden parties in the hope of again meeting rafaravavy and now that the secretary had avowed himself on the side of the christians he felt that through him he might influence her to agree to her lovers proposal  then his plan to effect the rescue of mamba was gradually matured  ebony he exclaimed suddenly one afternoon when sitting at his table preparing some villainous compound for the queen go down to the laboratory boy and fetch me some gunpowder sulphur saltpetre and charcoal  marks laboratory by the way contained not only the medicines which chanced to be in the capital at that time but also a vast collection of miscellaneous articles and substances which in the opinion of palace officials could be classed however remotely with doctors stuffs  them stuffs remarked hockins who sat luxuriously in an armchair smoking a short pipefor he had unfortunately obtained tobacco since arriving at the capitalthem stuffs are apt to cause surprisin effects wen properly mixed  just so  that is my reason for sending for them  i shall create some surprising effects if my old cunning in pyrotechny has not forsaken me when i was a schoolboy you must know i was fond of dabbling in fireworks and it strikes me that i could compound some things that would charm the queen and astonish the natives  massa asked ebony powerful surprise expressed in his sable visage while mark spooned large quantities of the ingredients referred to into an earthenware dish is dem powders to be took inside arter bein well shooken or rubbed outside  whichever way you please ebony  would you like to try  no thankee massa  now then look here said mark making some pencil notes on a sheet of paper after arranging several plates in a row  you and hockins set to work and mix these in the exact proportions set down on this paper id do it myself but im due at the palace and you know the queen does not like to be kept waiting  stick to the paper exactly and here you have an eggcup a tablespoon and a teaspoon to measure with  put your pipe out i advise you hockins before beginning  if rainiharo should call tell him he will find me with the queen  i dont like that prime minister  hes a prime rascal i think and eggs the queen on when she would probably let things drop  hes always brooding and pondering too as if hatching mischief  if thats a sign of hatching mischief said hockins with a short laugh the same thing may be said of yourself doctor for youve done little but brood and ponder for more nor a week past  true i have been plotting but many a man plots much without much resulting  hurrying away mark found the secretary waiting for him to act as interpreter for the queen understood little or no english  after the preliminary ceremonial salutations the young doctor asked if her majesty would honour the gardens with her presence the following day hold a grand reception and make arrangements to remain in anosy till after dark  yes the queen was quite ready to do so but why did her court physician make such a proposal  had he some new surprise in store for her  i have answered mark  in my country we make very grand displays with fire  but i have various little surprises and plots in store which cannot be properly wrought out unless ranavalona will consent to go to the gardens privatelythat is to say without public announcement for that has much to do with the success of my scheme  it shall be done though it is against my custom said the queen with a goodnatured nod for she had begun to regard her young physician as an eccentric creature who needed and deserved encouragement in his amusing and harmless fancies  immediately after the audience mark and his sympathetic interpreter the secretary obtained an interview with rafaravavy  the doctor began abruptly  i am well acquainted with your lover dear young lady  at this she pouted a little blushed terribly and drew her pretty figure to its full heightwhich was not great  and continued mark i have been very deeply indebted to him  rafaravavy relaxed a little and fixed her fine dark eyes on the youth searchingly but said nothing  now i know mark went on pretending not to observe the maidens varying moods that my friend loves you so profoundlyso deeplythat he will risk his life to see you and if he is caught you are well aware that in the present state of the queens mind the result would be his deathalmost certainly and perhaps you would die along with him therefore if you get an opportunity soon you should agree to fly with him  during the first part of this speech the young girls face glowed with evident pleasure but the last part was unfortunate  it did not suit the temper of one who was brave as she was beautiful  i know not sir she said with flashing eyes while the little figure drew up again what english girls may think or do but malagasy women are not afraid to die with those whom they love  your advice may be kindly meant but i doubt if it is wise  besides i am a servant of my queen and owe allegiance to her  your queen mademoiselle is a servant of the devil said mark whose indignation was severely stirred  and rafaravavy do you not profess to be a servant of the christians godthe almighty  does not the book state that it is impossible to serve two masters  come come cried the secretary in a sharp tone after translating this faithfully it is time to go  follow me  marks surprise at this abrupt termination of the interview was great but as rafaravavy retired hastily he had no resource but to follow his friend  why so sharp he asked as they passed along the corridor  because you have said enough returned the secretary with a quiet smile  you may understand your own women no doubt but not the malagasy girls as well as i do  when a man has said enough to a woman he should stop and let it simmer  all the rest that he would say she will say to herselfand say it much better too  but tell me when do you think ravoninohitriniony will meet rafaravavy  i dont know  all i know is that a true lover is sure to manage a meeting soonand somehow  he was glad to be able to make this indefinite reply for although he trusted the secretary and would have revealed his own affairs fully to him he felt that he had no right to reveal the affairs of his friend to any one  before they reached the palaceyard a loud report was heard  the palace shook as with an earthquake  loud cries of soldiery were heard without and marks heart sank with an undefinable dread  to account for this report we must go back a little  when hockins and ebony were left as we have seen to mix their powders the former being a reckless man forgot to put his pipe out and ebony being a careless man as regarded himself did not observe the omission  the consequence was that the seaman kept on puffing and emitting sage reflections to his admiring friend while they mixed their compounds in concert  hand me the powder ebony  das goodha ha das awrful good cried the negro referring to the latest sage reflectionas he pushed across the powder canister which was a large one  at that inauspicious moment a spark fell from the pipe  next moment the door was burst open the window blown out hockins was laid fiat on his back while ebony went headoverheels upon the floor  slowly and with a dazed look the seaman raised himself on one elbow and looked round  anyanything of ye left boy he asked quietly  iis not kite sure ockins replied the negro slowly passing his hand down one of his legs without rising from the floor  ow does it feel wid you  all right i think replied the seaman rising and presenting a remarkable exhibition of singed beard and frizzled locks no bones broke anyhow  at that instant mark rushed into the smokefilled room in consternation followed by the secretary and a number of soldiers who formed the guard of the palace and great was their surprise as well as their satisfaction to find that the two men had received no damage worth mentioning  well i am thankful exclaimed mark beginning to pick up the debris of plates and furniture  so am i remarked the sailor thankful to think that ive got it over at lastso easy too  why what do you mean  i means doctor that ive gone the whole round o human possibilities nowleastwise i think soand am alive to tell it  ive bin shot an stabbed an drowndedall butan now ive bin blowd up  sos i ockins so you neednt boast remarked ebony as he tenderly felt the place where his wool ought to have been but where only a few irregularlyshaped patches of scrub remained  we need scarcely say that mark breezy did not allow this little contretemps to interfere with his plans  youll have to work all night both of youthats your punishment for disobeying ordersand without the solace of a pipe too said mark when order was somewhat restored and work resumed  the garden party you know is fixed for tomorrow and its as much as our heads are worth to disappoint the queen of her expected amusements  time tide and ranavalona the first wait for no man  ive got to go out for an hour or so  when i return ill show you how to make stars and crackers and red rain etcetera  but i say doctor asked hockins looking up from his work where are the cases to hold all this here stuff  time enough for that when we want em  ive got some fellows at work on small ones and theres a big one that will open the madagaskite eyes if theres virtue in saltpetre  its made ofah here it comes he added as the door opened and two natives carried in a piece of castiron pipe about six feet long and four inches in diameter  the pistolbarrel of a giant exclaimed the seaman  a young cannon said ebony  wy massa you gwine to make a roman candle ob dat  he turned for an answer but mark had hastily quitted the house  encountering the secretary in the courtyard he took his arm and said i want your help  well you shall have it  but you are so mysmyswhat is itsterious about your leetil plans that i fear my help is not useful  oh yes it is i want you to get me a paper fromi dont know who the proper officer whoever he is authorising me to take a gang of convictsfour will doto work for me  good you shall have it returned the secretary with a laugh  i see you are going to give us big surprises tomorrow  you are right i am said mark as the secretary left him to execute his mission  armed with an order mark left the palace and hurried through the steep narrow streets of the town until he reached a piece of road that was being mended by four slaves in long chains  that morning mark had observed that his friend the crocodile was one of the four  passing close enough to attract the attention of the poor fellow he whispered without stopping mamba expect me tomorrow  this he had said in the native tongue having by that time acquired a few sentences of which he made the best and most frequent use possible  going to the guard of these slaves he presented his paper and said that he should come personally for them early in the morning  then he returned to the laboratory and assisted his comrades to load the firework cases with various kinds of fire stars golden rain etcetera  the young cannon especially was loaded with a succession of surprises to the very muzzle before midnight  suppose he bust suggested ebony with a solemn visage  de queen ob madigascur be blowd into middle ob nixt weekhey  i shall take precautions against that ebony  in the first place ill have it buried in the earth up to the muzzle and in the second place ill not place it too near her majesty  when all was prepared the wearied triumvirate retired to rest each to dream of the subjects that lay nearest his heart and imagination at the moment  hockins dreamed of tobaccopipes and explosions mark dreamed of freed slaves thunderstruck queens eloping lovers and terrible consequences and ebony dreamed of incomprehensible situations crashing thunderbolts and unimaginable coruscations of resplendent fire    chapter twenty three  in which mark carries out his plans successfully and powerfully astonishes himself as well as every one else  it was a brilliant lovely morning when the guests began to wend their way to the suburban residence of anosy where ranavalona was to hold her garden party  the people were very gay somewhat excited and very chatty for they were aware that the young english doctor had prepared something new and surprising for the queens special benefit  just before the earliest of these guests however had set off to the garden our three heroes had passed down to that part of the road where the four slaves were already at work with pick and shovel and clanking chain  it was a little after sunrise when mark went up to the guard to relieve him  take care said the guard when about to leave that you keep the slaves well out of the way when the queen passes  all the others in the neighbourhood have been taken off long ago  i was beginning to be afraid you would not come in time  i understand said mark who knew enough of the language and also of the situation to follow the drift of his meaning  the guard thereupon turned shouldered his musket and went off apparently well pleased at the unexpected relief from duty  while this little incident was occurring three of the slaves were looking on with a slight expression of surprise in their sad faces  the fourth mamba was standing in a dejected attitude before hockins and ebony holding a pick in one hand and his heavy chain in the other  oh man i am sorry to see you like this said hockins extending his brawny hand an i does wish i could set you freebut you know im as helpless as a babby in this matter  mamba dropped the pick and grasped the strong hand but did not look up his heart was too full  he did not understand the seamans words but he understood the tone  if he had looked up he would have seen that the tears were hopping over ebonys cheeks in spite of the powerful efforts of that sympathetic soul to control them and that he was unable to speak because of a lump in his throat  das most awrful he exclaimed at last  oh mamby id fight for you like a wildcat wid the cholera if that would do you any good but it would be ob no use  just then mark came forward  quick follow me he said leading the way to a thick clump of bushes behind a wall that bordered the road here quite concealed yet able to peep through the leafy screen he ordered his party to sit down on a heap of stones and await orders  he then went to the top of a mound that lay immediately behind them  from this he could see the road winding along for about two or three hundred yards  descending to his comrades he sat down beside them  you look anxious doctor remarked the seaman  i am anxious returned mark i am on the point of making a great venture and the results may be serious  but we are in gods hands then turning to mamba who looked at him with much curiosity and a gleam of hope on his intelligent face i have hope of success and have prayed for it  mamba whose knowledge of english was very slight shook his head and looked puzzled  have you forgotten mamba the law of your landthat the criminal who looks upon the queen is from that moment entitled to claim freedom ranavalona is to pass along this road in less than halfanhour  of course mark said this in remarkably bad malagasy but mamba understood  a gleam of intelligence shot into his swarthy visage and his chest began to heave with strong emotion as he glared rather than gazed at the speaker  not less surprised were hockins and ebony when mark explained for although they had indeed heard about the law in question they had forgotten it  after recovering the first shock mamba turned quickly and pointed to his three comrades in suffering  yes yesi understand said mark i shall set them free at the same time  why not  the risk will not be increased  a reglar jaildelivery murmured hockins as he drew in a long breath  hush they come cried mark crouching so as the more effectually to conceal himself in which act he was quickly imitated by the others  according to promise ranavalona had set out from her palace that morning without her wonted display and ceremonial with only a few of her courtiers and a handful of troops around her  she did not however omit the scarlet umbrella of state and it was this brilliant object which had attracted marks attention  when the procession had approached close to the place of concealment mark whispered now and ran to the top of the mound before referred to  the four slaves followed him  the summit gained they turned lifted up their arms and chains looked upon the queen and gave vent to the oooooo which stands to the malagasy in the place of a cheer  recognising the importance of the event hockins and ebony unable to restrain themselves gave vent to a hearty british hurrah  at this interruption the bearers of the royal palanquin or chair halted the soldiers brought their muskets to the ready and a dark frown overspread the features of the queen  before the storm could burst however mark descended the mound went to the side of the chair knelt on one knee and exclaimed  forgive madamforgive me  this then is your doing replied the queen sternly through the secretary who was at her side  it is madam  i am guilty  if punishment must descend i alone should bear it  there was something so modest yet so fearless in the youths tone and bearing that the queens brows relaxed a little  but why did you dare to interfere with my laws demanded ranavalona still angrily  i did not venture to interfere madam returned mark humbly i did but use one law to neutralise another  one of these slaves is my friend  i think he would be very useful in helping me tonight with my magic fires  there was so much of cool presumption in thus quietly changing the subject with such charming modesty of demeanour too that the queen burst into a hearty laugh  strike off his fetters she said and gave the signal to her bearers to move on  ay said mark to the secretary in an authoritative tone and also strike off the fetters of the other three  youve got cheek for anything amost doctor said the amazed and amused seaman as they fell into the procession and followed the queen to the pleasuregarden  here extensive preparations had been made for spending the day in games and festivities that far exceeded anything of the sort ever before attempted in that land  for mark breezy had not only an ingenious mind to devise but an organising spirit to make use of the services of others in carrying out his plans  when the guests were scattered about the grounds after a good breakfast enjoying the delightful shade of the trees tempting the goldfish in the lake with crumbs of food and loitering among the bypaths the young doctor made himself almost ubiquitous  acting the double part of manager of the games and amusements and private conspirator he set an army of palace officials in motion whom he pledged to secrecy and led each to suppose that he was the prime mover in some plot that was to astonish and delight the queen in all which he was ably assisted by the secretary  when he had thus stirred up as it were an air of mystery and expectation he led the secretary hockins and ebony to a retired spot and bidding them sit down gave them a brief address  you see he said the time has now come for me to explain to you more fully the plans and plots with which i have been engaged for some time past  and in doing so i would impress upon you mr secretary that i am placing my life in your hands but i do so without fear believing that you are a christian and will not betray me  mark paused and looked full at the secretary who said but you must remember that i can do nothing that will be disloyal to the queen  if you were persecuted by the queen and threatened with death would you consider it allowable to fly to the forests  yesthe word of the lord recommends that  would you consider it right to assist a fellowchristian to fly  truly i would  well then you will assist me this night for i have spoken to rafaravavy  my malagasy words are few but love does not require many words  she has agreed to fly with ravonino  have you seen ravonino lately asked hockins  noi have not seen him lately  how then do you know he will be ready  because said mark with a peculiar look i have been smitten with his complaint and know that it runs the same course and exhibits the same phases in most men  let a young fellow see his intended bride treated with cruelty and you may be sure that no matter what difficulties may be in the way he will hasten at the very first opportunity to meet and carry off the sweet little fairy in spite of  das me an my black darlin zactlysame zif you bin dar an sawd us do it exclaimed ebony with beaming interest  just so resumed mark  however i have not left things altogether to chance  although i did not see ravonino lately i saw him not very long ago and gave him to understand that when some unusual festivities were going on in this garden he was to be ready at the old spot for whatever might happen  now here is my little plan  you know ive been drilling fifty picked natives for some time in that big shed at the back of the cliff on the north side o the city  i picked them for intelligence as well as strength and activity  well i have taught them a wild wardance  it cost me no little trouble and many sleepless nights to invent it but ive managed it and hope to show the queen and court what can be done by a little organisation  these fifty are first of all to glide quietly among the trees each man to a particular spot and hang on the branches fifty earthen saucers full of grease with wicks in them  at a given signal they are to light these instantaneously and retire  at another signal they are to rush upon the open space in front of the gardenhouse and there engage in a sham fight  while thus engaged men who have been taught will set fire to the mildest of our fireworks  when these are about to go out i will myself light the big roman candle  de young cannon massa  yes the young cannon and that will keep things going for a considerable time  now it is when the fight of the fifty begins and engrosses the attention of every one that i will myself take rafaravavy out from among the ladies and lead her to the rendezvous  you will all stand byto lend a hand if need beat the southeast corner of the gardenhouse that i may know exactly where to find you  my hope and expectation is that by keeping things going as long as possible our friends ravonino and rafaravavy will get a good start  after the flight of the latter is found out nothing more can be done for them  do they go all alone asked hockins  no laihova goes with them and mamba who knows the secret meetingplaces of the christians will i have no doubt soon find out which way they have gone  anyhow they will all certainly make for the cave in betsilioland where so many of their friends are  may god speed them  meanwhile we must keep the queen amused with races wrestling and suchlike and when she begins to get wearied with mere eating and talking i want you hockins to go in for a wrestlingmatch with ebony by way of varying the entertainment and showing them what englishmen and niggers can do  wery good said the seaman with a sedate smile if thats to be the fun you better make your will ebony for ill break your back  all right retorted ebony with a grin an i tink youll be wise to make your last dyin speech afore we begin for ill bust you  the various plans which we have here sketched were carried out with such brilliant success that the queen did not weary at all and darkness began to descend on the scene before the day seemed to have half run its course  at this point mark hastened to the southeast corner of the gardenhouse where he found the other conspirators faithfully at their post  have you the flageolet with you he asked hastily  in course i has  never goes nowheres without it said the seaman drawing the little instrument from his breastpocket  go then make your bow to the queen and give her a tune  you know shes quite in love with your pipeor yourselfand has been asking me about it already  shes in the verandah just now and they are lighting the torches there  with the silent obedience of a manofwars man hockins went off and without prelude began  dead silence was the instant result for the small birdlike pipe seemed to charm the very soul of every one who heard it  we know not whether it was accident or a spice of humour in the seaman but the tune he played was jock o hazeldean  and as mark hurried off to see that his fifty men were in readiness he gave vent to a slight laugh as he thought of the lines    shes ower the border and awa   wi jock o hazeldean  to the surprise of the audience no sooner had the last notes of the air died away than the performer thrust the pipe into his pocket threw off his coat and in a loud voice challenged the best man in madagascar to wrestle with him  as the challenge was given in english of course no native responded  even if it had been given in choice malagasy we question whether any brown man there would have ventured a hug with the huge sailor  but no sooner had the challenge passed his lips than ebony sprang forward flung off not only his coat but his vest and shirt and embraced his white opponent in a grip of iron  at that opportune moment the signal was given to the fifty men who applied their lights and as if by magic the entire scene was illuminated by a blaze of intense light that almost rivalled that of the sun itself  a tremendous oooooo of applause burst from the astonished company who having had their attention fixed on the wrestlers did not observe how the sudden illumination had been effected  truly the proceedings of hockins and ebony would have surprised even more finished wrestlers than those of madagascar for the two men had entered into a sly compact not only to exert their strength to the uttermost but to give way each at certain points or moments when by so doing the appearance of what they styled a backbreaker and a buster might be achieved in an effective manner  it was a marvellous exhibition  ebony glared and gasped  hockins growled and frowned nothing short of a tussle between achilles and hercules could have equalled it  the court from the queen downwards was awestricken eyestrained openmouthed and breathless but mark felt that it was time to cut it short  giving a preconcerted signal he caused both men to fall down side by side as if exhausted but not conquered  then he gave another signal  a moment after firewheels and roman candles began to play and the fifty warriors rushed upon the scene brandishing muskets and yelling like fiends  hastening according to orders to the southeast corner of the gardenhouse hockins and ebony found the directorgeneral awaiting them  i cannot delay to fire the big candle he said quickly  de young cannon panted ebony  yes yes  you must fire it for me in about ten minutes or so when the warriors seem to be getting knocked up  follow me hockins and keep close  another minute and rafaravavy who was standing near the queens chair felt a touch on her arm  she looked round with a start for like every one else she had been fascinated and quite engrossed by the scene before her  a glance and motion of the hand from mark sufficed  she glided gently backwards and reached the other side of the house unobserved  here mark grasped her hand and hockins followed  they walked at first but began to run on gaining the shrubbery which was rendered doubly dark by contrast with the glare behind them  in a couple of minutes they reached the thicket where the previous meeting had taken place  the overarching foliage deepened the darkness so that it was impossible to distinguish features  a form was dimly seen but it was only by the sound of the voice that they knew it to be ravonino  few words were uttered  every instant was precious  farewell dear friend said ravonino grasping marks hand god grant that we may meet again in better times  laihova waits for me beyond the garden  he stopped abruptly seized rafaravavys hand and glided with her noiselessly into the thicket for at that moment another figure was seen to approach them  from his unusual size they knew him to be one of ranavalonas chief executioners  he was a coolheaded and suspicious man a sort of natural detective who always had his wits about him having observed several people gliding through the shrubbery he had quitted the sports and followed  to have been recognised by this official would have been fatalat least to those plotters who did not take to flight  hockins who was prompt to conceive and act when danger pressed at once stepped forward and gave the man of blood a righthander on the top of the nose which instantly romanised that feature and laid its owner on his back insensible  at the same momentas if the blow had been the touching of a secret springthe whole garden was lighted up with a magnificent red glare and they knew that ebony had done his part and lighted the giant candle the red glare lasted long enough to reveal the fact that ravonino and rafaravavy were gone and that the man at their feet was indeed the executioner whom they had guessed him to be  leaving him there they ran quickly back to the scene of festivities hoping that their absence had not been observed  before they had gone halfadozen steps there was an explosion like that of a big gun a bomb went high into the air and burst in a magnificent constellation of brilliant stars mingled with fiery rain  the oooooo cheers became vociferous at this and were if possible still more enthusiastic when the red fire changed to a beautiful blue  splendid exclaimed mark much satisfied with the result of his recent labours and it will keep going on for a considerable time yet  as he spoke there was a crash like the loudest thunder and a momentary glare as of the brightest noonlight which was followed by intense darkness while the garden was shaken as if by an earthquake  loud cries and shrieks were accompanied by the falling of a shower of dust and small stones  evidently there had been a catastrophe and the quaking conspirators hastened to the spot half expecting to find the queen and court of madagascar blown to atoms  the whole consarns busted up exclaimed hockins on coming in sight of the gardenhouse  the seamans explanation was the true one  owing to some inexplicable mistake in the loading of the monster roman candle fire had communicated somehow with the lowest charge which was a good strong one intended to propel a glorious mass of ingenious contrivances into the air and end the matter with an effective bang  as it turned out the bang was ten times more effective for it not only blew out the entire charge but burst the castiron case and upturned tons of earth in which mark had taken the precaution to bury the thing up to its neck  at first the queen like her people had got a severe fright but seeing that no one seemed to be hurt she controlled her feelings under the impression no doubt that the explosion was part of the programme  have you got your whistle hockins asked mark quickly as he ran forward  ay siralways here ready for action  come then play up when i give the wordsomething quieting  hold on lets do it sedately  by this time they had got within the circle of torchlight  reducing their run to a smart walk the two friends advanced as mark had suggested sedately in front of the queen while the secretary rejoined the circle of courtiers unperceived  as they advanced they encountered ebony with an unused roman candle in each hand and an expression of horror on his black face  oh massa he began  hush never mind  follow me said mark in a peremptory whisper  another moment and the sweet tones of the flageolet silenced the noise of the excited throng as hockins stood before the queen and played one of the sweetest of scottish songs  mark placed ebony behind his comrade made him hold up the roman candles quietly lighted them both and retired  thus hockins much to his own surprise found himself in the midst of spouting fire producing the melodious notes of afton water  when the little candles exploded our directorgeneral advanced to the royal chair and expressed a hope that the performances had given satisfaction  this the secretaryeverready in time of needtranslated and returned the answer that the queen was charmed after which the proceedings terminated and ranavalona returned to her palace to dream no doubt of fireworks and music instead of martyrdoms  so engrossed was the whole court with the exciting and singular events of the day that no one noticed the absence of rafaravavy and happily the queen did not happen to require her attendance that night  even those who were in closest proximity to the fugitives own room were so taken up with what they had seen that they either did not think of her or supposed that fatigue had induced her to retire early  thus it came to pass that when her flight was discovered on the following day rafaravavy carried by strong and willing bearers and guarded by her devoted ravonino and his faithful friend laihova was being swiftly borne over mountain and plain to the forest stronghold in betsilioland    chapter twenty four  flight and pursuit of ravonino and rafaravavy  the fury of the queen when she heard of the flight of rafaravavy was terrible for this was the second of her favourite ladiesinwaiting who had become christians and deserted her court in fear of their lives raruth the fair little sister of ravonino having been the first  fortunately ranavalona did not think of connecting the flight of rafaravavy with the recent entertainments so that suspicion did not attach to mark and his friends  neither did the executioner with the romanised nose suspect them for in the profound darkness he had not been able to see who it was that knocked the senses out of him and when afterwards he was told of the explosion that had occurred he came to the conclusion and told his friends that a big stone hurled into the air at that time had descended on his head and felled him  whether the friends believed this or not we cannot say but certain it is that they covertly rejoiced in the accident for naturally the man of blood was no favourite  as might be supposed soldiers were at once despatched all over the country in search of the fugitive and the queen relapsing into one of her dark fits of cruelty began to persecute the christians more severely than ever  still mark breezy strove to influence her towards mercy and in some measure restrained her  meanwhile ravonino and his party pushed on in hot haste towards their place of refuge in the wild forest  the dangers to which they were exposed and the risks they ran on this adventurous journey were too numerous to be related in detail  we can only touch on a few of them here  laihova it may be mentioned in passing failed to join them certainly not from want of will but because the place where he had concealed himself was discovered while he lay awaiting the signal to join his friends  two female relations who knew of his hidingplace were caught convicted if we may so put it of christianity and put to the torture although truehearted these poor girls were so agonised by suffering and terror that in a moment of weakness they disclosed the secret but even among prison authorities there were found followers of jesus secretly however for fear of the tyrant queenand one of these sent a swift messenger to laihova to warn him  had the youth been an ordinary man the warning would have been too late for close on the heels of the messenger came the soldiers with his deathwarrant  but laihova was gifted with cool courage and unusual speed of foot  trust also in the certainty of gods blessing whether life or death should be his portion filled him with that spirit of enthusiastic energy which goes so far in all circumstances of life to ensure success  he soon distanced his pursuers left them out of sight behind and finally found refuge with a christian friend who hid him over an oven in his house when he had reached the last stage of exhaustion from hard running and could not have advanced further without rest  the soldiers came up and searched the house while he was asleep but happily did not observe the oven  they remained there however over the night and thus rendered it impossible for laihova to join his friends at that time  ravonino could not of course afford to delay  knowing also that his young friend was well able to take care of himself and that his souls anchor was the lord he felt comparatively little anxiety in starting without him  to let rafaravavy have female companionship on the hazardous journey her lover induced a christian girl who had been named sarah to accompany them  this faithful creature was the means of saving their lives more than once by giving timely warning of approaching danger  the first place to which the fugitives directed their steps was a village about fifty miles from the capital where dwelt a christian who with his wife offered them hospitality and protection  this man had sent a noble message to the persecuted ones in the city  it ran thus  let all the christians who are compelled to run away for their lives come to me  i will take care of them  as long as i am safe they are safe and as long as i have food they shall share it  not an hours rest was taken until the house of their friend was reached  of course they were received with open arms  food was placed before them and mats were spread in a safe place on which they might rest  but neither food nor repose would the fugitives take until they had joined the christian family in thanking god for their escape and in singing his praise  sing the hymn of dear ramanisa said ravonino as he seated himself at the side of rafaravavy after arranging her mat  the host smiled as he turned over the leaves of a malagasy hymnbook all the fugitives like that hymn he said  do you wonder returned his guest  before the last great persecution he was one of our most faithful preachers of the gospel and when trouble came he always forgot himself in his eager desire to help and comfort others  many a time has he guided and strengthened the lords people when they have been compelled to flyto travel weary and footsore by night to wander in the dark forests and hide in the gloomy caves  wherever he went there was sunshine because his heart was very full of the love of jesus and when he was led out to be speared was he not faithful to the last  perhaps we may be permitted to sing his own hymn along with him some day before the throne  no wonder that we love the words of ramanisa  they called him josiah when he was baptized but he was ramanisa when the lord called him and i think that is the name that is written in the book of life  the hymn composed by this good native which these christians began to singand which is incorporated as we have said in the malagasy hymnbookis still and will doubtless continue to be a great favourite with the christians of madagascar  the following is a translation of three of the verses  see note 1    loud to the lord your voices raise   extol his name exalt his praise   publish the wonders of his hand   oer all the earth in every land    oh  god our god to thee we cry   jesus the saviour be thou nigh   oh sacred spirit hear our prayer   and save the afflicted from despair    scarce can we find a place of rest   save dens and caves with hunger pressd   yet thy compassion is our bliss   pilgrims amidst a wilderness  poor rafaravavy had full proof of the truth embodied in these lines both as to the affliction and the bliss before many days were over the soldiers being strong hardy men burdened only with their arms and with little clothing pushed after the three fugitives with so much vigour that they arrived at the place where the latter had rested on the second day of their flight  while soldiers were thus close to them the utmost caution and close concealment were necessary  they remained where they were therefore and every morning before dawn ravonino stole out to a neighbouring mountain with rafaravavy and her maid there they lay hid among the craggy rocks until nightfall when they returned to their friends house  but soon this place of concealment became known to the persecuting prime minister rainiharo who directed the soldiers to search the mountain before going to the village  this they did but did not find the fugitives for as it was cold that morning they had agreed to run the risk of remaining in the house  failing to find those they sought for in the mountain the soldiers entered the village and approached the house where they lay unperceived by human eye and it seemed as if at last rafaravavys doom was sealed other eyes howeververy black and sharp onesobserved the enemy and the owners of these eyesa flock of crowsrose in alarm at their approach  oh exclaimed the handmaiden sarah the crows are at the rice i spread out to dry and out she ran to rescue it  one glimpse of the soldiers was enough  sarah was equal to the occasion  without even a backward glance she gave warning to those in the house but cleverly continued her raid upon the crows laughingly asking the men when she passed them if they had come there to search for runaway christians  this way whispered the host to his two guests when the warning reached him  leading them to an inner room he made them creep under a bed and covered them with a mat  as for the chairbearers and their burden such adjuncts to malagasy travel were too numerous and common in the land to attract much attention  fortunately the soldiers were hungry and being eager for food did not search the house with care but during their stay of an hour poor rafaravavy heard all they said respecting her and the orders that had been issued for her arrest and death  at the same time ravonino became aware that his presence in the neighbourhood was known though his complicity in the abduction of his companion in distress he fancied had not been suspected  that night the fugitives resumed their journey and travelled till dawn when they again found safe refuge in the house of a sympathising friend thus they proceeded for several days and nights with the utmost caution for wherever they went it was found that soldiers had been sent out in pursuit  one night they approached a village where they knew they would be kindly received but had scarcely reached it when they learned that a party of soldiers were searching the neighbourhood for some other woman who had recently disappeared  they were compelled therefore to return to the place they had left the day before  from this point they changed their intended route partly to throw the pursuers off the scent if possible and partly to seek temporary refuge at the house of an old woman who was an aunt of sarah  shes a real good christian said sarah when advising the visit and she fears no one but god  if they ever kill my old aunt she will die singing or praying for her murderers  sure enough when they reached the hut of the old woman they heard her singing hymns at the full pitch of her voice quite regardless of the fact that she was breaking the law and that persecutors were swarming in the land  shelter you exclaimed this old woman when her niece had mentioned the cause of their visit yes i will shelter you as long as my dear lord gives me the power to do so  the need for friendly aid was great for even while the old woman spoke a little girl came bounding into the hut saying that a party of soldiers were approaching  run meet them child  then turn and run away as if you were afraid of them  make them chase you if you can  run  the girl was intelligent  she bounded away and the old woman with a degree of activity that was wonderful at her age led her visitors to the back of her house and hid them in a pit  there they had to spend that night while the aunt entertained their pursuers but next morning after the latter had left their old hostess led them to a plantation close at hand where they remained concealed for several days not daring to move for at various times they saw men who were in pursuit of them pass quite near to their hidingplace  here it was decided that the palanquin or chairbearers should proceed no further as they only increased the danger of discovery and that ravonino rafaravavy and sarah should proceed alone and on foot through the extensive forest which lay just beyond the place  the first night all went well  the moon was clear enough to make travelling easy and no enemies were encountered but the next evening a little after sunset on gaining the crest of a hill they met almost face to face a small band of soldiers who were travelling in the opposite direction  to crouch behind some rocks was the work of an instant  there was no thick underwood at the spot to conceal them  as ravonino glanced quickly round he saw that the only hope was to turn and run  they evidently had not been perceived but what probability was there that the two trembling girls beside him could escape by such means  we must fly dear one he said in desperation putting his arm round rafaravavys waist  i cannot run she said while a look of resignation settled on her face  go you may escape perhaps if the lord will and bring us help  leave us we are ready to die  leave you rafaravavy exclaimed the man with a look almost of triumph  nonot until my god commands  may he help us now  while he spoke he observed a patch of rushes growing at the side of the path  as a last resource he ran in among them leading or rather dragging the two girls  to their joy they found that the rushes grew in a pool of water  it was very shallow but by lying down and sinking themselves into the mud of the deepest part they managed to cover themselves completely except their heads which the rushes effectually concealed  a few minutes later and the soldiers reaching the crest of the hill halted to look round and chat  if it had been broad day at the time the fugitives must undoubtedly have been observed but it was growing dark for a few terrible minutes the men conversedalways on the same theme the capture and death of rafaravavy  then they resumed their march and disappeared among the forest trees  it was a deplorable plight in which the fugitives now found themselves soaking wet covered with mud from their necks downwards and without the prospect of any shelter for the coming night save that afforded by the open forest  poor sarah lost heart entirely for a little time and burst into tears but rafaravavy putting her hand on the maids shoulder said encouragingly the lord reigneth  we will not fear what man can do unto us  will you pray for us she added turning to their protector  ravonino at once kneeled the two girls sank down beside him and in few but earnest simple words he prayed for help in the allprevailing name of jesus  the vigour of body which flowed from the prayer was no fanciful emotion or miraculous effect  the confidence resulting from faith in god and the joy of soul and consequent flow of warm blood were not less natural consequences of prayer than direct answers to it would have been  they rose from their knees refreshed and walked on with renewed energy for a considerable time but at last rafaravavy was fairly overcome with fatigue and an irresistible desire to sleep  her maid being of a more robust physical fibre was not so much overcome and declared that she could still go on easily  ravonino at last solved the difficulty by taking his ladylove in his strong arms  she submitted with a sleepy protest and her little head was no sooner on the mans shoulder than she was fast asleep  and here again the power of joy to give strength became abundantly evident for when he fairly had rafaravavy in his arms a glow of enthusiasm and thankfulness pervaded his entire being so that he felt as if he had scarcely walked any distance at all that day  his endurance however was not destined to be further tested that night for he had not gone far when he came unexpectedly on the hut of a woodcutter who received him hospitably though being taciturn it was not easy to ascertain what were his views as to the religion for which so many people were then suffering  strange to say during all this trying time these fugitives found comfort not only from the word of god but from the pilgrims progress of bunyan  this work had been translated into the malagasy language by the english missionaries and many passages in it were found to be singularly appropriate to and comforting in the circumstances in which the persecuted people were placed  eight copies of the great allegory had been transcribed by the native christians themselves for their common use  these being lent from one household to another the details of the story soon spread  naturally those who possessed strong memories learned much of it by heart and thus it became a book which the afflicted christians prized next to the bible    note 1  extracted from madagascar its missions and martyrs by e prout for the london missionary society    chapter twenty five  the forest refugevoalavo is warlike ravonino peaceful and false friends dangerous  we change the scene now to the profoundest recesses of the tangled forest  here in the deep shadow cast by the overarching trees two native girls wandered out at an early hour one morning to converse about things that interested them deeplyif the varying aspects of their expressive faces were any index to their thoughts  one was tall dark majestic in mien and grave of countenance  the other was comparatively fair of small stature and evidently of lively yet timid disposition need we say that they were ramatoa the sister of laihova and raruth the sister of ravonino  i fear they will never return to us said raruth laying her hand on her friends arm  say not so replied ramatoa we know not what blessings our god has in store for us  only this we are sure of that all things will work together for our good  but the queen is so cruel objected her little friend  when her anger is roused she will do anything  besides has not the messenger told us that the soldiers have been sent in hundreds over the country to search for christians and spies are about everywhere  laihova too has been separated from them he says  perhaps he has been caught  i like not this messenger said the other with a touch of sternness in her look and tone  he seems to me like a wolf in sheeps clothing he does not refer all things to god as our father and in his use of the word he does not seem sincere  i trust that he is not one of the spies  as she spoke her companion uttered a quick exclamation  there was a rustling in the bushes and next moment laihova springing out clasped raruth in his arms  thank god he said in deep earnest tones as he released her  i am not too late  brother said ramatoa anxiously laying a hand on the mans arm are you alone  yes  have not ravoninohitriniony and rafaravavy arrived  no  andand what of mamba asked ramatoa  an expression of profound sadness crossed the features of laihova dropping his eyes on the ground he stood silent  for a few moments his sister did not speak but her breast heaved with suppressed emotion  at last she asked in a low voice  has he been martyred  nohe is not dead  buthe is condemned to slavery in chains for life  terrible though this fate was the news of it evidently conveyed a measure of relief to ramatoa for it assured her that her lover was at all events not dead  where there is life there is hope  i fear this will kill his mother she said  poor renimamba is so full of love and gentleness and her sorrows have been very heavy strange that her husband and son should share the same fateperpetual slavery  yet it is not perpetual  death will set them free  come to the cave and let us break the sad news  as they walked through the forest ramatoa gave her brother a rapid outline of what had occurred since the day he left  they will be deeply grieved she said that our friends are not with you  we had all hoped that you would arrive together  a messenger who has just come did indeed tell us that you had been separated from them but all supposed that you would easily overtake them  true sister but i overshot them  that has been the way of it returned laihova regretfully  still i feel sure that they will escape continued the girl ravoninohitriniony has such a firm trust in god and he is so strong and brave and wise  besides he has the blood of the white man in his veinshe will succeed or die  this compliment to her brother whether deserved or not had the effect of raising a flush of pleasure on raruths little face  many things have happened since you left us resumed ramatoa razafil the poet has come to stay with us and voalavo too  voalavo exclaimed laihova in surprise is he not the chief of a tribe that does not love jesus  and he was not a christian when i saw him last  he is a christian now returned the girl quietly if i may judge him by his works  he has been our main stay since you went away  not long after you left us he came saying that you had told him about jesus delivering men from the power of sin and he wanted to know about him you may be sure we were glad to tell him all we knew  he has never said he is a christian but he has stayed with us ever since and hunted for us  he is as active as the youngest men in getting and bringing in wild fruits and the youths are glad to have his wisdom and advice  he listens to us while we sing and he prays in secreti know that he does for i have overheard him  moreover he has brought some of his people over to our side  he seems to be particularly fond of renimamba and she is fond of himfor he is funny  yes he is very funny responded laihova with profound gravity  on reaching the cavern which we have described in a former chapter they found that most of the men were out and the women were busy with those culinary labours which tend to rejoice the hearts of hunters when they return home  the chief voalavo was there however deeply engaged in studyingyes studyingthe pilgrims progress  but he could not make much of it his educationat the hands of raruthhaving commenced only a few weeks before  besides teaching the chief his letters raruth had read to him large portions of the book which had so fascinated him that he had applied himself to his letters with a will and being an able man had begun to make rapid progress  his desire also to be able to read the biblewhen he began to understand what it was and to perceive the significance of some of its soulstirring wordsstimulated his active mind to greater exertions  the unfortunate poet razafil also fell in with the wonderful allegory in that cave for the first time and it helped in no small degree to turn his mind from brooding over the fate of his dear martyred daughter raniva  his mind was quicker than that of the chief to perceive the grand truths which underlie the story and he was not a little comforted  thus these two men so very differently constituted sat at the feet of the fair raruth who being as we have said timid and rather distrustful of herself was overjoyed to find that even she could help in advancing the cause of her lord  but it rather perplexed the little maiden when these same men having been gifted with inquiring minds puzzled themselves over the question why the prince of the country in the pilgrims progress did not kill apollyon at once and have done with him  or make him good suggested voalavo  true that would have been better perhaps than killing him assented razafil  like millions of the human race before them the two men got out of their depth here but unlike too many thousands of the same race they did not permit such difficulties to interfere with their unshaken confidence in the love and wisdom of that god who certainly doeth all things well whatever we in our pride and partial ignorance may think of him  voalavos studies on the day we write of did not however engross him so much as to prevent his starting up in great excitement when he heard the sound of laihovas voice  he hastened to the entrance of the cavern and received his friend with his wonted effusive heartiness  but he was damped considerably on learning that laihova came alone that mamba was enslaved and that ravonino and rafaravavy were still wandering in the forest pursued by their enemies  come my young men he shouted flying into a sudden state of indignation and clapping his hands together like a pistolshot we will go and rouse our warriors  arm and make to the rescue  we will dethrone the queenthis ranavalonausurper  why should such a woman live on filling the land with blood and misery  my friend said laihova in a soothing tone as he laid his hand on the chiefs shoulder the arms of christians are not the arms of a soldier  we wrestle not against flesh and blood  that is idle talk exclaimed the unpacified chief  did not christian use a sword  did not greatheart fight apollyon with a sword  true but these were spiritual weapons said laihova  moreover if you did rouse your people and march to the capital what could you do your whole tribe would appear but as a handful of dust in the eyes of the hova army  i would that we were a handful of dust snorted the chief and wed dash ourselves into the eyes of the hova army and kill them while they wept  but there is nothing to prevent us from going forth to meet our friends rejoined laihova and we can take our spears  if they stand in need of help we may give it  this proposition fell in entirely with the warlike voalavos views and a band of the young hunters and fruitgatherers entering the cave at that moment he urged them to make haste with their dinner and get ready for the warpath  everreadyas young blades usually arefor fighting these youths threw down their loads quickly  and truly judging from the contents of the cavern larder that day there was no prospect of famine before the persecuted people  in one part of that larder there was abundance of beef and pork also of game such as guineafowl pheasants partridges peacocks turkeys geese ducks pigeons turtledoves and snipe  in another place the vegetable and fruitgatherers had piled up little mounds of breadfruit pineapples cocoanuts yams plantains bananas maniocroot melons etcetera much of which had been gathered from regions at a considerable distance from their place of abode  thus they had laid up store for many days and felt somewhat elated  but there were two hearts there which found it impossible to rejoice and very hard to submit to god  reni and ramatoa retired to a dark recess in the cave and mingled their tears and prayers together  oh it would have been better if he had died sobbed reni for then he would have been with jesus but now it is awful to think of the lifelong slavery and we shall never more see him on earth  nay mother do not think thus  whatever god does must be best returned ramatoa in a tremulous voice  let us try to say thy will be  she broke down and finished the sentence with prayer for strength and for a submissive spirit  meanwhile the warlike expedition on which voalavo and his youths were only too ready to enter was rendered needless by the sudden appearance of ravonino himself with rafaravavy and sarah  after encountering innumerable hardships and dangers those three had at last arrived at their forest stronghold in safety  so then remarked laihova to raruth after the first enthusiastic reception was over i have only overshot them by a few hours after all  we were just going to sally forth to look for youand fight if need be said voalavo  there was no need for that returned ravonino the lord was our protector  where is renimamba  have you heard mother about your son  reni and ramatoa who had pressed forward looked surprised for their friend did not speak like a man who had bad news to tell  laihova has told me truly replied reni still whimpering that my dear boy is worse than dead  not so mother said ravonino taking the poor womans hand be of good cheer mamba is not dead  i know not indeed where he is at this moment having been pressed in my own flight but i know that the queen has set him freethis much i learned from our white friend mark breezy  more i cannot tell but is not this cause for joy and gratitude  come let us return thanks to our father  most of those present were glad to give vent to their feelings in prayer and praise though some there were who having been led to join the band by the mere force of circumstances had little heart in the matter certainly voalavo was not among these last for the enthusiasm which inclined him to fight with violence also induced him to pray with vigour  when this appropriate act of worship was over food was prepared for the wearied travellers and in a short time the whole party was seated round the cookingfire illuminated by the torches on the wall and listening eagerly to ravonino as he recounted his adventures  i fear much he said in conclusion that another dark season is about to fall on us  it may be like the lastor worse  ravonino here referred and with bated breath to the terrible outbreak of persecution which had occurred several years previously when at the lowest estimate about two thousand men and women were severely punished and many tortured and slain because they professed or favoured the religion of jesus  as one after another various members of the party detailed the sad sufferings or deaths of relatives and friends the feelings of all became deeply affected with grief those of some with a considerable dash also of indignation  among the latter of course was voalavo  why he cried suddenly giving his hands the accustomed pistolshot clap that betrayed his inability to contain himself why do we suffer all this  why not assemble the tribes go up at once to antananarivo take it cut off the queens head and put prince rakota on the throne  ay why not demanded several of the more fiery young men  because the lord tells us to overcome evil with good answered ravonino quietly  then wishing to draw attention from the subject he inquired for the messenger who had brought news of his own escape  all looked round as if expecting the man to answer for himself but no one replied  search was made and then it was discovered that the messenger had hastily taken his departure from the place    chapter twenty six  doctor breezy prescribes for the queen and attains to temporary and perfik flicity  while these events were taking place in the forest queen ranavalona was keeping her court physician and his comrades in a state of considerable uneasiness not only with reference to the safety of their own heads but because of her violent edicts regarding her christian subjects  she renewed her commands as to the necessity of every one coming forward on pain of instant death in the event of disobedience and accusing themselves with the reiterated assurance that if they failed to comply and they were afterwards accused by others they should be subjected to the ordeal of the tangena and slain or reduced to perpetual slavery if found guilty  the whole city was in a panic  no one felt safe  under the influence of fear some accused themselves expecting no doubt that their punishment would be lightened  others remained quiet hoping that they might escape detection while many were accused by false friends as well as by enemies and fell victims under the poison ordeal  others again stood firm and boldly proclaimed their faith in the lord jesus and their readiness to die if need be for his cause  after the accusations trials and investigations sentences were read which deprived four hundred officers and nobles of their honours and levied fines on the remainder to the number of about two thousand  one would have thought that the mere necessity for such widespread punishment would have shown the queen how deeply the new religion had taken root and how hopeless it was to attempt its suppression but she did not see it in that light  on the contrary she issued a mandate requiring all books to be delivered up to her officers and threatening death against any who should keep back or hide even a single leaf  she also commanded her subjects never again even to think of the christian lessons they had learned but to blot them from their memories for ever  among those who boldly held to their opinions was the queens own son rakota who however as we have seen did not run quite so much risk as others owing to his mothers affection for him  the prime ministers son also and prince ramonja made no effort to conceal their opinions though they were wise enough to refrain from exasperating the angry queen by asserting them openly  one morning the prime minister sent a message to the court physician requiring his immediate attendance at the palace  mark was seated in his own room at the time talking with hockins and ebony about the gloomy state of affairs  a slight feeling of dismay fluttered the heart of each when the message came for deathwarrants were much in the air at that time  oh massa praps deyre agoin to kill you was the negros comforting suggestion  more likely they want him to cure the queen said hockins  couldnt you massa whispered ebony with a terribly solemn countenance mix a spoonfula bery small spoonfulob prussic acid or creosote or suffin ob dat sort wid er physic  mark laughed and shook his head as he went out  he found rainiharo with a tremendous frown on his face and deep lines of care on his brow seated in front of our friend the secretary who had an open book on his knee  three other officers of the palace sat beside them  these constituted a court of inquiry into the contents of the suspected books and the secretary being the only literary character among them was the appointed reader  come here  sit down said rainiharo sternly pointing to a seat we want you to explain your books  the queen commands us to examine them and if we find anything contrary to her wishes in them to condemn them to the flames  but it seems to us that there is nothing in them but rubbish which we cannot understand  strange is it not that in barbaric as well as in civilised lands people are apt to regard as rubbish that which they do not understand  so thought the court physician but he wisely held his tongue and sat down  this book said the prime minister pointing with a look of mingled contempt and exasperation to the volume on the secretarys knee is worse than the last  the one we condemned yesterday was what you call your bible  we began with it because it was the biggest book  being practical men we began at the beginning intending to go straight through and give it a fair hearing  we began at gengenwhat was it  genesis answered the secretary  genzisyes  well we found nothing to object to in the first verse but in the secondthe very secondwe found the word darkness  this was sufficient  queen ranavalona does not like darkness so we condemned it at onceunanimouslyfor we could not for a moment tolerate anything with darkness in it  mark felt an almost irresistible desire to laugh outright but as the gratification of that desire might have cost him his head he did resist it successfully  now continued the prime minister with a darker frown we have got to the pilpilwhat is it  pilgrims progress answered the secretary  just sothe pilgims progress  well we agreed that we would give the pilpilgims progress a better chance so we opened it as it were anyhow and what do we come onthe very first thingbut a man named obstinate  now if there is one thing that the queen hates more than another it is an obstinate man  she cannot abide obstinate men  in fact she has none such about her for the few men of that sort that have turned up now and then have invariably lost their heads  but we wanted to be fair so we read on and what do we find as one of the first things that obstinate says  he says tush away with your book  now if the man himself condemns the book is our queen likely to spare it  but there are some things in the book which we cannot understand so we have sent for you to explain it  now added rainiharo turning to the secretary translate all that to the maker of physic and tell me what he has to answer  it was a strange and difficult duty that our young student was thus unexpectedly and suddenly called to perform and never before had he felt so deeply the difference between knowing a subject and expounding it  there was no escape however from the situation  he was not only bound by fear of his life but by scripture itself to give a reason of the hope that was in him and he rose to the occasion with vigour praying mentally for guidance and also blessing his mother for having subjected him in childhoodmuch against his willto a pretty stiff and systematic training in the truths of scripture as well as in the story of the pilgrims progress  but no exposition that he could give sufficed to affect the foregone conclusion that both the bible and the pilgrim containing as they did matter that was offensive to the queen were worthy of condemnation and therefore doomed to the flames  having settled this knotty point in a statesmanlike manner rainiharo bade mark and the secretary remain with him and dismissed his three colleagues  you see he said after some moments of anxious thought although i agree with the queen in her desire to stamp out the christian religion i have no desire that my son and my nephew should be stamped out along with it therefore i wish to have your assistance doctor in turning the mind of ranavalona away from persecution to some extent for in her present mood she is dangerous alike to friend and foe  indeed i would not give much for your own life if she becomes more violent  how is this to be done think you  the question was indeed a puzzler for it amounted to this  how are we to manage a furious bloodthirsty woman with the reins loose on her neck and the bit fast in her teeth  i know not said mark at last but i will think the matter over and talk with you again  if i may be allowed to speak said the secretary  you are allowed returned the premier  then i would advise that the queen should arrange a grand journeya processionall over the country with thousands of her soldiers  this will let her have plenty of fresh air and exercise change of scene and excitement and will give her something to do till her blood cools  at the same time it will show the people her great power and perhaps induce them to be cautious how they resist her will  the idea is good said mark with animation so good that i would advise its being carried out immediatelyeven before another week passes  rainiharo shook his head  impossible  there is to be a great bullfight this week and you know ranavalona will allow nothing to interfere with that  besides it takes time to get up such an expedition as you suggest  however i like the notion well  go  i will think over it and see you again  the bullfighting to which the premier referred was a favourite amusement with this bloodthirsty woman and the spectacle usually took place in the royal courtyard  rainiharo was right when he said the queen would not forego it but she was so pleased with the plan of a royal progress through the country that she gave orders to make ready for it at once in an extensive scale  you will of course accompany me she said to mark when he was summoned to a subsequent audience i may be ill or my bearers may fall and i may be injured  certainly he replied nothing would afford the court physician greater pleasure than to attend upon her majesty on such an expedition but i would ask a favour continued mark  may my black servant accompany me  he is very useful in assisting me with my medicines and  yes yes interrupted the queen let him go with you by all means he shall have bearers if you choose  and take yon other man alsowith his music  i love his little pipe  in some excitement mark went off to tell his comrades the newswhich hockins received with a grunt of satisfaction and the negro with a burst of joy  indeed the anxieties and worries they had recently experienced in the city coupled with the tyranny and bloodshed which they witnessed had so depressed the three friends that the mere idea of getting once again into the fresh free open plains and forests afforded them pleasure somewhat akin to that of the schoolboy when he obtains an unexpected holiday  great was the excitement all over the country when the queens intention was made known  the idea was not indeed a novelty  malagasy sovereigns had been in the habit of making such progresses from time to time in former years  the wise king radama the first frequently went on hunting expeditions with more or less of display  but knowing as they did only too well the cruel character of ranavalona the first the people feared that the desire to terrify and suppress had more to do with the event than pleasure or health  at last everything being complete the queen left the capital and directed her course to the southwestward  her enormous retinue consisted of the members of the government the principal military and civil officers and their wives six thousand soldiers and a host of slaves bearers and other attendants the whole numbering about 40000 souls  great preparations had been made for the journey in the way of providing large stores of rice herds of cattle and other provisions but those who knew the difficulties of the proposed route and the thinly populated character of the country looked with considerable apprehension on the prospects of the journey  some there were no doubt who regarded these prospects with a lively hope that the queen might never more return to her capital  of course such a multitude travelled very slowly as may well be believed when it is said that they had about 1500 palanquins in the host for there was not a wheeled vehicle in madagascar at that time the soldiers were formed in five divisions one carrying the tents one the cooking apparatus and spears and one the guns and sleepingmats the other two had always to be in readiness for any service required about the queen  the camp was divided into four parts the queen being in the middle in a blue tent surrounded wherever she halted for the night by high palisades and near to this was pitched a tent containing the idols of the royal family  the tent of the prime minister with the malagasy flag was pitched to the north of that of the queen  east west and south were occupied by other high officers of state and among the latter was the tent of our friends mark hockins and ebony  now said the first of these as he sat in the door of the tent one evening after supper watching the rich glow of sunshine that flooded a wide stretch of beautiful country in front of him this would be perfect felicity if only we had freedom to move about at our own pleasure and hunt up the treasures in botany entomology etcetera that are scattered around us  true massa returned ebony it would be perfik flicity if we could forgit de poor christns in chains an prisns  right ebony right  i am selfishly thinking only of myself at the present moment  but let us hope we may manage to do these poor christians good before we leave the land  i dont think myself that well get much fun out o this trip remarked hockins  you see the queens too fond o your physickin and of my tootootlin to part with us even for a day at a time  if we was like ebony now we might go where we liked an no one ud care  ob course not replied the negro promptly peepils nebber anxious about whar wise men goes to its ony childin an stoopid folk deys got to tink about  but why not ax de queen massa for leabe ob absence to go ahuntin  because shed be sure to refuse said mark  no i see no way out of this difficulty  we are too useful to be spared  but mark was wrong  that very night he was sent for by the prime minister and as he passed the secretarys tent he called him out to act as interpreter  on reaching the tent on the north side they found rainiharo doubled up on his mat and groaning in agony  whats wrong demanded the doctor  everything replied the patient  describe your feelings said the doctor  iveive got a redhot stone groaned rainiharo somewhere in my inwards  thorny shrubs are revolving in my stomach  young crocodiles are masticating myoh  at this point his power of description failed but that matters little for never having met with the disease before we can neither describe it nor give it a name  the young doctor did not know it but he knew exactly what to do and did it  we cannot report what he did but we can state the result which was great relief in a few minutes and a perfect cure before morning  most men are grateful under such circumstanceseven the cruel rainiharo was so  what can i do for you he asked affectionately next day  a sudden inspiration seized the doctor beg the queen he said to let me and my two friends wander round the host all day and every day for a short time and i will return to report myself each night  for what purpose asked the premier in some surprise  to pluck plants and catch butterflies  is the young doctor anxious to renew his childhood  something of the sort no doubt  but there is medicine in the plants andandinterest if nothing else in the butterflies  medicine in the plants was a sufficient explanation to the premier what he said to the queen we know not but he quickly returned with the required permission and mark went to his couch that night in a state of what ebony styled perfik flicity  behold our trio then once more alone in the great forests of madagascarat least almost alone for the secretary was with them for the double purpose of gaining instruction and seeing that the strangers did not lose themselves  as they were able to move about twice as fast as the host they could wander around here there and everywhere or rest at pleasure without fear of being left behind    chapter twenty seven  in which a happy change for the better is disastrously interrupted  one very sultry forenoon mark and his partywhile out botanising entomologising philosophising etcetera not far from but out of sight of the great processioncame to the brow of a hill and sat down to rest  their appearance had become somewhat curious and brigandlike by that time for their original garments having been wornout were partially replaced by means of the scissors and needle of john hockinsat least in the trousers department  that worthy seaman having during his travels torn his original trousers to shreds from the knee downwards had procured some stout canvas in the capital and made for himself another pair  he was like most sailors expert at tailoring and the result was so good that mark and ebony became envious  the seaman was obliging  he set to work and made a pair of nether garments for both mark wore his pair stuffed into the legs of a pair of wellington boots procured from a trader  ebony preferred to cut his off short just below the knee thus exposing to view those black boots supplied to negroes by nature which have the advantage of never wearing out hockins himself stuck to his navy shirt but the others found striped cotton shirts sufficient  a native straw hat on marks head and a silk scarf round his waist with a cavalry pistol in it enhanced the brigandlike aspect of his costume  this pistol was their only firearm the gun having been broken beyond repair but each carried a spear in one hand a gauze butterflynet in the other and a basket in lieu of a specimenbox on his shoulder even the secretary entering into the spirit of the thing carried a net and pursued the butterflies with the ardour of a boy  oh massa exclaimed ebony wiping the perspiration from his forehead with a bunch of grass i do lub science  indeed why so asked mark sitting down on a bank opposite his friend  why dont you see massa its not comfortabil for a man whats got any feelins to go troo de land huntin an killin cattle an oder brutes for noting  you cant eat more nor one hoxpraps not dat so wen youve kill im an eaten so much as you can dars no more fun for what fun is dere in slaughterin hoxes for noting  den if you goes

his own safetybalve at de time so he ought to have knowd suffin about it  i say ebony asked hockins where did you pick up so much larnin about scienceeh  i pick im in texaswas sistant to a german natralist dar for two year  stuck to im like a limpit till he amost busted hisself by tumblin into a swamp smashin his spectacles an ketchin fever wen he found hisself obleeged to go home to recroothe called itthough what dat was i nebber rightly understood unless it was drinkin brandy an water for i noticed that wen he said he needed to recroot he allers had a good stiff pull at de brandy bottle  ebonys discourse was here cut short by the sudden appearance of an enormous butterfly which the excitable negro dashed after at a breakneck pace in the interests of science  the last glimpse they had of him as he disappeared among the trees was in a somewhat peculiar attitude with his head down and his feet in the air  thats a sign he has missed him remarked hockins beginning to fill his pipethe tobacco not the musical one  ive always observed that when ebony becomes desperate and knows he cant git hold of the thing hes arter he makes a reckless plunge with a horrible yell goes right down by the head and disappears like a harpooned whale  true but have you not also observed said mark that like the whale hes sure to come to the surface againsooner or laterand generally with the object of pursuit in possession  i blieve youre right doctor said the seaman emitting a prolonged puff of smoke  does he always go mad like that asked the secretary who was much amused  usually replied mark but he is generally madder than that  hes in comparatively low spirits today  perhaps it is the heat that affects him  whew how hot it is  i think i shall take a bath in the first pool we come to  that would only make you hotter sir said hockins  ive often tried it  at first no doubt when you gits into the water it cools you but arter you come out you git hotter than before  a hot bath is the thing to cool you comfortably  but we cant get a hot bath here returned mark  you are wrong said the secretary we have many natural hot springs in our land  there is one not far from here  how far asked mark with some interest  about two ricecookings off  to dispel the readers perplexity we may explain at once that in madagascar they measure distances by the time occupied in cooking a pot of rice  as that operation occupies about halfanhour the secretary meant that the hot spring was distant about two halfhoursthat is between three and four miles off  lets go an git into it at once suggested hockins  better wait for ebony said mark  thento the secretaryyours is a very interesting and wonderful country  it is and i wonder not that european nations wish to get possession of itbut that shall never be  mark replied i hope not and regarded his friend with some surprise for he had spoken with emphasis and evidently strong feeling  have you fear that any of the nations wish to have your country  yes we have fear returned the secretary with an unwontedly stern look  they have tried it before perhaps they will try it again  but they will fail  has not god given us the land  has not he moved the hearts of engleesh men to send to us the bible  has not his holy spirit inclined our hearts to receive that word  yesit has come  it is planted  it must grow  the european nations cannot hinder it ranavalona cannot stamp it out  false friends and open foes cannot crush it  the word of god will civilise us  we will rise among the nations of the earth when the love of jesus spreads among usfor that love cures every evil  it inclines as well as teaches us to deny self and do good  it is not possible for man to reach a higher point than that  deny self  do good  we are slow to learn but it is sure to come at last for is it not written that the knowledge of the lord shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea  i believe you are right said mark much impressed with this outburst and the earnest enthusiasm of his friends manner  and he continued you have a noble country to work onfull of earths riches  you say noting but the truth answered the secretary in a gratified tone  is not our island as bigor more bigas yoursnearly the same as france  and look around  we have thousands of cattle tame and wild with which even now we send large supplies to foreign markets and fowls innumerable both wild and tame  our soil is rich and prolific are not our vegetables and fruits innumerable and abundant  do not immense forests traverse our island in all directions full of trees that are of value to mantrees fit for building his houses and ships and for making his beautiful furniture as well as those that supply cocoanuts and figs and fruits and gums and dyes  and have we not the silkworm in plenty and cottonplants and sugarcane and many spices and the great foodsupply of our peoplerice besides minerals which make nations rich such as iron and gold  yes we have everything that is desirable and good for man  but we have a climate which does not suit the white man  yet some white men like yourself manage to live here  is not this a voice from god  he does not speak to us with the tongue of man but he speaks with a still small voice as easy to understand  he has surrounded our island with unhealthy shores  does not that tell the white man not to come here  your london missionary society sent us the bible  god bless them for that  they have done well  but they have done enough  we desire not the interference of england or france in our affairs  we do not want your divisions your sects  we have the word  god will do the rest  we want no white nations to protect us  we want to be let alone to protect and develop ourselves with the bible for our guide and the holy spirit as our teacher  you englishmen were savages once and the word of god came and raised you  you only continue to be great because the bible keeps you still in the right path  what it has done for you it will do for us all we ask for is to be let alone  the secretary had become quite excited on this theme and there is no saying how much longer he might have gone on if ebony had not returned scratched bruised bleeding panting and perspiring but jubilant with an enormous butterfly captive in his net and the cause of science advanced  having secured the specimen they set off at once to visit the hot springs after pricking a travellers tree with a spear and obtaining a refreshing draught of cool clear water therefrom  fountains of mineral waters have been found in many parts of madagascar and among them several which are called ranomafana or warm waters  these vary both in temperature and medicinal properties the spot when reached was found to be a small cavity in the rocks which was delightfully shaded by the leaves of the wild fig and by a number of interwoven and overhanging bamboos  the branches of the figtrees spread directly across the stream  hastening to the fountain hockins thrust his hand in but quickly pulled it out again for the water was only a few degrees below the boilingpoint  too hot to bathe in he said  but not too hot here remarked ebony going to a pool a little further from the fountainhead where the water had cooled somewhat there the negro dropped his simple garments and was soon rolling like a black porpoise in his warm bath  it was only large enough for one but close to it was another small pool big enough for several men  there mark and hockins were soon disporting joyously while the secretary looked on and laughed  evidently he did not in the circumstances deem warm water either a necessity or a luxury  that evening after returning to camp mark was summoned to lay the result of his labours before the queen who was much interested in his collection of plants and not a little amused with his collection of insects for she could understand the use of the medicines which her court physician assured her could be extracted from the former but could see no sense whatever in collecting winged and creeping things merely to be stuck on pins and looked at and saddled with incomprehensible names  she did indeed except the gorgeous butterflies and similar creatures because these were pretty but on the whole she felt disposed to regard her physician as rather childish in that particular taste  very different was her opinion of john hockins  so fond was she of the flageolet of that musical and stalwart tar that she sent for him almost every evening and made him pipe away to her until he almost fell asleep at his duty so that at last he began to wish that flageolets had never been invented  its nothin but blow blow blow day arter day he growled as he returned to his tent one night and flung down the little instrument in disgust  i wish it had bin blowd up the time your big roman candle busted doctor  if it had been your influence with the queen would have been gone john  well i dunknow sir  many a queer gale ive come through in time past but this blow beats em all to sticks an whistles  nebber mind ockins remarked ebony who was busy preparing supper at the time wes habbin good times ob it just now  plenty fun an lots ob science  comego at your wittles  weve hard work besides fun before us demorrow  ebony was a true prophet in regard to the hard work but not as to the fun of the morrow for it so happened that two events occurred which threw a dark cloud over the expedition for some at least in the royal procession and induced the queen to return to the capital sooner than she had intended  the first of these events was the discovery of a party of sixteen fugitives who were of suspicious character and unable to give account of themselves  they had been discovered by the queens spies hidden in a ricehouse when brought before the officer who examined them they were at first silent when pressed they spoke a little but nothing of importance could be gathered from them  at last they seemed to make up their minds to acknowledge who they were for one of them stood forth boldly and said  since you ask us again and again we will tell you  we are not robbers or murderers  we are praying people  if this makes us guilty in the kingdom of the queen then whatsoever she does we must submit to suffer  we are ready to die for the name of the lord jesus  is this then asked the officer your final answer whether for life or death  it is our final answer whether for life or for death  when this was reported to the queen all her anger was stirred up again she ordered the captives to be chained and sent off at once to antananarivo  two of the band managed to escape that night but the other fourteen were safely lodged in prison  the countenance of ranavalona was now changed  she took no pleasure in marks collections and sent no more for the musical seaman  to make matters worse there came in on the following day a report that some of her soldiers had captured a large band of fugitives in a distant part of the country and were then marching them in chains to the capital as this band was at the time approaching the queen gave orders to halt on an eminence that overlooked the path along which they had to travel that she might see them  it was about noon when they drew nearworn weary and footsore  the queen was so placed among the bushes that she could see the captives without being herself seen  her chief officers stood near her  mark and his companions had taken up a position much nearer to the forest path  first came a band of weary little ones driven onwards like a flock of sheep and apparently too much terrified by what they had undergone to make much noise although most of them were weeping  next came a group of women  these like the children were not bound but the men who walked in rear were chained togethertwo and two  soldiers guarded them on every side  it is profoundly sad said mark in a deep sorrowful tone  god help them  massa whispered ebony look dar  sure i knows some ob  he stopped and opened wide his eyes for at that moment he recognised rafaravavy and ramatoa among the women  with something like a groan hockins turned a glance on his comrades and pointed to the men  they required no second glance to enlighten them for there they plainly saw ravonino heavily ironed by the neck to laihova and razafil the poet chained to the chief voalavo  many others whom they did not know were also there  these all trudged along with bowed heads and eyes on the ground like men who having gone through terrible mental and physical agony have either become callous or resigned to their fate  as the queen had given orders to her people to keep quiet and out of sight the poor captives knew nothing of the host that gazed at them mark and his friends were so horrified that all power to move or speak failed them for a time  as for ranavalona she sat in rigid silence like a bronze statue with compressed lips and frowning brows until they had passed  then she gave orders to encamp where they stood and retired in silence to her tent    chapter twenty eight  in which terrible but true martyrdoms are described  matters had now reached a crisis  although suffering from illness partly brought on or aggravated by her unrestrained passionsthe queen gave orders next day for the host to turn homeward  travelling more rapidly than she had yet done she soon reached the capital  there the arrival of the captives and the news of what had occurred prepared them for the worst  and the worst was not long of coming  the very day following the queens return a great assembly or kabary of the whole people was called  none were exempted from the meeting  high and low rich and poor sick and healthy were driven to the great place of assembly near the palaceliterally driven for officers were sent as usual to break into the houses of the people when necessary and force them to attend  and there was no way of escape for at the time of the summons being sent out every outlet from the city was guarded by soldiers and the cannon along the heights thundered a salute by way of striking terror into the hearts of the rebellious  well did the poor people know what all this foreshadowed  one who was an eyewitness of the scene said there was a general howling and wailing a rushing and running through the streets as if the town had been attacked by a hostile army  at last the great square of the city was crowded as full as it could hold with hundreds of thousands of people who were overawed by the presence of a body of troops fifteen thousand strong as they awaited the announcement of the queens pleasure  mark breezy was there along with his comrades on an elevated spot near to the place where the queens messenger was to make the proclamation  we are utterly helpless here said mark in a low voice as he gazed in pity on the groaning and swaying multitude  the queens countenance is changed to me  i feel sure that either we have been betrayed in the matter of rafaravavy or we are suspected  indeed if it were not that she is ill and needs my aid she would certainly banish us all from her dominions  i wish i was well out of em growled hockins  the country is well enough no doubt but a woman like that makes it a helluponearth  has you hear massa whar dey hab put ravonino an our oder friends asked ebony  no i did not dare to ask  and even if we knew we could do nothing  the youth spoke bitterly for he had become so much attached to their former guide and the natives with whom they had sojourned and travelled that he would have fought for them to the death if that could have availed them  strong and active young men are apt to become bitter when they find that superabundant energy and physical force are in some circumstances utterly useless  to be compelled to stand by inactive and see injustice donecruelty and death dealt out while the blood boils the nerves quiver and the violated feelings revolt is a sore trial to manhood  and such was the position of our three adventurers at that time  presently the highest civil and military officers came forth one of whom in a loud sonorous voice delivered the message of his terrible mistress  after a number of complimentary and adulatory phrases to the queen herself and many ceremonial bowings towards the palace as if she actually heard him the messenger spoke as follows  i announce to you o people that i am not a sovereign that deceives i find that in spite of my commands many of my people revile the idols and treat divination as a trifle and worship the christians god and pray and baptize and singwhich things i abhor  they are unlawful i detest them and they are not to be done saith ranavalomanjaka  i will not suffer it  those who dare to disobey my commands shall die now i order that all who are guilty shall come in classes according to their offences and accuse themselves of being baptized of being members of the church of having taught slaves to read and that all books shall be given up  as on a previous occasion many came forward at once and accused themselves or gave up their bibles and testaments but as before others concealed their treasures and held their tongue although it was evident that on this occasion the queen uttered no vain threat but was terribly in earnest  the proclamation ended the people dispersed and mark and his friends were returning to their quarters when they were arrested by a party of soldiers  as usual their first impulse was to resist violently but wisdom was given them in time and they went quietly along  of course mark protested vehemently both in english and in broken malagasy but no attention whatever was paid to his words  they were led to a prison which they had not before seen  as they approached the door the sound of singing was heard  another moment and they were thrust into the room whence the sounds issued and the door was locked upon them  at first they could only see dimly the place was so dark but in a few seconds their eyes becoming accustomed to the gloom they could see that a number of other prisonersboth men and womenwere seated round the walls singing a hymn  when the hymn ceased an exclamation from a familiar voice made them turn round and there they saw their friend ravonino seated on the floor with his back against the wall and chained to laihova and to the floor  beside him were several wellremembered natives and on the opposite side of the room also chained were the women of the party among whom were ramatoa raruth rafaravavy her maid sarah and the poor mother of mamba  ravonino exclaimed mark in tones of profound sorrow as he sat down beside his old guide i little thought to find you in such a strait  even so sir returned the man in a gentle voice for so it seems good in his eyes  but still less did i expect to find you in prison for the way they thrust you in shows me that you are no mere visitor  i fear me the cruel woman has found out how kind you were in helping me  but surely dar some hope for you  dey nebber kill you all said the negro waving his hand round as if to indicate the whole party  no hope no hope returned ravonino sadly not even for you ebony because you are only a black man  but they wont kill you sir or hockins  they know better than to risk the consequences of putting a british subject to death  for the rest of usour doom is sealed  if the lord wills it so remarked laihova quietly  how do you know that the lord wills it so demanded a voice fiercely and a man who had hitherto sat still with his face buried in his hands looked up  it was the stout chief voalavo all whose fun of disposition seemed to have been turned to fury  you all speak as if you were already dead men  are we not alive  have we not stout hearts and strong limbs  while life remains there is hope  he leaped up as he spoke and began to wrench at his chain like a maddened tiger until blood spurted from his wrists and the swollen veins stood out like cords from his neck and forehead  but iron proved tougher than flesh  he sank down exhausted with a deep groanyet even in his agony of rage the strong man murmured as he fell lord forgive me  while the men conversed and ebony sought to soothe voalavo with whom he had strong sympathy most of the poor women opposite were seated in a state of quiet resignation  some there were however who could not bring their minds to contemplate with calmness the horrible fate that they knew too well awaited them while others seemed to forget themselves in their desire to comfort their companions  among the timid ones was pretty little raruth  perhaps her vivid imagination enabled her to realise more powerfully the terrors of martyrdom  it may be that her delicatelystrung nerves shrank more sensitively from the prospect but in spite of her utmost efforts to be brave she trembled violently and was pale as death  yet she did not murmur she only laid her head on the sympathetic bosom of her queenlike friend ramatoa who seemed to her a miracle of strength and resignation  in a short time the door of the prison opened and a party of armed men entered with silver spear or hater of lies at their head  an involuntary shudder ran through the group of captives as the man advanced and looked round  which is razafil demanded hater of lies  the poet rose promptly  here i am he said looking boldly at the officer  then glancing upwards and in a voice of extreme tenderness he said now my sweet raniva i will soon join you  ramatoawhich is she said the officer as his men removed the fetters from the poet and fastened his wrists with a cord  ramatoa at once rose up  i am ready she said calmly  now raruth the master calls me  fear not what man can do unto thee  oh no no do not go yet exclaimed raruth in an agony of grief as she clung to her friend  the good lord cannot mean thisoh take me take me and let her stay  the sentence ended in a low wail for at the moment two soldiers forced the girls asunder and raruth sank upon the floor while ramatoa was led away  poor laihova had watched every movement of raruth  it was no doubt the fiercest part of the fiery trial he had to undergo and when the soldier grasped her arms to tear her from her friend he could restrain himself no longer  he sprang up and made a wild leap towards her but the chain arrested him effectually and three bayonets were quickly pointed at his breast  his head fell forward and he sank down like one who had been shot  meanwhile hater of lies selected raruth and twelve others from the group of prisoners but only the three whom we have mentioned are known to the reader  they were led into an outer room where they were further pinioned  some of them had their feet and hands tied together so that by thrusting a pole between the legs and arms of each they could be suspended and carried by two men  others were allowed to walk to the place of execution  the rage of ranavalona however was so great on finding that the christians would not submit to her that she had given orders to the soldiers to torture the martyrs with their spears as they marched along the road  this was done to all except ramatoa and raruth as the bloodstained road bore witness  the comfort of being together was not allowed to the two ladies  they were placed in different parts of the procession  mats were thrust into the mouths of the suspended victims to prevent them from speaking but some of them managed to free their mouths and prayed aloud while others sang hymns or addressed the crowd  thus they passed along the road that led to the place of hurling down  this was a tremendous precipice of granite 150 feet high  thither the multitude streamedsome influenced by hatred of the christians some by deep sympathy with them but the majority doubtless prompted by mere excitement and curiosity  and there they crowded as near as they dared venture to the edge of the precipice and gazed into the awful gulf  slowly the procession moved as if to prolong the agony of the martyrs suddenly a young man pushed through the crowd advanced to the side of ramatoa and grasped one of her hands exclaiming in a loud voice dearest  i will go with you and stay by you to the end  for a moment the calm serenity that had settled on the girls fine countenance was disturbed  mamba she said this is not wise  you cannot save me  it is gods will that i should now glorify the dear name of jesus by laying down my life  but you are not yet condemned and your mother needs your help  full well do i know that returned the youth fervently  were it not for my dear mothers love and claim on me i would now have gone with you to heaven  as it is i will stay by you dear one to the end  thank you dear friend returned the girl earnestly  i think it will not be long till we meet where there are no more sufferings or tears  soon the procession reached the brow of the terrible cliff  here the martyrs were ranged in such a way that while they were cast over one by one the rest could see their companions fall  the first to perish was the poet razafil  after the queens messenger had pronounced the sentence of each the poor man was seized and thrown violently on the ground  a rope was then fastened round his waist and he was asked if he would cease to pray in the name of jesus  cease to pray to jesus he exclaimed while the fire of enthusiasm gleamed in his eyesto jesus who saved my raniva and who holds out his blessed hands to meeven meto take me to himself  never  razafil was instantly slung over the precipice and held suspended there in the hope that the awful nature of his impending fate might cause his courage to fail while the executioner knelt knife in hand ready to cut the rope  once more and for the last time said the officer in command will you cease to pray  the answer was an emphatic no  next moment razafil went shooting down headlong into the abyss  there was a projecting ledge of rock about fifty feet down the precipice  on this the body of the martyr struck and bounding off into space reached the bottom with incredible violence a shattered and mangled heap  with trembling hearts and straining gaze the other victims watched the descent  it seemed to be more than human nature could endure to voluntarily face such a fate when a word would deliver them  so thought many of the spectators and they were right mere human nature could not have endured it but these christians were strengthened in a way that the ungodly will neither believe nor understand  one by one they were led to the edge of the cliff suspended over the edge and had the testingquestion put to them and one by one the answer was a decisive no  but where was the tyrant queen while this scene of butchery was being enacted  in her chamber in the palacecomparatively yet not altogether regardless of the matter  her son rakota stood beside her  our friend the secretary stood at the door  mother said the prince quietly they are being hurled down nowand little raruth is among them  the queen looked up startled  no no she said hesitatingly raruth must notbutbuti must not seem to my people to be weak yet i would save her  rakota gave a gentle nod to the secretary who instantly vanished  he reached the place of execution only just in time  the rope was already round the girls slender waist and the testingquestion had been put but her timidity had flown and was replaced by a calm almost angelic expression as she gazed up to heaven clasped her hands and with a flush of enthusiasm exclaimed  nojesusno i will never cease to worship thee  a murmur of mingled surprise and pity broke from the crowd  at that moment the secretary came forward  the queen he said has sent me to ask you raruth whether you will not worship our gods and save your life  no answered the girl firmly  i have been weaka cowardbut now god has sent me strength by his own holy spirit and my fixed determination is to go this day with my dear brothers and sisters to heaven  you are a fool  you are mad exclaimed an officer standing by as he struck her on the head  yes she is mad said the secretary to the officer in command send a messenger to tell the queen that raruth has lost her reason meanwhile let her be taken away and guarded well till the queens pleasure regarding her is known  but although this poor girl was thus snatched from death at the last moment no mercy was extended to the others  all were thrown over the cliff and dashed to pieces at that time except ramatoa  when the question was put to her last of all she as might have been expected was not less firm in her reply than her companions but instead of being thrown over she was informed that as it was not allowable to shed the blood of one of noble birth she was to be burnt alive  at this dreadful announcement she turned paler than before but did not flinch  at the same moment poor mamba lost control of himself  he sprang to her side put an arm round her waist and shouted  this shall not be  i too am a praying man  ye shall not touch her  he glared fiercely round and for a moment the soldiers did not dare to approach him although he was totally unarmed  but they sprang on him from behind and he was quickly overpowered by numbers  at the command of their officer they tore him from ramatoa carried him to the cliff and hurled him over  his head struck the ledge and his brains were dashed out there  next moment he lay dead among the rocks at the bottom  this awful sight ramatoa was spared for at the same instant they had dragged her away to the spot where a pile of wood had been prepared for herself  four stakes were fixed in the midst of the pile as three other christian nobles were to be burnt along with her one of whom was a lady  while ramatoa watched the preparations for her death her fellowsufferers arrivedsinging as they walked a hymn which begins with when our hearts are troubled and ends with then remember us ramatoa raised her voice and joined them  there was no wavering or shrinking from the fiery ordeal  when all was ready the martyrs quietly suffered themselves to be bound to the stakes and strange to say when the flames roared around them the song of praise still went on and the voices of praise and prayer did not cease until they had culminated in glad shouts of praise and victory before the throne of god  we write facts just now reader not fiction  men talk of the cruelty of devils  assuredly there is not a devil in or out of hell who can sink to lower depths of cruelty than fallen man will sink to when left to the unrestrained influence of that hateful thingsinfrom which jesus christ came to deliver us blessed be his name  it is said that while these four martyrs were being fastened to the stakes an immense triplearched rainbow stretched across the heavens one end of which appeared to rest upon them and that rain fell in torrents  this so terrified many of the spectators that they fled in consternation from the scene  but the cup of iniquity was not yet filled up  while the martyrs were still in the fire and praying o lord receive our spirits and lay not this sin to their charge a shouting yelling band arrived dragging after them the corpses of the men and women who had perished at the place of hurling down  these were tossed upon the pile to serve as fuel to the fire  the poor unrecognisable remains of mamba were among them and thus even in their death he and ramatoa were not divided  at this time of terrible suffering and trialas in the previous persecutions during the reign of this tyrant queenhundreds of christians willingly submitted to the loss of position wealth and liberty for the sake of jesus besides those who witnessed a good confession and sealed their testimony with their blood  thirtyseven native preachers with their wives and families were consigned to a life of slavery  more than a hundred men and women were flogged and sentenced to work in chains during their lives  some were heavily fined and many among the great and noble were stripped of honours and titles reduced to the ranks and forced to labour at the hardest and most menial occupation  among these last was prince ramonja who had been the means of sheltering secreting and saving many christians  fortunately prince rakota retained his influence over his mother and his power to do gooda circumstance for which our three adventurers had ultimately reason to thank god though for a considerable time after that they remained in prison in company with their friends ravonino voalavo laihova and others  these last were not delivered from their chains but lived in hourly expectation of being led out to execution  after raruths removal laihova was at first overwhelmed with despair but when a friendly jailor informed him of her having been spared under the supposition that she was insane hope revived a little though he could not help seeing that the prospect ahead was still very black  another prisoner who was inconsolable was poor renimamba  from the time that she was told of her sons fate she seemed to sink into a state of quiet imbecility from which no efforts of her friends could rouse her  she did not murmur or complain  she simply sat silent and callous to everything around her  she rafaravavy sarah and the other females were removed to another prison and for a long time their male friends could learn nothing as to their fate  it is this prolonged uncertainty thats so hard to bear remarked ravonino to mark one day lifting his hands high above his head and letting them fall with the clanking chains into his lap  true true replied the youth shortlyfor confinement was beginning to tell unfavourably on himself  das were it is remarked ebony endeavouring to brighten up a little but with only moderate success its sottin still an doin nuffin dat kills  what you tink ockins  ay ay assented the seaman and as for a long time nothing more than ay ay had been got out of hockins ebony relapsed into silence  things had reached this lugubrious pass when an event occurred which materially affected the condition of the prisoners and considerably altered the history of madagascar    chapter twenty nine  threatened death avertedburied aliveend of the tyrant queenrevolt crushed and radama the second crowned  one morning shortly after sunrise mark was awakened by the entrance of their jailor  by that time he had grown so accustomed to clanking chains shooting bolts and suchlike sounds that he looked up sleepily and without much interest but a thrill or qualm passed through him when he observed that the jailor was followed by hater of lies with his silver spear  still more were he and his awakened comrades horrified when the names of ravoninohitriniony and voalavo were sternly called out  both men promptly stood up  at last said the former quietly and without a trace of excitement well i am glad for it is the lords will  farewell my friends he added looking back as he was led away we shall all meet again in great joyfarewell  evidently voalavo did not take things so quietly  his lips were firmly compressed his face was deeply flushed and his brows were sternly contracted as they led him out  but for his chains the chief would certainly have given his jailors some trouble  the whole thing passed so quickly that it seemed to those left behind like a dream when they found themselves alone  ebony sat down put his face on his knees and fairly burst into tears  oh  lord he sobbed send em quick for me an lets hab it ober  it seemed as if the poor fellows prayer was about to be answered for again the door opened and the secretary entered  be not afraid he said observing their alarm i come not to summon you to death but to ask you doctor to come and see the queenshe is ill  oh massa pison her  do massa  nobody would call it murder said the negro with fervent entreaty  paying no attention to this advice mark followed the secretary and the bolts were again drawn on his friends  he found ranavalona suffering severely  indeed for some time previous to that her health had been failing and she would gladly have had the advice of her court physician but seemed to be ashamed to send for him after the way she had caused him to be treated  there is this to be said for her that she would probably have liberated him long ago but for the advice of her minister rainiharo who was jealous of the young englishmans growing popularity as well as a hater of his religion  after prescribing for the queen and affording her some relief he gave orders that she should be kept very quiet that no noise was to be permitted in or near the palace  then he left her apartments with the secretary  as they traversed one of the corridors the latter told mark that the order had been given for the execution of ravonino and voalavo  was that order given by the queen demanded mark flushing with indignation while a gush of anxiety almost choked him  no it was given by rainiharo who takes advantage of his position and the queens illness  just then a step was heard at the further end of the passage and hater of lies advanced towards them with his badge of office the silver spear in his hand  like a flash of light an idea entered the young englishmans head  he had no time to think or planonly to act  in the same moment however he offered up a silent prayer for help  as the officer was about to pass mark snatched the spear from his hand and brought the handle of it down on its owners crown with such goodwill that the hater of lies was laid flat upon the floor  thunderstruck the secretary gazed at his young companion  you are ruined now he said  true and you must be ruined along with me  here take the spear and act the part of the hater of lies  for a moment the secretary hesitatedthen as if suddenly making up his mind he said  come i am with you heart and soul  lead to the place of executionquick cried mark  we will take the prison in passing said his companion grasping the spear and hastening onward  the prison was soon reached  the guards were a little surprised at the change of the bearer but no one dared to think of opposing the passage of the wellknown and awful emblem of office  come hockins ebony laihova follow us cried mark springing in  he did not wait to explain  the secretary acting his part well stalked with grand solemnity down the streets towards the western gate of the city  his four friends followed  every one made way  hockins and the negro not knowing what they might be called on to do took the first opportunity that presented each to seize and carry off a gardenstake as a substitute for cudgel or quarterstaff  the guards as before let them pass without question  once outside the town they quickened their pace and finally ran  we may be too late gasped mark  it may be sobut we have not far to go  as he spoke they distinguished sounds as of men engaged in a struggle  on turning a point of rock they came in sight of a party of twelve soldiers  they were struggling fiercely with one man whom they tried to bind  but the man seemed to possess the power of samson  its voalavo cried hockins and rushed to the rescue  das so cried the negro following suit with blazing eyes  snatching the silver spear from the secretary mark sprang forward like a wildcat and sweeping it right and left brought down two of the men  his comrades overturned two others whose muskets they seized while voalavo with the power of a giant hurled two others from him as if they had been boys  he did not stop to speak but to the surprise of his rescuers ran straight into a neighbouring coppice and disappeared  for one moment the remaining soldiers lowered their bayonets as if to charge but the secretary grasping the hater of lies said in a commanding tone  what means this haste  ye shall answer to the queen for what you have done  go  return to your quarters  you are under arrest  carry your comrades with you  cowed by this speech for they all knew the secretary to be a man of position and power in the palace the soldiers humbly picked up their fallen comrades and retired  the victors immediately ran into the coppice in search of voalavo whom they found on his knees digging up the earth with both hands as if for very life  just as they came up he had uncovered the face of ravonino who had been buried alive and was already as pale as if he were dead  have they killed him gasped laihova as he dropped on his knees with the others and began to dig  nothey do not kill when the sentence is to bury alive said the secretary but no doubt he is halfsuffocated  the grave was very shallownot more than a foot deep and a living man might without much difficulty have struggled out of it but the poor man had been bound to a long pole which was buried along with him so that he could not move  they soon got him out and were about to cast him loose when there arose a cry in the city which quickly increased to a mighty roar  they have found out our trick said the secretary  nothing can save us now but flight  cometake him up  this way  in a moment hockins and ebony had the ends of the pole on their shoulders and bore their still unconscious friend after the secretary the noise and shouting in the town increased and it soon became evident that they were pursued being led no doubt by the soldiers who had been so roughly handled  this way cried their guide turning sharp into a bypath which led them into a small garden a frienda christiandwells here  the friend turned out to be an old woman who was rather deaf but she heard enough to understand the situation  here she said tottering into a backyard in which was a quantity of straw and rubbish  go down there  she pointed to a hole  it was the mouth of a ricehole  down went the secretary without a word and turned to receive the end of the pole which hockins passed carefully in  the rest followed  the old woman put on the cover and threw over it some of the rubbish  being pitch dark the nature of the place could not be distinguished by the fugitives but they could hear the shouting of the soldiers who searched the house for them  they could also hear the angry queries that were put to the owner of the place and they could perceive that the old woman had miraculously become dumb as well as stone deaf  soon the quietness overhead led them to hope that the soldiers had left in a short time the cover of the ricehole was removed and the old woman putting her head down informed them that all was safe at least in the meantime  they now unfastened ravonino from the pole and found to their great joy that he was yet alive though considerably shaken  a little ricesoup however and a nights rest put him all right again  in that hole carefully tended by the deaf old woman these six were compelled to secrete themselves for a week during which time the soldiers were scouring the country in all directions in search of them they had to keep so close and to be so careful that they did not even dare to let the old woman go near the neighbours to inquire what was going on in the town though naturally they were very anxious on that point  at the end of that week while the fugitives were taking a breath of fresh air in the yard they were surprised by hearing the tramp of approaching soldiers  to dive into their hidingplace and be covered over by the old woman was the work of a few seconds  anxiously they listened while the renewed search was going on  the sounds sometimes showed that the searchers were retiring from the yard at other times drawing near to it  at last a step was heard on the rubbish heap above them then a blow resounded on their covering as if with the buttend of a musket  this was followed by a shout a clamour of voices and a hasty clearing away of the rubbish  all is lost exclaimed the secretary in his native tongue  not while we have arms growled voalavo  you need not count on me to help you said ravonino quietly in the native tongue why should we slaughter men uselessly  if we had a chance of making a dash i would fight  but we can get out of this hole only one by one and no doubt a hundred men await us  is we agoin to fight massa asked the negro hopefully  of coorse we are said hockins  no my friend we are not said the secretary our only hope now is in god  it seems to me rejoined ravonino that god is our only hope at all timeswhether in danger or in safety but he makes it plain just now that our duty as well as our wisdom lies in quiet submission  ebony received this remark with a groan and hockins with something like a growl  just then the covering of their hidingplace was thrown off and several bayonetpoints appeared  come out one at a time quietly else we will shoot you where you stand exclaimed a stern voice  the secretary translated this  at the same time ravonino clambered out of the ricehole and was instantly seized and bound  its all over nowmay the lord have mercy on us exclaimed hockins dropping his weapon and following his friend  whatever might have been the various feelings of the unfortunate party the example thus set was accepted for each one submitted and when mark looked round on the large band of armed men by whom they were surrounded he perceived the wisdom of ravoninos advice and how hopeless would have been any attempt on the part of himself and his friends to break through and escape  silently and without a word of explanation the officer in command led his captives into the town  they were too much overwhelmed by their calamitous circumstances to pay much attention to anything yet they could not help observing that greater crowds of people than usual were hurrying through the streets and that every one wore more or less an air of excitement  our friends had expected to be cast into their old prison but they were led straight to the palace where they were handed over to the officer on duty  in spite of the depression of his spirits the secretary could not resist his feelings of curiosity and asked what all the stir meant but he received no answer  the prisoners were now conducted into a large room where they found prince rakota standing surrounded by a crowd of peoplemale and female  beside the prince was his cousin ramonja  ravonino and laihova observedwith a gush of feeling which may be understood but not describedthat rafaravavy and raruth were among the ladies  poor renimamba was also there her mild face showing unmistakable traces of the suffering caused by the loss of her only son  welcome my friends said rakota hastening forward to receive the prisoners  you are now safe and free  safe free repeated the secretary in surprise  yes  have they not told you the news he asked while an expression as of pain passed over his face my motherthe queenis dead  but come he added quickly as if he wished to avoid the subject i wish to consult with you for serious dangers threaten us  come  he left the room quickly followed by the secretary while ravonino and laihova were drinking in the news from the respective lips that pleased them best  the facts were soon communicated to all the party  the queen they said who had been declining in health for a considerable time past had latterly become much worse  no doubt her failure to stamp out christianity must have aggravated her complaint for the effect of her extreme severity was rather to advance than hinder the good cause  the persecutionsthe banishmentsthe murdersof twentyfive years instead of checking had spread the gospel far and wide over the land for as in the first days they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word and the amazing constancy and courage and tenderness to their enemies of the noble army of martyrs had given a depth and power to the christian life which might otherwise have been wanting  at all events whatever the cause ranavalona the first sank rapidly and on the 15th of august 1861 after a reign of thirtythree years the tyrant queen of madagascar passed away to the tribunal of the king of kings  her son prince rakota was her successor but his succession was not to be unopposed  he had a rival claimant to the throne in his own cousin rambosalama an able wary and unscrupulous man who on perceiving that the end was approaching had laid his plans secretly and extensively for seizing the reins of government  prince rakota however was so much beloved that all his cousins plans were revealed to him by his friends but the disposition of the prince was too humane to permit of his adopting the usual savage means to foil his foe  all has been told to me he said to the secretary  my cousin has gained many to his sideespecially of those who hate the christians he has even hired men to kill me  i know it because one of the assassins came last night and warned me  at the same time he confessed that he had intended to commit the crime  but have you not taken steps to thwart your cousin  i have  for some time past every allowable measure for our protection has been taken but the religion of jesus as you know forbids me to resort to poison the chain or the spear  my reign shall not begin with bloodshed if i can help it  you know that my good friend the commanderinchief of the troops rainiharos son is on our side finding that my cousin went about armed he recently issued an order that no one should be allowed to carry arms in the palace  as i myself bowed to this order and submitted to be searched of course rambosalama had no excuse for refusing  then as a precaution we have concealed from all except sure friends the orders which from day to day have regulated the movements of the troops  i have met daily in council those on whom i can depend and our course of action is all arranged only one point remains unsettled and it is that which i ask you to undertakefor your will is resolute  whatever my prince requires of me shall be doneif it be not against the laws of my god said the secretary  rakota looked pleased with the reply  i want you he said to stand in the passage here till rambosalama appears  he is sure to pass being now in the deathchamber to which i return speedily  his followers will be in force in the palaceyardi hear the multitudes assembling even now  when he passes this way it will be to give the signal of revolt  you will stop him  if he resists use forceyou are strong  you understand  the secretary looked intelligent and bowed as the prince rose and left him  then he hastily sought for and found his friend ebony with whom he had struck up a sort of happygolucky friendship  meanwhile the multitudes who had heard early in the morning that the queen was dying had crowded every street that led to the palace  some had even pressed into the courts in their anxiety to know the truth laxity seemed to prevail among the guards for many people who carried weapons illconcealed in their lambas and whose looks as well as movements were suspicious were allowed to enter  these were the partisans of rambosalama  indeed it is probable that even among the guards themselves there were adherents of the pretender  but the faithful commanderinchief was on the alert and had laid his plans  he stood in the chamber of death where the mourners were weeping  he watched with keen eye the movements of rambosalama and when that prince left the room for the purpose of giving the signal to his followers he slipped quietly out and gave his countersignal which was the waving of a scarf from a window  instantly a trumpet sounded and more than a thousand trusty soldiers who had been in waiting marched into the palace courts  hearing the trumpet the pretender hastened along the passage that led to the court  at the end of it a door opened and the secretary stepping out confronted him  well met rambosalama he said taking his arm in a friendly but firm way i have somewhat to say to you  not now not now exclaimed the other hastily  i am wanted outside another time  no time like the present interrupted the secretary tightening his grasp come this way  rambosalama taking alarm tried to wrench himself free but the secretary was strong  at the same moment a powerful black hand grasped the nape of his neck  come now sar you go long quiet an comfrable an nobody hurt you dis way  das a sweet little chamber for de naughty boys  with a force that there was no resisting ebony pushed the prince into a small room with a very small window  the door was shut the key turned and the danger was past  immediately afterwards the commanderinchief appeared on the balcony of the palace announced the queens death to the multitude and amid demonstrations of wildest joy alike from soldiers and people proclaimed rakota king of madagascar under the title of radama the second  in the afternoon of the same day the king presented himself to the people arrayed in royal robes with a crown on his head and surrounded by his chief nobles  so overjoyed were the people at the blessed change from the tyranny of a cruel woman to the sway of a gentle prince that it was some time before they could be quieted  when silence was obtained the king in a few and simple words assured his subjects that his great desire was and his aim would be to devote himself to their welfare and that of the country over which he had been called to reign    chapter thirty  the last  the vigour with which prince rakota put down the attempt at usurpation was followed by characteristic deeds of leniency and kindness  instead of taking the usual method of savage and semicivilised rulers to crush rebellion he merely banished rambosalama from the capital and confined him in a residence of his own in the country but no fetters were put on his limbs and his wealth was not forfeited nor was he forbidden to communicate with his friends  moreover before the sun of that day in 1861 had set the new king caused it to be proclaimed far and wide that all his subjects might depend upon receiving equal protection that every man was free to worship god according to the dictates of his own conscience that the prisondoors should be thrown open to those who had been condemned for conscience sake and their fetters knocked off  he also sent officers to announce to those who had been banished to the pestilential districts that the day of deliverance had come  to many of these last of course the good news came too late for this life  disease and hard labour and cruel fetters had done their work but the deliverance that came to these was grander and more glorious than the mere removal of earthly chains and pains  it was a glad day for madagascar and the people of the capital were wild with joy for condemned ones who had long been given up as lost because enslaved or imprisoned for life were suddenly restored to family and friends while others could entertain the hope that those who had been long banished would speedily return to them  many a house in the city resounded that day with hymns of praise and thanksgiving that the tyrant queen was dead and that the gentle prince was crowned  but the change did not bring equal joy to all  some there were whose smitten hearts could not recover from the crushing blows they had sustained when the news of loved ones having perished in exile had been brought to themthough even these felt an impulse of pleasure from christian sympathy with the joy of their more fortunate friends  among these last was poor renimamba  she being very meek and submissive had tried hard to join in the prayer and praise but her voice was choked when she attempted to speak and it quavered sadly when she tried to sing  oh if it had only pleased god to spare thee mambathou crumb of my lifemy dear my only son  she broke out thus one day when the sympathetic raruth sought to comfort her  i was beginning to get over the loss of his fatherit was so many years ago that they took him from me and as my boy grew up the likeness to my andrianivo was so strong that i used to try to think it was himself butnowboth  are with the lord which is far better said raruth tenderly laying her hand on renis arm  you are young to give such comfort returned reni with a sad smile  it is not i who give it but the lord returned raruth  and you forget mother that i am old in experience  when i stood on the edge of the rock of hurling that awful day and saw the dear ones tossed over one by one i think that many years passed over my head  truetrue returned the other i am a selfish old womanforgetting others when i think so much of myself  comelet us go to the meeting you know that the congregation assembles today for the first time after many many yearsso many  yes mother i know it  indeed i came here partly to ask you to go with me  and they say that totosy the great preacher is to speak to us  many others besides these two wended their way to the meetinghouse that day  among them was a group in which the reader is perhaps interested it consisted of mark breezy john hockins ebony ginger samuel ravoninohitriniony laihova and voalavo  well now this is the queerest gotomeetin that ive had to do with since i was a babby remarked hockins as he looked from side to side upon the varied crowd of men and women black brown and yellow rich and poor noble and slave who were joyfully and noisily thronging to the house of god  das truean look dar said ebony pointing to a young woman who was standing as if thunderstruck before a wornout feeble whitehaired man in tattered garments with a heavy iron collar on his neck  recovering from her surprise the young woman uttered the word father with a wild shriek and rushed into the old mans arms  easy to see that he is a banished one returned unexpectedly observed mark as the young woman after the first wild embrace seized the old mans arm and hurried him towards the meetinghouse while tears of joy streamed from her eyes  and this was not the only case they witnessed for constantly during the days that followed the accession of radama the second exiles were hastening homemen and women in rags worn and wasted with want and sufferingreappearing in the city to the astonishment and joy of friends who had supposed them long since dead  yes the longdesired jubilee had come at last and not only was there great rejoicing over those lost and found ones but also over many who through the power of sympathy were brought at that time to the saviour and repentance  referring to that period one of those returned exiles writes thus    on thursday 29th august 1861 we that were in concealment appeared   then all the people were astonished when they saw us that we were   alive and not yet buried or eaten by the dogs  and there were a great   many people desiring to see us for they considered us as dead and   this is what astonished them  on the 9th of september those that   were in fetters came to antananarivo but they could not walk on   account of the weight of the heavy fetters and their weak and feeble   bodies  it was a strange gathering and there were many surprises in the church that day and some strange music too besides that of psalms and hymns and spiritual songs for during the service several exiles who had just arrived hearing what was going on had hastened to the scene of reunion without waiting to have their fetters filed off and entered the house in clanking chains  the preachers duty was one of unusual difficulty for besides these peculiar interruptions and the exclamations of surprised friends the sympathy of his own heart nearly choked his utterance more than once but totosy was equal to the occasion  his heart was on fire his lips were eloquent and the occasion was one of a thousand never to be forgotten  despite difficulties he held his audience spellbound while he discoursed of the wonderful words of god and the shower of blessing which had begun to fall  suddenly during a momentary pause in the discourse the clanking of a very heavy chain was heard and a man was seen to make his way through the crowd  like saul head and shoulders above his fellows gaunt worn and ragged he had been standing near the door not listening apparently to the preacher but intent on scanning the faces of the congregation  discovering at length what he looked for he forced his way to the side of renimamba sank at her feet and with a profound sighalmost a groanlaid his head upon her lap  mamba grown to a giant seemed to have come back to her  but it was not her son  it was andrianivo her longlost husband  for one moment poor reni seemed terrified and bewildered then she suddenly grasped the mans prematurely grey head in both hands and covered the face with passionate kisses uttering every now and then a shriek by way of relieving her feelings  great though the preachers power was in overcoming the difficulties of his position renimambas meek spirit when thus roused was too much for him  he was obliged to stop  at the same moment the gaunt giant arose gathered up reni in his great arms as if she had been a mere baby and without a word stalked out of the meeting to the music of his clanking chains  a malagasy cheer burst from the sympathetic people  praise the lord  let us sing shouted the wise totosy and in a few seconds the congregation was letting off its surplus steam in tremendous and jubilant song to the ineffable joy of ebony who must have burst out in some other way had not this safetyvalve been provided  but there were more surprises in store for that singular meeting  after the sermon the preacher announced that two marriages were about to be solemnised by him in the simplest manner possible  my friends he said one of the bridegrooms is only half a malagasy the other half of him is english  he objects to ceremony and his friend the other man to be married objects to everything that he objects to and agrees to everything that he agrees to which is a very satisfactory state of mind in a friend so they are to be married together  immediately after this speech ravonino led forward rafaravavy and laihova advanced with raruth and these two couples were then and there united in matrimony  radama the second and prince ramonja who had been recalled and reinstated with the secretary and soa and other courtiers graced the wedding with their presence  from this time radama the secondor rakota as we still prefer to call himbegan systematically to undo the mischief which his wicked mother had done  he began to build a college he reopened the schools throughout the country which had been closed in the previous reign and acted on principles of civil and religions liberty and universal free trade while the london missionary societywhich had sent out the first protestant missionaries in 181820were invited to resume their beneficent labours in the islandan invitation which of course they gladly accepted and at once despatched the veteran mr ellis and other missionaries to the reopened field  see note 1  but all this and much more historical matter of great interest we must leave untouched in order that we may wind up the record of our heroes fortunes or misfortunes as the reader pleases to consider them  the events which we have described occurred in such rapid succession that our triomark hockins and ebonyhad scarce found breathingtime to consider what they should do now that they were free to do as they pleased  go home ob course said ebony when the question was mooted  aint my black darlin awaitin ob me dar  i incline to the same course said mark for mywell i wont say who is awaiting me there also  unless shes falled in lub wid some one else tinkin you was dead massa you know suggested ebony  ditto says i answered hockins when appealed to for to the best o my belief my old ooman is awaitin for me too over therehe pointed to england with the stem of his pipeto say nothin o three thumpin boys an a galalso an old granmother an a maiden aunt etcetererall awaitin with great patience i have no manner o doubt  but hows we to git dar  das de question as hamblit said to his moders ghost  the question was answered sooner than they expected for while they were yet speaking a summons came from the king commanding the immediate attendance of the court physician  the object was to offer mark his appointment permanently but mark respectfully yet firmly declined the honour  i feared that said the king for i doubt not that you has friends in your native home which draws you  well you wishes to go  i say go with my goodwill  there is breetish ship loading at tamatave now  if you and yous friends mus go there be your chance and i will send you to tamatave in palanquins  we all very sorry you go for you was useful to us and you was be kindto my mother  of course mark gladly availed himself of the opportunity thankfully accepted the kings offer and went off to inform his comrades and make preparation  it was a sad occasion when they met in the house of their old guide ravonino to spend the last evening with him and rafaravavy and laihova and raruth renimamba and her husband voalavo soa totosy the secretary and other friends but it was also a time of pleasant communing about days that seemed so long past although so recent  they also communed of days to come and especially of that great day of reunion in the better land  and intensely earnest was the final prayer of the native pastor totosy as he commended his friends to the loving care of god  next day they set sail for the seaport town of tamatave  and here we might appropriately terminate our narrative for the bright days that had begun to dawn on madagascar have never since been darkened by persecutionthough they have not been altogether cloudless or free from the curse of war for with its enormous capacities and important position the island has long been a morsel coveted by some of what men style the great powers  but we may not close our tale without at least touching on one dark spot the contemplation of which cannot fail to grieve the heart of every sincere christian  rakota the gentle humane courageous prince who had always favoured and suffered hardship for the cause of christ who had shielded and saved many of the christians at the risk of his own life and seemed to beindeed wasa very pillar in the infant church rakota fell into gross sin and ultimately perished by the assassins hand  we have no right to judge him  only this we know that the blood of jesus christ cleanseth from all sin and if his life and death throw light upon any passage of scripture they seem to bring out in strong relief the words let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall    it was a bright breezy morning when our three heroes stood on the deck of a homewardbound vessel and gazed wistfully over the taffrail at the fastreceding shore  when the island sank like a little cloud into the horizon and disappeared mark and ebony turned their eager eyes in the direction of old england as if they half expected that celebrated isle of the west to appear  possibly the one was thinking of a fair one with golden hair and blue eyes and a rosebud mouth  it is not improbable that the other was engaged in mental contemplation of a dark one with a flat nose and a coalscuttle mout an such eyes  as for hockins he stood with his sealegs wide apart his hands in his breeches pockets and his eyes frowning severely at the deck  evidently his thoughts whether of past present or future were too deep for utterance for like his comrades he maintained unbroken silence  leaving them thus in pensive meditation we regretfully bid themand our readersfarewell    note 1  those who wish for fuller information will find it in such
