86203537	under the deodars  by rudyard kipling     contents       the education of otis yeere      at the pits mouth      a wayside comedy      the hill of illusion      a secondrate woman      only a subaltern      in the matter of a private      the enlightenments of pagett m p     under the deodars     the education of otis yeere   i       in the pleasant orchardcloses         god bless all our gains say we      but may god bless all our losses         better suits with our degree             the lost bower  this is the history of a failure but the woman who failed said that it might be an instructive tale to put into print for the benefit of the younger generation the younger generation does not want instruction being perfectly willing to instruct if any one will listen to it none the less here begins the story where every rightminded story should begin that is to say at simla where all things begin and many come to an evil end  the mistake was due to a very clever woman making a blunder and not retrieving it men are licensed to stumble but a clever womans mistake is outside the regular course of nature and providence since all good people know that a woman is the only infallible thing in this world except government paper of the 79 issue bearing interest at four and a half per cent yet we have to remember that six consecutive days of rehearsing the leading part of the fallen angel at the new gaiety theatre where the plaster is not yet properly dry might have brought about an unhingement of spirits which again might have led to eccentricities  mrs hauksbee came to the foundry to tiffin with mrs mallowe her one bosom friend for she was in no sense a womans woman and it was a womans tiffin the door shut to all the world and they both talked chiffons which is french for mysteries  ive enjoyed an interval of sanity mrs hauksbee announced after tiffin was over and the two were comfortably settled in the little writingroom that opened out of mrs mallowes bedroom  my dear girl what has he done said mrs mallowe sweetly it is noticeable that ladies of a certain age call each other dear girl just as commissioners of twentyeight years standing address their equals in the civil list as my boy  theres no he in the case who am i that an imaginary man should be always credited to me am i an apache  no dear but somebodys scalp is generally drying at your wigwamdoor soaking rather  this was an allusion to the hawley boy who was in the habit of riding all across simla in the rains to call on mrs hauksbee that lady laughed  for my sins the aide at tyrconnel last night told me off to the mussuck hsh dont laugh one of my most devoted admirers when the duff came some one really ought to teach them to make puddings at tyrconnel the mussuck was at liberty to attend to me  sweet soul i know his appetite said mrs mallowe did he oh did he begin his wooing  by a special mercy of providence no he explained his importance as a pillar of the empire i didnt laugh  lucy i dont believe you  ask captain sangar he was on the other side well as i was saying the mussuck dilated  i think i can see him doing it said mrs mallowe pensively scratching her foxterriers ears  i was properly impressed most properly i yawned openly strict supervision and play them off one against the other said the mussuck shovelling down his ice by tureenfuls i assure you that mrs hauksbee is the secret of our government  mrs mallowe laughed long and merrily and what did you say  did you ever know me at loss for an answer yet i said so i have observed in my dealings with you the mussuck swelled with pride he is coming to call on me tomorrow the hawley boy is coming too  strict supervision and play them off one against the other that mrs hauksbee is the secret of our government and i daresay if we could get to the mussucks heart we should find that he considers himself a man of the world  as he is of the other two things i like the mussuck and i wont have you call him names he amuses me  he has reformed you too by what appears explain the interval of sanity and hit tim on the nose with the papercutter please that dog is too fond of sugar do you take milk in yours  no thanks polly im wearied of this life its hollow  turn religious then i always said that rome would be your fate  only exchanging halfadozen attaches in red for one in black and if i fasted the wrinkles would come and never never go has it ever struck you dear that im getting old  thanks for your courtesy ill return it yees we are both not exactly how shall i put it  what we have been i feel it in my bones as mrs crossley says polly ive wasted my life  as how  never mind how i feel it i want to be a power before i die  be a power then youve wits enough for anything and beauty  mrs hauksbee pointed a teaspoon straight at her hostess polly if you heap compliments on me like this i shall cease to believe that youre a woman tell me how i am to be a power  inform the mussuck that he is the most fascinating and slimmest man in asia and hell tell you anything and everything you please  bother the mussuck i mean an intellectual power not a gaspower polly im going to start a salon  mrs mallowe turned lazily on the sofa and rested her head on her hand hear the words of the preacher the son of baruch she said  will you talk sensibly  i will dear for i see that you are going to make a mistake  i never made a mistake in my life at least never one that i couldnt explain away afterwards  going to make a mistake went on mrs mallowe composedly it is impossible to start a salon in simla a bar would be much more to the point  perhaps but why it seems so easy  just what makes it so difficult how many clever women are there in simla  myself and yourself said mrs hauksbee without a moments hesitation  modest woman mrs feardon would thank you for that and how many clever men  oh er hundreds said mrs hauksbee vaguely  what a fatal blunder not one they are all bespoke by the government take my husband for instance jack was a clever man though i say so who shouldnt government has eaten him up all his ideas and powers of conversation he really used to be a good talker even to his wife in the old days are taken from him by this this kitchensink of a government thats the case with every man up here who is at work i dont suppose a russian convict under the knout is able to amuse the rest of his gang and all our menfolk here are gilded convicts  but there are scores  i know what youre going to say scores of idle men up on leave i admit it but they are all of two objectionable sets the civilian whod be delightful if he had the military mans knowledge of the world and style and the military man whod be adorable if he had the civilians culture  detestable word have civilians culchaw i never studied the breed deeply  dont make fun of jacks service yes theyre like the teapoys in the lakka bazar good material but not polished they cant help themselves poor dears a civilian only begins to be tolerable after he has knocked about the world for fifteen years  and a military man  when he has had the same amount of service the young of both species are horrible you would have scores of them in your salon  i would not said mrs hauksbee fiercely  i would tell the bearer to darwaza band them id put their own colonels and commissioners at the door to turn them away id give them to the topsham girl to play with  the topsham girl would be grateful for the gift but to go back to the salon allowing that you had gathered all your men and women together what would you do with them make them talk they would all with one accord begin to flirt your salon would become a glorified pelitis a scandal point by lamplight  theres a certain amount of wisdom in that view  theres all the wisdom in the world in it surely twelve simla seasons ought to have taught you that you cant focus anything in india and a salon to be any good at all must be permanent in two seasons your roomful would be scattered all over asia we are only little bits of dirt on the hillsides here one day and blown down the road the next we have lost the art of talking at least our men have we have no cohesion  george eliot in the flesh interpolated mrs hauksbee wickedly  and collectively my dear scoffer we men and women alike have no influence come into the verandah and look at the mall  the two looked down on the now rapidly filling road for all simla was abroad to steal a stroll between a shower and a fog  how do you propose to fix that river look theres the mussuck head of goodness knows what he is a power in the land though he does eat like a costermonger theres colonel blone and general grucher and sir dugald delane and sir henry haughton and mr jellalatty all heads of departments and all powerful  and all my fervent admirers said mrs hauksbee piously sir henry haughton raves about me but go on  one by one these men are worth something collectively theyre just a mob of angloindians who cares for what angloindians say your salon wont weld the departments together and make you mistress of india dear and these creatures wont talk administrative shop in a crowd your salon because they are so afraid of the men in the lower ranks overhearing it they have forgotten what of literature and art they ever knew and the women  cant talk about anything except the last gymkhana or the sins of their last nurse i was calling on mrs derwills this morning  you admit that they can talk to the subalterns though and the subalterns can talk to them your salon would suit their views admirably if you respected the religious prejudices of the country and provided plenty of kala juggahs  plenty of kala juggahs oh my poor little idea kala juggahs in a salon but who made you so awfully clever  perhaps ive tried myself or perhaps i know a woman who has i have preached and expounded the whole matter and the conclusion thereof  you neednt go on is vanity polly i thank you these vermin mrs hauksbee waved her hand from the verandah to two men in the crowd below who had raised their hats to her these vermin shall not rejoice in a new scandal point or an extra pelitis i will abandon the notion of a salon it did seem so tempting though but what shall i do i must do something  why are not abana and pharpar  jack has made you nearly as bad as himself i want to of course im tired of everything and everybody from a moonlight picnic at seepee to the blandishments of the mussuck  yes that comes too sooner or later have you nerve enough to make your bow yet  mrs hauksbees mouth shut grimly then she laughed i think i see myself doing it big pink placards on the mall mrs hauksbee positively her last appearance on any stage this is to give notice no more dances no more rides no more luncheons no more theatricals with supper to follow no more sparring with ones dearest dearest friend no more fencing with an inconvenient man who hasnt wit enough to clothe what hes pleased to call his sentiments in passable speech no more parading of the mussuck while mrs tarkass calls all round simla spreading horrible stories about me no more of anything that is thoroughly wearying abominable and detestable but all the same makes life worth the having yes i see it all dont interrupt polly im inspired a mauve and white striped cloud round my excellent shoulders a seat in the fifth row of the gaiety and both horses sold delightful vision a comfortable armchair situated in three different draughts at every ballroom and nice large sensible shoes for all the couples to stumble over as they go into the verandah then at supper cant you imagine the scene the greedy mob gone away reluctant subaltern pink all over like a newlypowdered baby they really ought to tan subalterns before they are exported polly sent back by the hostess to do his duty slouches up to me across the room tugging at a glove two sizes too large for him i hate a man who wears gloves like overcoats and trying to look as if hed thought of it from the first may i ahhave the pleasure f takin you nt supper then i get up with a hungry smile just like this  lucy how can you be so absurd  and sweep out on his arm so after supper i shall go away early you know because i shall be afraid of catching cold no one will look for my rickshaw mine so please you i shall stand always with that mauve and white cloud over my head while the wet soaks into my dear old venerable feet and tom swears and shouts for the memsahibs gharri then home to bed at halfpast eleven truly excellent life helped out by the visits of the padri just fresh from burying somebody down below there she pointed through the pines toward the cemetery and continued with vigorous dramatic gesture  listen i see it all down down even to the stays such stays sixeight a pair polly with red flannel or list is it that they put into the tops of those fearful things i can draw you a picture of them  lucy for heavens sake dont go waving your arms about in that idiotic manner recollect every one can see you from the mall  let them see theyll think i am rehearsing for the fallen angel look theres the mussuck how badly he rides there  she blew a kiss to the venerable indian administrator with infinite grace  now she continued hell be chaffed about that at the club in the delicate manner those brutes of men affect and the hawley boy will tell me all about it softening the details for fear of shocking me that boy is too good to live polly ive serious thoughts of recommending him to throw up his commission and go into the church in his present frame of mind he would obey me happy happy child  never again said mrs mallowe with an affectation of indignation shall you tiffin here lucindy your behaviour is scandlus  all your fault retorted mrs hauksbee for suggesting such a thing as my abdication no jamais nevaire i will act dance ride frivol talk scandal dine out and appropriate the legitimate captives of any woman i choose until i drrrop or a better woman than i puts me to shame before all simla and its dust and ashes in my mouth while im doing it  she swept into the drawingroom mrs mallowe followed and put an arm round her waist  im not said mrs hauksbee defiantly rummaging for her handkerchief ive been dining out the last ten nights and rehearsing in the afternoon youd be tired yourself its only because im tired  mrs mallowe did not offer mrs hauksbee any pity or ask her to lie down but gave her another cup of tea and went on with the talk  ive been through that too dear she said  i remember said mrs hauksbee a gleam of fun on her face in 84 wasnt it you went out a great deal less next season  mrs mallowe smiled in a superior and sphinxlike fashion  i became an influence said she  good gracious child you didnt join the theosophists and kiss buddhas big toe did you i tried to get into their set once but they cast me out for a sceptic without a chance of improving my poor little mind too  no i didnt theosophilander jack says  never mind jack what a husband says is known before what did you do  i made a lasting impression  so have i for four months but that didnt console me in the least i hated the man will you stop smiling in that inscrutable way and tell me what you mean  mrs mallowe told  and you mean to say that it is absolutely platonic on both sides  absolutely or i should never have taken it up  and his last promotion was due to you  mrs mallowe nodded  and you warned him against the topsham girl  another nod  and told him of sir dugald delanes private memo about him  a third nod  why  what a question to ask a woman because it amused me at first i am proud of my property now if i live he shall continue to be successful yes i will put him upon the straight road to knighthood and everything else that a man values the rest depends upon himself  polly you are a most extraordinary woman  not in the least im concentrated thats all you diffuse yourself dear and though all simla knows your skill in managing a team  cant you choose a prettier word  team of halfadozen from the mussuck to the hawley boy you gain nothing by it not even amusement  and you  try my recipe take a man not a boy mind but an almost mature unattached man and be his guide philosopher and friend youll find it the most interesting occupation that you ever embarked on it can be done you neednt look like that because ive done it  theres an element of risk about it that makes the notion attractive ill get such a man and say to him now understand that there must be no flirtation do exactly what i tell you profit by my instruction and counsels and all will yet be well is that the idea  more or less said mrs mallowe with an unfathomable smile but be sure he understands   ii       dribbledribble trickletrickle         what a lot of raw dust      my dollies had an accident         and out came all the sawdust         nursery rhyme  so mrs hauksbee in the foundry which overlooks simla mall sat at the feet of mrs mallowe and gathered wisdom the end of the conference was the great idea upon which mrs hauksbee so plumed herself  i warn you said mrs mallowe beginning to repent of her suggestion that the matter is not half so easy as it looks any woman even the topsham girl can catch a man but very very few know how to manage him when caught  my child was the answer ive been a female st simon stylites looking down upon men for these these years past ask the mussuck whether i can manage them  mrs hauksbee departed humming ill go to him and say to him in manner most ironical mrs mallowe laughed to herself then she grew suddenly sober i wonder whether ive done well in advising that amusement lucys a clever woman but a thought too careless  a week later the two met at a monday pop well said mrs mallowe  ive caught him said mrs hauksbee her eyes were dancing with merriment  who is it mad woman im sorry i ever spoke to you about it  look between the pillars in the third row fourth from the end you can see his face now look  otis yeere of all the improbable and impossible people i dont believe you  hsh wait till mrs tarkass begins murdering milton wellings and ill tell you all about it ssss that womans voice always reminds me of an underground train coming into earls court with the brakes on now listen it is really otis yeere  so i see but does it follow that he is your property  he is by right of trove i found him lonely and unbefriended the very next night after our talk at the dugald delanes burrakhana i liked his eyes and i talked to him next day he called next day we went for a ride together and today hes tied to my richshawwheels hand and foot youll see when the concerts over he doesnt know im here yet  thank goodness you havent chosen a boy what are you going to do with him assuming that youve got him  assuming indeed does a woman do i ever make a mistake in that sort of thing first mrs hauksbee ticked off the items ostentatiously on her little gloved fingers first my dear i shall dress him properly at present his raiment is a disgrace and he wears a dressshirt like a crumpled sheet of the pioneer secondly after i have made him presentable i shall form his manners his morals are above reproach  you seem to have discovered a great deal about him considering the shortness of your acquaintance  surely you ought to know that the first proof a man gives of his interest in a woman is by talking to her about his own sweet self if the woman listens without yawning he begins to like her if she flatters the animals vanity he ends by adoring her  in some cases  never mind the exceptions i know which one you are thinking of thirdly and lastly after he is polished and made pretty i shall as you said be his guide philosopher and friend and he shall become a success as great a success as your friend i always wondered how that man got on did the mussuck come to you with the civil list and dropping on one knee no two knees a la gibbon hand it to you and say adorable angel choose your friends appointment  lucy your long experiences of the military department have demoralised you one doesnt do that sort of thing on the civil side  no disrespect meant to jacks service my dear i only asked for information give me three months and see what changes i shall work in my prey  go your own way since you must but im sorry that i was weak enough to suggest the amusement  i am all discretion and may be trusted to an infinite extent quoted mrs hauksbee from the fallen angel and the conversation ceased with mrs tarkasss last longdrawn warwhoop  her bitterest enemies and she had many could hardly accuse mrs hauksbee of wasting her time otis yeere was one of those wandering dumb characters foredoomed through life to be nobodys property ten years in her majestys bengal civil service spent for the most part in undesirable districts had given him little to be proud of and nothing to bring confidence old enough to have lost the first fine careless rapture that showers on the immature stunt imaginary commissionerships and stars and sends him into the collar with coltish earnestness and abandon too young to be yet able to look back upon the progress he had made and thank providence that under the conditions of the day he had come even so far he stood upon the deadcentre of his career and when a man stands still he feels the slightest impulse from without fortune had ruled that otis yeere should be for the first part of his service one of the rank and file who are ground up in the wheels of the administration losing heart and soul and mind and strength in the process until steam replaces manual power in the working of the empire there must always be this percentage must always be the men who are used up expended in the mere mechanical routine for these promotion is far off and the millgrind of every day very instant the secretariats know them only by name they are not the picked men of the districts with divisions and collectorates awaiting them they are simply the rank and file the food for fever sharing with the ryot and the ploughbullock the honour of being the plinth on which the state rests the older ones have lost their aspirations the younger are putting theirs aside with a sigh both learn to endure patiently until the end of the day twelve years in the rank and file men say will sap the hearts of the bravest and dull the wits of the most keen  out of this life otis yeere had fled for a few months drifting in the hope of a little masculine society into simla when his leave was over he would return to his swampy sourgreen undermanned bengal district to the native assistant the native doctor the native magistrate the steaming sweltering station the illkempt city and the undisguised insolence of the municipality that babbled away the lives of men life was cheap however the soil spawned humanity as it bred frogs in the rains and the gap of the sickness of one season was filled to overflowing by the fecundity of the next otis was unfeignedly thankful to lay down his work for a little while and escape from the seething whining weakly hive impotent to help itself but strong in its power to cripple thwart and annoy the sunkeneyed man who by official irony was said to be in charge of it  i knew there were womendowdies in bengal they come up here sometimes but i didnt know that there were mendowds too  then for the first time it occurred to otis yeere that his clothes wore rather the mark of the ages it will be seen that his friendship with mrs hauksbee had made great strides  as that lady truthfully says a man is never so happy as when he is talking about himself from otis yeeres lips mrs hauksbee before long learned everything that she wished to know about the subject of her experiment learned what manner of life he had led in what she vaguely called those awful cholera districts learned too but this knowledge came later what manner of life he had purposed to lead and what dreams he had dreamed in the year of grace 77 before the reality had knocked the heart out of him very pleasant are the shady bridlepaths round prospect hill for the telling of such confidences  not yet said mrs hauksbee to mrs maliowe not yet i must wait until the man is properly dressed at least great heavens is it possible that he doesnt know what an honour it is to be taken up by me  mrs hauksbee did not reckon false modesty as one of her failings  always with mrs hauksbee murmured mrs mallowe with her sweetest smile to otis oh you men you men here are our punjabis growling because youve monopolised the nicest woman in simla theyll tear you to pieces on the mall some day mr yeere  mrs mallowe rattled downhill having satisfied herself by a glance through the fringe of her sunshade of the effect of her words  the shot went home of a surety otis yeere was somebody in this bewildering whirl of simla had monopolised the nicest woman in it and the punjabis were growling the notion justified a mild glow of vanity he had never looked upon his acquaintance with mrs hauksbee as a matter for general interest  the knowledge of envy was a pleasant feeling to the man of no account it was intensified later in the day when a luncher at the club said spitefully well for a debilitated ditcher yeere you are going it hasnt any kind friend told you that shes the most dangerous woman in simla  yeere chuckled and passed out when oh when would his new clothes be ready he descended into the mall to inquire and mrs hauksbee coming over the church ridge in her rickshaw looked down upon him approvingly hes learning to carry himself as if he were a man instead of a piece of furniture and she screwed up her eyes to see the better through the sunlight he is a man when he holds himself like that o blessed conceit what should we be without you  with the new clothes came a new stock of selfconfidence otis yeere discovered that he could enter a room without breaking into a gentle perspiration could cross one even to talk to mrs hauksbee as though rooms were meant to be crossed he was for the first time in nine years proud of himself and contented with his life satisfied with his new clothes and rejoicing in the friendship of mrs hauksbee  conceit is what the poor fellow wants she said in confidence to mrs mallowe i believe they must use civilians to plough the fields with in lower bengal you see i have to begin from the very beginning havent i but youll admit wont you dear that he is immensely improved since i took him in hand only give me a little more time and he wont know himself  indeed yeere was rapidly beginning to forget what he had been one of his own rank and file put the matter brutally when he asked yeere in reference to nothing and who has been making you a member of council lately you carry the side of halfadozen of em  i im awfly sorry i didnt mean it you know said yeere apologetically  therell be no holding you continued the old stager grimly climb down otis climb down and get all that beastly affectation knocked out of you with fever three thousand a month wouldnt support it  yeere repeated the incident to mrs hauksbee he had come to look upon her as his mother confessor  and you apologised she said oh shame i hate a man who apologises never apologise for what your friend called side never its a mans business to be insolent and overbearing until he meets with a stronger now you bad boy listen to me  simply and straightforwardly as the rickshaw loitered round jakko mrs hauksbee preached to otis yeere the great gospel of conceit illustrating it with living pictures encountered during their sunday afternoon stroll  good gracious she ended with the personal argument youll apologise next for being my attache  never said otis yeere thats another thing altogether i shall always be  whats coming thought mrs hauksbee  proud of that said otis  safe for the present she said to herself  but im afraid i have grown conceited like jeshurun you know when he waxed fat then he kicked its the having no worry on ones mind and the hill air i suppose  hill air indeed said mrs hauksbee to herself hed have been hiding in the club till the last day of his leave if i hadnt discovered him and aloud  why shouldnt you be you have every right to  i why  oh hundreds of things im not going to waste this lovely afternoon by explaining but i know you have what was that heap of manuscript you showed me about the grammar of the aboriginal whats their names  gullals a piece of nonsense ive far too much work to do to bother over gullals now you should see my district come down with your husband some day and ill show you round such a lovely place in the rains a sheet of water with the railwayembankment and the snakes sticking out and in the summer green flies and green squash the people would die of fear if you shook a dogwhip at em but they know youre forbidden to do that so they conspire to make your life a burden to you my districts worked by some man at darjiling on the strength of a native pleaders false reports oh its a heavenly place  otis yeere laughed bitterly  theres not the least necessity that you should stay in it why do you  because i must howm i to get out of it  how in a hundred and fifty ways if there werent so many people on the road id like to box your ears ask my dear boy ask look there is young hexarly with six years service and half your talents he asked for what he wanted and he got it see down by the convent theres mcarthurson who has come to his present position by asking sheer downright asking after he had pushed himself out of the rank and file one man is as good as another in your service believe me ive seen simla for more seasons than i care to think about do you suppose men are chosen for appointments because of their special fitness beforehand you have all passed a high test what do you call it in the beginning and except for the few who have gone altogether to the bad you can all work hard asking does the rest call it cheek call it insolence call it anything you like but ask men argue yes i know what men say that a man by the mere audacity of his request must have some good in him a weak man doesnt say give me this and that he whines why havent i been given this and that if you were in the army i should say learn to spin plates or play a tambourine with your toes as it is ask you belong to a service that ought to be able to command the channel fleet or set a leg at twenty minutes notice and yet you hesitate over asking to escape from a squashy green district where you admit you are not master drop the bengal government altogether even darjiling is a little outoftheway hole i was there once and the rents were extortionate assert yourself get the government of india to take you over try to get on the frontier where every man has a grand chance if he can trust himself go somewhere do something you have twice the wits and three times the presence of the men up here and and mrs hauksbee paused for breath then continued and in any way you look at it you ought to you who could go so far  i dont know said yeere rather taken aback by the unexpected eloquence i havent such a good opinion of myself  it was not strictly platonic but it was policy mrs hauksbee laid her hand lightly upon the ungloved paw that rested on the turnedback rickshaw hood and looking the man full in the face said tenderly almost too tenderly i believe in you if you mistrust yourself is that enough my friend  it is enough answered otis very solemnly  he was silent for a long time redreaming the dreams that he had dreamed eight years ago but through them all ran as sheetlightning through golden cloud the light of mrs hauksbees violet eyes  curious and impenetrable are the mazes of simla life the only existence in this desolate land worth the living gradually it went abroad among men and women in the pauses between dance play and gymkhana that otis yeere the man with the newlylit light of selfconfidence in his eyes had done something decent in the wilds whence he came he had brought an erring municipality to reason appropriated the funds on his own responsibility and saved the lives of hundreds he knew more about the gullals than any living man had a vast knowledge of the aboriginal tribes was in spite of his juniority the greatest authority on the aboriginal gullals no one quite knew who or what the gullals were till the mussuck who had been calling on mrs hauksbee and prided himself upon picking peoples brains explained they were a tribe of ferocious hillmen somewhere near sikkim whose friendship even the great indian empire would find it worth her while to secure now we know that otis yeere had showed mrs hauksbee his ms notes of six years standing on these same gullals he had told her too how sick and shaken with the fever their negligence had bred crippled by the loss of his pet clerk and savagely angry at the desolation in his charge he had once damned the collective eyes of his intelligent local board for a set of haramzadas which act of brutal and tyrannous oppression won him a reprimand royal from the bengal government but in the anecdote as amended for northern consumption we find no record of this hence we are forced to conclude that mrs hauksbee edited his reminiscences before sowing them in idle ears ready as she well knew to exaggerate good or evil and otis yeere bore himself as befitted the hero of many tales  you can talk to me when you dont fall into a brown study talk now and talk your brightest and best said mrs hauksbee  otis needed no spur look to a man who has the counsel of a woman of or above the world to back him so long as he keeps his head he can meet both sexes on equal ground an advantage never intended by providence who fashioned man on one day and woman on another in sign that neither should know more than a very little of the others life such a man goes far or the counsel being withdrawn collapses suddenly while his world seeks the reason  generalled by mrs hauksbee who again had all mrs mallowes wisdom at her disposal proud of himself and in the end believing in himself because he was believed in otis yeere stood ready for any fortune that might befall certain that it would be good he would fight for his own hand and intended that this second struggle should lead to better issue than the first helpless surrender of the bewildered stunt  what might have happened it is impossible to say this lamentable thing befell bred directly by a statement of mrs hauksbee that she would spend the next season in darjiling  are you certain of that said otis yeere  quite were writing about a house now  otis yeere stopped dead as mrs hauksbee put it in discussing the relapse with mrs mallowe  he has behaved she said angrily just like captain kerringtons pony only otis is a donkey at the last gymkhana planted his forefeet and refused to go on another step polly my mans going to disappoint me what shall i do  as a rule mrs mallowe does not approve of staring but on this occasion she opened her eyes to the utmost  you have managed cleverly so farshe said speak to him and ask him what he means  i will at tonights dance  no o not at a dance said mrs mallowe cautiously men are never themselves quite at dances better wait till tomorrow morning  nonsense if hes going to vert in this insane way there isnt a day to lose are you going no then sit up for me theres a dear i shant stay longer than supper under any circumstances  mrs mallowe waited through the evening looking long and earnestly into the fire and sometimes smiling to herself  oh oh oh the mans an idiot a raving positive idiot im sorry i ever saw him  mrs hauksbee burst into mrs mallowes house at midnight almost in tears  what in the world has happened said mrs mallowe but her eyes showed that she had guessed an answer  happened everything has happened he was there i went to him and said now what does this nonsense mean dont laugh dear i cant bear it but you know what i mean i said then it was a square and i sat it out with him and wanted an explanation and he said oh i havent patience with such idiots you know what i said about going to darjiling next year it doesnt matter to me where i go id have changed the station and lost the rent to have saved this he said in so many words that he wasnt going to try to work up any more because because he would be shifted into a province away from darjiling and his own district where these creatures are is within a days journey  ah hh said mrs mallowe in a tone of one who has successfully tracked an obscure word through a large dictionary  did you ever hear of anything so mad so absurd and he had the ball at his feet he had only to kick it i would have made him anything anything in the wide world he could have gone to the worlds end i would have helped him i made him didnt i polly didnt i create that man doesnt he owe everything to me and to reward me just when everything was nicely arranged by this lunacy that spoilt everything  very few men understand your devotion thoroughly  oh polly dont laugh at me i give men up from this hour i could have killed him then and there what right had this man this thing i had picked out of his filthy paddyfields to make love to me  he did that did he  he did i dont remember half he said i was so angry oh but such a funny thing happened i cant help laughing at it now though i felt nearly ready to cry with rage he raved and i stormed im afraid we must have made an awful noise in our kala juggah protect my character dear if its all over simla by tomorrow and then he bobbed forward in the middle of this insanity i firmly believe the mans demented and kissed me  morals above reproach purred mrs mallowe  so they were so they are it was the most absurd kiss i dont believe hed ever kissed a woman in his life before i threw my head back and it was a sort of slidy pecking dab just on the end of the chin here mrs hauksbee tapped her masculine little chin with her fan then of course i was furiously angry and told him that he was no gentleman and i was sorry id ever met him and so on he was crushed so easily then i couldnt be very angry then i came away straight to you  was this before or after supper  oh before oceans before isnt it perfectly disgusting  let me think i withhold judgment till tomorrow morning brings counsel  but morning brought only a servant with a dainty bouquet of annandale roses for mrs hauksbee to wear at the dance at viceregal lodge that night  he doesnt seem to be very penitent said mrs mallowe whats the billetdoux in the centre  mrs hauksbee opened the neatlyfolded note another accomplishment that she had taught otis read it and groaned tragically  last wreck of a feeble intellect poetry is it his own do you think oh that i ever built my hopes on such a maudlin idiot  no its a quotation from mrs browning and in view of the facts of the case as jack says uncommonly well chosen listen       sweet thou hast trod on a heart         pass theres a world full of men      and women as fair as thou art         must do such things now and then      thou only hast stepped unaware         malice not one can impute      and why should a heart have been there         in the way of a fair womans foot  i didnt i didnt i didnt said mrs hauksbee angrily her eyes filling with tears there was no malice at all oh its too vexatious  youve misunderstood the compliment said mrs mallowe he clears you completely and ahem i should think by this that he has cleared completely too my experience of men is that when they begin to quote poetry they are going to flit like swans singing before they die you know  polly you take my sorrows in a most unfeeling way  do i is it so terrible if hes hurt your vanity i should say that youve done a certain amount of damage to his heart  oh you can never tell about a man said mrs hauksbee     at the pits mouth        men say it was a stolen tide         the lord that sent it he knows all      but in mine ear will aye abide         the message that the bells let fall      and awesome bells they were to me      that in the dark rang enderby             jean ingelow  once upon a time there was a man and his wife and a tertium quid  all three were unwise but the wife was the unwisest the man should have looked after his wife who should have avoided the tertium quid who again should have married a wife of his own after clean and open flirtations to which nobody can possibly object round jakko or observatory hill when you see a young man with his pony in a white lather and his hat on the back of his head flying downhill at fifteen miles an hour to meet a girl who will be properly surprised to meet him you naturally approve of that young man and wish him staff appointments and take an interest in his welfare and as the proper time comes give them sugartongs or sidesaddles according to your means and generosity  the tertium quid flew downhill on horseback but it was to meet the mans wife and when he flew uphill it was for the same end the man was in the plains earning money for his wife to spend on dresses and fourhundredrupee bracelets and inexpensive luxuries of that kind he worked very hard and sent her a letter or a postcard daily she also wrote to him daily and said that she was longing for him to come up to simla the tertium quid used to lean over her shoulder and laugh as she wrote the notes then the two would ride to the postoffice together  now simla is a strange place and its customs are peculiar nor is any man who has not spent at least ten seasons there qualified to pass judgment on circumstantial evidence which is the most untrustworthy in the courts for these reasons and for others which need not appear i decline to state positively whether there was anything irretrievably wrong in the relations between the mans wife and the tertium quid if there was and hereon you must form your own opinion it was the mans wifes fault she was kittenish in her manners wearing generally an air of soft and fluffy innocence but she was deadlily learned and evilinstructed and now and again when the mask dropped men saw this shuddered and almost drew back men are occasionally particular and the least particular men are always the most exacting  simla is eccentric in its fashion of treating friendships certain attachments which have set and crystallised through halfadozen seasons acquire almost the sanctity of the marriage bond and are revered as such again certain attachments equally old and to all appearance equally venerable never seem to win any recognised official status while a chancesprung acquaintance not two months born steps into the place which by right belongs to the senior there is no law reducible to print which regulates these affairs  some people have a gift which secures them infinite toleration and others have not the mans wife had not if she looked over the garden wall for instance women taxed her with stealing their husbands she complained pathetically that she was not allowed to choose her own friends when she put up her big white muff to her lips and gazed over it and under her eyebrows at you as she said this thing you felt that she had been infamously misjudged and that all the other womens instincts were all wrong which was absurd she was not allowed to own the tertium quid in peace and was so strangely constructed that she would not have enjoyed peace had she been so permitted she preferred some semblance of intrigue to cloak even her most commonplace actions  after two months of riding first round jakko then elysium then summer hill then observatory hill then under jutogh and lastly up and down the cart road as far as the tara devi gap in the dusk she said to the tertium quid frank people say we are too much together and people are so horrid  the tertium quid pulled his moustache and replied that horrid people were unworthy of the consideration of nice people  but they have done more than talk they have written written to my hubby im sure of it said the mans wife and she pulled a letter from her husband out of her saddlepocket and gave it to the tertium quid  it was an honest letter written by an honest man then stewing in the plains on two hundred rupees a month for he allowed his wife eight hundred and fifty and in a silk banian and cotton trousers it said that perhaps she had not thought of the unwisdom of allowing her name to be so generally coupled with the tertium quids that she was too much of a child to understand the dangers of that sort of thing that he her husband was the last man in the world to interfere jealously with her little amusements and interests but that it would be better were she to drop the tertium quid quietly and for her husbands sake the letter was sweetened with many pretty little pet names and it amused the tertium quid considerably he and she laughed over it so that you fifty yards away could see their shoulders shaking while the horses slouched along side by side  their conversation was not worth reporting the upshot of it was that next day no one saw the mans wife and the tertium quid together they had both gone down to the cemetery which as a rule is only visited officially by the inhabitants of simla  a simla funeral with the clergyman riding the mourners riding and the coffin creaking as it swings between the bearers is one of the most depressing things on this earth particularly when the procession passes under the wet dank dip beneath the rockcliffe hotel where the sun is shut out and all the hill streams are wailing and weeping together as they go down the valleys  occasionally folk tend the graves but we in india shift and are transferred so often that at the end of the second year the dead have no friend only acquaintances who are far too busy amusing themselves up the hill to attend to old partners the idea of using a cemetery as a rendezvous is distinctly a feminine one a man would have said simply let people talk well go down the mall a woman is made differently especially if she be such a woman as the mans wife she and the tertium quid enjoyed each others society among the graves of men and women whom they had known and danced with aforetime  they used to take a big horseblanket and sit on the grass a little to the left of the lower end where there is a dip in the ground and where the occupied graves stop short and the readymade ones are not ready each wellregulated indian cemetery keeps halfadozen graves permanently open for contingencies and incidental wear and tear in the hills these are more usually babys size because children who come up weakened and sick from the plains often succumb to the effects of the rains in the hills or get pneumonia from their ayahs taking them through damp pinewoods after the sun has set in cantonments of course the mans size is more in request these arrangements varying with the climate and population  one day when the mans wife and the tertium quid had just arrived in the cemetery they saw some coolies breaking ground they had marked out a fullsize grave and the tertium quid asked them whether any sahib was sick they said that they did not know but it was an order that they should dig a sahibs grave  work away said the tertium quid and lets see how its done  the coolies worked away and the mans wife and the tertium quid watched and talked for a couple of hours while the grave was being deepened then a coolie taking the earth in baskets as it was thrown up jumped over the grave  thats queer said the tertium quid wheres my ulster  whats queer said the mans wife  i have got a chill down my back just as if a goose had walked over my grave  why do you look at the thing then said the mans wife let us go  the tertium quid stood at the head of the grave and stared without answering for a space then he said dropping a pebble down it is nasty and cold horribly cold i dont think i shall come to the cemetery any more i dont think gravedigging is cheerful  the two talked and agreed that the cemetery was depressing they also arranged for a ride next day out from the cemetery through the mashobra tunnel up to fagoo and back because all the world was going to a gardenparty at viceregal lodge and all the people of mashobra would go too  coming up the cemetery road the tertium quids horse tried to bolt uphill being tired with standing so long and managed to strain a back sinew  i shall have to take the mare tomorrow said the tertium quid and she will stand nothing heavier than a snaffle  they made their arrangements to meet in the cemetery after allowing all the mashobra people time to pass into simla that night it rained heavily and next day when the tertium quid came to the trystingplace he saw that the new grave had a foot of water in it the ground being a tough and sour clay  jove that looks beastly said the tertium quid fancy being boarded up and dropped into that well  they then started off to fagoo the mare playing with the snaffle and picking her way as though she were shod with satin and the sun shining divinely the road below mashobra to fagoo is officially styled the himalayanthibet road but in spite of its name it is not much more than six feet wide in most places and the drop into the valley below may be anything between one and two thousand feet  now were going to thibet said the mans wife merrily as the horses drew near to fagoo she was riding on the cliffside  into thibet said the tertium quid ever so far from people who say horrid things and hubbies who write stupid letters with you to the end of the world  a coolie carrying a log of wood came round a corner and the mare went wide to avoid him forefeet in and haunches out as a sensible mare should go  to the worlds end said the mans wife and looked unspeakable things over her near shoulder at the tertium quid  he was smiling but while she looked the smile froze stiff as it were on his face and changed to a nervous grin the sort of grin men wear when they are not quite easy in their saddles the mare seemed to be sinking by the stern and her nostrils cracked while she was trying to realise what was happening the rain of the night before had rotted the dropside of the himalayanthibet road and it was giving way under her what are you doing said the mans wife the tertium quid gave no answer he grinned nervously and set his spurs into the mare who rapped with her forefeet on the road and the struggle began the mans wife screamed oh frank get off  but the tertium quid was glued to the saddle his face blue and white and he looked into the mans wifes eyes then the mans wife clutched at the mares head and caught her by the nose instead of the bridle the brute threw up her head and went down with a scream the tertium quid upon her and the nervous grin still set on his face  the mans wife heard the tinkletinkle of little stones and loose earth falling off the roadway and the sliding roar of the man and horse going down then everything was quiet and she called on frank to leave his mare and walk up but frank did not answer he was underneath the mare nine hundred feet below spoiling a patch of indian corn  as the revellers came back from viceregal lodge in the mists of the evening they met a temporarily insane woman on a temporarily mad horse swinging round the corners with her eyes and her mouth open and her head like the head of a medusa she was stopped by a man at the risk of his life and taken out of the saddle a limp heap and put on the bank to explain herself this wasted twenty minutes and then she was sent home in a ladys rickshaw still with her mouth open and her hands picking at her ridinggloves  she was in bed through the following three days which were rainy so she missed attending the funeral of the tertium quid who was lowered into eighteen inches of water instead of the twelve to which he had first objected     a wayside comedy     because to every purpose there is time and judgment therefore   the misery of man is great upon him   eccles viii 6  fate and the government of india have turned the station of kashima into a prison and because there is no help for the poor souls who are now lying there in torment i write this story praying that the government of india may be moved to scatter the european population to the four winds  kashima is bounded on all sides by the rocktipped circle of the dosehri hills in spring it is ablaze with roses in summer the roses die and the hot winds blow from the hills in autumn the white mists from the jhils cover the place as with water and in winter the frosts nip everything young and tender to earthlevel there is but one view in kashima a stretch of perfectly flat pasture and ploughland running up to the grayblue scrub of the dosehri hills  there are no amusements except snipe and tiger shooting but the tigers have been long since hunted from their lairs in the rockcaves and the snipe only come once a year narkarra one hundred and fortythree miles by road is the nearest station to kashima but kashima never goes to narkarra where there are at least twelve english people it stays within the circle of the dosehri hills  all kashima acquits mrs vansuythen of any intention to do harm but all kashima knows that she and she alone brought about their pain  boulte the engineer mrs boulte and captain kurrell know this they are the english population of kashima if we except major vansuythen who is of no importance whatever and mrs vansuythen who is the most important of all  you must remember though you will not understand that all laws weaken in a small and hidden community where there is no public opinion when a man is absolutely alone in a station he runs a certain risk of falling into evil ways this risk is multiplied by every addition to the population up to twelve the jurynumber after that fear and consequent restraint begin and human action becomes less grotesquely jerky  there was deep peace in kashima till mrs vansuythen arrived she was a charming woman every one said so everywhere and she charmed every one in spite of this or perhaps because of this since fate is so perverse she cared only for one man and he was major vansuythen had she been plain or stupid this matter would have been intelligible to kashima but she was a fair woman with very still gray eyes the colour of a lake just before the light of the sun touches it no man who had seen those eyes could later on explain what fashion of woman she was to look upon the eyes dazzled him her own sex said that she was not badlooking but spoilt by pretending to be so grave and yet her gravity was natural it was not her habit to smile she merely went through life looking at those who passed and the women objected while the men fell down and worshipped  she knows and is deeply sorry for the evil she has done to kashima but major vansuythen cannot understand why mrs boulte does not drop in to afternoon tea at least three times a week when there are only two women in one station they ought to see a great deal of each other says major vansuythen  long and long before ever mrs vansuythen came out of those faraway places where there is society and amusement kurrell had discovered that mrs boulte was the one woman in the world for him and you dare not blame them kashima was as out of the world as heaven or the other place and the dosehri hills kept their secret well boulte had no concern in the matter he was in camp for a fortnight at a time he was a hard heavy man and neither mrs boulte nor kurrell pitied him they had all kashima and each other for their very very own and kashima was the garden of eden in those days when boulte returned from his wanderings he would slap kurrell between the shoulders and call him old fellow and the three would dine together kashima was happy then when the judgment of god seemed almost as distant as narkarra or the railway that ran down to the sea but the government sent major vansuythen to kashima and with him came his wife  the etiquette of kashima is much the same as that of a desert island when a stranger is cast away there all hands go down to the shore to make him welcome kashima assembled at the masonry platform close to the narkarra road and spread tea for the vansuythens that ceremony was reckoned a formal call and made them free of the station its rights and privileges when the vansuythens settled down they gave a tiny housewarming to all kashima and that made kashima free of their house according to the immemorial usage of the station  then the rains came when no one could go into camp and the narkarra road was washed away by the kasun river and in the cuplike pastures of kashima the cattle waded kneedeep the clouds dropped down from the dosehri hills and covered everything  at the end of the rains boultes manner towards his wife changed and became demonstratively affectionate they had been married twelve years and the change startled mrs boulte who hated her husband with the hate of a woman who has met with nothing but kindness from her mate and in the teeth of this kindness has done him a great wrong moreover she had her own trouble to fight with her watch to keep over her own property kurrell for two months the rains had hidden the dosehri hills and many other things besides but when they lifted they showed mrs boulte that her man among men her ted for she called him ted in the old days when boulte was out of earshot was slipping the links of the allegiance  the vansuythen woman has taken him mrs boulte said to herself and when boulte was away wept over her belief in the face of the overvehement blandishments of ted sorrow in kashima is as fortunate as love because there is nothing to weaken it save the flight of time mrs boulte had never breathed her suspicion to kurrell because she was not certain and her nature led her to be very certain before she took steps in any direction that is why she behaved as she did  boulte came into the house one evening and leaned against the doorposts of the drawingroom chewing his moustache mrs boulte was putting some flowers into a vase there is a pretence of civilisation even in kashima  little woman said boulte quietly do you care for me  immensely said she with a laugh can you ask it  but im serious said boulte do you care for me  mrs boulte dropped the flowers and turned round quickly do you want an honest answer  yees ive asked for it  mrs boulte spoke in a low even voice for five minutes very distinctly that there might be no misunderstanding her meaning when samson broke the pillars of gaza he did a little thing and one not to be compared to the deliberate pulling down of a womans homestead about her own ears there was no wise female friend to advise mrs boulte the singularly cautious wife to hold her hand she struck at boultes heart because her own was sick with suspicion of kurrell and worn out with the long strain of watching alone through the rains there was no plan or purpose in her speaking the sentences made themselves and boulte listened leaning against the doorpost with his hands in his pockets when all was over and mrs boulte began to breathe through her nose before breaking out into tears he laughed and stared straight in front of him at the dosehri hills  is that all he said thanks i only wanted to know you know  what are you going to do said the woman between her sobs  do nothing what should i do kill kurrell or send you home or apply for leave to get a divorce its two days treck into narkarra he laughed again and went on ill tell you what you can do you can ask kurrell to dinner tomorrow no on thursday that will allow you time to pack and you can bolt with him i give you my word i wont follow  he took up his helmet and went out of the room and mrs boulte sat till the moonlight streaked the floor thinking and thinking and thinking she had done her best upon the spur of the moment to pull the house down but it would not fall moreover she could not understand her husband and she was afraid then the folly of her useless truthfulness struck her and she was ashamed to write to kurrell saying i have gone mad and told everything my husband says that i am free to elope with you get a dek for thursday and we will fly after dinner there was a coldbloodedness about that procedure which did not appeal to her so she sat still in her own house and thought  at dinnertime boulte came back from his walk white and worn and haggard and the woman was touched at his distress as the evening wore on she muttered some expression of sorrow something approaching to contrition boulte came out of a brown study and said oh that i wasnt thinking about that by the way what does kurrell say to the elopement  i havent seen him said mrs boulte good god is that all  but boulte was not listening and her sentence ended in a gulp  the next day brought no comfort to mrs boulte for kurrell did not appear and the new lift that she in the five minutes madness of the previous evening had hoped to build out of the ruins of the old seemed to be no nearer  boulte ate his breakfast advised her to see her arab pony fed in the verandah and went out the morning wore through and at midday the tension became unendurable mrs boulte could not cry she had finished her crying in the night and now she did not want to be left alone perhaps the vansuythen woman would talk to her and since talking opens the heart perhaps there might be some comfort to be found in her company she was the only other woman in the station  in kashima there are no regular callinghours every one can drop in upon every one else at pleasure mrs boulte put on a big terai hat and walked across to the vansuythens house to borrow last weeks queen the two compounds touched and instead of going up the drive she crossed through the gap in the cactushedge entering the house from the back as she passed through the diningroom she heard behind the purdah that cloaked the drawingroom door her husbands voice saying  but on my honour on my soul and honour i tell you she doesnt care for me she told me so last night i would have told you then if vansuythen hadnt been with you if it is for her sake that youll have nothing to say to me you can make your mind easy its kurrell  what said mrs vansuythen with a hysterical little laugh kurrell oh it cant be you two must have made some horrible mistake perhaps you you lost your temper or misunderstood or something things cant be as wrong as you say  mrs vansuythen had shifted her defence to avoid the mans pleading and was desperately trying to keep him to a sideissue  there must be some mistake she insisted and it can be all put right again  boulte laughed grimly  it cant be captain kurrell he told me that he had never taken the least the least interest in your wife mr boulte oh do listen he said he had not he swore he had not said mrs vansuythen  the purdah rustled and the speech was cut short by the entry of a little thin woman with big rings round her eyes mrs vansuythen stood up with a gasp  what was that you said asked mrs boulte never mind that man what did ted say to you what did he say to you what did he say to you  mrs vansuythen sat down helplessly on the sofa overborne by the trouble of her questioner  he said i cant remember exactly what he said but i understood him to say that is but really mrs boulte isnt it rather a strange question  will you tell me what he said repeated mrs boulte even a tiger will fly before a bear robbed of her whelps and mrs vansuythen was only an ordinarily good woman she began in a sort of desperation well he said that the never cared for you at all and of course there was not the least reason why he should have and and that was all  you said he swore he had not cared for me was that true  yes said mrs vansuythen very softly  mrs boulte wavered for an instant where she stood and then fell forward fainting  what did i tell you said boulte as though the conversation had been unbroken you can see for yourself she cares for him the light began to break into his dull mind and he went on and what was he saying to you  but mrs vansuythen with no heart for explanations or impassioned protestations was kneeling over mrs boulte  oh you brute she cried are all men like this help me to get her into my room and her face is cut against the table oh will you be quiet and help me to carry her i hate you and i hate captain kurrell lift her up carefully and now go go away  boulte carried his wife into mrs vansuythens bedroom and departed before the storm of that ladys wrath and disgust impenitent and burning with jealousy kurrell had been making love to mrs vansuythen would do vansuythen as great a wrong as he had done boulte who caught himself considering whether mrs vansuythen would faint if she discovered that the man she loved had forsworn her  in the middle of these meditations kurrell came cantering along the road and pulled up with a cheery goodmornin been mashing mrs vansuythen as usual eh bad thing for a sober married man that what will mrs boulte say  boulte raised his head and said slowly oh you liar kurrells face changed whats that he asked quickly  nothing much said boulte has my wife told you that you two are free to go off whenever you please she has been good enough to explain the situation to me youve been a true friend to me kurrell old man havent you  kurrell groaned and tried to frame some sort of idiotic sentence about being willing to give satisfaction but his interest in the woman was dead had died out in the rains and mentally he was abusing her for her amazing indiscretion it would have been so easy to have broken off the thing gently and by degrees and now he was saddled with boultes voice recalled him  i dont think i should get any satisfaction from killing you and im pretty sure youd get none from killing me  then in a querulous tone ludicrously disproportioned to his wrongs boulte added  seems rather a pity that you havent the decency to keep to the woman now youve got her youve been a true friend to her too havent you  kurrell stared long and gravely the situation was getting beyond him  what do you mean he said  boulte answered more to himself than the questioner my wife came over to mrs vansuythens just now and it seems youd been telling mrs vansuythen that youd never cared for emma i suppose you lied as usual what had mrs vansuythen to do with you or you with her try to speak the truth for once in a way  kurrell took the double insult without wincing and replied by another question go on what happened  emma fainted said boulte simply but look here what had you been saying to mrs vansuythen  kurrell laughed mrs boulte had with unbridled tongue made havoc of his plans and he could at least retaliate by hurting the man in whose eyes he was humiliated and shown dishonourable  said to her what does a man tell a lie like that for i suppose i said pretty much what youve said unless im a good deal mistaken  i spoke the truth said boulte again more to himself than kurrell emma told me she hated me she has no right in me  no i suppose not youre only her husband yknow and what did mrs vansuythen say after you had laid your disengaged heart at her feet  kurrell felt almost virtuous as he put the question  i dont think that matters boulte replied and it doesnt concern you  but it does i tell you it does began kurrell shamelessly  the sentence was cut by a roar of laughter from boultes lips kurrell was silent for an instant and then he too laughed laughed long and loudly rocking in his saddle it was an unpleasant sound the mirthless mirth of these men on the long white line of the narkarra road there were no strangers in kashima or they might have thought that captivity within the dosehri hills had driven half the european population mad the laughter ended abruptly and kurrell was the first to speak  well what are you going to do  boulte looked up the road and at the hills nothing said he quietly whats the use its too ghastly for anything we must let the old life go on i can only call you a hound and a liar and i cant go on calling you names for ever besides which i dont feel that im much better we cant get out of this place what is there to do  kurrell looked round the ratpit of kashima and made no reply the injured husband took up the wondrous tale  ride on and speak to emma if you want to god knows i dont care what you do  he walked forward and left kurrell gazing blankly after him kurrell did not ride on either to see mrs boulte or mrs vansuythen he sat in his saddle and thought while his pony grazed by the roadside  the whir of approaching wheels roused him mrs vansuythen was driving home mrs boulte white and wan with a cut on her forehead  stop please said mrs boulte i want to speak to ted  mrs vansuythen obeyed but as mrs boulte leaned forward putting her hand upon the splashboard of the dogcart kurrell spoke  ive seen your husband mrs boulte  there was no necessity for any further explanation the mans eyes were fixed not upon mrs boulte but her companion mrs boulte saw the look  speak to him she pleaded turning to the woman at her side oh speak to him tell him what you told me just now tell him you hate him tell him you hate him  she bent forward and wept bitterly while the sais impassive went forward to hold the horse mrs vansuythen turned scarlet and dropped the reins she wished to be no party to such unholy explanations  ive nothing to do with it she began coldly but mrs boultes sobs overcame her and she addressed herself to the man i dont know what i am to say captain kurrell i dont know what i can call you i think youve youve behaved abominably and she has cut her forehead terribly against the table  it doesnt hurt it isnt anything said mrs boulte feebly that doesnt matter tell him what you told me say you dont care for him oh ted wont you believe her  mrs boulte has made me understand that you were that you were fond of her once upon a time went on mrs vansuythen  well said kurrell brutally it seems to me that mrs boulte had better be fond of her own husband first  stop said mrs vansuythen hear me first i dont care i dont want to know anything about you and mrs boulte but i want you to know that i hate you that i think you are a cur and that ill never never speak to you again oh i dont dare to say what i think of you you man  i want to speak to ted moaned mrs boulte but the dogcart rattled on and kurrell was left on the road shamed and boiling with wrath against mrs boulte  he waited till mrs vansuythen was driving back to her own house and she being freed from the embarrassment of mrs boultes presence learned for the second time her opinion of himself and his actions  in the evenings it was the wont of all kashima to meet at the platform on the narkarra road to drink tea and discuss the trivialities of the day major vansuythen and his wife found themselves alone at the gatheringplace for almost the first time in their remembrance and the cheery major in the teeth of his wifes remarkably reasonable suggestion that the rest of the station might be sick insisted upon driving round to the two bungalows and unearthing the population  sitting in the twilight said he with great indignation to the boultes thatll never do hang it all were one family here you must come out and so must kurrell ill make him bring his banjo  so great is the power of honest simplicity and a good digestion over guilty consciences that all kashima did turn out even down to the banjo and the major embraced the company in one expansive grin as he grinned mrs vansuythen raised her eyes for an instant and looked at all kashima her meaning was clear major vansuythen would never know anything he was to be the outsider in that happy family whose cage was the dosehri hills  youre singing villainously out of tune kurrell said the major truthfully pass me that banjo  and he sang in excruciatingwise till the stars came out and all kashima went to dinner  that was the beginning of the new life of kashima the life that mrs boulte made when her tongue was loosened in the twilight  mrs vansuythen has never told the major and since he insists upon keeping up a burdensome geniality she has been compelled to break her vow of not speaking to kurrell this speech which must of necessity preserve the semblance of politeness and interest serves admirably to keep alight the flame of jealousy and dull hatred in boultes bosom as it awakens the same passions in his wifes heart mrs boulte hates mrs vansuythen because she has taken ted from her and in some curious fashion hates her because mrs vansuythen and here the wifes eyes see far more clearly than the husbands detests ted and ted that gallant captain and honourable man knows now that it is possible to hate a woman once loved to the verge of wishing to silence her for ever with blows above all is he shocked that mrs boulte cannot see the error of her ways  boulte and he go out tigershooting together in all friendship boulte has put their relationship on a most satisfactory footing  youre a blackguard he says to kurrell and ive lost any selfrespect i may ever have had but when youre with me i can feel certain that you are not with mrs vansuythen or making emma miserable  kurrell endures anything that boulte may say to him sometimes they are away for three days together and then the major insists upon his wife going over to sit with mrs boulte although mrs vansuythen has repeatedly declared that she prefers her husbands company to any in the world from the way in which she clings to him she would certainly seem to be speaking the truth  but of course as the major says in a little station we must all be friendly     the hill of illusion        what rendered vain their deep desire      a god a god their severance ruled      and bade between their shores to be      the unplumbed salt estranging sea             matthew

theyre rehearsing the singingquadrilles for the fancy ball cant you hear mrs buzgagos voice she has a solo its quite a new idea listen  mrs buzgago in the old library con molt exp  seesaw margery daw

goodnight little lady i shall see you tomorrow  she ye es goodnight guy dont be angry with me  he angry you know i trust you absolutely goodnight and god bless you  three seconds later alone hmm id give something to discover whether theres another man at the back of all this     a secondrate woman        est fuga volvitur rota         on we drift where looms the dim port      one two three four five contribute their quota         something is gained if one caught but the import      show it us hugues of saxegotha             master hugues of saxegotha  dressed dont tell me that woman ever dressed in her life she stood in the middle of the room while her ayah no her husband it must have been a man threw her clothes at her she then did her hair with her fingers and rubbed her bonnet in the flue under the bed i know she did as well as if i had assisted at the orgy who is she said mrs hauksbee  dont said mrs mallowe feebly you make my head ache i am miserable today stay me with fondants comfort me with chocolates for i am did you bring anything from pelitis  questions to begin with you shall have the sweets when you have answered them who and what is the creature there were at least halfadozen men round her and she appeared to be going to sleep in their midst  delville said mrs mallowe shady delville to distinguish her from mrs jim of that ilk she dances as untidily as she dresses i believe and her husband is somewhere in madras go and call if you are so interested  what have i to do with shigramitish women she merely caught my attention for a minute and i wondered at the attraction that a dowd has for a certain type of man i expected to see her walk out of her clothes until i looked at her eyes  hooks and eyes surely drawled mrs mallowe  dont be clever polly you make my head ache and round this hayrick stood a crowd of men a positive crowd  perhaps they also expected  polly dont be rabelaisian  mrs mallowe curled herself up comfortably on the sofa and turned her attention to the sweets she and mrs hauksbee shared the same house at simla and these things befell two seasons after the matter of otis yeere which has been already recorded  mrs hauksbee stepped into the verandah and looked down upon the mall her forehead puckered with thought  hah said mrs hauksbee shortly indeed  what is it said mrs mallowe sleepily  that dowd and the dancing master to whom i object  why to the dancing master he is a middleaged gentleman of reprobate and romantic tendencies and tries to be a friend of mine  then make up your mind to lose him dowds cling by nature and i should imagine that this animal how terrible her bonnet looks from above is specially clingsome  she is welcome to the dancing master so far as i am concerned i never could take an interest in a monotonous liar the frustrated aim of his life is to persuade people that he is a bachelor  ooh i think ive met that sort of man before and isnt he  no he confided that to me a few days ago ugh some men ought to be killed  what happened then  he posed as the horror of horrors a misunderstood man heaven knows the femme incomprise is sad enough and bad enough but the other thing  and so fat too i should have laughed in his face men seldom confide in me how is it they come to you  for the sake of impressing me with their careers in the past protect me from men with confidences  and yet you encourage them  what can i do they talk i listen and they vow that i am sympathetic i know i always profess astonishment even when the plot is of the most old possible  yes men are so unblushingly explicit if they are once allowed to talk whereas womens confidences are full of reservations and fibs except  when they go mad and babble of the unutterabilities after a weeks acquaintance really if you come to consider we know a great deal more of men than of our own sex  and the extraordinary thing is that men will never believe it they say we are trying to hide something  they are generally doing that on their own account alas these chocolates pall upon me and i havent eaten more than a dozen i think i shall go to sleep  then youll get fat dear if you took more exercise and a more intelligent interest in your neighbours you would  be as much loved as mrs hauksbee youre a darling in many ways and i like you you are not a womans woman but why do you trouble yourself about mere human beings  because in the absence of angels who i am sure would be horribly dull men and women are the most fascinating things in the whole wide world lazy one i am interested in the dowd i am interested in the dancing master i am interested in the hawley boy and i am interested in you  why couple me with the hawley boy he is your property  yes and in his own guileless speech im making a good thing out of him when he is slightly more reformed and has passed his higher standard or whatever the authorities think fit to exact from him i shall select a pretty little girl the holt girl i think and here she waved her hands airily whom mrs hauksbee hath joined together let no man put asunder thats all  and when you have yoked may holt with the most notorious detrimental in simla and earned the undying hatred of mamma holt what will you do with me dispenser of the destinies of the universe  mrs hauksbee dropped into a low chair in front of the fire and chin in hand gazed long and steadfastly at mrs mallowe  i do not know she said shaking her head what i shall do with you dear its obviously impossible to marry you to some one else your husband would object and the experiment might not be successful after all i think i shall begin by preventing you from what is it sleeping on alehouse benches and snoring in the sun  dont i dont like your quotations they are so rude go to the library and bring me new books  while you sleep no if you dont come with me i shall spread your newest frock on my rickshawbow and when any one asks me what i am doing i shall say that i am going to phelpss to get it let out i shall take care that mrs macnamara sees me put your things on theres a good girl  mrs mallowe groaned and obeyed and the two went off to the library where they found mrs delville and the man who went by the nickname of the dancing master by that time mrs mallowe was awake and eloquent  that is the creature said mrs hauksbee with the air of one pointing out a slug in the road  no said mrs mallowe the man is the creature ugh goodevening mr bent i thought you were coming to tea this evening  surely it was for tomorrow was it not answered the dancing master i understood i fancied im so sorry how very unfortunate  but mrs mallowe had passed on  for the practised equivocator you said he was murmured mrs hauksbee he strikes me as a failure now wherefore should he have preferred a walk with the dowd to tea with us elective affinities i suppose both grubby polly id never forgive that woman as long as the world rolls  i forgive every woman everything said mrs mallowe he will be a sufficient punishment for her what a common voice she has  mrs delvilles voice was not pretty her carriage was even less lovely and her raiment was strikingly neglected all these things mrs mallowe noticed over the top of a magazine  now what is there in her said mrs hauksbee do you see what i meant about the clothes falling off if i were a man i would perish sooner than be seen with that ragbag and yet she has good eyes but oh  what is it  she doesnt know how to use them on my honour she does not look oh look untidiness i can endure but ignorance never the womans a fool  hsh shell hear you  all the women in simla are fools shell think i mean some one else now shes going out what a thoroughly objectionable couple she and the dancing master make which reminds me do you suppose theyll ever dance together  wait and see i dont envy her the conversation of the dancing master loathly man his wife ought to be up here before long  do you know anything about him  only what he told me it may be all a fiction he married a girl bred in the country i think and being an honourable chivalrous soul told me that he repented his bargain and sent her to her as often as possible a person who has lived in the doon since the memory of man and goes to mussoorie when other people go home the wife is with her at present so he says  babies  one only but he talks of his wife in a revolting way i hated him for it he thought he was being epigrammatic and brilliant  that is a vice peculiar to men i dislike him because he is generally in the wake of some girl disappointing the eligibles he will persecute may holt no more unless i am much mistaken  no i think mrs delville may occupy his attention for a while  do you suppose she knows that he is the head of a family  not from his lips he swore me to eternal secrecy wherefore i tell you dont you know that type of man  not intimately thank goodness as a general rule when a man begins to abuse his wife to me i find that the lord gives me wherewith to answer him according to his folly and we part with a coolness between us i laugh  im different ive no sense of humour  cultivate it then it has been my mainstay for more years than i care to think about a welleducated sense of humour will save a woman when religion training and home influences fail and we may all need salvation sometimes  do you suppose that the delville woman has humour  her dress betrays her how can a thing who wears her supplement under her left arm have any notion of the fitness of things much less their folly if she discards the dancing master after having once seen him dance i may respect her otherwise  but are we not both assuming a great deal too much dear you saw the woman at pelitis half an hour later you saw her walking with the dancing master an hour later you met her here at the library  still with the dancing master remember  still with the dancing master i admit but why on the strength of that should you imagine  i imagine nothing i have no imagination i am only convinced that the dancing master is attracted to the dowd because he is objectionable in every way and she in every other if i know the man as you have described him he holds his wife in slavery at present  she is twenty years younger than he  poor wretch and in the end after he has posed and swaggered and lied he has a mouth under that ragged moustache simply made for lies he will be rewarded according to his merits  i wonder what those really are said mrs mallowe  but mrs hauksbee her face close to the shelf of the new books was humming softly what shall he have who killed the deer she was a lady of unfettered speech  one month later she announced her intention of calling upon mrs delville both mrs hauksbee and mrs mallowe were in morning wrappers and there was a great peace in the land  i should go as i was said mrs mallowe it would be a delicate compliment to her style  mrs hauksbee studied herself in the glass  assuming for a moment that she ever darkened these doors i should put on this robe after all the others to show her what a morningwrapper ought to be it might enliven her as it is i shall go in the dovecoloured sweet emblem of youth and innocence and shall put on my new gloves  if you really are going dirty tan would be too good and you know that dovecolour spots with the rain  i care not i may make her envious at least i shall try though one cannot expect very much from a woman who puts a lace tucker into her habit  just heavens when did she do that  yesterday riding with the dancing master i met them at the back of jakko and the rain had made the lace lie down to complete the effect she was wearing an unclean terai with the elastic under her chin i felt almost too well content to take the trouble to despise her  the hawley boy was riding with you what did he think  does a boy ever notice these things should i like him if he did he stared in the rudest way and just when i thought he had seen the elastic he said theres something very taking about that face i rebuked him on the spot i dont approve of boys being taken by faces  other than your own i shouldnt be in the least surprised if the hawley boy immediately went to call  i forbade him let her be satisfied with the dancing master and his wife when she comes up im rather curious to see mrs bent and the delville woman together  mrs hauksbee departed and at the end of an hour returned slightly flushed  there is no limit to the treachery of youth i ordered the hawley boy as he valued my patronage not to call the first person i stumble over literally stumble over in her poky dark little drawingroom is of course the hawley boy she kept us waiting ten minutes and then emerged as though she had been tipped out of the dirtyclothesbasket you know my way dear when i am at all put out i was superior crrrrushingly superior lifted my eyes to heaven and had heard of nothing dropped my eyes on the carpet and really didnt know played with my cardcase and supposed so the hawley boy giggled like a girl and i had to freeze him with scowls between the sentences  and she  she sat in a heap on the edge of a couch and managed to convey the impression that she was suffering from stomachache at the very least it was all i could do not to ask after her symptoms when i rose she grunted just like a buffalo in the water too lazy to move  are you certain  am i blind polly laziness sheer laziness nothing else or her garments were only constructed for sitting down in i stayed for a quarter of an hour trying to penetrate the gloom to guess what her surroundings were like while she stuck out her tongue  lu cy  well ill withdraw the tongue though im sure if she didnt do it when i was in the room she did the minute i was outside at any rate she lay in a lump and grunted ask the hawley boy dear i believe the grunts were meant for sentences but she spoke so indistinctly that i cant swear to it  you are incorrigible simply  i am not treat me civilly give me peace with honour dont put the only available seat facing the window and a child may eat jam in my lap before church but i resent being grunted at wouldnt you do you suppose that she communicates her views on life and love to the dancing master in a set of modulated grmphs  you attach too much importance to the dancing master  he came as we went and the dowd grew almost cordial at the sight of him he smiled greasily and moved about that darkened dogkennel in a suspiciously familiar way  dont be uncharitable any sin but that ill forgive  listen to the voice of history i am only describing what i saw he entered the heap on the sofa revived slightly and the hawley boy and i came away together he is disillusioned but i felt it my duty to lecture him severely for going there and thats all  now for pitys sake leave the wretched creature and the dancing master alone they never did you any harm  no harm to dress as an example and a stumblingblock for half simla and then to find this person who is dressed by the hand of god not that i wish to disparage him for a moment but you know the tikka dhurzie way he attires those lilies of the field this person draws the eyes of men and some of them nice men its almost enough to make one discard clothing i told the hawley boy so  and what did that sweet youth do  turned shellpink and looked across the far blue hills like a distressed cherub am i talking wildly polly let me say my say and i shall be calm otherwise i may go abroad and disturb simla with a few original reflections excepting always your own sweet self there isnt a single woman in the land who understands me when i am whats the word  tetefele suggested mrs mallowe  exactly and now let us have tiffin the demands of society are exhausting and as mrs delville says here mrs hauksbee to the horror of the khitmatgars lapsed into a series of grunts while mrs mallowe stared in lazy surprise  god gie us a guid conceit of oorselves said mrs hauksbee piously returning to her natural speech now in any other woman that would have been vulgar i am consumed with curiosity to see mrs bent i expect complications  woman of one idea said mrs mallowe shortly all complications are as old as the hills i have lived through or near all all all  and yet do not understand that men and women never behave twice alike i am old who was young if ever i put my head in your lap you dear big sceptic you will learn that my parting is gauze but never no never have i lost my interest in men and women polly i shall see this business out to the bitter end  i am going to sleep said mrs mallowe calmly i never interfere with men or women unless i am compelled and she retired with dignity to her own room  mrs hauksbees curiosity was not long left ungratified for mrs bent came up to simla a few days after the conversation faithfully reported above and pervaded the mall by her husbands side  behold said mrs hauksbee thoughtfully rubbing her nose that is the last link of the chain if we omit the husband of the delville whoever he may be let me consider the bents and the delvilles inhabit the same hotel and the delville is detested by the waddy do you know the waddy who is almost as big a dowd the waddy also abominates the male bent for which if her other sins do not weigh too heavily she will eventually go to heaven  dont be irreverent said mrs mallowe i like mrs bents face  i am discussing the waddy returned mrs hauksbee loftily the waddy will take the female bent apart after having borrowed yes everything that she can from hairpins to babies bottles such my dear is life in a hotel the waddy will tell the female bent facts and fictions about the dancing master and the dowd  lucy i should like you better if you were not always looking into peoples backbedrooms  anybody can look into their front drawingrooms and remember whatever i do and whatever i look i never talk as the waddy will let us hope that the dancing masters greasy smile and manner of the pedagogue will soften the heart of that cow his wife if mouths speak truth i should think that little mrs bent could get very angry on occasion  but what reason has she for being angry  what reason the dancing master in himself is a reason how does it go if in his life some trivial errors fall look in his face and youll believe them all i am prepared to credit any evil of the dancing master because i hate him so and the dowd is so disgustingly badly dressed  that she too is capable of every iniquity i always prefer to believe the best of everybody it saves so much trouble  very good i prefer to believe the worst it saves useless expenditure of sympathy and you may be quite certain that the waddy believes with me  mrs mallowe sighed and made no answer  the conversation was holden after dinner while mrs hauksbee was dressing for a dance  i am too tired to go pleaded mrs mallowe and mrs hauksbee left her in peace till two in the morning when she was aware of emphatic knocking at her door  dont be very angry dear said mrs hauksbee my idiot of an ayah has gone home and as i hope to sleep tonight there isnt a soul in the place to unlace me  oh this is too bad said mrs mallowe sulkily  cant help it im a lone lorn grasswidow dear but i will not sleep in my stays and such news too oh do unlace me theres a darling the dowd the dancing master i and the hawley boy you know the north verandah  how can i do anything if you spin round like this protested mrs mallowe fumbling with the knot of the laces  oh i forget i must tell my tale without the aid of your eyes do you know youve lovely eyes dear well to begin with i took the hawley boy to a kala juggah  did he want much taking  lots there was an arrangement of looseboxes in kanats and she was in the next one talking to him  which how explain  you know what i mean the dowd and the dancing master we could hear every word and we listened shamelessly specially the hawley boy polly i quite love that woman  this is interesting there now turn round what happened  one moment ah h blessed relief ive been looking forward to taking them off for the last halfhour which is ominous at my time of life but as i was saying we listened and heard the dowd drawl worse than ever she drops her final gs like a barmaid or a blueblooded aidedecamp look heere youre gettin too fond o me she said and the dancing master owned it was so in language that nearly made me ill the dowd reflected for a while then we heard her say look heere mister bent why are you such an awful liar i nearly exploded while the dancing master denied the charge it seems that he never told her he was a married man  i said he wouldnt  and she had taken this to heart on personal grounds i suppose she drawled along for five minutes reproaching him with his perfidy and grew quite motherly now youve got a nice little wife of your own you have she said shes ten times too good for a fat old man like you and look heere you never told me a word about her and ive been thinkin about it a good deal and i think youre a liar wasnt that delicious the dancing master maundered and raved till the hawley boy suggested that he should burst in and beat him his voice runs up into an impassioned squeak when he is afraid the dowd must be an extraordinary woman she explained that had he been a bachelor she might not have objected to his devotion but since he was a married man and the father of a very nice baby she considered him a hypocrite and this she repeated twice she wound up her drawl with an im tellin you this because your wife is angry with me an i hate quarrellin with any other woman an i like your wife you know how you have behaved for the last six weeks you shouldnt have done it indeed you shouldnt youre too old an too fat cant you imagine how the dancing master would wince at that now go away she said i dont want to tell you what i think of you because i think you are not nice ill stay heere till the next dance begins did you think that the creature had so much in her  i never studied her as closely as you did it sounds unnatural what happened  the dancing master attempted blandishment reproof jocularity and the style of the lord high warden and i had almost to pinch the hawley boy to make him keep quiet she grunted at the end of each sentence and in the end he went away swearing to himself quite like a man in a novel he looked more objectionable than ever i laughed i love that woman in spite of her clothes and now im going to bed what do you think of it  i shant begin to think till the morning said mrs mallowe yawning perhaps she spoke the truth they do fly into it by accident sometimes  mrs hauksbees account of her eavesdropping was an ornate one but truthful in the main for reasons best known to herself mrs shady delville had turned upon mr bent and rent him limb from limb casting him away limp and disconcerted ere she withdrew the light of her eyes from him permanently being a man of resource and anything but pleased in that he had been called both old and fat he gave mrs bent to understand that he had during her absence in the doon been the victim of unceasing persecution at the hands of mrs delville and he told the tale so often and with such eloquence that he ended in believing it while his wife marvelled at the manners and customs of some women when the situation showed signs of languishing mrs waddy was always on hand to wake the smouldering fires of suspicion in mrs bents bosom and to contribute generally to the peace and comfort of the hotel mr bents life was not a happy one for if mrs waddys story were true he was argued his wife untrustworthy to the last degree if his own statement was true his charms of manner and conversation were so great that he needed constant surveillance and he received it till he repented genuinely of his marriage and neglected his personal appearance mrs delville alone in the hotel was unchanged she removed her chair some six paces towards the head of the table and occasionally in the twilight ventured on timid overtures of friendship to mrs bent which were repulsed  she does it for my sake hinted the virtuous bent  a dangerous and designing woman purred mrs waddy  worst of all every other hotel in simla was full  polly are you afraid of diphtheria  of nothing in the world except smallpox diphtheria kills but it doesnt disfigure why do you ask  because the bent baby has got it and the whole hotel is upside down in consequence the waddy has set her five young on the rail and fled the dancing master fears for his precious throat and that miserable little woman his wife has no notion of what ought to be done she wanted to put it into a mustard bath for croup  where did you learn all this  just now on the mall dr howlen told me the manager of the hotel is abusing the bents and the bents are abusing the manager they are a feckless couple  well whats on your mind  this and i know its a grave thing to ask  would you seriously object to my bringing the child over here with its mother  on the most strict understanding that we see nothing of the dancing master  he will be only too glad to stay away polly youre an angel the woman really is at her wits end  and you know nothing about her careless and would hold her up to public scorn if it gave you a minutes amusement therefore you risk your life for the sake of her brat no loo im not the angel i shall keep to my rooms and avoid her but do as you please only tell me why you do it  mrs hauksbees eyes softened she looked out of the window and back into mrs mallowes face  i dont know said mrs hauksbee simply  you dear  polly and for aught you knew you might have taken my fringe off never do that again without warning now well get the rooms ready i dont suppose i shall be allowed to circulate in society for a month  and i also thank goodness i shall at last get all the sleep i want  much to mrs bents surprise she and the baby were brought over to the house almost before she knew where she was bent was devoutly and undisguisedly thankful for he was afraid of the infection and also hoped that a few weeks in the hotel alone with mrs delville might lead to explanations mrs bent had thrown her jealousy to the winds in her fear for her childs life  we can give you good milk said mrs hauksbee to her and our house is much nearer to the doctors than the hotel and you wont feel as though you were living in a hostile camp where is the dear mrs waddy she seemed to be a particular friend of yours  theyve all left me said mrs bent bitterly mrs waddy went first she said i ought to be ashamed of myself for introducing diseases there and i am sure it wasnt my fault that little dora  how nice cooed mrs hauksbee the waddy is an infectious disease herself more quickly caught than the plague and the taker runs presently mad i lived next door to her at the elysium three years ago now see you wont give us the least trouble and ive ornamented all the house with sheets soaked in carbolic it smells comforting doesnt it remember im always in call and my ayahs at your service when yours goes to her meals and and if you cry ill never forgive you  dora bent occupied her mothers unprofitable attention through the day and the night the doctor called thrice in the twentyfour hours and the house reeked with the smell of the condys fluid chlorinewater and carbolic acid washes mrs mallowe kept to her own rooms she considered that she had made sufficient concessions in the cause of humanity and mrs hauksbee was more esteemed by the doctor as a help in the sickroom than the halfdistraught mother  i know nothing of illness said mrs hauksbee to the doctor only tell me what to do and ill do it  keep that crazy woman from kissing the child and let her have as little to do with the nursing as you possibly can said the doctor id turn her out of the sickroom but that i honestly believe shed die of anxiety she is less than no good and i depend on you and the ayahs remember  mrs hauksbee accepted the responsibility though it painted olive hollows under her eyes and forced her to her oldest dresses mrs bent clung to her with more than childlike faith  i know youll make dora well wont you she said at least twenty times a day and twenty times a day mrs hauksbee answered valiantly of course i will  but dora did not improve and the doctor seemed to be always in the house  theres some danger of the thing taking a bad turn he said ill come over between three and four in the morning tomorrow  good gracious said mrs hauksbee he never told me what the turn would be my education has been horribly neglected and i have only this foolish motherwoman to fall back upon  the night wore through slowly and mrs hauksbee dozed in a chair by the fire there was a dance at the viceregal lodge and she dreamed of it till she was aware of mrs bents anxious eyes staring into her own  wake up wake up do something cried mrs bent piteously doras choking to death do you mean to let her die  mrs hauksbee jumped to her feet and bent over the bed the child was fighting for breath while the mother wrung her hands despairingly  oh what can i do what can you do she wont stay still i cant hold her why didnt the doctor say this was coming screamed mrs bent wont you help me shes dying  i ive never seen a child die before stammered mrs hauksbee feebly and then let none blame her weakness after the strain of long watching she broke down and covered her face with her hands the ayahs on the threshold snored peacefully  there was a rattle of rickshaw wheels below the clash of an opening door a heavy step on the stairs and mrs delville entered to find mrs bent screaming for the doctor as she ran round the room mrs hauksbee her hands to her ears and her face buried in the chintz of a chair was quivering with pain at each cry from the bed and murmuring thank god i never bore a child oh thank god i never bore a child  mrs delville looked at the bed for an instant took mrs bent by the shoulders and said quietly get me some caustic be quick  the mother obeyed mechanically mrs delville had thrown herself down by the side of the child and was opening its mouth  oh youre killing her cried mrs bent wheres the doctor leave her alone  mrs delville made no reply for a minute but busied herself with the child  now the caustic and hold a lamp behind my shoulder will you do as you are told the acidbottle if you dont know what i mean she said  a second time mrs delville bent over the child mrs hauksbee her face still hidden sobbed and shivered one of the ayahs staggered sleepily into the room yawning doctor sahib come  mrs delville turned her head  youre only just in time she said it was chokin her when i came an ive burnt it  there was no sign of the membrane getting to the airpassages after the last steaming it was the general weakness i feared said the doctor half to himself and he whispered as he looked youve done what i should have been afraid to do without consultation  she was dyin said mrs delville under her breath can you do anythin what a mercy it was i went to the dance  mrs hauksbee raised her head  is it all over she gasped im useless im worse than useless what are you doing here  she stared at mrs delville and mrs bent realising for the first time who was the goddess from the machine stared also  then mrs delville made explanation putting on a dirty long glove and smoothing a crumpled and illfitting balldress  i was at the dance an the doctor was tellin me about your baby bein so ill so i came away early an your door was open an i i lost my boy this way six months ago an ive been tryin to forget it ever since an i i i am very sorry for intrudin an anythin that has happened  mrs bent was putting out the doctors eye with a lamp as he stooped over dora  take it away said the doctor i think the child will do thanks to you mrs delville i should have come too late but i assure you he was addressing himself to mrs delville i had not the faintest reason to expect this the membrane must have grown like a mushroom will one of you help me please  he had reason for the last sentence mrs hauksbee had thrown herself into mrs delvilles arms where she was weeping bitterly and mrs bent was unpicturesquely mixed up with both while from the tangle came the sound of many sobs and much promiscuous kissing  good gracious ive spoilt all your beautiful roses said mrs hauksbee lifting her head from the lump of crushed gum and calico atrocities on mrs delvilles shoulder and hurrying to the doctor  mrs delville picked up her shawl and slouched out of the room mopping her eyes with the glove that she had not put on  i always said she was more than a woman sobbed mrs hauksbee hysterically and that proves it  six weeks later mrs bent and dora had returned to the hotel mrs hauksbee had come out of the valley of humiliation had ceased to reproach herself for her collapse in an hour of need and was even beginning to direct the affairs of the world as before  so nobody died and everything went off as it should and i kissed the dowd polly i feel so old does it show in my face  kisses dont as a rule do they of course you know what the result of the dowds providential arrival has been  they ought to build her a statue only no sculptor dare copy those skirts  ah said mrs mallowe quietly she has found another reward the dancing master has been smirking through simla giving every one to understand that she came because of her undying love for him for him to save his child and all simla naturally believes this  but mrs bent  mrs bent believes it more than any one else she wont speak to the dowd now isnt the dancing master an angel  mrs hauksbee lifted up her voice and raged till bedtime the doors of the two rooms stood open  polly said a voice from the darkness what did that americanheiressglobetrotter girl say last season when she was tipped out of her rickshaw turning a corner some absurd adjective that made the man who picked her up explode  paltry said mrs mallowe through her nose like this haow pahltry  exactly said the voice haow pahltry it all is  which  everything babies diphtheria mrs bent and the dancing master i whooping in a chair and the dowd dropping in from the clouds i wonder what the motive was all the motives  um  what do you think  dont ask me go to sleep     only a subaltern      not only to enforce by command but to encourage by   example the energetic discharge of duty and the steady endurance   of the difficulties and privations inseparable from military service   bengal army regulations  they made bobby wick pass an examination at sandhurst he was a gentleman before he was gazetted so when the empress announced that gentlemancadet robert hanna wick was posted as second lieutenant to the tyneside tail twisters at krab bokhar he became an officer and a gentleman which is an enviable thing and there was joy in the house of wick where mamma wick and all the little wicks fell upon their knees and offered incense to bobby by virtue of his achievements  papa wick had been a commissioner in his day holding authority over three millions of men in the chotabuldana division building great works for the good of the land and doing his best to make two blades of grass grow where there was but one before of course nobody knew anything about this in the little english village where he was just old mr wick and had forgotten that he was a companion of the order of the star of india  he patted bobby on the shoulder and said well done my boy  there followed while the uniform was being prepared an interval of pure delight during which bobby took brevetrank as a man at the womenswamped tennisparties and teafights of the village and i daresay had his joiningtime been extended would have fallen in love with several girls at once little country villages at home are very full of nice girls because all the young men come out to india to make their fortunes  india said papa wick is the place ive had thirty years of it and begad id like to go back again when you join the tail twisters youll be among friends if every one hasnt forgotten wick of chotabuldana and a lot of people will be kind to you for our sakes the mother will tell you more about outfit than i can but remember this stick to your regiment bobby stick to your regiment youll see men all round you going into the staff corps and doing every possible sort of duty but regimental and you may be tempted to follow suit now so long as you keep within your allowance and i havent stinted you there stick to the line the whole line and nothing but the line be careful how you back another young fools bill and if you fall in love with a woman twenty years older than yourself dont tell me about it thats all  with these counsels and many others equally valuable did papa wick fortify bobby ere that last awful night at portsmouth when the officers quarters held more inmates than were provided for by the regulations and the libertymen of the ships fell foul of the drafts for india and the battle raged from the dockyard gates even to the slums of longport while the drabs of fratton came down and scratched the faces of the queens officers  bobby wick with an ugly bruise on his freckled nose a sick and shaky detachment to manuvre in ship and the comfort of fifty scornful females to attend to had no time to feel homesick till the malabar reached midchannel when he doubled his emotions with a little guardvisiting and a great many other matters  the tail twisters were a most particular regiment those who knew them least said that they were eaten up with side but their reserve and their internal arrangements generally were merely protective diplomacy some five years before the colonel commanding had looked into the fourteen fearless eyes of seven plump and juicy subalterns who had all applied to enter the staff corps and had asked them why the three stars should he a colonel of the line command a dashed nursery for doubledashed bottlesuckers who put on condemned tin spurs and rode qualified mokes at the hiatused heads of forsaken black regiments he was a rude man and a terrible wherefore the remnant took measures with the halfbutt as an engine of public opinion till the rumour went abroad that young men who used the tail twisters as a crutch to the staff corps had many and varied trials to endure however a regiment had just as much right to its own secrets as a woman  when bobby came up from deolali and took his place among the tail twisters it was gently but firmly borne in upon him that the regiment was his father and his mother and his indissolubly wedded wife and that there was no crime under the canopy of heaven blacker than that of bringing shame on the regiment which was the bestshooting bestdrilled bestsetup bravest most illustrious and in all respects most desirable regiment within the compass of the seven seas he was taught the legends of the mess plate from the great grinning golden gods that had come out of the summer palace in pekin to the silvermounted markhorhorn snuffmull presented by the last co he who spake to the seven subalterns and every one of those legends told him of battles fought at long odds without fear as without support of hospitality catholic as an arabs of friendships deep as the sea and steady as the fightingline of honour won by hard roads for honours sake and of instant and unquestioning devotion to the regiment the regiment that claims the lives of all and lives for ever  more than once too he came officially into contact with the regimental colours which looked like the lining of a bricklayers hat on the end of a chewed stick bobby did not kneel and worship them because british subalterns are not constructed in that manner indeed he condemned them for their weight at the very moment that they were filling with awe and other more noble sentiments  but best of all was the occasion when he moved with the tail twisters in review order at the breaking of a november day allowing for dutymen and sick the regiment was one thousand and eighty strong and bobby belonged to them for was he not a subaltern of the line the whole line and nothing but the line as the tramp of two thousand one hundred and sixty sturdy ammunition boots attested he would not have changed places with deighton of the horse battery whirling by in a pillar of cloud to a chorus of strong right strong left or hoganyale of the white hussars leading his squadron for all it was worth with the price of horseshoes thrown in or tick boileau trying to live up to his fierce blue and gold turban while the wasps of the bengal cavalry stretched to a gallop in the wake of the long lollopping walers of the white hussars  they fought through the clear cool day and bobby felt a little thrill run down his spine when he heard the tinkletinkletinkle of the empty cartridgecases hopping from the breechblocks after the roar of the volleys for he knew that he should live to hear that sound in action the review ended in a glorious chase across the plain batteries thundering after cavalry to the huge disgust of the white hussars and the tyneside tail twisters hunting a sikh regiment till the lean lathy singhs panted with exhaustion bobby was dusty and dripping long before noon but his enthusiasm was merely focused not diminished  he returned to sit at the feet of revere his skipper that is to say the captain of his company and to be instructed in the dark art and mystery of managing men which is a very large part of the profession of arms  if you havent a taste that way said revere between his puffs of his cheroot youll never be able to get the hang of it but remember bobby t isnt the best drill though drill is nearly everything that hauls a regiment through hell and out on the other side its the man who knows how to handle men goatmen swinemen dogmen and so on  dormer for instance said bobby i think he comes under the head of foolmen he mopes like a sick owl  thats where you make your mistake my son dormer isnt a fool yet but hes a dashed dirty soldier and his room corporal makes fun of his socks before kitinspection dormer being twothirds pure brute goes into a corner and growls  how do you know said bobby admiringly  because a company commander has to know these things because if he does not know he may have crime ay murder brewing under his very nose and yet not see that its there dormer is being badgered out of his mind big as he is and he hasnt intellect enough to resent it hes taken to quiet boozing and bobby when the butt of a room goes on the drink or takes to moping by himself measures are necessary to pull him out of himself  what measures man cant run round coddling his men for ever  no the men would precious soon show him that he was not wanted youve got to  here the coloursergeant entered with some papers bobby reflected for a while as revere looked through the company forms  does dormer do anything sergeant bobby asked with the air of one continuing an interrupted conversation  no sir does is dooty like a hortomato said the sergeant who delighted in long words a dirty soldier and es under full stoppages for new kit its covered with scales sir  scales what scales  fishscales sir es always pokin in the mud by the river an acleanin them muchlyfish with is thumbs revere was still absorbed in the company papers and the sergeant who was sternly fond of bobby continued e generally goes down there when es got is skinful beggin your pardon sir an they do say that the more lush inhebriated e is the more fish e catches they call im the looney fishmonger in the compny sir  revere signed the last paper and the sergeant retreated  its a filthy amusement sighed bobby to himself then aloud to revere are you really worried about dormer  a little you see hes never mad enough to send to hospital or drunk enough to run in but at any minute he may flare up brooding and sulking as he does he resents any interest being shown in him and the only time i took him out shooting he all but shot me by accident  i fish said bobby with a wry face i hire a countryboat and go down the river from thursday to sunday and the amiable dormer goes with me if you can spare us both  you blazing young fool said revere but his heart was full of much more pleasant words  bobby the captain of a dhoni with private dormer for mate dropped down the river on thursday morning the private at the bow the subaltern at the helm the private glared uneasily at the subaltern who respected the reserve of the private  after six hours dormer paced to the stern saluted and said beg y pardon sir but was you ever on the durhm canal  no said bobby wick come and have some tiffin  they ate in silence as the evening fell private dormer broke forth speaking to himself  hi was on the durhm canal jes such a night come next week twelve month atrailin of my toes in the water he smoked and said no more till bedtime  the witchery of the dawn turned the gray riverreaches to purple gold and opal and it was as though the lumbering dhoni crept across the splendours of a new heaven  private dormer popped his head out of his blanket and gazed at the glory below and around  well damn my eyes said private dormer in an awed whisper this ere is like a bloomin gallantryshow for the rest of the day he was dumb but achieved an ensanguined filthiness through the cleaning of big fish  the boat returned on saturday evening dormer had been struggling with speech since noon as the lines and luggage were being disembarked he found tongue  beg y pardon sir he said but would you would you min shakin ands with me sir  of course not said bobby and he shook accordingly dormer returned to barracks and bobby to mess  he wanted a little quiet and some fishing i think said bobby my aunt but hes a filthy sort of animal have you ever seen him clean them muchlyfish with is thumbs  anyhow said revere three weeks later hes doing his best to keep his things clean  when the spring died bobby joined in the general scramble for hill leave and to his surprise and delight secured three months  as good a boy as i want said revere the admiring skipper  the best of the batch said the adjutant to the colonel keep back that young skrimshanker porkiss sir and let revere make him sit up  so bobby departed joyously to simla pahar with a tin box of gorgeous raiment  son of wick old wick of chotabuldana ask him to dinner dear said the aged men  what a nice boy said the matrons and the maids  firstclass place simla oh ripping said bobby wick and ordered new white cord breeches on the strength of it  were in a bad way wrote revere to bobby at the end of two months since you left the regiment has taken to fever and is fairly rotten with it two hundred in hospital about a hundred in cells drinking to keep off fever and the companies on parade fifteen file strong at the outside theres rather more sickness in the outvillages than i care for but then im so blistered with pricklyheat that im ready to hang myself whats the yarn about your mashing a miss haverley up there not serious i hope youre overyoung to hang millstones round your neck and the colonel will turf you out of that in doublequick time if you attempt it  it was not the colonel that brought bobby out of simla but a muchmoretoberespected commandant the sickness in the outvillages spread the bazar was put out of bounds and then came the news that the tail twisters must go into camp the message flashed to the hill stations cholera leave stopped officers recalled alas for the white gloves in the neatlysoldered boxes the rides and the dances and picnics that were to be the loves half spoken and the debts unpaid without demur and without question fast as tonga could fly or pony gallop back to their regiments and their batteries as though they were hastening to their weddings fled the subalterns  bobby received his orders on returning from a dance at viceregal lodge where he had but only the haverley girl knows what bobby had said or how many waltzes he had claimed for the next ball six in the morning saw bobby at the tonga office in the drenching rain the whirl of the last waltz still in his ears and an intoxication due neither to wine nor waltzing in his brain  good man shouted deighton of the horse battery through the mist whar you raise dat tonga im coming with you ow but ive a head and a half i didnt sit out all night they say the batterys awful bad and he hummed dolorously       leave the what at the whatsitsname      leave the flock without shelter      leave the corpse uninterred      leave the bride at the altar  my faith itll be more bally corpse than bride though this journey jump in bobby get on coachwan  on the umballa platform waited a detachment of officers discussing the latest news from the stricken cantonment and it was here that bobby learned the real condition of the tail twisters  they went into camp said an elderly major recalled from the whisttables at mussoorie to a sickly native regiment they went into camp with two hundred and ten sick in carts two hundred and ten fever cases only and the balance looking like so many ghosts with sore eyes a madras regiment could have walked through em  but they were as fit as bedamned when i left them said bobby  then youd better make them as fit as bedamned when you rejoin said the major brutally  bobby pressed his forehead against the rainsplashed windowpane as the train lumbered across the sodden doab and prayed for the health of the tyneside tail twisters naini tal had sent down her contingent with all speed the lathering ponies of the dalhousie road staggered into pathankot taxed to the full stretch of their strength while from cloudy darjiling the calcutta mail whirled up the last straggler of the little army that was to fight a fight in which was neither medal nor honour for the winning against an enemy none other than the sickness that destroyeth in the noonday  and as each man reported himself he said this is a bad business and went about his own forthwith for every regiment and battery in the cantonment was under canvas the sickness bearing them company  bobby fought his way through the rain to the tail twisters temporary mess and revere could have fallen on the boys neck for the joy of seeing that ugly wholesome phiz once more  keep em amused and interested said revere they went on the drink poor fools after the first two cases and there was no improvement oh its good to have you back bobby porkiss is a never mind  deighton came over from the artillery camp to attend a dreary mess dinner and contributed to the general gloom by nearly weeping over the condition of his beloved battery porkiss so far forgot himself as to insinuate that the presence of the officers could do no earthly good and that the best thing would be to send the entire regiment into hospital and let the doctors look after them porkiss was demoralised with fear nor was his peace of mind restored when revere said coldly oh the sooner you go out the better if thats your way of thinking any public school could send us fifty good men in your place but it takes time time porkiss and money and a certain amount of trouble to make a regiment spose youre the person we go into camp for eh  whereupon porkiss was overtaken with a great and chilly fear which a drenching in the rain did not allay and two days later quitted this world for another where men do fondly hope allowances are made for the weaknesses of the flesh the regimental sergeantmajor looked wearily across the sergeants mess tent when the news was announced  there goes the worst of them he said itll take the best and then please god itll stop the sergeants were silent till one said it couldnt be him and all knew of whom travis was thinking  bobby wick stormed through the tents of his company rallying rebuking mildly as is consistent with the regulations chaffing the fainthearted haling the sound into the watery sunlight when there was a break in the weather and bidding them be of good cheer for their trouble was nearly at an end scuttling on his dun pony round the outskirts of the camp and heading back men who with the innate perversity of british soldiers were always wandering into infected villages or drinking deeply from rainflooded marshes comforting the panicstricken with rude speech and more than once tending the dying who had no friends the men without townies organising with banjos and burnt cork singsongs which should allow the talent of the regiment full play and generally as he explained playing the giddy gardengoat all round  youre worth halfadozen of us bobby said revere in a moment of enthusiasm how the devil do you keep it up  bobby made no answer but had revere looked into the breastpocket of his coat he might have seen there a sheaf of badlywritten letters which perhaps accounted for the power that possessed the boy a letter came to bobby every other day the spelling was not above reproach but the sentiments must have been most satisfactory for on receipt bobbys eyes softened marvellously and he was wont to fall into a tender abstraction for a while ere shaking his cropped head he charged into his work  by what power he drew after him the hearts of the roughest and the tail twisters counted in their ranks some rough diamonds indeed was a mystery to both skipper and c o who learned from the regimental chaplain that bobby was considerably more in request in the hospital tents than the reverend john emery  the men seem fond of you are you in the hospitals much said the colonel who did his daily round and ordered the men to get well with a hardness that did not cover his bitter grief  a little sir said bobby  shouldnt go there too often if i were you they say its not contagious but theres no use in running unnecessary risks we cant afford to have you down yknow  six days later it was with the utmost difficulty that the postrunner plashed his way out to the camp with the mailbags for the rain was falling in torrents bobby received a letter bore it off to his tent and the programme for the next weeks singsong being satisfactorily disposed of sat down to answer it for an hour the unhandy pen toiled over the paper and where sentiment rose to more than normal tidelevel bobby wick stuck out his tongue and breathed heavily he was not used to letterwriting  beg y pardon sir said a voice at the tent door but dormers orrid bad sir an theyve taken him orf sir  damn private dormer and you too said bobby wick running the blotter over the halffinished letter tell him ill come in the morning  es awful bad sir said the voice hesitatingly there was an undecided squelching of heavy boots  well said bobby impatiently  excusin imself before and for takin the liberty e says it would be a comfort for to assist im sir if  tattoo lao get my pony here come in out of the rain till im ready what blasted nuisances you are thats brandy drink some you want it hang on to my stirrup and tell me if i go too fast  strengthened by a fourfinger nip which he swallowed without a wink the hospital orderly kept up with the slipping mudstained and very disgusted pony as it shambled to the hospital tent  private dormer was certainly orrid bad he had all but reached the stage of collapse and was not pleasant to look upon  whats this dormer said bobby bending over the man youre not going out this time youve got to come fishing with me once or twice more yet  the blue lips parted and in the ghost of a whisper said beg y pardon sir disturbin of you now but would you min oldin my and sir  bobby sat on the side of the bed and the icy cold hand closed on his own like a vice forcing a ladys ring which was on the little finger deep into the flesh bobby set his lips and waited the water dripping from the hem of his trousers an hour passed and the grasp of the hand did not relax nor did the expression of the drawn face change bobby with infinite craft lit himself a cheroot with the left hand his right arm was numbed to the elbow and resigned himself to a night of pain  dawn showed a very whitefaced subaltern sitting on the side of a sick mans cot and a doctor in the doorway using language unfit for publication  have you been here all night you young ass said the doctor  there or thereabouts said bobby ruefully hes frozen on to me  dormers mouth shut with a click he turned his head and sighed the clinging hand opened and bobbys arm fell useless at his side  hell do said the doctor quietly it must have been a tossup all through the night think youre to be congratulated on this case  oh bosh said bobby i thought the man had gone out long ago only only i didnt care to take my hand away rub my arm down theres a good chap what a grip the brute has im chilled to the marrow he passed out of the tent shivering  private dormer was allowed to celebrate his repulse of death by strong waters four days later he sat on the side of his cot and said to the patients mildly id a liken to a spoken to im so i should  but at that time bobby was reading yet another letter he had the most persistent correspondent of any man in camp and was even then about to write that the sickness had abated and in another week at the outside would be gone he did not intend to say that the chill of a sick mans hand seemed to have struck into the heart whose capacities for affection he dwelt on at such length he did intend to enclose the illustrated programme of the forthcoming singsong whereof he was not a little proud he also intended to write on many other matters which do not concern us and doubtless would have done so but for the slight feverish headache which made him dull and unresponsive at mess  you are overdoing it bobby said his skipper might give the rest of us credit of doing a little work you go on as if you were the whole mess rolled into one take it easy  i will said bobby im feeling done up somehow revere looked at him anxiously and said nothing  there was a flickering of lanterns about the camp that night and a rumour that brought men out of their cots to the tent doors a paddling of the naked feet of dooliebearers and the rush of a galloping horse  wots up asked twenty tents and through twenty tents ran the answer wick es down  they brought the news to revere and he groaned any one but bobby and i shouldnt have cared the sergeantmajor was right  not going out this journey gasped bobby as he was lifted from the doolie not going out this journey then with an air of supreme conviction i cant you see  not if i can do anything said the surgeonmajor who had hastened over from the mess where he had been dining  he and the regimental surgeon fought together with death for the life of bobby wick their work was interrupted by a hairy apparition in a bluegray dressinggown who stared in horror at the bed and cried oh my gawd it cant be im until an indignant hospital orderly whisked him away  if care of man and desire to live could have done aught bobby would have been saved as it was he made a fight of three days and the surgeonmajors brow uncreased well save him yet he said and the surgeon who though he ranked with the captain had a very youthful heart went out upon the word and pranced joyously in the mud  not going out this journey whispered bobby wick gallantly at the end of the third day  bravo said the surgeonmajor thats the way to look at it bobby  as evening fell a gray shade gathered round bobbys mouth and he turned his face to the tent wall wearily the surgeonmajor frowned  im awfully tired said bobby very faintly whats the use of bothering me with medicine i dont want it let me alone  the desire for life had departed and bobby was content to drift away on the easy tide of death  its no good said the surgeonmajor he doesnt want to live hes meeting it poor child and he blew his nose  half a mile away the regimental band was playing the overture to the singsong for the men had been told that bobby was out of danger the clash of the brass and the wail of the horns reached bobbys ears       is there a single joy or pain      that i should never knoow      you do not love me tis in vain      bid me goodbye and go  an expression of hopeless irritation crossed the boys face and he tried to shake his head  the surgeonmajor bent down what is it bobby not that waltz muttered bobby thats our own our very ownest own mummy dear  with this he sank into the stupor that gave place to death early next morning  revere his eyes red at the rims and his nose very white went into bobbys tent to write a letter to papa wick which should bow the white head of the excommissioner of chotabuldana in the keenest sorrow of his life bobbys little store of papers lay in confusion on the table and among them a halffinished letter the last sentence ran so you see darling there is really no fear because as long as i know you care for me and i care for you nothing can touch me  revere stayed in the tent for an hour when he came out his eyes were redder than ever  private conklin sat on a turneddown bucket and listened to a not unfamiliar tune private conklin was a convalescent and should have been tenderly treated  ho said private conklin theres another bloomin orfcer da ed  the bucket shot from under him and his eyes filled with a smithyful of sparks a tall man in a bluegray bedgown was regarding him with deep disfavour  you ought to take shame for yourself conky orfcer bloomin orfcer ill learn you to misname the likes of im hangel bloomin hangel thats wote is  and the hospital orderly was so satisfied with the justice of the punishment that he did not even order private dormer back to his cot     in the matter of a private     hurrah hurrah a soldiers life for me shout boys shout for it   makes you jolly and free        the ramrod corps  people who have seen say that one of the quaintest spectacles of human frailty is an outbreak of hysterics in a girls school it starts without warning generally on a hot afternoon among the elder pupils a girl giggles till the giggle gets beyond control then she throws up her head and cries honk honk honk like a wild goose and tears mix with the laughter if the mistress be wise she will rap out something severe at this point and check matters if she be tenderhearted and send for a drink of water the chances are largely in favor of another girl laughing at the afflicted one and herself collapsing thus the trouble spreads and may end in half of what answers to the lower sixth of a boys school rocking and whooping together given a week of warm weather two stately promenades per diem a heavy mutton and rice meal in the middle of the day a certain amount of nagging from the teachers and a few other things some amazing effects develop at least this is what folk say who have had experience  now the mother superior of a convent and the colonel of a british infantry regiment would be justly shocked at any comparison being made between their respective charges but it is a fact that under certain circumstances thomas in bulk can be worked up into ditthering rippling hysteria he does not weep but he shows his trouble unmistakably and the consequences get into the newspapers and all the good people who hardly know a martini from a snider say take away the brutes ammunition  thomas isnt a brute and his business which is to look after the virtuous people demands that he shall have his ammunition to his hand he doesnt wear silk stockings and he really ought to be supplied with a new adjective to help him to express his opinions but for all that he is a great man if you call him the heroic defender of the national honor one day and a brutal and licentious soldiery the next you naturally bewilder him and he looks upon you with suspicion there is nobody to speak for thomas except people who have theories to work off on him and nobody understands thomas except thomas and he does not always know what is the matter with himself  that is the prologue this is the story  corporal slane was engaged to be married to miss jhansi mkenna whose history is well known in the regiment and elsewhere he had his colonels permission and being popular with the men every arrangement had been made to give the wedding what private ortheris called eeklar it fell in the heart of the hot weather and after the wedding slane was going up to the hills with the bride none the less slanes grievance was that the affair would be only a hiredcarriage wedding and he felt that the eeklar of that was meagre miss mkenna did not care so much the sergeants wife was helping her to make her weddingdress and she was very busy slane was just then the only moderately contented man in barracks all the rest were more or less miserable  and they had so much to make them happy too all their work was over at eight in the morning and for the rest of the day they could lie on their backs and smoke canteenplug and swear at the punkahcoolies they enjoyed a fine full flesh meal in the middle of the day and then threw themselves down on their cots and sweated and slept till it was cool enough to go out with their towny whose vocabulary contained less than six hundred words and the adjective and whose views on every conceivable question they had heard many times before  there was the canteen of course and there was the temperance room with the secondhand papers in it but a man of any profession cannot read for eight hours a day in a temperature of 96 degrees or 98 degrees in the shade running up sometimes to 103 degrees at midnight very few men even though they get a pannikin of flat stale muddy beer and hide it under their cots can continue drinking for six hours a day one man tried but he died and nearly the whole regiment went to his funeral because it gave them something to do it was too early for the excitement of fever or cholera the men could only wait and wait and wait and watch the shadow of the barrack creeping across the blinding white dust that was a gay life  they lounged about cantonmentsit was too hot for any sort of game and almost too hot for viceand fuddled themselves in the evening and filled themselves to distension with the healthy nitrogenous food provided for them and the more they stoked the less exercise they took and more explosive they grew then tempers began to wear away and men fell abrooding over insults real or imaginary for they had nothing else to think of the tone of the repartees changed and instead of saying lightheartedly ill knock your silly face in men grew laboriously polite and hinted that the cantonments were not big enough for themselves and their enemy and that there would be more space for one of the two in another place  it may have been the devil who arranged the thing but the fact of the case is that losson had for a long time been worrying simmons in an aimless way it gave him occupation the two had their cots side by side and would sometimes spend a long afternoon swearing at each other but simmons was afraid of losson and dared not challenge him to a fight he thought over the words in the hot still nights and half the hate he felt toward losson be vented on the wretched punkahcoolie  losson bought a parrot in the bazar and put it into a little cage and lowered the cage into the cool darkness of a well and sat on the wellcurb shouting bad language down to the parrot he taught it to say simmons ye sooor which means swine and several other things entirely unfit for publication he was a big gross man and he shook like a jelly when the parrot had the sentence correctly simmons however shook with rage for all the room were laughing at himthe parrot was such a disreputable puff of green feathers and it looked so human when it chattered losson used to sit swinging his fat legs on the side of the cot and ask the parrot what it thought of simmons the parrot would answer simmons ye sooor good boy losson used to say scratching the parrots head ye ear that sim and simmons used to turn over on his stomach and make answer i ear take eed you dont ear something one of these days  in the restless nights after he had been asleep all day fits of blind rage came upon simmonr and held him till he trembled all over while he thought in how many different ways he would slay losson sometimes he would picture himself trampling the life out of the man with heavy ammunitionboots and at others smashing in his face with the butt and at others jumping on his shoulders and dragging the head back till the neckbone cracked then his mouth would feel hot and fevered and he would reach out for another sup of the beer in the pannikin  but the fancy that came to him most frequently and stayed with him longest was one connected with the great roll of fat under lossons right ear he noticed it first on a moonlight night and thereafter it was always before his eyes it was a fascinating roll of fat a man could get his hand upon it and tear away one side of the neck or he could place the muzzle of a rifle on it and blow away all the head in a flash losson had no right to be sleek and contented and welltodo when he simmons was the butt of the room some day perhaps he would show those who laughed at the simmons ye sooor joke that he was as good as the rest and held a mans life in the crook of his forefinger when losson snored simmons hated him more bitterly than ever why should losson be able to sleep when simmons had to stay awake hour after hour tossing and turning on the tapes with the dull liver pain gnawing into his right side and his head throbbing and aching after canteen he thought over this for many nights and the world became unprofitable to him he even blunted his naturally fine appetite with beer and tobacco and all the while the parrot talked at and made a mock of him  the heat continued and the tempers wore away more quickly than before a sergeants wife died of heatapoplexy in the night and the rumor ran abroad that it was cholera men rejoiced openly hoping that it would spread and send them into camp but that was a false alarm  it was late on a tuesday evening and the men were waiting in the deep double verandas for last posts when simmons went to the box at the foot of his bed took out his pipe and slammed the lid down with a bang that echoed through the deserted barrack like the crack of a rifle ordinarily speaking the men would have taken no notice but their nerves were fretted to fiddlestrings they jumped up and three or four clattered into the barrackroom only to find simmons kneeling by his box  owl its you is it they said and laughed foolishly we thought twas  simmons rose slowly if the accident had so shaken his fellows what would not the reality do  you thought it wasdid you and what makes you think he said lashing himself into madness as he went on to hell with your thinking ye dirty spies  simmons ye sooor chuckled the parrot in the veranda sleepily recognizing a wellknown voice now that was absolutely all  the tension snapped simmons fell back on the armrack deliberatelythe men were at the far end of the roomand took out his rifle and packet of ammunition dont go playing the goat sim said losson put it down but there was a quaver in his voice another man stooped slipped his boot and hurled it at simmons head the prompt answer was a shot which fired at random found its billet in lossons throat losson fell forward without a word and the others scattered  you thought it was yelled simmons youre drivin me to it i tell you youre drivin me to it get up losson an dont lie shammin thereyou an your blasted parrit that druv me to it  but there was an unaffected reality about lossons pose that showed simmons what he had done the men were still clamoring on the veranda simmons appropriated two more packets of ammunition and ran into the moonlight muttering ill make a night of it thirty rouns an the last for myself take you that you dogs  he dropped on one knee and fired into the brown of the men on the veranda but the bullet flew high and landed in the brickwork with a vicious phant that made some of the younger ones turn pale it is as musketry theorists observe one thing to fire and another to be fired at  then the instinct of the chase flared up the news spread from barrack to barrack and the men doubled out intent on the capture of simmons the wild beast who was heading for the cavalry paradeground stopping now and again to send back a shot and a lurse in the direction of his pursuers  ill learn you to spy on me he shouted ill learn you to give me dorgs names come on the ole lot o you colonel john anthony deever cbhe turned toward the infantry mess and shook his rifleyou think yourself the devil of a manbut i tell jou that if you put your ugly old carcass outside o that door ill make you the poorestlookin man in the army come out colonel john anthony deever cb come out and see me practiss on the rainge im the crack shot of the ole bloomin battalion in proof of which statement simmons fired at the lighted windows of the messhouse  private simmons e compny on the cavalry pradeground sir with thirty rounds said a sergeant breathlessly to the colonel shootin right and lef sir shot private losson whats to be done sir  colonel john anthony deever cb sallied out only to be saluted by a spurt of dust at his feet  pull up said the second in command i dont want my step in that way colonel hes as dangerous as a mad dog  shoot him like one then said the colonel bitterly if he wont take his chance my regiment too if it had been the towheads i could have understood  private simmons had occupied a strong position near a well on the edge of the paradeground and was defying the regiment to come on the regiment was not anxious to comply for there is small honor in being shot by a fellowprivate only corporal slane rifle in band threw himself down on the ground and wormed his way toward the well  dont shoot said he to the men round him like as not youll hit me ill catch the beggar livin  simmons ceased shouting for a while and the noise of trapwheels could be heard across the plain major oldyne commanding the horse battery was coming back from a dinner in the civil lines was driving after his usual customthat is to say as fast as the horse could go  a orfcer a blooming spangled orfcer shrieked simmons ill make a scarecrow of that orfcer the trap stopped  whats this demanded the major of gunners you there drop your rifle  why its jerry blazes i aint got no quarrel with you jerry blazes pass frien an alls well  but jerry blazes had not the faintest intention of passing a dangerous murderer he was as his adoring battery swore long and fervently without knowledge of fear and they were surely the best judges for jerry blazes it was notorious had done his possible to kill a man each time the battery went out  he walked toward simmons with the intention of rushing him and knocking him down  dont make me do it sir said simmons i aint got nothing agin you ah you wouldthe major broke into a runtake that then  the major dropped with a bullet through his shoulder and simmons stood over him he had lost the satisfaction of killing losson in the desired way hut here was a helpless body to his hand should be slip in another cartridge and blow off the head or with the butt smash in the white face he stopped to consider and a cry went up from the far side of the paradeground hes killed jerry blazes but in the shelter of the wellpillars simmons was safe except when he stepped out to fire ill blow yer andsome ead off jerry blazes said simmons reflectively six an three is nine an one is ten an that leaves me another nineteen an one for myself he tugged at the string of the second packet of ammunition corporal slane crawled out of the shadow of a bank into the moonlight  i see you said simmons come a bit furder on an ill do for you  im comm said corporal slane briefly youve done a bad days work sim come out ere an come back with me  come tolaugbed simmons sending a cartridge home with his thumb not before ive settled you an jerry blazes  the corporal was lying at full length in the dust of the paradeground a rifle under him some of the lesscautious men in the distance shouted shoot im shoot im slane  you move and or foot slane said simmons an ill kick jerry blazes ead in and shoot you after  i aint movin said the corporal raising his head you darent it a man on is legs let go o jerry blazes an come out o that with your fistes come an it me you darent you bloomin dogshooter  i dare  you lie you mansticker you sneakin sheeny butcher you lie see there slane kicked the rifle away and stood up in the peril of his life come on now  the temptation was more than simmons could resist for the corporal in his white clothes offered a perfect mark  dont misname me shouted simmons firing as he spoke the shot missed and the shooter blind with rage threw his rifle down and rushed at slane from the protection of the well within striking distance he kicked savagely at slanes stomach but the weedy corporal knew something of simmonss weakness and knew too the deadly guard for that kick bowing forward and drawing up his right leg till the heel of the right foot was set some three inches above the inside of the left kneecap he met the blow standing on one legexactly as gonds stand when they meditateand ready for the fall that would follow there was an oath the corporal fell over his own left as shinbone met shinbone and the private collapsed his right leg broken an inch above the ankle  pity you dont know that guard sim said slane spitting out the dust as he rose then raising his voicecome an take him orf ive bruk is leg this was not strictly true for the private had accomplished his own downfall since it is the special merit of that legguard that the harder the kick the greater the kickers discomfiture  slane walked to jerry blazes and hung over him with ostentatious anxiety while simmons weeping with pain was carried away ope you aint urt badly sir said slane the major had fainted and there was an ugly ragged hole through the top of his arm slane knelt down and murmured selp me i believe es dead well if that aint my blooming luck all over  but the major was destined to lead his battery afield for many a long day with unshaken nerve he was removed and nursed and petted into convalescence while the battery discussed the wisdom of capturing simmons and blowing him from a gun they idolized their major and his reappearance on parade brought about a scene nowhere provided for in the army regulations  great too was the glory that fell to slanes share the gunners would have made him drunk thrice a day for at least a fortnight even the colonel of his own regiment complimented him upon his coolness and the local paper called him a hero these things did not puff him up when the major offered him money and thanks the virtuous corporal took the one and put aside the other but he had a request to make and prefaced it with many a beg ypardon sir could the major see his way to letting the slane mkenna wedding be adorned by the presence of four battery horses to pull a hired barouche the major could and so could the battery excessively so it was a gorgeous wedding        wot did i do it for said corporal slane for the orses o course jhansi aint a beauty to look at but i wasnt goin to ave a hired turnout jerry blazes if i adnt a wanted something sim might ha blowed jerry blazes blooming ead into hirish stew for aught id a cared  and they hanged private simmonshanged him as high as haman in hollow square of the regiment and the colonel said it was drink and the chaplain was sure it was the devil and simmons fancied it was both but he didnt know and only hoped his fate would be a warning to his companions and half a dozen intelligent publicists wrote six beautiful leading articles on the prevalence of crime in the army  but not a soul thought of comparing the bloodyminded simmons to the squawking gaping schoolgirl with which this story opens     the enlightenments of pagett mp     because half a dozen grasshoppers under a fern make the field   ring with their importunate chink while thousands of great cattle   reposed beneath the shadow of the british oak chew the cud and   are silent pray do not imagine that those who make the noise are   the only inhabitants of the fieldthat of course they are many in   number or that after all they are other than the little shrivelled   meagre hopping though loud and troublesome insects of the   hourburke reflections on the revolution in france  they were sitting in the veranda of the splendid palace of an indian proconsul surrounded by all the glory and mystery of the immemorial east in plain english it was a onestoried tenroomed whitewashed mudroofed bungalow set in a dry garden of dusty tamarisk trees and divided from the road by a low mud wall the green parrots screamed overhead as they flew in battalions to the river for their morning drink beyond the wall clouds of fine dust showed where the cattle and goats of the city were passing afield to graze the remorseless white light of the winter sunshine of northern india lay upon everything and improved nothing from the whining peisianwheel by the lawntennis court to the long perspective of level road and the blue domed tombs of mohammedan saints just visible above the trees  a happy new year said orde to his guest its the first youve ever spent out of england isnt it  yes happy new year said pagett smiling at the sunshine what a divine climate you have here just think of the brown cold fog hanging over london now and he rubbed his hands  it was more than twenty years since he had last seen orde his schoolmate and their paths in the world had divided early the one had quitted college to become a cogwheel in the machinery of the great indian government the other more blessed with goods had been whirled into a similar position in the english scheme three successive elections had not affected pagetts position with a loyal constituency and he had grown insensibly to regard himself in some sort as a pillar of the empire whose real worth would be known later on after a few years of conscientious attendance at many divisions after newspaper battles innumerable and the publication of interminable correspondence and more hasty oratory than in his calmer moments he cared to think upon it occurred to him as it had occurred to many of his fellows in parliament that a tour to india would enable him to sweep a larger lyre and address himself to the problems of imperial administration with a firmer hand accepting therefore a general invitation extended to him by orde some years before pagett had taken ship to karachi and only overnight had been received with joy by the deputycommissioner of amara they had sat late discussing the changes and chances of twenty years recalling the names of the dead and weighing the futures of the living as is the custom of men meeting after intervals of action  next morning they smoked the after breakfast pipe in the veranda still regarding each other curiously pagett in a light grey frockcoat and garments much too thin for the time of the year and a puggried sunhat carefully and wonderfully made orde in a shooting coat riding breeches brown cowhide boots with spurs and a battered flax helmet he had ridden some miles in the early morning to inspect a doubtful river dam the mens faces differed as much as their attire ordes worn and wrinkled around the eyes and grizzled at the temples was the harder and more square of the two and it was with something like envy that the owner looked at the comfortable outlines of pagetts blandly receptive countenance the clear skin the untroubled eye and the mobile cleanshaved lips  and this is india said pagett for the twentieth time staring long and intently at the grey feathering of the tamarisks  one portion of india only its very much like this for 300 miles in every direction by the way now that you have rested a littlei wouldnt ask the old question beforewhat dyou think of the country  tis the most pervasive country that ever yet was seen i acquired several pounds of your country coming up from karachi the air is heavy with it and for miles and miles along that distressful eternity of rail theres no horizon to show where air and earth separate  yes it isnt easy to see truly or far in india but you had a decent passage out hadnt you  very good on the whole your angloindian may be unsympathetic about ones political views but he has reduced ship life to a science  the angloindian is a political orphan and if hes wise he wont be in a hurry to be adopted by your party grandmothers but how were your companions unsympathetic  well there was a man called dawlishe a judge somewhere in this country it seems and a capital partner at whist by the way and when i wanted to talk to him about the progress of india in a political sense orde hid a grin which might or might not have been sympathetic the national congress movement and other things in which as a member of parliament im of course interested he shifted the subject and when i once cornered him he looked me calmly in the eye and said thats all tommy rot come and have a game at bull you may laugh but that isnt the way to treat a great and important question and knowing who i was well i thought it rather rude dont you know and yet dawlishe is a thoroughly good fellow  yes hes a friend of mine and one of the straightest men i know i suppose like many angloindians he felt it was hopeless to give you any just idea of any indian question without the documents before you and in this case the documents you want are the country and the people  precisely that was why i came straight to you bringing an open mind to bear on things im anxious to know what popular feeling in india is really like yknow now that it has wakened into political life the national congress in spite of dawlishe must have caused great excitement among the masses  on the contrary nothing could be more tranquil than the state of popular feeling and as to excitement the people would as soon be excited over the rule of three as over the congress  excuse me orde but do you think you are a fair judge isnt the official angloindian naturally jealous of any external influences that might move the masses and so much opposed to liberal ideas truly liberal ideas that he can scarcely be expected to regard a popular movement with fairness  what did dawlishe say about tommy rot think a moment old man you and i were brought up together taught by the same tutors read the same books lived the same life and new languages and work among new races while you more fortunate remain at home why should i change my mind our mindbecause i change my sky why should i and the few hundred englishmen in my service become unreasonable prejudiced fossils while you and your newer friends alone remain bright and openminded you surely dont fancy civilians are members of a primrose league  of course not but the mere position of an english official gives him a point of view which cannot but bias his mind on this question pagett moved his knee up and down a little uneasily as he spoke  that sounds plausible enough but like more plausible notions on indian matters i believe its a mistake youll find when you come to consult the unofficial briton that our fault as a classi speak of the civilian nowis rather to magnify the progress that has been made toward liberal institutions it is of english origin such as it is and the stress of our work since the mutinyonly thirty years agohas been in that direction no i think you will get no fairer or more dispassionate view of the congress business than such men as i can give you but i may as well say at once that those who know most of india from the inside are inclined to wonder at the noise our scarcely begun experiment makes in england  but surely the gathering together of congress delegates is of itself a new thing  theres nothing new under the sun when europe was a jungle half asia flocked to the canonical conferences of buddhism and for centuries the people have gathered at pun hurdwar trimbak and benares in immense numbers a great meeting what you call a mass meeting is really one of the oldest and most popular of indian institutions in the case of the congress meetings the only notable fact is that the priests of the altar are british not buddhist jam or brahmanical and that the whole thing is a british contrivance kept alive by the efforts of messrs hume eardley norton and digby  you mean to say then it s not a spontaneous movement  what movement was ever spontaneous in any true sense of the word this seems to be more factitious than usual you seem to know a great deal about it try it by the touchstone of subscriptions a coarse but fairly trustworthy criterion and there is scarcely the color of money in it the delegates write from england that they are out of pocket for working expenses railway fares and stationerythe mere pasteboard and scaffolding of their show it is in fact collapsing from mere financial inanition  but you cannot deny that the people of india who are perhaps too poor to subscribe are mentally and morally moved by the agitation pagett insisted  that is precisely what i do deny the native side of the movement is the work of a limited class a microscopic minority as lord dufferin described it when compared with the people proper but still a very interesting class seeing that it is of our own creation it is composed almost entirely of those of the literary or clerkly castes who have received an english education  surely that s a very important class its members must be the ordained leaders of popular thought  anywhere else they might be leaders but they have no social weight in this topsyturvy land and though they have been employed in clerical work for generations they have no practical knowledge of affairs a ships clerk is a useful person but he is scarcely the captain and an orderlyroom writer however smart he may be is not the colonel you see the writer class in india has never till now aspired to anything like command it wasnt allowed to the indian gentleman for thousands of years past has resembled victor hugos noble       un vrai sire      chatelain      laisse ecrire      le vilain      sa main digne      quand il signe      egratigne      le velin  and the little egralignures he most likes to make have been scored pretty deeply by the sword  but this is childish and medheval nonsense  precisely and from your or rather our point of view the pen is mightier than the sword in this country its otherwise the fault lies in our indian balances not yet adjusted to civilized weights and measures  well at all events this literary class represent the natural aspirations and wishes of the people at large though it may not exactly lead them and in spite of all you say orde i defy you to find a really sound english radical who would not sympathize with those aspirations  pagett spoke with some warmth and he had scarcely ceased when a well appointed dogcart turned into the compound gates and orde rose saying  here is edwards the master of the lodge i neglect so diligently come to talk about accounts i suppose  as the vehicle drove up under the porch pagett also rose saying with the trained effusion born of much practice  but this is also my friend my old and valued friend edwards im delighted to see you i knew you were in india but not exactly where  then it isnt accounts mr edwards said orde cheerily  why no sir i heard mr pagett was coming and as our works were closed for the new year i thought i would drive over and see him  a very happy thought mr edwards you may not know orde was a leading member of our radical club at switebton when i was beginning political life and i owe much to his exertions theres no pleasure like meeting an old friend except perhaps making a new one i suppose mr edwards you stick to the good old cause  well you see sir things are different out here theres precious little one can find to say against the government which was the main of our talk at home and them that do say things are not the sort o people a man who respects himself would like to be mixed up with there are no politics in a manner of speaking in india its all work  surely you are mistaken my good friend why i have come all the way from england just to see the working of this great national movement  i dont know where youre going to find the nation as moves to begin with and then youll be hard put to it to find what they are moving about its like this sir said edwards who had not quite relished being called my good friend they havent got any grievancenothing to hit with dont you see sir and then theres not much to hit against because the government is more like a kind of general providence directing an oldestablished state of things than that at home where theres something new thrown down for us to fight about every three months  you are probably in your workshops full of english mechanics out of the way of learning what the masses think  i dont know so much about that there are four of us english foremen and between seven and eight hundred native fitters smiths carpenters painters and such like  and they are full of the congress of course  never hear a word of it from years end to years end and i speak the talk too but i wanted to ask how things are going on at homeold tyler and brown and the rest  we will speak of them presently but your account of the indifference of your men surprises me almost as much as your own i fear you are a backslider from the good old doctrine ed wards pagett spoke as one who mourned the death of a near relative  not a bit sir but i should be if i took up with a parcel of baboos pleaders and schoolboys as never did a days work in their lives and couldnt if they tried and if you was to poll us english railway men mechanics tradespeople and the like of that all up and down the country from peshawur to calcutta you would find us mostly in a tale together and yet you know were the same english you pay some respect to at home at lection time and we have the pull o knowing something about it  this is very curious but you will let me come and see you and perhaps you will kindly show me the railway works and we will talk things over at leisure and about all old friends and old times added pagett detecting with quick insight a look of disappointment in the mechanics face  nodding briefly to orde edwards mounted his dogcart and drove off  its very disappointing said the member to orde who while his friend discoursed with edwards had been looking over a bundle of sketches drawn on grey paper in purple ink brought to him by a chuprassee  dont let it trouble you old chap said orde sympathetically look here a moment here are some sketches by the man who made the carved wood screen you admired so much in the diningroom and wanted a copy of and the artist himself is here too  a native said pagett  of course was the reply bishen siagh is his name and he has two brothers to help him when there is an important job to do the three go ato partnership but they spend most of their time and all their money in litigation over an inheritance and im afraid they are getting involved thoroughbred sikhs of the old rock obstinate touchy bigoted and cunning but good men for all that here is bishen singnshall we ask him about the congress  but bishen singh who approached with a respectful salaam had never heard of it and he listened with a puzzled face and obviously feigned interest to ordes account of its aims and objects finally shaking his vast white turban with great significance when he learned that it was promoted by certain pleaders named by orde and by educated natives he began with labored respect to explain how he was a poor man with no concern in such matters which were all under the control of god but presently broke out of urdu into familiar punjabi the mere sound of which had a rustic smack of village smokereek and ploughtail as he denounced the wearers of white coats the jugglers with words who filched his field from him the men whose backs were never bowed in honest work and poured ironical scorn on the bengali he and one of his brothers had seen calcutta and being at work there had bengali carpenters given to them as assistants  those carpenters said bishen singh black apes were more efficient workmates and as for the bengali babutchick the guttural click needed no interpretation but orde translated the rest while pagett gazed with in terest at the woodcarver  he seems to have a most illiberal prejudice against the bengali said the mp  yes its very sad that for ages outside bengal there should be so bitter a prejudice pride of race which also means racehatred is the plague and curse of india and it spreads far pointed with his ridingwhip to the large map of india on the veranda wall  see i begin with the north said he theres the afghan and as a highlander he despises all the dwellers in hindoostanwith the exception of the sikh whom he hates as cordially as the sikh hates him the hindu loathes sikh and afghan and the rajputthats a little lower down across this yellow blot of deserthas a strong objection to put it mildly to the maratha who by the way poisonously hates the afghan lets go north a minute the sindhi hates everybody ive mentioned very good well take less warlike races the cultivator of northern india domineers over the man in the next province and the behari of the northwest ridicules the bengali they are all at one on that point im giving you merely the roughest possible outlines of the facts of course  bishen singh his clean cut nostrils still quivering watched the large sweep of the whip as it traveled from the frontier through sindh the punjab and rajputana till it rested by the valley of the jumna  hateeternal and inextinguishable hate concluded orde flicking the lash of the whip across the large map from east to west as he sat down remember cannings advice to lord granville never write or speak of indian things without looking at a map  pagett opened his eyes orde resumed and the racehatred is only a part of it whats really the matter with bisben singh is classhatred which unfortunately is even more intense and more widely spread thats one of the little drawbacks of caste which some of your recent english writers find an impeccable system  the woodcarver was glad to be recalled to the business of his craft and his eyes shone as he received instructions for a carved wooden doorway for pagett which he promised should be splendidly executed and despatched to england in six months it is an irrelevant detail but in spite of ordes reminders fourteen months elapsed before the work was finished business over bishen singh hung about reluctant to take his leave and at last joining his hands and approaching orde with bated breath and whispering humbleness said he had a petition to make ordes face suddenly lost all trace of expression speak on bishen singh said he and the carver in a whining tone explained that his case against his brothers was fixed for hearing before a native judge andhere he dropped his voice still lower till he was summarily stopped by orde who sternly pointed to the gate with an emphatic begone  bishen singh showing but little sign of discomposure salaamed respectfully to the friends and departed  pagett looked inquiry orde with complete recovery of his usual urbanity replied its nothing only the old story he wants his case to be tried by an english judgethey all do thatbut when he began to hint that the other side were in improper relations with the native judge i had to shut him up gunga ram the man he wanted to make insinuations about may not be very bright but hes as honest as daylight on the bench but thats just what one cant get a native to believe  do you really mean to say these people prefer to have their cases tried by english judges  why certainly  pagett drew a long breath i didnt know that before at this point a phaeton entered the compound and orde rose with confound it theres old rasul ah khan come to pay one of his tiresome duty calls im afraid we shall never get through our little congress discussion  pagett was an almost silent spectator of the grave formalities of a visit paid by a punctilious old mahommedan gentleman to an indian official and was much impressed by the distinction of manner and fine appearance of the mohammedan landholder when the exchange of polite banalities came to a pause he expressed a wish to learn the courtly visitors opinion of the national congress  orde reluctantly interpreted and with a smile which even mohammedan politeness could not save from bitter scorn rasul ah khan intimated that he knew nothing about it and cared still less it was a kind of talk encouraged by the government for some mysterious purpose of its own and for his own part he wondered and held his peace  pagett was far from satisfied with this and wished to have the old gentlemans opinion on the propriety of managing all indian affairs on the basis of an elective system  orde did his best to explain but it was plain the visitor was bored and bewildered frankly he didnt think much of committees they had a municipal committee at lahore and had elected a menial servant an orderly as a member he had been informed of this on good authority and after that committees had ceased to interest him but all was according to the rule of government and please god it was all for the best  what an old fossil it is cried pagett as orde returned from seeing his guest to the door just like some old blueblooded hidalgo of spain what does he really think of the congress after all and of the elective system  hates it all like poison when you are sure of a majority election is a fine system but you can scarcely expect the mahommedans the most masterful and powerful minority in the country to contemplate their own extinction with joy the worst of it is that he and his coreligionists who are many and the landed proprietors also of hindu race are frightened and put out by this election business and by the importance we have bestowed on lawyers pleaders writers and the like who have up to now been in abject submission to them they say little hut after all they are the most important fagots in the great bundle of communities and all the glib bunkum in the world would not pay for their estrangement they have controlled the land  but i am assured that experience of local selfgovernment in your municipalities has been most satisfactory and when once the principle is accepted in your centres dont you know it is bound to spread and these importantahm people of yours would learn it like the rest i see no difficulty at all and the smooth lips closed with the complacent snap habitual to pagett mp the man of cheerful yesterdays and confident tomorrows  orde looked at him with a dreary smile  the privilege of election has been most reluctantly withdrawn from scores of municipalities others have had to be summarily suppressed and outside the presidency towns the actual work done has been badly performed this is of less moment perhapsit only sends up the local deathratesthan the fact that the public interest in municipal elections never very strong has waned and is waning in spite of careful nursing on the part of government servants  can you explain this lack of interest said pagett putting aside the rest of ordes remarks  you may find a ward of the key in the fact that only one in every thousand af our population can spell then they are infinitely more interested in religion and caste questions than in any sort of politics when the business of mere existence is over their minds are occupied by a series of interests pleasures rituals superstitions and the like based on centuries of tradition and usage you perhaps find it hard to conceive of people absolutely devoid of curiosity to whom the book the daily paper and the printed speech are unknown and you would describe their life as blank thats a profound mistake you are in another land another century down on the bedrock of society where the family merely and not the community is allimportant the average oriental cannot be brought to look beyond his clan his life too is naore complete and selfsufficing and less sordid and lowthoughted than you might imagine it is bovine and slow in some respects but it is never empty you and i are inclined to put the cart before the horse and to forget that it is the man that is elemental not the book       the corn and the cattle are all my care      and the rest is the will of god  why should such folk look up from their immemorially appointed round of duty and interests to meddle with the unknown and fuss with votingpapers how would you atop of all your interests care to conduct even onetenth of your life according to the manners and customs of the papuans lets say thats what it comes to  but if they wont take the trouble to vote why do you anticipate that mohammedans proprietors and the rest would be crushed by majorities of them  again pagett disregarded the closing sentence  because though the landholders would not move a finger on any purely political question they could be raised in dangerous excitement by religious hatreds already the first note of this has been sounded by the people who are trying to get up an agitation on the cowkilling question and every year there is trouble over the mohammedan muharrum processions  but who looks after the popular rights being thus unrepresented  the government of her majesty the queen empress of india in which if the congress promoters are to be believed the people have an implicit trust for the congress circular specially prepared for rustic comprehension says the movement is for the remission of tax the advancement of hindustan and the strengthening of the british government this paper is headed in large letters  may the prosperity of the empire of india endure  really said pagett that shows some cleverness but there are things better worth imitation in our english methods oferpolitical statement than this sort of amiable fraud  anyhow resumed orde you perceive that not a word is said about elections and the elective principle and the reticence of the congress promoters here shows they are wise in their generation  but the elective principle must triumph in the end and the little difficulties you seem to anticipate would give way on the introduction of a wellbalanced scheme capable of indefinite extension  but is it possible to devise a scheme which always assuming that the people took any interest in it without enormous expense ruinous dislocation of the administation and danger to the public peace can satisfy the aspirations of mr hume and his following and yet safeguard the interests of the mahommedans the landed and wealthy classes the conservative hindus the eurasians parsees sikhs rajputs native christians domiciled europeans and others who are each important and powerful in their way  pagetts attention however was diverted to the gate where a group of cultivators stood in apparent hesitation  here are the twelve apostles by jovecome straight out of raffaeles cartoons said the mp with the fresh appreciation of a newcomer  orde loth to be interrupted turned impatiently toward the villagers and their leader handing his long staff to one of his companions advanced to the house  it is old jelbo the lumherdar or headman of pind sharkot and a very intelligent man for a villager  the jat farmer had removed his shoes and stood smiling on the edge of the veranda his strongly marked features glowed with russet bronze and his bright eyes gleamed under deeply set brows contracted by lifelong exposure to sunshine his beard and moustache streaked with grey swept from bold cliffs of brow and cheek in the large sweeps one sees drawn by michael angelo and strands of long black hair mingled with the irregularly piled wreaths and folds of his turban the drapery of stout blue cotton cloth thrown over his broad shoulders and girt round his narrow loins hung from his tall form in broadly sculptured folds and he would have made a superb model for an artist in search of a patriarch  orde greeted him cordially and after a polite pause the countryman started off with a long story told with impressive earnestness orde listened and smiled interrupting the speaker at times to argue and reason with him in a tone which pagett could hear was kindly and finally checking the flux of words was about to dismiss him when pagett suggested that he should be asked about the national congress  but jelloc had never heard of it he was a poor man and such things by the favor of his honor did not concern him  whats the matter with your big friend that he was so terribly in earnest asked pagett when he had left  nothing much he wants the blood of the people in the next village who have had smallpox and cattle plague pretty badly and by the help of a wizard a currier and several pigs have passed it on to his own village wants to know if they cant be run in for this awful crime it seems they made a dreadful charivari at the village boundary threw a quantity of spellbearing objects over the border a buffalos skull and other things then branded a chamurwhat you would call a currieron his hinder parts and drove him and a number of pigs over into jelbos village jelbo says he can bring evidence to prove that the wizard directing these proceedings who is a sansi has been guilty of theft arson cattlekilling perjury and murder but would prefer to have him punished for bewitching them and inflicting smallpox  and how on earth did you answer such a lunatic  lunatic i the old fellow is as sane as you or i and he has some ground of complaint against those sansis i asked if he would like a native superintendent of police with some men to make inquiries but he objected on the grounds the police were rather worse than smallpox and criminal tribes put together  criminal tribeseri dont quite understand said paget  we have in india many tribes of people who in the slack antibritish days became robbers in various kind and preyed on the people they are being restrained and reclaimed little by little and in time will become useful citizens but they still cherish hereditary traditions of crime and are a difficult lot to deal with by the way what about the political rights of these folk under your schemes the country people call them vermin but i suppose they would be electors with the rest  nonsensespecial provision would be made for them in a wellconsidered electoral scheme and they would doubtless be treated with fitting severity said pagett with a magisterial air  severity yesbut whether it would be fitting is doubtful even those poor devils have rights and after all they only practice what they have been taught  but criminals orde  yes criminals with codes and rituals of crime gods and godlings of crime and a hundred songs and sayings in praise of it puzzling isnt it  its simply dreadful they ought to be put down at once are there many of them  not more than about sixty thousand in this province for many of the tribes broadly described as criminal are really vagabond and criminal only on occasion while others are being settled and reclaimed they are of great antiquity a legacy from the past the golden glorious aryan past of max muller birdwood and the rest of your spindrift philosophers  an orderly brought a card to orde who took it with a movement of irritation at the interruption and banded it to pagett a large card with a ruled border in red ink and in the centre in schoolboy copper plate mr dma nath give salaam said the civilian and there entered in haste a slender youth clad in a closely fitting coat of grey homespun tight trousers patentleather shoes and a small black velvet cap his thin cheek twitched and his eyes wandered restlessly for the young man was evidently nervous and uncomfortable though striving to assume a free and easy air  your honor may perhaps remember me he said in english and orde scanned him keenly  i know your face somehow you belonged to the shershah district i think when i was in charge there  yes sir my father is writer at shershah and your honor gave me a prize when i was first in the middle school examination five years ago since then i have prosecuted my studies and i am now second years student in the mission college  of course you are kedar naths sonthe boy who said he liked geography better than play or sugar cakes and i didnt believe you how is your father getting on  he is well and he sends his salaam but his circumstances are depressed and he also is down on his luck  you learn english idiom at the mission college it seems  yes sir they are the best idioms and my father ordered me to ask your honor to say a word for him to the present incumbent of your honors shoes the latchet of which he is not worthy to open and who knows not joseph for things are different at sher shah now and my father wants promotion  your father is a good man and i will do what i can for him  at this point a telegram was handed to orde who after glancing at it said he must leave his young friend whom he introduced to pagett a member of the english house of commons who wishes to learn about india  orde bad scarcely retired with his telegram when pagett began  perhaps you can tell me something of the national congress movement  sir it is the greatest movement of modern times and one in which all educated men like us must join all our students are for the congress  excepting i suppose mahommedans and the christians said pagett quick to use his recent instruction  these are some mere exceptions to the universal rule  but the people outside the college the working classes the agriculturists your father and mother for instance  my mother said the young man with a visible effort to bring himself to pronounce the word has no ideas and my father is not agriculturist nor working class he is of the kayeth caste but he had not the advantage of a collegiate education and he does not know much of the congress it is a movement for the educated youngman connecting adjective and noun in a sort of vocal hyphen  ah yes said pagett feeling he was a little off the rails and what are the benefits you expect to gain by it  oh sir everything england owes its greatness to parliamentary institutions and we should at once gain the same high position in scale of nations sir we wish to have the sciences the arts the manufactures the industrial factories with steam engines and other motive powers and public meetings and debates already we have a debating club in connection with the college and elect a mr speaker sir the progress must come you also are a member of parliament and worship the great lord ripon said the youth breathlessly and his black eyes flashed as he finished his commaless sentences  well said pagett drily it has not yet occurred to me to worship his lordship although i believe he is a very worthy man and i am not sure that england owes quite all the things you name to the house of commons you see my young friend the growth of a nation like ours is slow subject to many influences and if you have read your history arightsir i know it allall norman conquest magna charta runnymede reformation tudors stuarts mr milton and mr burke and i have read something of mr herbert spencer and gibbons decline and fall reynolds mysteries of the court and pagett felt like one who had pulled the string of a showerbath unawares and hastened to stop the torrent with a question as to what particular grievances of the people of india the attention of an elected assembly should be first directed but young mr dma nath was slow to particularize there were many very many demanding consideration mr pagett would like to hear of one or two typical examples the repeal of the arms act was at last named and the student learned for the first time that a license was necessary before an englishman could carry a gun in england then natives of india ought to be allowed to become volunteer riflemen if they chose and the absolute equality of the oriental with his european fellowsubject in civil status should be proclaimed on principle and the indian army should be considerably reduced the student was not however prepared with answers to mr pagetts mildest questions on these points and he returned to vague generalities leaving the mp so much impressed with the crudity of his views that he was glad on ordes return to say goodbye to his very interesting young friend  what do you think of young india asked orde  curious very curiousand callow  and yet the civilian replied one can scarcely help sympathizing with him for his mere youths sake the young orators of the oxford union arrived at the same conclusions and showed doubtless just the same enthusiasm if there were any political analogy between india and england if the thousand races of this empire were one if there were any chance even of their learning to speak one language if in short india were a utopia of the debatingroom and not a real land this kind of talk might be worth listening to but it is all based on false analogy and ignorance of the facts  but he is a native and knows the facts  he is a sort of english schoolboy but married three years and the father of two weaklings and knows less than most english schoolboys you saw all he is and knows and such ideas as he has acquired are directly hostile to the most cherished convictions of the vast majority of the people  but what does he mean by saying he is a student of a mission college is he a christian  he meant just what he said and he is not a christian nor ever will he be good people in america scotland and england most of whom would never dream of collegiate education for their own sons are pinching themselves to bestow it in pure waste on indian youths their scheme is an oblique subterranean attack on heathenism the theory being that with the jam of secular education leading to a university degree the pill of moral or religious instruction may he coaxed down the heathen gullet  but does it succeed do they make converts  they make no converts for the subtle oriental swallows the jam and rejects the pill but the mere example of the sober righteous and godly lives of the principals and professors who are most excellent and devoted men must have a certain moral value yet as lord lansdowne pointed out the other day the market is dangerously overstocked with graduates of our universities who look for employment in the administration an immense number are employed but year by year the college mills grind out increasing lists of youths foredoomed to failure and disappointment and meanwhile trade manufactures and the industrial arts are neglected and in fact regarded with contempt by our new literary mandarins in posse  but our young friend said he wanted steamengines and factories said pagett  yes he would like to direct such concerns he wants to begin at the top for manual labor is held to be discreditable and he would never defile his hands by the apprenticeship which the architects engineers and manufacturers of england cheerfully undergo and he would be aghast to learn that the leading names of industrial enterprise in england belonged a generation or two since or now belong to men who wrought with their own hands and though he talks glibly of manufacturers he refuses to see that the indian manufacturer of the future will be the despised workman of the present it was proposed for example a few weeks ago that a certain municipality in this province should establish an elementary technical school for the sons of workmen the stress of the opposition to the plan came from a pleader who owed all he had to a college education bestowed on him gratis by government and missions you would have fancied some fine old crusted tory squire of the last generation was speaking these people he said want no education for they learn their trades from their fathers and to teach a workmans son the elements of mathematics and physical science would give him ideas above his business they must be kept in their place and it was idle to imagine that there was any science in wood or iron work and he carried his point but the indian workman will rise in the social scale in spite of the new literary caste  in england we have scarcely begun to realize that there is an industrial class in this country yet i suppose the example of men like edwards for instance must tell said pagett thoughtfully  that you shouldnt know much about it is natural enough for there are but few sources of information india in this as in other respects is like a badly kept ledgernot written up to date and men like edwards are in reality missionaries who by precept and example are teaching more lessons than they know only a few however of their crowds of subordinates seem to care to try to emulate them and aim at individual advancement the rest drop into the ancient indian caste groove  how do you mean asked he well it is found that the new railway and factory workmen the fitter the smith the enginedriver and the rest are already forming separate hereditary castes you may notice this down at jamalpur in bengal one of the oldest railway centres and at other places and in other industries they are following the same inexorable indian law  which means queried pagett  it means that the rooted habit of the people is to gather in small selfcontained selfsufficing family groups with no thought or care for any interests but their owna habit which is scarcely compatible with the right acceptation of the elective principle  yet you must admit orde that though our young friend was not able to expound the faith that is in him your indian army is too big  not nearly big enough for its main purpose and as a side issue there are certain powerful minorities of fighting folk whose interests an asiatic government is bound to consider arms is as much a means of livelihood as civil employ under government and law and it would be a heavy strain on british bayonets to hold down sikhs jats bilochis rohillas rajputs bhils dogras pahtans and gurkbas to abide by the decisions of a numerical majority opposed to their interests leave the numerical majority to itself without the british bayonetsa flock of sheep might as reasonably hope to manage a troop of collies  this complaint about excessive growth of the army is akin to another contention of the congress party they protest against the malversation of the whole of the moneys raised by additional taxes as a famine insurance fund to other purposes you must be aware that this special famine fund has all been spent on frontier roads and defences and strategic railway schemes as a protection against russia  but there was never a special famine fund raised by special taxation and put by as in a box no sane administrator would dream of such a thing in a time of prosperity a finance minister rejoicing in a margin proposed to annually apply a million and a half to the construction of railways and canals for the protection of districts liable to scarcity and to the reduction of the annual loans for public works but times were not always prosperous and the finance minister had to choose whether he would bang up the insurance scheme for a year or impose fresh taxation when a farmer hasnt got the little surplus he hoped to have for buying a new wagon and draining a lowlying field corner you dont accuse him of malversation if he spends what he has on the necessary work of the rest of his farm  a clatter of hoofs was heard and orde looked up with vexation but his brow cleared as a horseman halted under the porch  hellin orde just looked in to ask if you are coming to polo on tuesday we want you badly to help to crumple up the krab bokbar team  orde explained that he had to go out into the district and while the visitor complained that though good men wouldnt play duffers were always keen and that his side would probably be beaten pagett rose to look at his mount a red lathered biloch mare with a curious lyrelike incurving of the ears quite a little thoroughbred in all other respects said the mp and orde presented mr reginald burke manager of the siad and sialkote bank to his friend  yes shes as good as they make em and shes all the female i possess and spoiled in consequence arent you old girl said burke patting the mares glossy neck as she backed and plunged  mr pagett said orde has been asking me about the congress what is your opinion burke turned to the m p with a frank smile  well if its all the same to you sir i should say damn the congress but then im no politician but only a business man  you find it a tiresome subject  yes its all that and worse than that for this kind of agitation is anything but wholesome for the country  how do you mean  it would be a long job to explain and sara here wont stand but you know how sensitive capital is and how timid investors are all this sort of rot is likely to frighten them and we cant afford to frighten them the passengers aboard an ocean steamer dont feel reassured when the ships way is stopped and they hear the workmens hammers tinkering at the engines down below the old arks going on all right as she is and only wants quiet and room to move thems my sentiments and those of some other people who have to do with money and business  then you are a thickandthin supporter of the government as it is  why no the indian government is much too timid with its moneylike an old maiden aunt of minealways in a funk about her investments they dont spend half enough on railways for instance and they are slow in a general way and ought to be made to sit up in all that concerns the encouragement of private enterprise and coaxing out into use the millions of capital that lie dormant in the country  the mare was dancing with impatience and burke was evidently anxious to be off so the men wished him goodbye  who is your genial friend who condemns both congress and government in a breath asked pagett with an amused smile  just now he is reggie burke keener on polo than on anything else but if you go to the sind and sialkote bank tomorrow you would find mr reginald burke a very capable man of business known and liked by an immense constituency north and south of this  do you think he is right about the governments want of enterprise  i should hesitate to say better consult the merchants and chambers of commerce in cawnpore madras bombay and calcutta but though these bodies would like as reggie puts it to make government sit up it is an elementary consideration in governing a country like india which must be administered for the benefit of the people at large that the counsels of those who resort to it for the sake of making money should be judiciously weighed and not allowed to overpower the rest they are welcome guests here as a matter of course but it has been found best to restrain their influence thus the rights of plantation laborers factory operatives and the like have been protected and the capitalist eager to get on has not always regarded government action with favor it is quite conceivable that under an elective system the commercial communities of the great towns might find means to secure majorities on labor questions and on financial matters  they would act at least with intelligence and consideration  intelligence yes but as to consideration who at the present moment most bitterly resents the tender solicitude of lancashire for the welfare and protection of the indian factory operative english and native capitalists running cotton mills and factories  but is the solicitude of lancashire in this matter entirely disinterested  it is no business of mine to say i merely indicate an example of how a powerful commercial interest might hamper a government intent in the first place on the larger interests of humanity  orde broke off to listen a moment theres dr lathrop talking to my wife in the drawingroom said he  surely not thats a ladys voice and if my ears dont deceive me an american  exactly dr eva mccreery lathrop chief of the new womens hospital here and a very good fellow forbye goodmorning doctor he said as a graceful figure came out on the veranda you seem to be in trouble i hope mrs orde was able to help you  your wife is real kind and good i always come to her when im in a fix but i fear its more than comforting i want  you work too hard and wear yourself out said orde kindly let me introduce my friend mr pagett just fresh from home and anxious to learn his india you could tell him something of that more important half of which a mere man knows so little  perhaps i could if id any heart to do it but im in trouble ive lost a case a case that was doing well through nothing in the world but inattention on the part of a nurse i had begun to trust and when i spoke only a small piece of my mind she collapsed in a whining heap on the floor it is hopeless  the men were silent for the blue eyes of the lady doctor were dim recovering herself she looked up with a smile half sad half humorous and i am in a whining heap too but what phase of indian life are you particularly interested in sir  mr pagett intends to study the political aspect of things and the possibility of bestowing electoral institutions on the people  wouldnt it be as much to the purpose to bestow pointlace collars on them they need many things more urgently than votes why its like giving a breadpill for a broken leg  eri dont quite follow said pagett uneasily  well whats the matter with this country is not in the least political but an all round entanglement of physical social and moral evils and corruptions all more or less due to the unnatural treatment of women you cant gather figs from thistles and so long as the system of infant marriage the prohibition of the remarriage of widows the lifelong imprisonment of wives and mothers in a worse than penal confinement and the withholding from them of any kind of education or treatment as rational beings continues the country cant advance a step half of it is morally dead and worse than dead and thats just the half from which we have a right to look for the best impulses its right here where the trouble is and not in any political considerations whatsoever  but do they marry so early said pagett vaguely  the average age is seven but thousands are married still earlier one result is that girls of twelve and thirteen have to bear the burden of wifehood and motherhood and as might be expected the rate of mortality both for mothers and children is terrible pauperism domestic unhappiness and a low state of health are only a few of the consequences of this then when as frequently happens the boyhusband dies prematurely his widow is condemned to worse than death she may not remarry must live a secluded and despised life a life so unnatural that she sometimes prefers suicide more often she goes astray you dont know in england what such words as infantmarriage babywife girlmother and virginwidow mean but they mean unspeakable horrors here  well but the advanced political party here will surely make it their business to advocate social reforms as well as political ones said pagett  very surely they will do no such thing said the lady doctor emphatically i wish i could make you understand why even of the funds devoted to the marchioness of dufferins organization for medical aid to the women of india it was said in print and in speech that they would be better spent on more college scholarships for men and in all the advanced parties talkgod forgive themand in all their programmes they carefully avoid all such subjects they will talk about the protection of the cow for thats an ancient superstitionthey can all understand that but the protection of the women is a new and dangerous idea she turned to pagett impulsively  you are a member of the english parliament can you do nothing the foundations of their life are rottenutterly and bestially rotten i could tell your wife things that i couldnt tell you i know the lifethe inner life that belongs to the native and i know nothing else and believe me you might as well try to grow goldenrod in a mushroompit as to make anything of a people that are born and reared as thesethese thingsre the men talk of their rights and privileges i have seen the women that bear these very men and againmay god forgive the men  pagetts eyes opened with a large wonder dr lathrop rose tempestuously  i must be off to lecture said she and im sorry that i cant show you my hospitals but you had better believe sir that its more necessary for india than all the elections in creation  thats a woman with a mission and no mistake said pagett after a pause  yes she believes in her work and so do i said orde ive a notion that in the end it will be found that the most helpful work done for india in this generation was wrought by lady dufferin in drawing attentionwhat work that was by the way even with her husbands great name to back it to the needs of women here in effect native habits and beliefs are an organized conspiracy against the laws of health and happy lifebut there is some dawning of hope now  how d you account for the general indifference then  i suppose its due in part to their fatalism and their utter indifference to all human suffering how much do you imagine the great province of the punjab with over twenty million people and half a score rich towns has contributed to the maintenance of civil dispensaries last year about seven thousand rupees  thats seven hundred pounds said pagett quickly  i wish it was replied orde but anyway its an absurdly inadequate sum and shows one of the blank sides of oriental character  pagett was silent for a long time the question of direct and personal pain did not lie within his researches he preferred to discuss the weightier matters of the law and contented himself with murmuring theyll do better later on then with a rush returning to his first thought  but my dear orde if its merely a class movement of a local and temporary character how d you account for bradlaugh who is at least a man of sense taking it up  i know nothing of the champion of the new brahmins but what i see in the papers i suppose there is something tempting in being hailed by a large assemblage as the representative of the aspirations of two hundred and fifty millions of people such a man looks through all the roaring and the wreaths and does not reflect that it is a false perspective which as a matter of fact hides the real complex and manifold india from his gaze he can scarcely be expected to distinguish between the ambitions of a new oligarchy and the real wants of the people of whom he knows nothing but its strange that a professed radical should come to be the chosen advocate of a movement which has for its aim the revival of an ancient tyranny shows how even radicalism can fall into academic grooves and miss the essential truths of its own creed believe me pagett to deal with india you want firsthand knowledge and experience i wish he would come and live here for a couple of years or so  is not this rather an ad hominem style of argument  cant help it in a case like this indeed i am not sure you ought not to go further and weigh the whole character and quality and upbringing of the man you must admit that the monumental complacency with which he trotted out his ingenious little constitution for india showed a strange want of imagination and the sense of humor  no i dont quite admit it said pagett  well you know him and i dont but thats how it strikes a stranger he turned on his heel and paced the veranda thoughtfully and after all the burden of the actual daily unromantic toil falls on the shoulders of the men out here and not on his own he enjoys all the privileges of recommendation without responsibility and wewell perhaps when youve seen a little more of india youll understand to begin with our death rates five times higher than yoursi speak now for the brutal bureaucratand we work on the refuse of workedout cities and exhausted civilizations among the bones of the dead  pagett laughed thats an epigrammatic way of putting it orde  is it lets see said the deputy commissioner of amara striding into the sunshine toward a halfnaked gardener potting roses he took the mans hoe and went to a rainscarped bank at the bottom of the garden  come here pagett he said and cut at the sunbaked soil after three strokes there rolled from under the blade of the hoe the half of a clanking skeleton that settled at pagetts feet in an unseemly jumble of bones the mp drew back  our houses are built on cemeteries said orde there are scores of thousands of graves within ten miles  pagett was contemplating the skull with the awed fascination of a man who has but little to do with the dead indias a very curious place said he after a pause  ah youll know all about it in three months come in to lunch said orde
