selected from a series which was first published partially in black and white february to december 1891 and fully in the new york sun during the same period the voyages which supplied the occasion and the material for the work were three in number viz one of seven months june 1888 to january 1889 in the yacht casco from san francisco to the marquesas the paumotus tahiti and thence northward to hawaii a second june to december 1889 in the trading schooner equator from honolulu the hawaiian capital where the author had stayed in the intervening five months to the gilberts and thence to samoa and a third april to september 1890 in the trading steamer janet nicoll which set out from sydney and followed a very devious course extending as far as penrhyn in the eastern to the marshall islands in the western pacific  before setting out on the first of these voyages the author had contracted to write an account of his adventures in the form of letters for serial publication the plan by and by changed in his mind into that of a book partly of travel and partly of research which should combine the results of much careful observation and enquiry upon matters of island history custom belief and tradition with some account of his own experiences and those of his travelling companions under the nominal title of letters he began to compose the chapters of such a book on board the janet nicoll and continued the task during the first ten months of his residence in samoa october 1890 to july 1891 before the serial publication had gone very far he realised that the personal and impersonal elements in his work were not very successfully  combined nor in proportions that contented his readers accordingly he abandoned for the time being the idea of republishing the chapters in book form but when the scheme of the edinburgh edition was maturing he desired that a selection should be made from them and should form one volume of that edition that desire was carried out the same selection is here republished with the addition of a halfsection then omitted describing a visit to the kona coast of hawaii and the lepers port of embarkation for molokai  it must be understood that a considerable portion of the authors voyages above mentioned is not recorded at all in the following pages of one of its most attractive episodes the visit to tahiti no account was written while of his experiences in hawaii only the visit to the kona coast is included several chapters which did not come out to the writers satisfaction have been omitted of the five sections here given each is complete in itself with the exception of part iii the first deals with the marquesas the second with the paumolusthe former a volcanic and mountainous group the latter a low group of atolls or coral islands both in the eastern pacific and both under the protectorate of france the third section is fragmentary and deals as has been said with only one portion of the writers experiences in hawaii the last two describe his residence in the gilberts a remote and littleknown coral group in the western pacific which at the time of his visit was under independent native government but has since been annexed by great britain this is the part of his work with which the author himself was best satisfied and it derives additional interest from describing a state of manners and government which has now passed away       in the south seas    being an account of experiences and observations in the marquesas   paumotus and gilbert islands in the course of two cruises on the   yacht casco 1888 and the schooner equator 1889     part i  the marquesas     in the south seas  chapter i  an island landfall   for nearly ten years my health had been declining and for some while before i set forth upon my voyage i believed i was come to the afterpiece of life and had only the nurse and undertaker to expect it was suggested that i should try the south seas and i was not unwilling to visit like a ghost and be carried like a bale among scenes that had attracted me in youth and health i chartered accordingly dr merrits schooner yacht the casco seventyfour tons register sailed from san francisco towards the end of june 1888 visited the eastern islands and was left early the next year at honolulu hence lacking courage to return to my old life of the house and sickroom i set forth to leeward in a trading schooner the equator of a little over seventy tons spent four months among the atolls low coral islands of the gilbert group and reached samoa towards the close of 89 by that time gratitude and habit were beginning to attach me to the islands i had gained a competency of strength i had made friends i had learned new interests the time of my voyages had passed like days in fairyland and i decided to remain i began to prepare these pages at sea on a third cruise in the trading steamer janet nicoll if more days are granted me they shall be passed where i have found life most pleasant and man most interesting the axes of my black boys are already clearing the foundations of my future house and i must learn to address readers from the uttermost parts of the sea  that i should thus have reversed the verdict of lord tennysons hero is less eccentric than appears few men who come to the islands leave them they grow grey where they alighted the palm shades and the tradewind fans them till they die perhaps cherishing to the last the fancy of a visit home which is rarely made more rarely enjoyed and yet more rarely repeated no part of the world exerts the same attractive power upon the visitor and the task before me is to communicate to fireside travellers some sense of its seduction and to describe the life at sea and ashore of many hundred thousand persons some of our own blood and language all our contemporaries and yet as remote in thought and habit as rob roy or barbarossa the apostles or the cæsars  the first experience can never be repeated the first love the first sunrise the first south sea island are memories apart and touched a virginity of sense on the 28th of july 1888 the moon was an hour down by four in the morning in the east a radiating centre of brightness told of the day and beneath on the skyline the morning bank was already building black as ink we have all read of the swiftness of the days coming and departure in low latitudes it is a point on which the scientific and sentimental tourist are at one and has inspired some tasteful poetry the period certainly varies with the season but here is one case exactly noted although the dawn was thus preparing by four the sun was not up till six and it was halfpast five before we could distinguish our expected islands from the clouds on the horizon eight degrees south and the day two hours acoming the interval was passed on deck in the silence of expectation the customary thrill of landfall heightened by the strangeness of the shores that we were then approaching slowly they took shape in the attenuating darkness uahuna piling up to a truncated summit appeared the first upon the starboard bow almost abeam arose our destination nukahiva whelmed in cloud and betwixt and to the southward the first rays of the sun displayed the needles of uapu these pricked about the line of the horizon like the pinnacles of some ornate and monstrous church they stood there in the sparkling brightness of the morning the fit signboard of a world of wonders  not one soul aboard the casco had set foot upon the islands or knew except by accident one word of any of the island tongues and it was with something perhaps of the same anxious pleasure as thrilled the bosom of discoverers that we drew near these problematic shores the land heaved up in peaks and rising vales it fell in cliffs and buttresses its colour ran through fifty modulations in a scale of pearl and rose and olive and it was crowned above by opalescent clouds the suffusion of vague hues deceived the eye the shadows of clouds were confounded with the articulations of the mountain and the isle and its unsubstantial canopy rose and shimmered before us like a single mass there was no beacon no smoke of towns to be expected no plying pilot somewhere in that pale phantasmagoria of cliff and cloud our haven lay concealed and somewhere to the east of itthe only seamark givena certain headland known indifferently as cape adam and eve or cape jack and jane and distinguished by two colossal figures the gross statuary of nature these we were to find for these we craned and stared focussed glasses and wrangled over charts and the sun was overhead and the land close ahead before we found them to a ship approaching like the casco from the north they proved indeed the least conspicuous features of a striking coast the surf flying high above its base strange austere and feathered mountains rising behind and jack and jane or adam and eve impending like a pair of warts above the breakers  thence we bore away along shore on our port beam we might hear the explosions of the surf a few birds flew fishing under the prow there was no other sound or mark of life whether of man or beast in all that quarter of the island winged by her own impetus and the dying breeze the casco skimmed under cliffs opened out a cove showed us a beach and some green trees and flitted by again bowing to the swell the trees from our distance might have been hazel the beach might have been in europe the mountain forms behind modelled in little from the alps and the forest which clustered on their ramparts a growth no more considerable than our scottish heath again the cliff yawned but now with a deeper entry and the casco hauling her wind began to slide into the bay of anaho the cocopalm that giraffe of vegetables so graceful so ungainly to the european eye so foreign was to be seen crowding on the beach and climbing and fringing the steep sides of mountains rude and bare hills embraced the inlet upon either hand it was enclosed to the landward by a bulk of shattered mountains in every crevice of that barrier the forest harboured roosting and nesting there like birds about a ruin and far above it greened and roughened the razor edges of the summit  under the eastern shore our schooner now bereft of any breeze continued to creep in the smart creature when once under way appearing motive in herself from close aboard arose the bleating of young lambs a bird sang in the hillside the scent of the land and of a hundred fruits or flowers flowed forth to meet us and presently a house or two appeared standing high upon the ankles of the hills and one of these surrounded with what seemed a garden these conspicuous habitations that patch of culture had we but known it were a mark of the passage of whites and we might have approached a hundred islands and not found their parallel it was longer ere we spied the native village standing in the universal fashion close upon a curve of beach close under a grove of palms the sea in front growling and whitening on a concave arc of reef for the cocotree and the island man are both lovers and neighbours of the surf the coral waxes the palm grows but man departs says the sad tahitian proverb but they are all three so long as they endure cohaunters of the beach the mark of anchorage was a blowhole in the rocks near the southeasterly corner of the bay punctually to our use the blowhole spouted the schooner turned upon her heel the anchor plunged it was a small sound a great event my soul went down with these moorings whence no windlass may extract nor any diver fish it up and i and some part of my ships company were from that hour the bondslaves of the isles of vivien  before yet the anchor plunged a canoe was already paddling from the hamlet it contained two men one white one brown and tattooed across the face with bands of blue both in immaculate white european clothes the resident trader mr regler and the native chief taipikikino captain is it permitted to come on board were the first words we heard among the islands canoe followed canoe till the ship swarmed with stalwart sixfoot men in every stage of undress some in a shirt some in a loincloth one in a handkerchief imperfectly adjusted some and these the more considerable tattooed from head to foot in awful patterns some barbarous and knived one who sticks in my memory as something bestial squatting on his hams in a canoe sucking an orange and spitting it out again to alternate sides with apelike vivacityall talking and we could not understand one word all trying to trade with us who had no thought of trading or offering us island curios at prices palpably absurd there was no word of welcome no show of civility no hand extended save that of the chief and mr regler as we still continued to refuse the proffered articles complaint ran high and rude and one the jester of the party railed upon our meanness amid jeering laughter amongst other angry pleasantrieshere is a mighty fine ship said he to have no money on board i own i was inspired with sensible repugnance even with alarm the ship was manifestly in their power we had women on board i knew nothing of my guests beyond the fact that they were cannibals the directory my only guide was full of timid cautions and as for the trader whose presence might else have reassured me were not whites in the pacific the usual instigators and accomplices of native outrage when he reads this confession our kind friend mr regler can afford to smile  later in the day as i sat writing up my journal the cabin was filled from end to end with marquesans three brownskinned generations squatted crosslegged upon the floor and regarding me in silence with embarrassing eyes the eyes of all polynesians are large luminous and melting they are like the eyes of animals and some italians a kind of despair came over me to sit there helpless under all these staring orbs and be thus blocked in a corner of my cabin by this speechless crowd and a kind of rage to think they were beyond the reach of articulate communication like furred animals or folk born deaf or the dwellers of some alien planet  to cross the channel is for a boy of twelve to change heavens to cross the atlantic for a man of twentyfour is hardly to modify his diet but i was now escaped out of the shadow of the roman empire under whose toppling monuments we were all cradled whose laws and letters are on every hand of us constraining and preventing i was now to see what men might be whose fathers had never studied virgil had never been conquered by cæsar and never been ruled by the wisdom of gaius or papinian by the same step i had journeyed forth out of that comfortable zone of kindred languages where the curse of babel is so easy to be remedied and my new fellowcreatures sat before me dumb like images methought in my travels all human relation was to be excluded and when i returned home for in those days i still projected my return i should have but dipped into a picturebook without a text nay and i even questioned if my travels should be much prolonged perhaps they were destined to a speedy end perhaps my subsequent friend kauanui whom i remarked there sitting silent with the rest for a man of some authority might leap from his hams with an earsplitting signal the ship be carried at a rush and the ships company butchered for the table  there could be nothing more natural than these apprehensions nor anything more groundless in my experience of the islands i had never again so menacing a reception were i to meet with such today i should be more alarmed and tenfold more surprised the majority of polynesians are easy folk to get in touch with frank fond of notice greedy of the least affection like amiable fawning dogs and even with the marquesans so recently and so imperfectly redeemed from a bloodboltered barbarism all were to become our intimates and one at least was to mourn sincerely our departure     chapter ii  making friends   the impediment of tongues was one that i particularly overestimated the languages of polynesia are easy to smatter though hard to speak with elegance and they are extremely similar so that a person who has a tincture of one or two may risk not without hope an attempt upon the others  and again not only is polynesian easy to smatter but interpreters abound missionaries traders and broken white folk living on the bounty of the natives are to be found in almost every isle and hamlet and even where these are unserviceable the natives themselves have often scraped up a little english and in the french zone though far less commonly a little frenchenglish or an efficient pidgin what is called to the westward beachlamar comes easy to the polynesian it is now taught besides in the schools of hawaii and from the multiplicity of british ships and the nearness of the states on the one hand and the colonies on the other it may be called and will almost certainly become the tongue of the pacific  i will instance a few examples i met in majuro a marshall island boy who spoke excellent english this he had learned in the german firm in jaluit yet did not speak one word of german i heard from a gendarme who had taught school in rapaiti that while the children had the utmost difficulty or reluctance to learn french they picked up english on the wayside and as if by accident on one of the most outoftheway atolls in the carolines my friend mr benjamin hird was amazed to find the lads playing cricket on the beach and talking english and it was in english that the crew of the janet nicoll a set of black boys from different melanesian islands communicated with other natives throughout the cruise transmitted orders and sometimes jested together on the forehatch but what struck me perhaps most of all was a word i heard on the verandah of the tribunal at noumea a case had just been hearda trial for infanticide against an apelike native woman and the audience were smoking cigarettes as they awaited the verdict an anxious amiable french lady not far from tears was eager for acquittal and declared she would engage the prisoner to be her childrens nurse the bystanders exclaimed at the proposal the woman was a savage said they and spoke no language mais vous savez objected the fair sentimentalist ils apprennent si vite langlais  but to be able to speak to people is not all and in the first stage of my relations with natives i was helped by two things to begin with i was the showman of the casco she her fine lines tall spars and snowy decks the crimson fittings of the saloon and the white the gilt and the repeating mirrors of the tiny cabin brought us a hundred visitors the men fathomed out her dimensions with their arms as their fathers fathomed out the ships of cook the women declared the cabins more lovely than a church bouncing junos were never weary of sitting in the chairs and contemplating in the glass their own bland images and i have seen one lady strip up her dress and with cries of wonder and delight rub herself barebreeched upon the velvet cushions  biscuit jam and syrup was the entertainment and as in european parlours the photograph album went the round this sober gallery their everyday costumes and physiognomies had been transformed in three weeks sailing into things wonderful and rich and foreign alien faces barbaric dresses they were now beheld and fingered in the swerving cabin with innocent excitement and surprise her majesty was often recognised and i have seen french subjects kiss her photograph captain speedyin an abyssinian wardress supposed to be the uniform of the british armymet with much acceptance and the effigies of mr andrew lang were admired in the marquesas there is the place for him to go when he shall be weary of middlesex and homer  it was perhaps yet more important that i had enjoyed in my youth some knowledge of our scots folk of the highlands and the islands not much beyond a century has passed since these were in the same convulsive and transitionary state as the marquesans of today in both cases an alien authority enforced the clans disarmed the chiefs deposed new customs introduced and chiefly that fashion of regarding money as the means and object of existence the commercial age in each succeeding at a bound to an age of war abroad and patriarchal communism at home in one the cherished practice of tattooing in the other a cherished costume proscribed in each a main luxury cut off beef driven under cloud of night from lowland pastures denied to the meatloving highlander longpig pirated from the next village to the maneating kanaka the grumbling the secret ferment the fears and resentments the alarms and sudden councils of marquesan chiefs reminded me continually of the days of lovat and struan hospitality tact natural fine manners and a touchy punctilio are common to both races common to both tongues the trick of dropping medial consonants  here is a table of two widespread polynesian words                    house      love1    tahitian        fare        aroha   new zealand     whare   samoan          fale        talofa   manihiki        fale        aloha   hawaiian        hale        aloha   marquesan       hae        kaoha  the elision of medial consonants so marked in these marquesan instances is no less common both in gaelic and the lowland scots stranger still that prevalent polynesian sound the socalled catch written with an apostrophe and often or always the gravestone of a perished consonant is to be heard in scotland to this day when a scot pronounces water better or bottlewaer beer or bolethe sound is precisely that of the catch and i think we may go beyond and say that if such a population could be isolated and this mispronunciation should become the rule it might prove the first stage of transition from t to k which is the disease of polynesian languages the tendency of the marquesans however is to urge against consonants or at least on the very common letter l a war of mere extermination a hiatus is agreeable to any polynesian ear the ear even of the stranger soon grows used to these barbaric voids but only in the marquesan will you find such names as haaii and paaaeua when each individual vowel must be separately uttered  these points of similarity between a south sea people and some of my own folk at home ran much in my head in the islands and not only inclined me to view my fresh acquaintances with favour but continually modified my judgment a polite englishman comes today to the marquesans and is amazed to find the men tattooed polite italians came not long ago to england and found our fathers stained with woad and when i paid the return visit as a little boy i was highly diverted with the backwardness of italy so insecure so much a matter of the day and hour is the preeminence of race it was so that i hit upon a means of communication which i recommend to travellers when i desired any detail of savage custom or of superstitious belief i cast back in the story of my fathers and fished for what i wanted with some trait of equal barbarism michael scott lord derwentwaters head the secondsight the water kelpieeach of these i have found to be a killing bait the black bulls head of stirling procured me the legend of rahero and what i knew of the cluny macphersons or the appin stewarts enabled me to learn and helped me to understand about the tevas of tahiti the native was no longer ashamed his sense of kinship grew warmer and his lips were opened it is this sense of kinship that the traveller must rouse and share or he had better content himself with travels from the blue bed to the brown and the presence of one cockney titterer will cause a whole party to walk in clouds of darkness  the hamlet of anaho stands on a margin of flat land between the west of the beach and the spring of the impending mountains a grove of palms perpetually ruffling its green fans carpets it as for a triumph with fallen branches and shades it like an arbour a road runs from end to end of the covert among beds of flowers the milliners shop of the community and here and there in the grateful twilight in an air filled with a diversity of scents and still within hearing of the surf upon the reef the native houses stand in scattered neighbourhood the same word as we have seen represents in many tongues of polynesia with scarce a shade of difference the abode of man but although the word be the same the structure itself continually varies and the marquesan among the most backward and barbarous of islanders is yet the most commodiously lodged the grass huts of hawaii the birdcage houses of tahiti or the open shed with the crazy venetian blinds of the polite samoannone of these can be compared with the marquesan paepaehae or dwelling platform the paepae is an oblong terrace built without cement of black volcanic stone from twenty to fifty feet in length raised from four to eight feet from the earth and accessible by a broad stair along the back of this and coming to about half its width runs the open front of the house like a covered gallery the interior sometimes neat and almost elegant in its bareness the sleeping space divided off by an endlong coaming some bright raiment perhaps hanging from a nail and a lamp and one of whites sewingmachines the only marks of civilisation on the outside at one end of the terrace burns the cookingfire under a shed at the other there is perhaps a pen for pigs the remainder is the evening lounge and al fresco banquethall of the inhabitants to some houses water is brought down the mountain in bamboo pipes perforated for the sake of sweetness with the highland comparison in my mind i was struck to remember the sluttish mounds of turf and stone in which i have sat and been entertained in the hebrides and the north islands two things i suppose explain the contrast in scotland wood is rare and with materials so rude as turf and stone the very hope of neatness is excluded and in scotland it is cold shelter and a hearth are needs so pressing that a man looks not beyond he is out all day after a bare bellyful and at night when he saith aha it is warm he has not appetite for more or if for something else then something higher a fine school of poetry and song arose in these rough shelters and an air like lochaber no more is an evidence of refinement more convincing as well as more imperishable than a palace  to one such dwelling platform a considerable troop of relatives and dependants resort in the hour of the dusk when the fire blazes and the scent of the cooked breadfruit fills the air and perhaps the lamp glints already between the pillars of the house you shall behold them silently assemble to this meal men women and children and the dogs and pigs frisk together up the terrace stairway switching rival tails the strangers from the ship were soon equally welcome welcome to dip their fingers in the wooden dish to drink cocoanuts to share the circulating pipe and to hear and hold high debate about the misdeeds of the french the panama canal or the geographical position of san francisco and new yoko in a highland hamlet quite out of reach of any tourist i have met the same plain and dignified hospitality  i have mentioned two factsthe distasteful behaviour of our earliest visitors and the case of the lady who rubbed herself upon the cushionswhich would give a very false opinion of marquesan manners the great majority of polynesians are excellently mannered but the marquesan stands apart annoying and attractive wild shy and refined if you make him a present he affects to forget it and it must be offered him again at his going a pretty formality i have found nowhere else a hint will get rid of any one or any number they are so fiercely proud and modest while many of the more lovable but blunter islanders crowd upon a stranger and can be no more driven off than flies a slight or an insult the marquesan seems never to forget i was one day talking by the wayside with my friend hoka when i perceived his eyes suddenly to flash and his stature to swell a white horseman was coming down the mountain and as he passed and while he paused to exchange salutations with myself hoka was still staring and ruffling like a gamecock it was a corsican who had years before called him cochon sauvagecoçon chauvage as hoka mispronounced it with people so nice and so touchy it was scarce to be supposed that our company of greenhorns should not blunder into offences hoka on one of his visits fell suddenly in a brooding silence and presently after left the ship with cold formality when he took me back into favour he adroitly and pointedly explained the nature of my offence i had asked him to sell cocoanuts and in hokas view articles of food were things that a gentleman should give not sell or at least that he should not sell to any friend on another occasion i gave my boats crew a luncheon of chocolate and biscuits i had sinned i could never learn how against some point of observance and though i was drily thanked my offerings were left upon the beach but our worst mistake was a slight we put on toma hokas adoptive father and in his own eyes the rightful chief of anaho in the first place we did not call upon him as perhaps we should in his fine new european house the only one in the hamlet in the second when we came ashore upon a visit to his rival taipikikino it was toma whom we saw standing at the head of the beach a magnificent figure of a man magnificently tattooed and it was of toma that we asked our question where is the chief what chief cried toma and turned his back on the blasphemers nor did he forgive us hoka came and went with us daily but alone i believe of all the countryside neither toma nor his wife set foot on board the casco the temptation resisted it is hard for a european to compute the flying city of laputa moored for a fortnight in st jamess park affords but a pale figure of the casco anchored before anaho for the londoner has still his change of pleasures but the marquesan passes to his grave through an unbroken uniformity of days  on the afternoon before it was intended we should sail a valedictory party came on board nine of our particular friends equipped with gifts and dressed as for a festival hoka the chief dancer and singer the greatest dandy of anaho and one of the handsomest young fellows in the worldsullen showy dramatic light as a feather and strong as an oxit would have been hard on that occasion to recognise as he sat there stooped and silent his face heavy and grey it was strange to see the lad so much affected stranger still to recognise in his last gift one of the curios we had refused on the first day and to know our friend so gaily dressed so plainly moved at our departure for one of the halfnaked crew that had besieged and insulted us on our arrival strangest of all perhaps to find in that carved handle of a fan the last of those curiosities of the first day which had now all been given to us by their possessorstheir chief merchandise for which they had sought to ransom us as long as we were strangers which they pressed on us for nothing as soon as we were friends the last visit was not long protracted one after another they shook hands and got down into their canoe when hoka turned his back immediately upon the ship so that we saw his face no more taipi on the other hand remained standing and facing us with gracious valedictory gestures and when captain otis dipped the ensign the whole party saluted with their hats this was the farewell the episode of our visit to anaho was held concluded and though the casco remained nearly forty hours at her moorings not one returned on board and i am inclined to think they avoided appearing on the beach this reserve and dignity is the finest trait of the marquesan   footnote    1 where that word is used as a salutation i give that form     chapter iii  the maroon   of the beauties of anaho books might be written i remember waking about three to find the air temperate and scented the long swell brimmed into the bay and seemed to fill it full and then subside gently deeply and silently the casco rolled only at times a block piped like a bird oceanward the heaven was bright with stars and the sea with their reflections if i looked to that side i might have sung with the hawaiian poet    ua maomao ka lani ua kahaea luna   ua pipi ka maka o ka hoku   the heavens were fair they stretched above   many were the eyes of the stars  and then i turned shoreward and high squalls were overhead the mountains loomed up black and i could have fancied i had slipped ten thousand miles away and was anchored in a highland loch that when the day came it would show pine and heather and green fern and roofs of turf sending up the smoke of peats and the alien speech that should next greet my ears must be gaelic not kanaka  and day when it came brought other sights and thoughts i have watched the morning break in many quarters of the worldit has been certainly one of the chief joys of my existence and the dawn that i saw with most emotion shone upon the bay of anaho the mountains abruptly overhang the port with every variety of surface and of inclination lawn and cliff and forest not one of these but wore its proper tint of saffron of sulphur of the clove and of the rose the lustre was like that of satin on the lighter hues there seemed to float an efflorescence a solemn bloom appeared on the more dark the light itself was the ordinary light of morning colourless and clean and on this ground of jewels pencilled out the least detail of drawing meanwhile around the hamlet under the palms where the blue shadow lingered the red coals of cocoa husk and the light trails of smoke betrayed the awakening business of the day along the beach men and women lads and lasses were returning from the bath in bright raiment red and blue and green such as we delighted to see in the coloured little pictures of our childhood and presently the sun had cleared the eastern hill and the glow of the day was over all  the glow continued and increased the business from the main part ceased before it had begun twice in the day there was a certain stir of shepherding along the seaward hills at times a canoe went out to fish at times a woman or two languidly filled a basket in the cotton patch at times a pipe would sound out of the shadow of a house ringing the changes on its three notes with an effect like que le jour me dure repeated endlessly or at times across a corner of the bay two natives might communicate in the marquesan manner with conventional whistlings all else was sleep and silence the surf broke and shone around the shores a species of black crane fished in the broken water the black pigs were continually galloping by on some affair but the people might never have awaked or they might all be dead  my favourite haunt was opposite the hamlet where was a landing in a cove under a lianaed cliff the beach was lined with palms and a tree called the purao something between the fig and mulberry in growth and bearing a flower like a great yellow poppy with a maroon heart in places rocks encroached upon the sand the beach would be all submerged and the surf would bubble warmly as high as to my knees and play with cocoanut husks as our more homely ocean plays with wreck and wrack and bottles as the reflux drew down marvels of colour and design streamed between my feet which i would grasp at miss or seize now to find them what they promised shells to grace a cabinet or be set in gold upon a ladys finger now to catch only maya of coloured sand pounded fragments and pebbles that as soon as they were dry became as dull and homely as the flints upon a garden path i have toiled at this childish pleasure for hours in the strong sun conscious of my incurable ignorance but too keenly pleased to be ashamed meanwhile the blackbird or his tropical understudy would be fluting in the thickets overhead  a little further in the turn of the bay a streamlet trickled in the bottom of a den thence spilling down a stair of rock into the sea the draught of air drew down under the foliage in the very bottom of the den which was a perfect arbour for coolness in front it stood open on the blue bay and the casco lying there under her awning and her cheerful colours overhead was a thatch of puraos and over these again palms brandished their bright fans as i have seen a conjurer make himself a halo out of naked swords for in this spot over a neck of low land at the foot of the mountains the tradewind streams into anaho bay in a flood of almost constant volume and velocity and of a heavenly coolness  it chanced one day that i was ashore in the cove with mrs stevenson and the ships cook except for the casco lying outside and a crane or two and the everbusy wind and sea the face of the world was of a prehistoric emptiness life appeared to stand stockstill and the sense of isolation was profound and refreshing on a sudden the trade wind coming in a gust over the isthmus struck and scattered the fans of the palms above the den and behold in two of the tops there sat a native motionless as an idol and watching us you would have said without a wink the next moment the tree closed and the glimpse was gone this discovery of human presences latent overhead in a place where we had supposed ourselves alone the immobility of our treetop spies and the thought that perhaps at all hours we were similarly supervised struck us with a chill talk languished on the beach as for the cook whose conscience was not clear he never afterwards set foot on shore and twice when the casco appeared to be driving on the rocks it was amusing to observe that mans alacrity death he was persuaded awaiting him upon the beach it was more than a year later in the gilberts that the explanation dawned upon myself the natives were drawing palmtree wine a thing forbidden by law and when the wind thus suddenly revealed them they were doubtless more troubled than ourselves  at the top of the den there dwelt an old melancholy grizzled man of the name of tari charlie coffin he was a native of oahu in the sandwich islands and had gone to sea in his youth in the american whalers a circumstance to which he owed his name his english his downeast twang and the misfortune of his innocent life for one captain sailing out of new bedford carried him to nukahiva and marooned him there among the cannibals the motive for this act was inconceivably small poor taris wages which were thus economised would scarce have shook the credit of the new bedford owners and the act itself was simply murder taris life must have hung in the beginning by a hair in the grief and terror of that time it is not unlikely he went mad an infirmity to which he was still liable or perhaps a child may have taken a fancy to him and ordained him to be spared he escaped at least alive married in the island and when i knew him was a widower with a married son and a granddaughter but the thought of oahu haunted him its praise was for ever on his lips he beheld it looking back as a place of ceaseless feasting song and dance and in his dreams i dare say he revisits it with joy i wonder what he would think if he could be carried there indeed and see the modern town of honolulu brisk with traffic and the palace with its guards and the great hotel and mr bergers band with their uniforms and outlandish instruments or what he would think to see the brown faces grown so few and the white so many and his fathers land sold for planting sugar and his fathers house quite perished or perhaps the last of them struck leprous and immured between the surf and the cliffs on molokai so simply even in south sea islands and so sadly the changes come  tari was poor and poorly lodged his house was a wooden frame run up by europeans it was indeed his official residence for tari was the shepherd of the promontory sheep i can give a perfect inventory of its contents three kegs a tin biscuitbox an iron saucepan several cocoashell cups a lantern and three bottles probably containing oil while the clothes of the family and a few mats were thrown across the open rafters upon my first meeting with this exile he had conceived for me one of the baseless island friendships had given me nuts to drink and carried me up the den to see my housethe only entertainment that he had to offer he liked the amelican he said and the inglisman but the flessman was his abhorrence and he was careful to explain that if he had thought us fless we should have had none of his nuts and never a sight of his house his distaste for the french i can partly understand but not at all his toleration of the anglosaxon the next day he brought me a pig and some days later one of our party going ashore found him in act to bring a second we were still strange to the islands we were pained by the poor mans generosity which he could ill afford and by a natural enough but quite unpardonable blunder we refused the pig had tari been a marquesan we should have seen him no more being what he was the most mild longsuffering melancholy man he took a revenge a hundred times more painful scarce had the canoe with the nine villagers put off from their farewell before the casco was boarded from the other side it was tari coming thus late because he had no canoe of his own and had found it hard to borrow one coming thus solitary as indeed we always saw him because he was a stranger in the land and the dreariest of company the rest of my family basely fled from the encounter i must receive our injured friend alone and the interview must have lasted hard upon an hour for he was loath to tear himself away you go way i see you no moreno sir he lamented and then looking about him with rueful admiration this goodee shipno sirgoodee ship he would exclaim the no sir thrown out sharply through the nose upon a rising inflection an echo from new bedford and the fallacious whaler from these expressions of grief and praise he would return continually to the case of the rejected pig i like give plesent all e same you he complained only got pig you no take him he was a poor man he had no choice of gifts he had only a pig he repeated and i had refused it i have rarely been more wretched than to see him sitting there so old so grey so poor so hardly fortuned of so rueful a countenance and to appreciate with growing keenness the affront which i had so innocently dealt him but it was one of those cases in which speech is vain  taris son was smiling and inert his daughterinlaw a girl of sixteen pretty gentle and grave more intelligent than most anahowomen and with a fair share of french his grandchild a mite of a creature at the breast i went up the den one day when tari was from home and found the son making a cotton sack and madame suckling mademoiselle when i had sat down with them on the floor the girl began to question me about england which i tried to describe piling the pan and the cocoa shells one upon another to represent the houses and explaining as best i was able and by word and gesture the overpopulation the hunger and the perpetual toil pas de cocotiers pas de popoi she asked i told her it was too cold and went through an elaborate performance shutting out draughts and crouching over an imaginary fire to make sure she understood but she understood right well remarked it must be bad for the health and sat a while gravely reflecting on that picture of unwonted sorrows i am sure it roused her pity for it struck in her another thought always uppermost in the marquesan bosom and she began with a smiling sadness and looking on me out of melancholy eyes to lament the decease of her own people ici pas de kanaques said she and taking the baby from her breast she held it out to me with both her hands teneza little baby like this then dead all the kanaques die then no more the smile and this instancing by the girlmother of her own tiny flesh and blood affected me strangely they spoke of so tranquil a despair meanwhile the husband smilingly made his sack and the unconscious babe struggled to reach a pot of raspberry jam friendships offering which i had just brought up the den and in a perspective of centuries i saw their case as ours death coming in like a tide and the day already numbered when there should be no more beretani and no more of any race whatever and what oddly touched me no more literary works and no more readers     chapter iv  death   the thought of death i have said is uppermost in the mind of the marquesan it would be strange if it were otherwise the race is perhaps the handsomest extant six feet is about the middle height of males they are strongly muscled free from fat swift in action graceful in repose and the women though fatter and duller are still comely animals to judge by the eye there is no race more viable and yet death reaps them with both hands when bishop dordillon first came to taiohae he reckoned the inhabitants at many thousands he was but newly dead and in the same bay stanislao moanatini counted on his fingers eight residual natives or take the valley of hapaa known to readers of herman melville under the grotesque misspelling of hapar there are but two writers who have touched the south seas with any genius both americans melville and charles warren stoddard and at the christening of the first and greatest some influential fairy must have been neglected he shall be able to see he shall be able to tell he shall be able to charm said the friendly godmothers but he shall not be able to hear exclaimed the last the tribe of hapaa is said to have numbered some four hundred when the smallpox came and reduced them by one fourth six months later a woman developed tubercular consumption the disease spread like a fire about the valley and in less than a year two survivors a man and a woman fled from that newcreated solitude a similar adam and eve may some day wither among new races the tragic residue of britain when i first heard this story the date staggered me but i am now inclined to think it possible early in the year of my visit for example or late the year before a first case of phthisis appeared in a household of seventeen persons and by the month of august when the tale was told me one soul survived and that was a boy who had been absent at his schooling and depopulation works both ways the doors of death being set wide open and the door of birth almost closed thus in the halfyear ending july 1888 there were twelve deaths and but one birth in the district of the hatiheu seven or eight more deaths were to be looked for in the ordinary course and m aussel the observant gendarme knew of but one likely birth at this rate it is no matter of surprise if the population in that part should have declined in forty years from six thousand to less than four hundred which are once more on the authority of m aussel the estimated figures and the rate of decline must have even accelerated towards the end  a good way to appreciate the depopulation is to go by land from anaho to hatiheu on the adjacent bay the road is good travelling but cruelly steep we seemed scarce to have passed the deserted house which stands highest in anaho before we were looking dizzily down upon its roof the casco well out in the bay and rolling for a wager shrank visibly and presently through the gap of taris isthmus uahuna was seen to hang cloudlike on the horizon over the summit where the wind blew really chill and whistled in the reedlike grass and tossed the grassy fell of the pandanus we stepped suddenly as through a door into the next vale and bay of hatiheu a bowl of mountains encloses it upon three sides on the fourth this rampart has been bombarded into ruins runs down to seaward in imminent and shattered crags and presents the one practicable breach of the blue bay the interior of this vessel is crowded with lovely and valuable treesorange breadfruit mummyapple coco the island chestnut and for weeds the pine and the banana four perennial streams water and keep it green and along the dell first of one then of another of these the road for a considerable distance descends into this fortunate valley the song of the waters and the familiar disarray of boulders gave us a strong sense of home which the exotic foliage the daftlike growth of the pandanus the buttressed trunk of the banyan the black pigs galloping in the bush and the architecture of the native houses dissipated ere it could be enjoyed  the houses on the hatiheu side begin high up higher yet the more melancholy spectacle of empty paepaes when a native habitation is deserted the superstructurepandanus thatch wattle unstable tropical timberspeedily rots and is speedily scattered by the wind only the stones of the terrace endure nor can any ruin cairn or standing stone or vitrified fort present a more stern appearance of antiquity we must have passed from six to eight of these now houseless platforms on the main road of the island where it crosses the valley of taipi mr osbourne tells me they are to be reckoned by the dozen and as the roads have been made long posterior to their erection perhaps to their desertion and must simply be regarded as lines drawn at random through the bush the forest on either hand must be equally filled with these survivals the gravestones of whole families such ruins are tapu2 in the strictest sense no native must approach them they have become outposts of the kingdom of the grave it might appear a natural and pious custom in the hundreds who are left the rearguard of perished thousands that their feet should leave untrod these hearthstones of their fathers i believe in fact the custom rests on different and more grim conceptions but the house the grave and even the body of the dead have been always particularly honoured by marquesans until recently the corpse was sometimes kept in the family and daily oiled and sunned until by gradual and revolting stages it dried into a kind of mummy offerings are still laid upon the grave in traitors bay mr osbourne saw a man buy a lookingglass to lay upon his sons and the sentiment against the desecration of tombs thoughtlessly ruffled in the laying down of the new roads is a chief ingredient in the native hatred for the french  the marquesan beholds with dismay the approaching extinction of his race the thought of death sits down with him to meat and rises with him from his bed he lives and breathes under a shadow of mortality awful to support and he is so inured to the apprehension that he greets the reality with relief he does not even seek to support a disappointment at an affront at a breach of one of his fleeting and communistic loveaffairs he seeks an instant refuge in the grave hanging is now the fashion i heard of three who had hanged themselves in the west end of hivaoa during the first half of 1888 but though this be a common form of suicide in other parts of the south seas i cannot think it will continue popular in the marquesas far more suitable to marquesan sentiment is the old form of poisoning with the fruit of the eva which offers to the native suicide a cruel but deliberate death and gives time for those decencies of the last hour to which he attaches such remarkable importance the coffin can thus be at hand the pigs killed the cry of the mourners sounding already through the house and then it is and not before that the marquesan is conscious of achievement his life all rounded in his robes like cæsars adjusted for the final act praise not any man till he is dead said the ancients envy not any man till you hear the mourners might be the marquesan parody the coffin though of late introduction strangely engages their attention it is to the mature marquesan what a watch is to the european schoolboy for ten years queen vaekehu had dunned the fathers at last but the other day they let her have her will gave her her coffin and the womans soul is at rest i was told a droll instance of the force of this preoccupation the polynesians are subject to a disease seemingly rather of the will than of the body i was told the tahitians have a word for it erimatua but cannot find it in my dictionary a gendarme m nouveau has seen men beginning to succumb to this insubstantial malady has routed them from their houses turned them on to do their trick upon the roads and in two days has seen them cured but this other remedy is more original a marquesan dying of this discouragementperhaps i should rather say this acquiescencehas been known at the fulfilment of his crowning wish on the mere sight of that desired hermitage his coffinto revive recover shake off the hand of death and be restored for years to his occupationscarving tikis idols let us say or braiding old mens beards from all this it may be conceived how easily they meet death when it approaches naturally i heard one example grim and picturesque in the time of the smallpox in hapaa an old man was seized with the disease he had no thought of recovery had his grave dug by a wayside and lived in it for near a fortnight eating drinking and smoking with the passersby talking mostly of his end and equally unconcerned for himself and careless of the friends whom he infected  this proneness to suicide and loose seat in life is not peculiar to the marquesan what is peculiar is the widespread depression and acceptance of the national end pleasures are neglected the dance languishes the songs are forgotten it is true that some and perhaps too many of them are proscribed but many remain if there were spirit to support or to revive them at the last feast of the bastille stanislao moanatini shed tears when he beheld the inanimate performance of the dancers when the people sang for us in anaho they must apologise for the smallness of their repertory they were only young folk present they said and it was only the old that knew the songs the whole body of marquesan poetry and music was being suffered to die out with a single dispirited generation the full import is apparent only to one acquainted with other polynesian races who knows how the samoan coins a fresh song for every trifling incident or who has heard on penrhyn for instance a band of little stripling maids from eight to twelve keep up their minstrelsy for hours upon a stretch one song following another without pause in like manner the marquesan never industrious begins now to cease altogether from production the exports of the group decline out of all proportion even with the deathrate of the islanders the coral waxes the palm grows and man departs says the marquesan and he folds his hands and surely this is nature fond as it may appear we labour and refrain not for the reward of any single life but with a timid eye upon the lives and memories of our successors and where no one is to succeed of his own family or his own tongue i doubt whether rothschilds would make money or cato practise virtue it is natural also that a temporary stimulus should sometimes rouse the marquesan from his lethargy over all the landward shore of anaho cotton runs like a wild weed man or woman whoever comes to pick it may earn a dollar in the day yet when we arrived the traders storehouse was entirely empty and before we left it was nearly full so long as the circus was there so long as the casco was yet anchored in the bay it behoved every one to make his visit and to this end every woman must have a new dress and every man a shirt and trousers never before in mr reglers experience had they displayed so much activity  in their despondency there is an element of dread the fear of ghosts and of the dark is very deeply written in the mind of the polynesian not least of the marquesan poor taipi the chief of anaho was condemned to ride to hatiheu on a moonless night he borrowed a lantern sat a long while nerving himself for the adventure and when he at last departed wrung the cascos by the hand as for a final separation certain presences called vehinehae frequent and make terrible the nocturnal roadside i was told by one they were like so much mist and as the traveller walked into them dispersed and dissipated another described them as being shaped like men and having eyes like cats from none could i obtain the smallest clearness as to what they did or wherefore they were dreaded we may be sure at least they represent the dead for the dead in the minds of the islanders are allpervasive when a native says that he is a man writes dr codrington he means that he is a man and not a ghost not that he is a man and not a beast the intelligent agents of this world are to his mind the men who are alive and the ghosts the men who are dead dr codrington speaks of melanesia from what i have learned his words are equally true of the polynesian and yet more among cannibal polynesians a dreadful suspicion rests generally on the dead and the marquesans the greatest cannibals of all are scarce likely to be free from similar beliefs i hazard the guess that the vehinehae are the hungry spirits of the dead continuing their lifes business of the cannibal ambuscade and lying everywhere unseen and eager to devour the living another superstition i picked up through the troubled medium of tari coffins english the dead he told me came and danced by night around the paepae of their former family the family were thereupon overcome by some emotion but whether of pious sorrow or of fear i could not gather and must make a feast of which fish pig and popoi were indispensable ingredients so far this is clear enough but here tari went on to instance the new house of toma and the housewarming feast which was just then in preparation as instances in point dare we indeed string them together and add the case of the deserted ruin as though the dead continually besieged the paepaes of the living were kept at armslength even from the first foundation only by propitiatory feasts and so soon as the fire of life went out upon the hearth swarmed back into possession of their ancient seat  i speak by guess of these marquesan superstitions on the cannibal ghost i shall return elsewhere with certainty and it is enough for the present purpose to remark that the men of the marquesas from whatever reason fear and shrink from the presence of ghosts conceive how this must tell upon the nerves in islands where the number of the dead already so far exceeds that of the living and the dead multiply and the living dwindle at so swift a rate conceive how the remnant huddles about the embers of the fire of life even as old red indians deserted on the march and in the snow the kindly tribe all gone the last flame expiring and the night around populous with wolves   footnote    2 in english usually written taboo tapu is the correct tahitian     formed     chapter v  depopulation   over the whole extent of the south seas from one tropic to another we find traces of a bygone state of overpopulation when the resources of even a tropical soil were taxed and even the improvident polynesian trembled for the future we may accept some of the ideas of mr darwins theory of coral islands and suppose a rise of the sea or the subsidence of some former continental area to have driven into the tops of the mountains multitudes of refugees or we may suppose more soberly a people of searovers emigrants from a crowded country to strike upon and settle island after island and as time went on to multiply exceedingly in their new seats in either case the end must be the same soon or late it must grow apparent that the crew are too numerous and that famine is at hand the polynesians met this emergent danger with various expedients of activity and prevention a way was found to preserve breadfruit by packing it in artificial pits pits forty feet in depth and of proportionate bore are still to be seen i am told in the marquesas and yet even these were insufficient for the teeming people and the annals of the past are gloomy with famine and cannibalism among the hawaiiansa hardier people in a more exacting climateagriculture was carried far the land was irrigated with canals and the fishponds of molokai prove the number and diligence of the old inhabitants meanwhile over all the island world abortion and infanticide prevailed on coral atolls where the danger was most plainly obvious these were enforced by law and sanctioned by punishment on vaitupu in the ellices only two children were allowed to a couple on nukufetau but one on the latter the punishment was by fine and it is related that the fine was sometimes paid and the child spared  this is characteristic for no people in the world are so fond or so longsuffering with childrenchildren make the mirth and the adornment of their homes serving them for playthings and for picturegalleries happy is the man that has his quiver full of them the stray bastard is contended for by rival families and the natural and the adopted children play and grow up together undistinguished the spoiling and i may almost say the deification of the child is nowhere carried so far as in the eastern islands and furthest according to my opportunities of observation in the paumotu group the socalled low or dangerous archipelago i have seen a paumotuan native turn from me with embarrassment and disaffection because i suggested that a brat would be the better for a beating it is a daily matter in some eastern islands to see a child strike or even stone its mother and the mother so far from punishing scarce ventures to resist in some when his child was born a chief was superseded and resigned his name as though like a drone he had then fulfilled the occasion of his being and in some the lightest words of children had the weight of oracles only the other day in the marquesas if a child conceived a distaste to any stranger i am assured the stranger would be slain and i shall have to tell in another place an instance of the opposite how a child in manihiki having taken a fancy to myself her adoptive parents at once accepted the situation and loaded me with gifts  with such sentiments the necessity for child destruction would not fail to clash and i believe we find the trace of divided feeling in the tahitian brotherhood of oro at a certain date a new god was added to the societyisland olympus or an old one refurbished and made popular oro was his name and he may be compared with the bacchus of the ancients his zealots sailed from bay to bay and from island to island they were everywhere received with feasting wore fine clothes sang danced acted gave exhibitions of dexterity and strength and were the artists the acrobats the bards and the harlots of the group their life was public and epicurean their initiation a mystery and the highest in the land aspired to join the brotherhood if a couple stood next in line to a highchieftaincy they were suffered on grounds of policy to spare one child all other children who had a father or a mother in the company of oro stood condemned from the moment of conception a freemasonry an agnostic sect a company of artists its members all under oath to spread unchastity and all forbidden to leave offspringi do not know how it may appear to others but to me the design seems obvious famine menacing the islands and the needful remedy repulsive it was recommended to the native mind by these trappings of mystery pleasure and parade this is the more probable and the secret serious purpose of the institution appears the more plainly if it be true that after a certain period of life the obligation of the votary was changed at first bound to be profligate afterwards expected to be chaste  here then we have one side of the case maneating among kindly men childmurder among childlovers industry in a race the most idle invention in a race the least progressive this grim pagan salvationarmy of the brotherhood of oro the report of early voyagers the widespread vestiges of former habitation and the universal tradition of the islands all point to the same fact of former crowding and alarm and today we are face to face with the reverse today in the marquesas in the eight islands of hawaii in mangareva in easter island we find the same race perishing like flies why this change or grant that the coming of the whites the change of habits and the introduction of new maladies and vices fully explain the depopulation why is that depopulation not universal the population of tahiti after a period of alarming decrease has again become stationary i hear of a similar result among some maori tribes in many of the paumotus a slight increase is to be observed and the samoans are today as healthy and at least as fruitful as before the change grant that the tahitians the maoris and the paumotuans have become inured to the new conditions and what are we to make of the samoans who have never suffered  those who are acquainted only with a single group are apt to be ready with solutions thus i have heard the mortality of the maoris attributed to their change of residencefrom fortified hilltops to the low marshy vicinity of their plantations how plausible and yet the marquesans are dying out in the same houses where their fathers multiplied or take opium the marquesas and hawaii are the two groups the most infected with this vice the population of the one is the most civilised that of the other by far the most barbarous of polynesians and they are two of those that perish the most rapidly here is a strong case against opium but let us take unchastity and we shall find the marquesas and hawaii figuring again upon another count thus samoans are the most chaste of polynesians and they are to this day entirely fertile marquesans are the most debauched we have seen how they are perishing hawaiians are notoriously lax and they begin to be dotted among deserts so here is a case stronger still against chastity and here also we have a correction to apply whatever the virtues of the tahitian neither friend nor enemy dares call him chaste and yet he seems to have outlived the time of danger one last example syphilis has been plausibly credited with much of the sterility but the samoans are by all accounts as fruitful as at first by some accounts more so and it is not seriously to be argued that the samoans have escaped syphilis  these examples show how dangerous it is to reason from any particular cause or even from many in a single group i have in my eye an able and amiable pamphlet by the rev se bishop why are the hawaiians dying out any one interested in the subject ought to read this tract which contains real information and yet mr bishops views would have been changed by an acquaintance with other groups samoa is for the moment the main and the most instructive exception to the rule the people are the most chaste and one of the most temperate of island peoples they have never been tried and depressed with any grave pestilence their clothing has scarce been tampered with at the simple and becoming tabard of the girls tartuffe in many another island would have cried out for the cool healthy and modest lavalava or kilt tartuffe has managed in many another island to substitute stifling and inconvenient trousers lastly and perhaps chiefly so far from their amusements having been curtailed i think they have been upon the whole extended the polynesian falls easily into despondency bereavement disappointment the fear of novel visitations the decay or proscription of ancient pleasures easily incline him to be sad and sadness detaches him from life the melancholy of the hawaiian and the emptiness of his new life are striking and the remark is yet more apposite to the marquesas in samoa on the other hand perpetual song and dance perpetual games journeys and pleasures make an animated and a smiling picture of the island life and the samoans are today the gayest and the best entertained inhabitants of our planet the importance of this can scarcely be exaggerated in a climate and upon a soil where a livelihood can be had for the stooping entertainment is a prime necessity it is otherwise with us where life presents us with a daily problem and there is a serious interest and some of the heat of conflict in the mere continuing to be so in certain atolls where there is no great gaiety but man must bestir himself with some vigour for his daily bread public health and the population are maintained but in the lotos islands with the decay of pleasures life itself decays it is from this point of view that we may instance among other causes of depression the decay of war we have been so long used in europe to that dreary business of war on the great scale trailing epidemics and leaving pestilential corpses in its train that we have almost forgotten its original the most healthful if not the most humane of all field sportshedgewarfare from this as well as from the rest of his amusements and interests the islander upon a hundred islands has been recently cut off and to this as well as to so many others the samoan still makes good a special title  upon the whole the problem seems to me to stand thuswhere there have been fewest changes important or unimportant salutary or hurtful there the race survives where there have been most important or unimportant salutary or hurtful there it perishes each change however small augments the sum of new conditions to which the race has to become inured there may seem a priori no comparison between the change from sour toddy to bad gin and that from the island kilt to a pair of european trousers yet i am far from persuaded that the one is any more hurtful than the other and the unaccustomed race will sometimes die of pinpricks we are here face to face with one of the difficulties of the missionary in polynesian islands he easily obtains preeminent authority the king becomes his maire du palais he can proscribe he can command and the temptation is ever towards too much thus by all accounts the catholics in mangareva and thus to my own knowledge the protestants in hawaii have rendered life in a more or less degree unliveable to their converts and the mild uncomplaining creatures like children in a prison yawn and await death it is easy to blame the missionary but it is his business to make changes it is surely his business for example to prevent war and yet i have instanced war itself as one of the elements of health on the other hand it were perhaps easy for the missionary to proceed more gently and to regard every change as an affair of weight i take the average missionary i am sure i do him no more than justice when i suppose that he would hesitate to bombard a village even in order to convert an archipelago experience begins to show us at least in polynesian islands that change of habit is bloodier than a bombardment  there is one point ere i have done where i may go to meet criticism i have said nothing of faulty hygiene bathing during fevers mistaken treatment of children native doctoring or abortionall causes frequently adduced and i have said nothing of them because they are conditions common to both epochs and even more efficient in the past than in the present was it not the same with unchastity it may be asked was not the polynesian always unchaste doubtless he was so always doubtless he is more so since the coming of his remarkably chaste visitors from europe take the hawaiian account of cook i have no doubt it is entirely fair take krusensterns candid almost innocent description of a russian manofwar at the marquesas consider the disgraceful history of missions in hawaii itself where in the war of lust the american missionaries were once shelled by an english adventurer and once raided and mishandled by the crew of an american warship add the practice of whaling fleets to call at the marquesas and carry off a complement of women for the cruise consider besides how the whites were at first regarded in the light of demigods as appears plainly in the reception of cook upon hawaii and again in the story of the discovery of tutuila when the really decent women of samoa prostituted themselves in public to the french and bear in mind how it was the custom of the adventurers and we may almost say the business of the missionaries to deride and infract even the most salutary tapus here we see every engine of dissolution directed at once against a virtue never and nowhere very strong or popular and the result even in the most degraded islands has been further degradation mr lawes the missionary of savage island told me the standard of female chastity had declined there since the coming of the whites in heathen time if a girl gave birth to a bastard her father or brother would dash the infant down the cliffs and today the scandal would be small or take the marquesas stanislao moanatini told me that in his own recollection the young were strictly guarded they were not suffered so much as to look upon one another in the street but passed so my informant put it like dogs and the other day the whole schoolchildren of nukahiva and uapu escaped in a body to the woods and lived there for a fortnight in promiscuous liberty readers of travels may perhaps exclaim at my authority and declare themselves better informed i should prefer the statement of an intelligent native like stanislao even if it stood alone which it is far from doing to the report of the most honest traveller a ship of war comes to a haven anchors lands a party receives and returns a visit and the captain writes a chapter on the manners of the island it is not considered what class is mostly seen yet we should not be pleased if a lascar foremast hand were to judge england by the ladies who parade ratcliffe highway and the gentlemen who share with them their hire stanislaos opinion of a decay of virtue even in these unvirtuous islands has been supported to me by others his very example the progress of dissolution amongst the young is adduced by mr bishop in hawaii and so far as marquesans are concerned we might have hazarded a guess of some decline in manners i do not think that any race could ever have prospered or multiplied with such as now obtain i am sure they would have been never at the pains to count paternal kinship it is not possible to give details suffice it that their manners appear to be imitated from the dreams of ignorant and vicious children and their debauches persevered in until energy reason and almost life itself are in abeyance     chapter vi  chiefs and tapus   we used to admire exceedingly the bland and gallant manners of the chief called taipikikino an elegant guest at table skilled in the use of knife and fork a brave figure when he shouldered a gun and started for the woods after wild chickens always serviceable always ingratiating and gay i would sometimes wonder where he found his cheerfulness he had enough to sober him i thought in his official budget his expensesfor he was always seen attired in virgin whitemust have by far exceeded his income of six dollars in the year or say two shillings a month and he was himself a man of no substance his house the poorest in the village it was currently supposed that his elder brother kauanui must have helped him out but how comes it that the elder brother should succeed to the family estate and be a wealthy commoner and the younger be a poor man and yet rule as chief in anaho that the one should be wealthy and the other almost indigent is probably to be explained by some adoption for comparatively few children are brought up in the house or succeed to the estates of their natural begetters that the one should be chief instead of the other must be explained in a very irish fashion on the ground that neither of them is a chief at all  since the return and the wars of the french many chiefs have been deposed and many socalled chiefs appointed we have seen in the same house one such upstart drinking in the company of two such extruded island bourbons men whose word a few years ago was life and death now sunk to be peasants like their neighbours so when the french overthrew hereditary tyrants dubbed the commons of the marquesas freeborn citizens of the republic and endowed them with a vote for a conseillergénéral at tahiti they probably conceived themselves upon the path to popularity and so far from that they were revolting public sentiment the deposition of the chiefs was perhaps sometimes needful the appointment of others may have been needful also it was at least a delicate business the government of george ii exiled many highland magnates it never occurred to them to manufacture substitutes and if the french have been more bold we have yet to see with what success  our chief at anaho was always called he always called himself taipikikino and yet that was not his name but only the wand of his false position as soon as he was appointed chief his namewhich signified if i remember exactly prince born among flowersfell in abeyance and he was dubbed instead by the expressive byword taipikikinohighwater manofnoaccountor englishing more boldly beggar on horsebacka witty and a wicked cut a nickname in polynesia destroys almost the memory of the original name today if we were polynesians gladstone would be no more heard of we should speak of and address our nestor as the grand old man and it is so that himself would sign his correspondence not the prevalence then but the significancy of the nickname is to be noted here the new authority began with small prestige taipi has now been some time in office from all i saw he seemed a person very fit he is not the least unpopular and yet his power is nothing he is a chief to the french and goes to breakfast with the resident but for any practical end of chieftaincy a rag doll were equally efficient  we had been but three days in anaho when we received the visit of the chief of hatiheu a man of weight and fame late leader of a war upon the french late prisoner in tahiti and the last eater of longpig in nukahiva not many years have elapsed since he was seen striding on the beach of anaho a dead mans arm across his shoulder so does kooamua to his enemies he roared to the passersby and took a bite from the raw flesh and now behold this gentleman very wisely replaced in office by the french paying us a morning visit in european clothes he was the man of the most character we had yet seen his manners genial and decisive his person tall his face rugged astute formidable and with a certain similarity to mr gladstones only for the brownness of the skin and the highchiefs tattooing all one side and much of the other being of an even blue further acquaintance increased our opinion of his sense he viewed the casco in a manner then quite new to us examining her lines and the running of the gear to a piece of knitting on which one of the party was engaged he must have devoted ten minutes patient study nor did he desist before he had divined the principles and he was interested even to excitement by a typewriter which he learned to work when he departed he carried away with him a list of his family with his own name printed by his own hand at the bottom i should add that he was plainly much of a humorist and not a little of a humbug he told us for instance that he was a person of exact sobriety such being the obligation of his high estate the commons might be sots but the chief could not stoop so low and not many days after he was to be observed in a state of smiling and lopsided imbecility the casco ribbon upside down on his dishonoured hat  but his business that morning in anaho is what concerns us here the devilfish it seems were growing scarce upon the reef it was judged fit to interpose what we should call a close season for that end in polynesia a tapu vulgarly spelt taboo has to be declared and who was to declare it taipi might he ought it was a chief part of his duty but would any one regard the inhibition of a beggar on horseback he might plant palm branches it did not in the least follow that the spot was sacred he might recite the spell it was shrewdly supposed the spirits would not hearken and so the old legitimate cannibal must ride over the mountains to do it for him and the respectable official in white clothes could but look on and envy at about the same time though in a different manner kooamua established a forest law it was observed the cocopalms were suffering for the plucking of green nuts impoverishes and at last endangers the tree now kooamua could tapu the reef which was public property but he could not tapu other peoples palms and the expedient adopted was interesting he tapud his own trees and his example was imitated over all hatiueu and anaho i fear taipi might have tapud all that he possessed and found none to follow him so much for the esteem in which the dignity of an appointed chief is held by others a single circumstance will show what he thinks of it himself i never met one but he took an early opportunity to explain his situation true he was only an appointed chief when i beheld him but somewhere else perhaps upon some other isle he was a chieftain by descent upon which ground he asked me so to say it to excuse his mushroom honours  it will be observed with surprise that both these tapus are for thoroughly sensible ends with surprise i say because the nature of that institution is much misunderstood in europe it is taken usually in the sense of a meaningless or wanton prohibition such as that which today prevents women in some countries from smoking or yesterday prevented any one in scotland from taking a walk on sunday the error is no less natural than it is unjust the polynesians have not been trained in the bracing practical thought of ancient rome with them the idea of law has not been disengaged from that of morals or propriety so that tapu has to cover the whole field and implies indifferently that an act is criminal immoral against sound public policy unbecoming or as we say not in good form many tapus were in consequence absurd enough such as those which deleted words out of the language and particularly those which related to women tapu encircled women upon all hands many things were forbidden to men to women we may say that few were permitted they must not sit on the paepae they must not go up to it by the stair they must not eat pork they must not approach a boat they must not cook at a fire which any male had kindled the other day after the roads were made it was observed the women plunged along the margin through the bush and when they came to a bridge waded through the water roads and bridges were the work of mens hands and tapu for the foot of women even a mans saddle if the man be native is a thing no selfrespecting lady dares to use thus on the anaho side of the island only two white men mr regler and the gendarme m aussel possess saddles and when a woman has a journey to make she must borrow from one or other it will be noticed that these prohibitions tend most of them to an increased reserve between the sexes regard for female chastity is the usual excuse for these disabilities that men delight to lay upon their wives and mothers here the regard is absent and behold the women still bound hand and foot with meaningless proprieties the women themselves who are survivors of the old regimen admit that in those days life was not worth living and yet even then there were exceptions there were female chiefs and i am assured priestesses besides nice customs curtseyed to great dames and in the most sacred enclosure of a high place father siméon delmar was shown a stone and told it was the throne of some welldescended lady how exactly parallel is this with european practice when princesses were suffered to penetrate the strictest cloister and women could rule over a land in which they were denied the control of their own children  but the tapu is more often the instrument of wise and needful restrictions we have seen it as the organ of paternal government it serves besides to enforce in the rare case of some one wishing to enforce them rights of private property thus a man weary of the coming and going of marquesan visitors tapus his door and to this day you may see the palmbranch signal even as our greatgrandfathers saw the peeled wand before a highland inn or take another case anaho is known as the country without popoi the word popoi serves in different islands to indicate the main food of the people thus in hawaii it implies a preparation of taro in the marquesas of breadfruit and a marquesan does not readily conceive life possible without his favourite diet a few years ago a drought killed the breadfruit trees and the bananas in the district of anaho and from this calamity and the openhanded customs of the island a singular state of things arose wellwatered hatiheu had escaped the drought every householder of anaho accordingly crossed the pass chose some one in hatiheu gave him his namean onerous gift but one not to be rejectedand from this improvised relative proceeded to draw his supplies for all the world as though he had paid for them hence a continued traffic on the road some stalwart fellow in a loincloth and glistening with sweat may be seen at all hours of the day a stick across his bare shoulders tripping nervously under a double burthen of green fruits and on the far side of the gap a dozen stone posts on the wayside in the shadow of a grove mark the breathingplace of the popoicarriers a little back from the breach and not half a mile from anaho i was the more amazed to find a cluster of welldoing breadfruits heavy with their harvest why do you not take these i asked tapu said hoka and i thought to myself after the manner of dull travellers what children and fools these people were to toil over the mountain and despoil innocent neighbours when the staff of life was thus growing at their door i was the more in error in the general destruction these surviving trees were enough only for the family of the proprietor and by the simple expedient of declaring a tapu he enforced his right  the sanction of the tapu is superstitious and the punishment of infraction either a wasting or a deadly sickness a slow disease follows on the eating of tapu fish and can only be cured with the bones of the same fish burned with the due mysteries the cocoanut and breadfruit tapu works more swiftly suppose you have eaten tapu fruit at the evening meal at night your sleep will be uneasy in the morning swelling and a dark discoloration will have attacked your neck whence they spread upward to the face and in two days unless the cure be interjected you must die this cure is prepared from the rubbed leaves of the tree from which the patient stole so that he cannot be saved without confessing to the tahuku the person whom he wronged in the experience of my informant almost no tapu had been put in use except the two described he had thus no opportunity to learn the nature and operation of the others and as the art of making them was jealously guarded amongst the old men he believed the mystery would soon die out i should add that he was no marquesan but a chinaman a resident in the group from boyhood and a reverent believer in the spells which he described white men amongst whom ah fu included himself were exempt but he had a tale of a tahitian woman who had come to the marquesas eaten tapu fish and although uninformed of her offence and danger had been afflicted and cured exactly like a native  doubtless the belief is strong doubtless with this weakly and fanciful race it is in many cases strong enough to kill it should be strong indeed in those who tapu their trees secretly so that they may detect a depredator by his sickness or perhaps we should understand the idea of the hidden tapu otherwise as a politic device to spread uneasiness and extort confessions so that when a man is ailing he shall ransack his brain for any possible offence and send at once for any proprietor whose rights he has invaded had you hidden a tapu we may conceive him asking and i cannot imagine the proprietor gainsaying it and that is perhaps the strangest feature of the systemthat it should be regarded from without with such a mental and implicit awe and when examined from within should present so many apparent evidences of design  we read in dr campbells poenamo of a new zealand girl who was foolishly told that she had eaten a tapu yam and who instantly sickened and died in the two days of simple terror the period is the same as in the marquesas doubtless the symptoms were so too how singular to consider that a superstition of such sway is possibly a manufactured article and that even if it were not originally invented its details have plainly been arranged by the authorities of some polynesian scotland yard fitly enough the belief is todayand was probably alwaysfar from universal hell at home is a strong deterrent with some a passing thought with others with others again a theme of public mockery not always well assured and so in the marquesas with the tapu mr regler has seen the two extremes of scepticism and implicit fear in the tapu grove he found one fellow stealing breadfruit cheerful and impudent as a street arab and it was only on a menace of exposure that he showed himself the least discountenanced the other case was opposed in every point mr regler asked a native to accompany him upon a voyage the man went gladly enough but suddenly perceiving a dead tapu fish in the bottom of the boat leaped back with a scream nor could the promise of a dollar prevail upon him to advance  the marquesan it will be observed adheres to the old idea of the local circumscription of beliefs and duties not only are the whites exempt from consequences but their transgressions seem to be viewed without horror it was mr regler who had killed the fish yet the devout native was not shocked at mr regleronly refused to join him in his boat a white is a white the servant so to speak of other and more liberal gods and not to be blamed if he profit by his liberty the jews were perhaps the first to interrupt this ancient comity of faiths and the jewish virus is still strong in christianity all the world must respect our tapus or we gnash our teeth     chapter vii  hatiheu   the bays of anaho and hatiheu are divided at their roots by the knifeedge of a single hillthe pass so often mentioned but this isthmus expands to the seaward in a considerable peninsula very bare and grassy haunted by sheep and at night and morning by the piercing cries of the shepherds wandered over by a few wild goats and on its seafront indented with long clamorous caves and faced with cliffs of the colour and ruinous outline of an old peatstack in one of these echoing and sunless gullies we saw clustered like seabirds on a splashing ledge shrill as seabirds in their salutation to the passing boat a group of fisherwomen stripped to their gaudy underclothes the clash of the surf and the thin female voices echo in my memory we had that day a native crew and steersman kauanui it was our first experience of polynesian seamanship which consists in hugging every point of land there is no thought in this of saving time for they will pull a long way in to skirt a point that is embayed it seems that as they can never get their houses near enough the surf upon the one side so they can never get their boats near enough upon the other the practice in bold water is not so dangerous as it looksthe reflex from the rocks sending the boat off near beaches with a heavy run of sea i continue to think it very hazardous and find the composure of the natives annoying to behold we took unmingled pleasure on the way out to see so near at hand the beach and the wonderful colours of the surf on the way back when the sea had risen and was running strong against us the fineness of the steersmans aim grew more embarrassing as we came abreast of the seafront where the surf broke highest kauanui embraced the occasion to light his pipe which then made the circuit of the boateach man taking a whiff or two and ere he passed it on filling his lungs and cheeks with smoke their faces were all puffed out like apples as we came abreast of the cliff foot and the bursting surge fell back into the boat in showers at the next point cocanetti was the word and the stroke borrowed my knife and desisted from his labours to open nuts these untimely indulgences may be compared to the tot of grog served out before a ship goes into action  my purpose in this visit led me first to the boys school for hatiheu is the university of the north islands the hum of the lesson came out to meet us close by the door where the draught blew coolest sat the lay brother around him in a packed halfcircle some sixty highcoloured faces set with staring eyes and in the background of the barnlike room benches were to be seen and blackboards with sums on them in chalk the brother rose to greet us sensibly humble thirty years he had been there he said and fingered his white locks as a bashful child pulls out his pinafore et point de résultats monsieur presque pas de résultats he pointed to the scholars you see sir all the youth of nukahiva and uapu between the ages of six and fifteen this is all that remains and it is but a few years since we had a hundred and twenty from nukahiva alone oui monsieur cela se dépérit prayers and reading and writing prayers again and arithmetic and more prayers to conclude such appeared to be the dreary nature of the course for arithmetic all island people have a natural taste in hawaii they make good progress in mathematics in one of the villages on majuro and generally in the marshall group the whole population sit about the trader when he is weighing copra and each on his own slate takes down the figures and computes the total the trader finding them so apt introduced fractions for which they had been taught no rule at first they were quite gravelled but ultimately by sheer hard thinking reasoned out the result and came one after another to assure the trader he was right not many people in europe could have done the like the course at hatiheu is therefore less dispiriting to polynesians than a stranger might have guessed and yet how bald it is at best i asked the brother if he did not tell them stories and he stared at me if he did not teach them history and he said o yes they had a little scripture historyfrom the new testament and repeated his lamentations over the lack of results i had not the heart to put more questions i could but say it must be very discouraging and resist the impulse to add that it seemed also very natural he looked upmy days are far spent he said heaven awaits me may that heaven forgive me but i was angry with the old man and his simple consolation for think of his opportunity the youth from six to fifteen are taken from their homes by government centralised at hatiheu where they are supported by a weekly tax of food and with the exception of one month in every year surrendered wholly to the direction of the priests since the escapade already mentioned the holiday occurs at a different period for the girls and for the boys so that a marquesan brother and sister meet again after their education is complete a pair of strangers it is a harsh law and highly unpopular but what a power it places in the hands of the instructors and how languidly and dully is that power employed by the mission too much concern to make the natives pious a design in which they all confess defeat is i suppose the explanation of their miserable system but they might see in the girls school at taiohae under the brisk housewifely sisters a different picture of efficiency and a scene of neatness airiness and spirited and mirthful occupation that should shame them into cheerier methods the sisters themselves lament their failure they complain the annual holiday undoes the whole years work they complain particularly of the heartless indifference of the girls out of so many pretty and apparently affectionate pupils whom they have taught and reared only two have ever returned to pay a visit of remembrance to their teachers these indeed come regularly but the rest so soon as their schooldays are over disappear into the woods like captive insects it is hard to imagine anything more discouraging and yet i do not believe these ladies need despair for a certain interval they keep the girls alive and innocently busy and if it be at all possible to save the race this would be the means no such praise can be given to the boys school at hatiheu the day is numbered already for them all alike for the teacher and the scholars death is girt he is afoot upon the march and in the frequent interval they sit and yawn but in life there seems a thread of purpose through the least significant the drowsiest endeavour is not lost and even the school at hatiheu may be more useful than it seems  hatiheu is a place of some pretensions the end of the bay towards anaho may be called the civil compound for it boasts the house of kooamua and close on the beach under a great tree that of the gendarme m armand aussel with his garden his pictures his books and his excellent table to which strangers are made welcome no more singular contrast is possible than between the gendarmerie and the priesthood who are besides in smouldering opposition and full of mutual complaints a priests kitchen in the eastern islands is a depressing spot to see and many or most of them make no attempt to keep a garden sparsely subsisting on their rations but you will never dine with a gendarme without smacking your lips and m aussels homemade sausage and the salad from his garden are unforgotten delicacies pierre loti may like to know that he is m aussels favourite author and that his books are read in the fit scenery of hatiheu bay  the other end is all religious it is here that an overhanging and tiptilted horn a good seamark for hatiheu bursts naked from the verdure of the climbing forest and breaks down shoreward in steep taluses and cliffs from the edge of one of the highest perhaps seven hundred or a thousand feet above the beach a virgin looks insignificantly down like a poor lost doll forgotten there by a giant child this laborious symbol of the catholics is always strange to protestants we conceive with wonder that men should think it worth while to toil so many days and clamber so much about the face of precipices for an end that makes us smile and yet i believe it was the wise bishop dordillon who chose the place and i know that those who had a hand in the enterprise look back with pride upon its vanquished dangers the boys school is a recent importation it was at first in taiohae beside the girls and it was only of late after their joint escapade that the width of the island was interposed between the sexes but hatiheu must have been a place of missionary importance from before about midway of the beach no less than three churches stand grouped in a patch of bananas intermingled with some pineapples two are of wood the original church now in disuse and a second that for some mysterious reason has never been used the new church is of stone with twin towers walls flangeing into buttresses and sculptured front the design itself is good simple and shapely but the character is all in the detail where the architect has bloomed into the sculptor it is impossible to tell in words of the angels although they are more like winged archbishops that stand guard upon the door of the cherubs in the corners of the scapegoat gargoyles or the quaint and spirited relief where st michael the artists patron makes short work of a protesting lucifer we were never weary of viewing the imagery so innocent sometimes so funny and yet in the best sensein the sense of inventive gusto and expressionso artistic i know not whether it was more strange to find a building of such merit in a corner of a barbarous isle or to see a building so antique still bright with novelty the architect a french lay brother still alive and well and meditating fresh foundations must have surely drawn his descent from a masterbuilder in the age of the cathedrals and it was in looking on the church of hatiheu that i seemed to perceive the secret charm of mediæval sculpture that combination of the childish courage of the amateur attempting all things like the schoolboy on his slate with the manly perseverance of the artist who does not know when he is conquered  i had always afterwards a strong wish to meet the architect brother michel and one day when i was talking with the resident in taiohae the chief port of the island there were shown in to us an old worn purblind asceticlooking priest and a lay brother a type of all that is most sound in france with a broad clever honest humorous countenance an eye very large and bright and a strong and healthy body inclining to obesity but that his blouse was black and his face shaven clean you might pick such a man today toiling cheerfully in his own patch of vines from half a dozen provinces of france and yet he had always for me a haunting resemblance to an old kind friend of my boyhood whom i name in case any of my readers should share with me that memorydr paul of the west kirk almost at the first word i was sure it was my architect and in a moment we were deep in a discussion of hatiheu church brother michel spoke always of his labours with a twinkle of humour underlying which it was possible to spy a serious pride and the change from one to another was often very human and diverting et vos gargouilles moyenâge cried i comme elles sont originales nestce pas elles sont bien drôles he said smiling broadly and the next moment with a sudden gravity cependant il y en a une qui a une patte de cassé il faut que je voie cela i asked if he had any modela point we much discussed non said he simply cest une église idéale the relievo was his favourite performance and very justly so the angels at the door he owned he would like to destroy and replace ils nont pas de vie ils manquent de vie vous devriez voir mon église à la dominique jai là une vierge qui est vraiment gentille ah i cried they told me you had said you would never build another church and i wrote in my journal i could not believe it oui jaimerais bien en faire une autre he confessed and smiled at the confession an artist will understand how much i was attracted by this conversation there is no bond so near as a community in that unaffected interest and slightly shamefaced pride which mark the intelligent man enamoured of an art he sees the limitations of his aim the defects of his practice he smiles to be so employed upon the shores of death yet sees in his own devotion something worthy artists if they had the same sense of humour with the augurs would smile like them on meeting but the smile would not be scornful  i had occasion to see much of this excellent man he sailed with us from taiohae to hivaoa a dead beat of ninety miles against a heavy sea it was what is called a good passage and a feather in the cascos cap but among the most miserable forty hours that any one of us had ever passed we were swung and tossed together all that time like shot in a stage thunderbox the mate was thrown down and had his head cut open the captain was sick on deck the cook sick in the galley of all our party only two sat down to dinner i was one i own that i felt wretchedly and i can only say of the other who professed to feel quite well that she fled at an early moment from the table it was in these circumstances that we skirted the windward shore of that indescribable island of uapu viewing with dizzy eyes the coves the capes the breakers the climbing forests and the inaccessible stone needles that surmount the mountains the place persists in a dark corner of our memories like a piece of the scenery of nightmares the end of this distressful passage where we were to land our passengers was in a similar vein of roughness the surf ran high on the beach at taahauku the boat broachedto and capsized and all hands were submerged only the brother himself who was well used to the experience skipped ashore by some miracle of agility with scarce a sprinkling thenceforward during our stay at hivaoa he was our cicerone and patron introducing us taking us excursions serving us in every way and making himself daily more beloved  michel blanc had been a carpenter by trade had made money and retired supposing his active days quite over and it was only when he found idleness dangerous that he placed his capital and acquirements at the service of the mission he became their carpenter mason architect and engineer added sculpture to his accomplishments and was famous for his skill in gardening he wore an enviable air of having found a port from lifes contentions and lying there strongly anchored went about his business with a jolly simplicity complained of no lack of resultsperhaps shyly thinking his own statuary result enough and was altogether a pattern of the missionary layman     chapter viii  the port of entry   the portthe mart the civil and religious capital of these rude islandsis called taiohae and lies strung along the beach of a precipitous green bay in nukahiva it was midwinter when we came thither and the weather was sultry boisterous and inconstant now the wind blew squally from the land down gaps of splintered precipice now between the sentinel islets of the entry it came in gusts from seaward heavy and dark clouds impended on the summits the rain roared and ceased the scuppers of the mountain gushed and the next day we would see the sides of the amphitheatre bearded with white falls along the beach the town shows a thin file of houses mostly white and all ensconced in the foliage of an avenue of green puraos a pier gives access from the sea across the belt of breakers to the eastward there stands on a projecting bushy hill the old fort which is now the calaboose or prison eastward still alone in a garden the residency flies the colours of france just off calaboose hill the tiny government schooner rides almost permanently at anchor marks eight bells in the morning there or thereabout with the unfurling of her flag and salutes the setting sun with the report of a musket  here dwell together and share the comforts of a club which may be enumerated as a billiardboard absinthe a map of the world on mercators projection and one of the most agreeable verandahs in the tropics a handful of whites of varying nationality mostly french officials german and scottish merchant clerks and the agents of the opium monopoly there are besides three tavernkeepers the shrewd scot who runs the cotton ginmill two white ladies and a sprinkling of people on the beacha south sea expression for which there is no exact equivalent it is a pleasant society and a hospitable but one man who was often to be seen seated on the logs at the pierhead merits a word for the singularity of his history and appearance long ago it seems he fell in love with a native lady a high chiefess in uapu she on being approached declared she could never marry a man who was untattooed it looked so naked whereupon with some greatness of soul our hero put himself in the hands of the tahukus and with still greater persevered until the process was complete he had certainly to bear a great expense for the tahuku will not work without reward and certainly exquisite pain kooamua high chief as he was and one of the old school was only part tattooed he could not he told us with lively pantomime endure the torture to an end our enamoured countryman was more resolved he was tattooed from head to foot in the most approved methods of the art and at last presented himself before his mistress a new man the fickle fair one could never behold him from that day except with laughter for my part i could never see the man without a kind of admiration of him it might be said if ever of any that he had loved not wisely but too well  the residency stands by itself calaboose hill screening it from the fringe of town along the further bay the house is commodious with wide verandahs all day it stands open back and front and the trade blows copiously over its bare floors on a weekday the garden offers a scene of most untropical animation half a dozen convicts toiling there cheerfully with spade and barrow and touching hats and smiling to the visitor like old attached family servants on sunday these are gone and nothing to be seen but dogs of all ranks and sizes peacefully slumbering in the shady grounds for the dogs of taiohae are very courtlyminded and make the seat of government their promenade and place of siesta in front and beyond a strip of green down loses itself in a low wood of many species of acacia and deep in the wood a ruinous wall encloses the cemetery of the europeans english and scottish sleep there and scandinavians and french maîtres de manoeuvres and maîtres ouvriers mingling alien dust back in the woods perhaps the blackbird or as they call him there the island nightingale will be singing home strains and the ceaseless requiem of the surf hangs on the ear i have never seen a restingplace more quiet but it was a long thought how far these sleepers had all travelled and from what diverse homes they had set forth to lie here in the end together  on the summit of its promontory hill the calaboose stands all day with doors and window shutters open to the trade on my first visit a dog was the only guardian visible he indeed rose with an attitude so menacing that i was glad to lay hands on an old barrelhoop and i think the weapon must have been familiar for the champion instantly retreated and as i wandered round the court and through the building i could see him with a couple of companions humbly dodging me about the corners the prisoners dormitory was a spacious airy room devoid of any furniture its whitewashed walls covered with inscriptions in marquesan and rude drawings one of the pier not badly done one of a murder several of french soldiers in uniform there was one legend in french je nest sic pas le sou from this noontide quietude it must not be supposed the prison was untenanted the calaboose at taiohae does a good business but some of its occupants were gardening at the residency and the rest were probably at work upon the streets as free as our scavengers at home although not so industrious on the approach of evening they would be called in like children from play and the harbourmaster who is also the gaoler would go through the form of locking them up until six the next morning should a prisoner have any call in town whether of pleasure or affairs he has but to unhook the windowshutter and if he is back again and the shutter decently replaced by the hour of call on the morrow he may have met the harbourmaster in the avenue and there will be no complaint far less any punishment but this is not all the charming french resident m delaruelle carried me one day to the calaboose on an official visit in the green court a very ragged gentleman his legs deformed with the island elephantiasis saluted us smiling one of our political prisonersan insurgent from raiatea said the resident and then to the gaoler i thought i had ordered him a new pair of trousers meanwhile no other convict was to be seeneh bien said the resident où sont vos prisonniers monsieur le résident replied the gaoler saluting with soldierly formality comme cest jour de fête je les ai laissé aller à la chasse they were all upon the mountains hunting goats presently we came to the quarters of the women likewise desertedoù sont vos bonnes femmes asked the resident and the gaoler cheerfully responded je crois monsieur le résident quelles sont allées quelquepart faire une visite it had been the design of m delaruelle who was much in love with the whimsicalities of his small realm to elicit something comical but not even he expected anything so perfect as the last to complete the picture of convict life in taiohae it remains to be added that these criminals draw a salary as regularly as the president of the republic ten sous a day is their hire thus they have money food shelter clothing and i was about to write their liberty the french are certainly a goodnatured people and make easy masters they are besides inclined to view the marquesans with an eye of humorous indulgence they are dying poor devils said m delaruelle the main thing is to let them die in peace and it was not only well said but i believe expressed the general thought yet there is another element to be considered for these convicts are not merely useful they are almost essential to the french existence with a people incurably idle dispirited by what can only be called endemic pestilence and inflamed with illfeeling against their new masters crime and convict labour are a godsend to the government  theft is practically the sole crime originally petty pilferers the men of taiohae now begin to force locks and attack strongboxes hundreds of dollars have been taken at a time though with that redeeming moderation so common in polynesian theft the marquesan burglar will always take a part and leave a part sharing so to speak with the proprietor if it be chilian cointhe island currencyhe will escape if the sum is in gold french silver or banknotes the police wait until the money begins to come in circulation and then easily pick out their man and now comes the shameful part in plain english the prisoner is tortured until he confesses and if that be possible restores the money to keep him alone day and night in the black hole is to inflict on the marquesan torture inexpressible even his robberies are carried on in the plain daylight under the open sky with the stimulus of enterprise and the countenance of an accomplice his terror of the dark is still insurmountable conceive then what he endures in his solitary dungeon conceive how he longs to confess become a fullfledged convict and be allowed to sleep beside his comrades while we were in taiohae a thief was under prevention he had entered a house about eight in the morning forced a trunk and stolen eleven hundred francs and now under the horrors of darkness solitude and a bedevilled cannibal imagination he was reluctantly confessing and giving up his spoil from one cache which he had already pointed out three hundred francs had been recovered and it was expected that he would presently disgorge the rest this would be ugly enough if it were all but i am bound to say because it is a matter the french should set at rest that worse is continually hinted i heard that one man was kept six days with his arms bound backward round a barrel and it is the universal report that every gendarme in the south seas is equipped with something in the nature of a thumbscrew i do not know this i never had the face to ask any of the gendarmespleasant intelligent and kindly fellowswith whom i have been intimate and whose hospitality i have enjoyed and perhaps the tale reposes as i hope it does on a misconstruction of that ingenious catscradle with which the french agent of police so readily secures a prisoner but whether physical or moral torture is certainly employed and by a barbarous injustice the state of accusation in which a man may very well be innocently placed is positively painful the state of conviction in which all are supposed guilty is comparatively free and positively pleasant perhaps worse stillnot only the accused but sometimes his wife his mistress or his friend is subjected to the same hardships i was admiring in the tapu system the ingenuity of native methods of detection there is not much to admire in those of the french and to lock up a timid child in a dark room and if he prove obstinate lock up his sister in the next is neither novel nor humane  the main occasion of these thefts is the new vice of opiumeating here nobody ever works and all eat opium said a gendarme and ah fu knew a woman who ate a dollars worth in a day the successful thief will give a handful of money to each of his friends a dress to a woman pass an evening in one of the taverns of taiohae during which he treats all comers produce a big lump of opium and retire to the bush to eat and sleep it off a trader who did not sell opium confessed to me that he was at his wits end i do not sell it but others do said he the natives only work to buy it if they walk over to me to sell their cotton they have just to walk over to some one else to buy their opium with my money and why should they be at the bother of two walks there is no use talking he addedopium is the currency of this country  the man under prevention during my stay at taiohae lost patience while the chinese opiumseller was being examined in his presence of course he sold me opium he broke out all the chinese here sell opium it was only to buy opium that i stole it is only to buy opium that anybody steals and what you ought to do is to let no opium come here and no chinamen this is precisely what is done in samoa by a native government but the french have bound their own hands and for forty thousand francs sold native subjects to crime and death this horrid traffic may be said to have sprung up by accident it was captain hart who had the misfortune to be the means of beginning it at a time when his plantations flourished in the marquesas and he found a difficulty in keeping chinese coolies today the plantations are practically deserted and the chinese gone but in the meanwhile the natives have learned the vice the patent brings in a round sum and the needy government at papeete shut their eyes and open their pockets of course the patentee is supposed to sell to chinamen alone equally of course no one could afford to pay forty thousand francs for the privilege of supplying a scattered handful of chinese and every one knows the truth and all are ashamed of it french officials shake their heads when opium is mentioned and the agents of the farmer blush for their employment those that live in glass houses should not throw stones as a subject of the british crown i am an unwilling shareholder in the largest opium business under heaven but the british case is highly complicated it implies the livelihood of millions and must be reformed when it can be reformed at all with prudence this french business on the other hand is a nostrum and a mere excrescence no native industry was to be encouraged the poison is solemnly imported no native habit was to be considered the vice has been gratuitously introduced and no creature profits save the government at papeetethe not very enviable gentlemen who pay them and the chinese underlings who do the dirty work     chapter ix  the house of temoana   the history of the marquesas is of late years much confused by the coming and going of the french at least twice they have seized the archipelago at least once deserted it and in the meanwhile the natives pursued almost without interruption their desultory cannibal wars through these events and changing dynasties a single considerable figure may be seen to move that of the high chief a king temoana odds and ends of his history came to my ears how he was at first a convert of the protestant mission how he was kidnapped or exiled from his native land served as cook aboard a whaler and was shown for small charge in english seaports how he returned at last to the marquesas fell under the strong and benign influence of the late bishop extended his influence in the group was for a while joint ruler with the prelate and died at last the chief supporter of catholicism and the french his widow remains in receipt of two pounds a month from the french government queen she is usually called but in the official almanac she figures as madame vaekehu grande chefesse his son natural or adoptive i know not which stanislao moanatini chief of akaui serves in taiohae as a kind of minister of public works and the daughter of stanislao is high chiefess of the southern island of tauata these then are the greatest folk of the archipelago we thought them also the most estimable this is the rule in polynesia with few exceptions the higher the family the better the manbetter in sense better in manners and usually taller and stronger in body a stranger advances blindfold he scrapes acquaintance as he can save the tattoo in the marquesas nothing indicates the difference of rank and yet almost invariably we found after we had made them that our friends were persons of station i have said usually taller and stronger i might have been more absoluteover all polynesia and a part of micronesia the rule holds good the great ones of the isle and even of the village are greater of bone and muscle and often heavier of flesh than any commoner the usual explanationthat the highborn child is more industriously shampooedis probably the true one in new caledonia at least where the difference does not exist or has never been remarked the practice of shampooing seems to be itself unknown doctors would be well employed in a study of the point  vaekehu lives at the other end of the town from the residency beyond the buildings of the mission her house is on the european plan a table in the midst of the chief room photographs and religious pictures on the wall it commands to either hand a charming vista through the front door a peep of green lawn scurrying pigs the pendent fans of the cocopalm and the splendour of the bursting surf through the back mounting forest glades and coronals of precipice here in the strong thoroughdraught her majesty received us in a simple gown of print and with no mark of royalty but the exquisite finish of her tattooed mittens the elaboration of her manners and the gentle falsetto in which all the highly refined among marquesan ladies and vaekehu above all others delight to sing their language an adopted daughter interpreted while we gave the news and rehearsed by name our friends of anaho as we talked we could see through the landward door another lady of the household at her toilet under the green trees who presently when her hair was arranged and her hat wreathed with flowers appeared upon the back verandah with gracious salutations  vaekehu is very deaf merci is her only word of french and i do not know that she seemed clever an exquisite kind refinement with a shade of quietism gathered perhaps from the nuns was what chiefly struck us or rather upon that first occasion we were conscious of a sense as of districtvisiting on our part and reduced evangelical gentility on the part of our hostess the other impression followed after she was more at ease and came with stanislao and his little girl to dine on board the casco she had dressed for the occasion wore white which very well became her strong brown face and sat among us eating or smoking her cigarette quite cut off from all society or only now and then included through the intermediary of her son it was a position that might have been ridiculous and she made it ornamental making believe to hear and to be entertained her face whenever she met our eyes lighting with the smile of good society her contributions to the talk when she made any and that was seldom always complimentary and pleasing no attention was paid to the child for instance but what she remarked and thanked us for her parting with each when she came to leave was gracious and pretty as had been every step of her behaviour when mrs stevenson held out her hand to say goodbye vaekehu took it held it and a moment smiled upon her dropped it and then as upon a kindly afterthought and with a sort of warmth of condescension held out both hands and kissed my wife upon both cheeks given the same relation of years and of rank the thing would have been so done on the boards of the comédie française just so might madame brohan have warmed and condescended to madame broisat in the marquis de villemer it was my part to accompany our guests ashore when i kissed the little girl goodbye at the pier steps vaekehu gave a cry of gratificationreached down her hand into the boat took mine and pressed it with that flattering softness which seems the coquetry of the old lady in every quarter of the earth the next moment she had taken stanislaos arm and they moved off along the pier in the moonlight leaving me bewildered this was a queen of cannibals she was tattooed from hand to foot and perhaps the greatest masterpiece of that art now extant so that a while ago before she was grown prim her leg was one of the sights of taiohae she had been passed from chief to chief she had been fought for and taken in war perhaps being so great a lady she had sat on the high place and throned it there alone of her sex while the drums were going twenty strong and the priests carried up the bloodstained baskets of longpig and now behold her out of that past of violence and sickening feasts step forth in her age a quiet smooth elaborate old lady such as you might find at home mittened also but not often so wellmannered in a score of country houses only vaekehus mittens were of dye not of silk and they had been paid for not in money but the cooked flesh of men it came in my mind with a clap what she could think of it herself and whether at heart perhaps she might not regret and aspire after the barbarous and stirring past but when i asked stanislaoah said he she is content she is religious she passes all her days with the sisters  stanislao stanislaos with the final consonant evaded after the polynesian habit was sent by bishop dordillon to south america and there educated by the fathers his french is fluent his talk sensible and spirited and in his capacity of gangerinchief he is of excellent service to the french with the prestige of his name and family and with the stick when needful he keeps the natives working and the roads passable without stanislao and the convicts i am in doubt what would become of the present regimen in nukahiva whether the highways might not be suffered to close up the pier to wash away and the residency to fall piecemeal about the ears of impotent officials and yet though the hereditary favourer and one of the chief props of french authority he has always an eye upon the past he showed me where the old public place had stood still to be traced by random piles of stone told me how great and fine it was and surrounded on all sides by populous houses whence at the beating of the drums the folk crowded to make holiday the drumbeat of the polynesian has a strange and gloomy stimulation for the nerves of all white persons feel itat these precipitate sounds their hearts beat faster and according to old residents its effect on the natives was extreme bishop dordillon might entreat temoana himself command and threaten at the note of the drum wild instincts triumphed and now it might beat upon these ruins and who should assemble the houses are down the people dead their lineage extinct and the sweepings and fugitives of distant bays and islands encamp upon their graves the decline of the dance stanislao especially laments chaque pays a ses coutumes said he but in the report of any gendarme perhaps corruptly eager to increase the number of délits and the instruments of his own power custom after custom is placed on the expurgatorial index tenez une danse qui nest pas permise said stanislao je ne sais pas pourquoi elle est très jolie elle va comme ça and sticking his umbrella upright in the road he sketched the steps and gestures all his criticisms of the present all his regrets for the past struck me as temperate and sensible the short term of office of the resident he thought the chief defect of the administration that officer having scarce begun to be efficient ere he was recalled i thought i gathered too that he regarded with some fear the coming change from a naval to a civil governor i am sure at least that i regard it so myself for the civil servants of france have never appeared to any foreigner as at all the flower of their country while her naval officers may challenge competition with the world in all his talk stanislao was particular to speak of his own country as a land of savages and when he stated an opinion of his own it was with some apologetic preface alleging that he was a savage who had travelled there was a deal in this elaborate modesty of honest pride yet there was something in the precaution that saddened me and i could not but fear he was only forestalling a taunt that he had heard too often  i recall with interest two interviews with stanislao the first was a certain afternoon of tropic rain which we passed together in the verandah of the club talking at times with heightened voices as the showers redoubled overhead passing at times into the billiardroom to consult in the dim cloudy daylight that map of the world which forms its chief adornment he was naturally ignorant of english history so that i had much of news to communicate the story of gordon i told him in full and many episodes of the indian mutiny lucknow the second battle of cawnpore the relief of arrah the death of poor spottiswoode and sir hugh roses hotspur midland campaign he was intent to hear his brown face strongly marked with smallpox kindled and changed with each vicissitude his eyes glowed with the reflected light of battle his questions were many and intelligent and it was chiefly these that sent us so often to the map but it is of our parting that i keep the strongest sense we were to sail on the morrow and the night had fallen dark gusty and rainy when we stumbled up the hill to bid farewell to stanislao he had already loaded us with gifts but more were waiting we sat about the table over cigars and green cocoanuts claps of wind blew through the house and extinguished the lamp which was always instantly relighted with a single match and these recurrent intervals of darkness were felt as a relief for there was something painful and embarrassing in the kindness of that separation ah vous devriez rester ici mon cher ami cried stanislao vous êtes les gens quil faut pour les kanaques vous êtes doux vous et votre famille vous seriez obéis dans toutes les îles we had been civil not always that my conscience told me and never anything beyond and all this todo is a measure not of our considerateness but of the want of it in others the rest of the evening on to vaekehus and back as far as to the pier stanislao walked with my arm and sheltered me with his umbrella and after the boat had put off we could still distinguish in the murky darkness his gestures of farewell his words if there were any were drowned by the rain and the loud surf  i have mentioned presents a vexed question in the south seas and one which well illustrates the common ignorant habit of regarding races in a lump in many quarters the polynesian gives only to receive i have visited islands where the population mobbed me for all the world like dogs after the waggon of catsmeat and where the frequent proposition you my pleni friend or with more of pathos you all e same my father must be received with hearty laughter and a shout and perhaps everywhere among the greedy and rapacious a gift is regarded as a sprat to catch a whale it is the habit to give gifts and to receive returns and such characters complying with the custom will look to it nearly that they do not lose but for persons of a different stamp the statement must be reversed the shabby polynesian is anxious till he has received the return gift the generous is uneasy until he has made it the first is disappointed if you have not given more than he the second is miserable if he thinks he has given less than you this is my experience if it clash with that of others i pity their fortune and praise mine the circumstance cannot change what i have seen nor lessen what i have received and indeed i find that those who oppose me often argue from a ground of singular presumptions comparing polynesians with an ideal person compact of generosity and gratitude whom i never had the pleasure of encountering and forgetting that what is almost poverty to us is wealth almost unthinkable to them i will give one instance i chanced to speak with consideration of these gifts of stanislaos with a certain clever man a great hater and contemner of kanakas well what were they he cried a pack of old mens beards trash and the same gentleman some half an hour later being upon a different train of thought dwelt at length on the esteem in which the marquesans held that sort of property how they preferred it to all others except land and what fancy prices it would fetch using his own figures i computed that in this commodity alone the gifts of vaekehu and stanislao represented between two and three hundred dollars and the queens official salary is of two hundred and forty in the year  but generosity on the one hand and conspicuous meanness on the other are in the south seas as at home the exception it is neither with any hope of gain nor with any lively wish to please that the ordinary polynesian chooses and presents his gifts a plain social duty lies before him which he performs correctly but without the least enthusiasm and we shall best understand his attitude of mind if we examine our own to the cognate absurdity of marriage presents there we give without any special thought of a return yet if the circumstance arise and the return be withheld we shall judge ourselves insulted we give them usually without affection and almost never with a genuine desire to please and our gift is rather a mark of our own status than a measure of our love to the recipients so in a great measure and with the common run of the polynesians their gifts are formal they imply no more than social recognition and they are made and reciprocated as we pay and return our morning visits and the practice of marking and measuring events and sentiments by presents is universal in the island world a gift plays with them the part of stamp and seal and has entered profoundly into the mind of islanders peace and war marriage adoption and naturalisation are celebrated or declared by the acceptance or the refusal of gifts and it is as natural for the islander to bring a gift as for us to carry a cardcase     chapter x  a portrait and a story   i have had occasion several times to name the late bishop father dordillon monseigneur as he is still almost universally called vicarapostolic of the marquesas and bishop of cambysopolis in partibus everywhere in the islands among all classes and races this fine old kindly cheerful fellow is remembered with affection and respect his influence with the natives was paramount they reckoned him the highest of menhigher than an admiral brought him their money to keep took his advice upon their purchases nor would they plant trees upon their own land till they had the approval of the father of the islands during the time of the french exodus he singly represented europe living in the residency and ruling by the hand of temoana the first roads were made under his auspices and by his persuasion the old road between hatiheu and anaho was got under way from either side on the ground that it would be pleasant for an evening promenade and brought to completion by working on the rivalry of the two villages the priest would boast in hatiheu of the progress made in anaho and he would tell the folk of anaho if you dont take care your neighbours will be over the hill before you are at the top it could not be so done today it could then death opium and depopulation had not gone so far and the people of hatiheu i was told still vied with each other in fine attire and used to go out by families in the cool of the evening boatsailing and racing in the bay there seems some truth at least in the common view that this joint reign of temoana and the bishop was the last and brief golden age of the marquesas but the civil power returned the mission was packed out of the residency at twentyfour hours notice new methods supervened and the golden age whatever it quite was came to an end it is the strongest proof of father dordillons prestige that it survived seemingly without loss this hasty deposition  his method with the natives was extremely mild among these barbarous children he still played the part of the smiling father and he was careful to observe in all indifferent matters the marquesan etiquette thus in the singular system of artificial kinship the bishop had been adopted by vaekehu as a grandson miss fisher of hatiheu as a daughter from that day monseigneur never addressed the young lady except as his mother and closed his letters with the formalities of a dutiful son with europeans he could be strict even to the extent of harshness he made no distinction against heretics with whom he was on friendly terms but the rules of his own church he would see observed and once at least he had a white man clapped in gaol for the desecration of a saints day but even this rigour so intolerable to laymen so irritating to protestants could not shake his popularity we shall best conceive him by examples nearer home we may all have known some divine of the old school in scotland a literal sabbatarian a stickler for the letter of the law who was yet in private modest innocent genial and mirthful much such a man it seems was father dordillon and his popularity bore a test yet stronger he had the name and probably deserved it of a shrewd man in business and one that made the mission pay nothing so much stirs up resentment as the inmixture in commerce of religious bodies but even rival traders spoke well of monseigneur  his character is best portrayed in the story of the days of his decline a time came when from the failure of sight he must desist from his literary labours his marquesan hymns grammars and dictionaries his scientific papers lives of saints and devotional poetry he cast about for a new interest pitched on gardening and was to be seen all day with spade and waterpot in his childlike eagerness actually running between the borders another step of decay and he must leave his garden also instantly a new occupation was devised and he sat in the mission cutting paper flowers and wreaths his diocese was not great enough for his activity the churches of the marquesas were papered with his handiwork and still he must be making more ah said he smiling when i am dead what a fine time you will have clearing out my trash he had been dead about six months but i was pleased to see some of his trophies still exposed and looked upon them with a smile the tribute if i have read this cheerful character aright which he would have preferred to any useless tears disease continued progressively to disable him he who had clambered so stalwartly over the rude rocks of the marquesas bringing peace to warfaring clans was for some time carried in a chair between the mission and the church and at last confined to bed impotent with dropsy and tormented with bedsores and sciatica here he lay two months without complaint and on the 11th january 1888 in the seventyninth year of his life and the thirtyfourth of his labours in the marquesas passed away  those who have a taste for hearing missions protestant or catholic decried must seek their pleasure elsewhere than in my pages whether catholic or protestant with all their gross blots with all their deficiency of candour of humour and of common sense the missionaries are the best and the most useful whites in the pacific this is a subject which will follow us throughout but there is one part of it that may conveniently be treated here the married and the celibate missionary each has his particular advantage and defect the married missionary taking him at the best may offer to the native what he is much in want ofa higher picture of domestic life but the woman at his elbow tends to keep him in touch with europe and out of touch with polynesia and to perpetuate and even to ingrain parochial decencies far best forgotten the mind of the female missionary tends for instance to be continually busied about dress she can be taught with extreme difficulty to think any costume decent but that to which she grew accustomed on clapham common and to gratify this prejudice the native is put to useless expense his mind is tainted with the morbidities of europe and his health is set in danger the celibate missionary on the other hand and whether at best or worst falls readily into native ways of life to which he adds too commonly what is either a mark of celibate man at large or an inheritance from mediæval saintsi mean slovenly habits and an unclean person there are of course degrees in this and the sister of course and all honour to her is as fresh as a lady at a ball for the diet there is nothing to be saidit must amaze and shock the polynesianbut for the adoption of native habits there is much chaque pays a ses coutumes said stanislao these it is the missionarys delicate task to modify and the more he can do so from within and from a native standpoint the better he will do his work and here i think the catholics have sometimes the advantage in the vicariate of dordillon i am sure they had it i have heard the bishop blamed for his indulgence to the natives and above all because he did not rage with sufficient energy against cannibalism it was a part of his policy to live among the natives like an elder brother to follow where he could to lead where it was necessary never to drive and to encourage the growth of new habits instead of violently rooting up the old and it might be better in the longrun if this policy were always followed  it might be supposed that native missionaries would prove more indulgent but the reverse is found to be the case the new broom sweeps clean and the white missionary of today is often embarrassed by the bigotry of his native coadjutor what else should we expect on some islands sorcery polygamy human sacrifice and tobaccosmoking have been prohibited the dress of the native has been modified and himself warned in strong terms against rival sects of christianity all by the same man at the same period of time and with the like authority by what criterion is the convert to distinguish the essential from the unessential he swallows the nostrum whole there has been no play of mind no instruction and except for some brute utility in the prohibitions no advance to call things by their proper names this is teaching superstition it is unfortunate to use the word so few people have read history and so many have dipped into little atheistic manuals that the majority will rush to a conclusion and suppose the labour lost and far from that these semispontaneous superstitions varying with the sect of the original evangelist and the customs of the island are found in practice to be highly fructifying and in particular those who have learned and who go forth again to teach them offer an example to the world the best specimen of the christian hero that i ever met was one of these native missionaries he had saved two lives at the risk of his own like nathan he had bearded a tyrant in his hour of blood when a whole white population fled he alone stood to his duty and his behaviour under domestic sorrow with which the public has no concern filled the beholder with sympathy and admiration a poor little smiling laborious man he looked and you would have thought he had nothing in him but that of which indeed he had too muchfacile goodnature3  it chances that the only rivals of monseigneur and his mission in the marquesas were certain of these brownskinned evangelists natives from hawaii i know not what they thought of father dordillon they are the only class i did not question but i suspect the prelate to have regarded them askance for he was eminently human during my stay at taiohae the time of the yearly holiday came round at the girls school and a whole fleet of whaleboats came from uapu to take the daughters of that island home on board of these was kauwealoha one of the pastors a fine rugged old gentleman of that leonine type so common in hawaii he paid me a visit in the casco and there entertained me with a tale of one of his colleagues kekela a missionary in the great cannibal isle of hivaoa it appears that shortly after a kidnapping visit from a peruvian slaver the boats of an american whaler put into a bay upon that island were attacked and made their escape with difficulty leaving their mate a mr whalon in the hands of the natives the captive with his arms bound behind his back was cast into a house and the chief announced the capture to kekela and here i begin to follow the version of kauwealoha it is a good specimen of kanaka english and the reader is to conceive it delivered with violent emphasis and speaking pantomime  i got melican mate the chief he say what you go do melican mate kekela he say i go make fire i go kill i go eat him he say you come tomollow eat piece i no want eat melican mate kekela he say why you want this bad shippee this slave shippee the chief he say one time a shippee he come from pelu he take away plenty kanaka he take

pantomime and a change indicating that the narrator has left the boat and returned to the beach all the kanaka they say how melican mate he go awayjump in boat low afta violent pantomime and change again to boat kekela he say low quick  here i think kauwealohas pantomime had confused me i have no more of his ipsissima verba and can but add in my own less spirited manner that the ship was reached mr whalon taken aboard and kekela returned to his charge among the cannibals but how unjust it is to repeat the stumblings of a foreigner in a language only partly acquired a thoughtless reader might conceive kauwealoha and his colleague to be a species of amicable baboon but i have here the antidote in return for his act of gallant charity kekela was presented by the american government with a sum of money and by president lincoln personally with a gold watch from his letter of thanks written in his own tongue i give the following extract i do not envy the man who can read it without emotion    when i saw one of your countrymen a citizen of your great nation   illtreated and about to be baked and eaten as a pig is eaten i ran   to save him full of pity and grief at the evil deed of these   benighted people i gave my boat for the strangers life this boat   came from james hunnewell a gift of friendship it became the ransom   of this countryman of yours that he might not be eaten by the savages   who knew not jehovah this was mr whalon and the date jan 14   1864    as to this friendly deed of mine in saving mr whalon its seed came   from your great land and was brought by certain of your countrymen   who had received the love of god it was planted in hawaii and i   brought it to plant in this land and in these dark regions that they   might receive the root of all that is good and true which is love    1 love to jehovah    2 love to self    3 love to our neighbour    if a man have a sufficiency of these three he is good and holy like   his god jehovah in his triune character father son and holy   ghost onethree threeone if he have two and wants one it is not   well and if he have one and wants two this indeed is not well but   if he cherishes all three then is he holy indeed after the manner   of the bible    this is a great thing for your great nation to boast of before all   the nations of the earth from your great land a most precious seed   was brought to the land of darkness it was planted here not by means   of guns and menofwar and threatenings it was planted by means of   the ignorant the neglected the despised such was the introduction   of the word of the almighty god into this group of nuuhiwa great is   my debt to americans who have taught me all things pertaining to this   life and to that which is to come    how shall i repay your great kindness to me thus david asked of   jehovah and thus i ask of you the president of the united states   this is my only paymentthat which i have received of the lord   lovealoha   footnote    3 the reference is to maka the hawaiian missionary at butaritari     in the gilberts     chapter xi  longpiga cannibal high place   nothing more strongly arouses our disgust than cannibalism nothing so surely unmortars a society nothing we might plausibly argue will so harden and degrade the minds of those that practise it and yet we ourselves make much the same appearance in the eyes of the buddhist and the vegetarian we consume the carcases of creatures of like appetites passions and organs with ourselves we feed on babes though not our own and the slaughterhouse resounds daily with screams of pain and fear we distinguish indeed but the unwillingness of many nations to eat the dog an animal with whom we live on terms of the next intimacy shows how precariously the distinction is grounded the pig is the main element of animal food among the islands and i had many occasions my mind being quickened by my cannibal surroundings to observe his character and the manner of his death many islanders live with their pigs as we do with our dogs both crowd around the hearth with equal freedom and the island pig is a fellow of activity enterprise and sense he husks his own cocoanuts and i am told rolls them into the sun to burst he is the terror of the shepherd mrs stevenson senior has seen one fleeing to the woods with a lamb in his mouth and i saw another come rapidly and erroneously to the conclusion that the casco was going down and swim through the flush water to the rail in search of an escape it was told us in childhood that pigs cannot swim i have known one to leap overboard swim five hundred yards to shore and return to the house of his original owner i was once at tautira a pigmaster on a considerable scale at first in my pen the utmost good feeling prevailed a little sow with a bellyache came and appealed to us for help in the manner of a child and there was one shapely black boar whom we called catholicus for he was a particular present from the catholics of the village and who early displayed the marks of courage and friendliness no other animal whether dog or pig was suffered to approach him at his food and for human beings he showed a full measure of that toadying fondness so common in the lower animals and possibly their chief title to the name one day on visiting my piggery i was amazed to see catholicus draw back from my approach with cries of terror and if i was amazed at the change i was truly embarrassed when i learnt its reason one of the pigs had been that morning killed catholicus had seen the murder he had discovered he was dwelling in the shambles and from that time his confidence and his delight in life were ended we still reserved him a long while but he could not endure the sight of any twolegged creature nor could we under the circumstances encounter his eye without confusion i have assisted besides by the ear at the act of butchery itself the victims cries of pain i think i could have borne but the execution was mismanaged and his expression of terror was contagious that small heart moved to the same tune with ours upon such dread foundations the life of the european reposes and yet the european is among the less cruel of races the paraphernalia of murder the preparatory brutalities of his existence are all hid away an extreme sensibility reigns upon the surface and ladies will faint at the recital of one tithe of what they daily expect of their butchers some will be even crying out upon me in their hearts for the coarseness of this paragraph and so with the island cannibals they were not cruel apart from this custom they are a race of the most kindly rightly speaking to cut a mans flesh after he is dead is far less hateful than to oppress him whilst he lives and even the victims of their appetite were gently used in life and suddenly and painlessly despatched at last in island circles of refinement it was doubtless thought bad taste to expatiate on what was ugly in the practice  cannibalism is traced from end to end of the pacific from the marquesas to new guinea from new zealand to hawaii here in the lively haunt of its exercise there by scanty but significant survivals hawaii is the most doubtful we find cannibalism chronicled in hawaii only in the history of a single war where it seems to have been thought exceptional as in the case of mountain outlaws such as fell by the hand of theseus in tahiti a single circumstance survived but that appears conclusive in historic times when human oblation was made in the marae the eyes of the victim were formally offered to the chief a delicacy to the leading guest all melanesia appears tainted in micronesia in the marshalls with which my acquaintance is no more than that of a tourist i could find no trace at all and even in the gilbert zone i long looked and asked in vain i was told tales indeed of men who had been eaten in a famine but these were nothing to my purpose for the same thing is done under the same stress by all kindreds and generations of men at last in some manuscript notes of dr turners which i was allowed to consult at malua i came on one damning evidence on the island of onoatoa the punishment for theft was to be killed and eaten how shall we account for the universality of the practice over so vast an area among people of such varying civilisation and with whatever intermixture of such different blood what circumstance is common to them all but that they lived on islands destitute or very nearly so of animal food i can never find it in my appetite that man was meant to live on vegetables only when our stores ran low among the islands i grew to weary for the recurrent day when economy allowed us to open another tin of miserable mutton and in at least one ocean language a particular word denotes that a man is hungry for fish having reached that stage when vegetables can no longer satisfy and his soul like those of the hebrews in the desert begins to lust after fleshpots add to this the evidences of overpopulation and imminent famine already adduced and i think we see some ground of indulgence for the island cannibal  it is right to look at both sides of any question but i am far from making the apology of this worse than bestial vice the higher polynesian races such as the tahitians hawaiians and samoans had one and all outgrown and some of them had in part forgot the practice before cook or bougainville had shown a topsail in their waters it lingered only in some low islands where life was difficult to maintain and among inveterate savages like the new zealanders or the marquesans the marquesans intertwined maneating with the whole texture of their lives longpig was in a sense their currency and sacrament it formed the hire of the artist illustrated public events and was the occasion and attraction of a feast today they are paying the penalty of this bloody commixture the civil power in its crusade against maneating has had to examine one after another all marquesan arts and pleasures has found them one after another tainted with a cannibal element and one after another has placed them on the proscript list their art of tattooing stood by itself the execution exquisite the designs most beautiful and intricate nothing more handsomely sets off a handsome man it may cost some pain in the beginning but i doubt if it be near so painful in the longrun and i am sure it is far more becoming than the ignoble european practice of tightlacing among women and now it has been found needful to forbid the art their songs and dances were numerous and the law has had to abolish them by the dozen they now face emptyhanded the tedium of their uneventful days and who shall pity them the least rigorous will say that they were justly served  death alone could not satisfy marquesan vengeance the flesh must be eaten the chief who seized mr whalon preferred to eat him and he thought he had justified the wish when he explained it was a vengeance two or three years ago the people of a valley seized and slew a wretch who had offended them his offence it is to be supposed was dire they could not bear to leave their vengeance incomplete and under the eyes of the french they did not dare to hold a public festival the body was accordingly divided and every man retired to his own house to consummate the rite in secret carrying his proportion of the dreadful meat in a swedish matchbox the barbarous substance of the drama and the european properties employed offer a seizing contrast to the imagination yet more striking is another incident of the very year when i was there myself 1888 in the spring a man and woman skulked about the schoolhouse in hivaoa till they found a particular child alone him they approached with honeyed words and carneying mannersyou are soandso son of soandso they asked and caressed and beguiled him deeper in the woods some instinct woke in the childs bosom or some look betrayed the horrid purpose of his deceivers he sought to break from them he screamed and they casting off the mask seized him the more strongly and began to run his cries were heard his schoolmates playing not far off came running to the rescue and the sinister couple fled and vanished in the woods they were never identified no prosecution followed but it was currently supposed they had some grudge against the boys father and designed to eat him in revenge all over the islands as at home among our own ancestors it will be observed that the avenger takes no particular heed to strike an individual a family a class a village a whole valley or island a whole race of mankind share equally the guilt of any member so in the above story the son was to pay the penalty for his father so mr whalon the mate of an american whaler was to bleed and be eaten for the misdeeds of a peruvian slaver i am reminded of an incident in jaluit in the marshall group which was told me by an eyewitness and which i tell here again for the strangeness of the scene two men had awakened the animosity of the jaluit chiefs and it was their wives who were selected to be punished a single native served as executioner early in the morning in the face of a large concourse of spectators he waded out upon the reef between his victims these neither complained nor resisted accompanied their destroyer patiently stooped down when they had waded deep enough at his command and he laying one hand upon the shoulders of each held them under water till they drowned doubtless although my informant did not tell me so their families would be lamenting aloud upon the beach  it was from hatiheu that i paid my first visit to a cannibal high place  the day was sultry and clouded drenching tropical showers succeeded bursts of sweltering sunshine the green pathway of the road wound steeply upward as we went our little schoolboy guide a little ahead of us father simeon had his portfolio in his hand and named the trees for me and read aloud from his notes the abstract of their virtues presently the road mounting showed us the vale of hatiheu on a larger scale and the priest with occasional reference to our guide pointed out the boundaries and told me the names of the larger tribes that lived at perpetual war in the old days one on the northeast one along the beach one behind upon the mountain with a survivor of this latter clan father simeon had spoken until the pacification he had never been to the seas edge nor if i remember exactly eaten of seafish each in its own district the septs lived cantoned and beleaguered one step without the boundaries was to affront death if famine came the men must out to the woods to gather chestnuts and small fruits even as to this day if the parents are backward in their weekly doles school must be broken up and the scholars sent foraging but in the old days when there was trouble in one clan there would be activity in all its neighbours the woods would be laid full of ambushes and he who went after vegetables for himself might remain to be a joint for his hereditary foes nor was the pointed occasion needful a dozen different natural signs and social junctures called this people to the warpath and the cannibal hunt let one of chiefly rank have finished his tattooing the wife of one be near upon her time two of the debouching streams have deviated nearer on the beach of hatiheu a certain bird have been heard to sing a certain ominous formation of cloud observed above the northern sea and instantly the arms were oiled and the manhunters swarmed into the wood to lay their fratricidal ambuscades it appears besides that occasionally perhaps in famine the priest would shut himself in his house where he lay for a stated period like a person dead when he came forth it was to run for three days through the territory of the clan naked and starving and to sleep at night alone in the high place it was now the turn of the others to keep the house for to encounter the priest upon his rounds was death on the eve of the fourth day the time of the running was over the priest returned to his roof the laymen came forth and in the morning the number of the victims was announced i have this tale of the priest on one authorityi think a good onebut i set it down with diffidence the particulars are so striking that had they been true i almost think i must have heard them oftener referred to upon one point there seems to be no question that the feast was sometimes furnished from within the clan in times of scarcity all who were not protected by their family connectionsin the highland expression all the commons of the clanhad cause to tremble it was vain to resist it was useless to flee they were begirt upon all hands by cannibals and the oven was ready to smoke for them abroad in the country of their foes or at home in the valley of their fathers  at a certain corner of the road our scholarguide struck off to his left into the twilight of the forest we were now on one of the ancient native roads plunged in a high vault of wood and clambering it seemed at random over boulders and dead trees but the lad wound in and out and up and down without a check for these paths are to the natives as marked as the kings highway is to us insomuch that in the days of the manhunt it was their labour rather to block and deface than to improve them in the crypt of the wood the air was clammy and hot and cold overhead upon the leaves the tropical rain uproariously poured but only here and there as through holes in a leaky roof a single drop would fall and make a spot upon my mackintosh presently the huge trunk of a banyan hove in sight standing upon what seemed the ruins of an ancient fort and our guide halting and holding forth his arm announced that we had reached the paepae tapu  paepae signifies a floor or platform such as a native house is built on and even such a paepaea paepae haemay be called a paepae tapu in a lesser sense when it is deserted and becomes the haunt of spirits but the public high place such as i was now treading was a thing on a great scale as far as my eyes could pierce through the dark undergrowth the floor of the forest was all paved three tiers of terrace ran on the slope of the hill in front a crumbling parapet contained the main arena and the pavement of that was pierced and parcelled out with several wells and small enclosures no trace remained of any superstructure and the scheme of the amphitheatre was difficult to seize i visited another in hivaoa smaller but more perfect where it was easy to follow rows of benches and to distinguish isolated seats of honour for eminent persons and where on the upper platform a single joist of the temple or deadhouse still remained its uprights richly carved in the old days the high place was sedulously tended no tree except the sacred banyan was suffered to encroach upon its grades no dead leaf to rot upon the pavement the stones were smoothly set and i am told they were kept bright with oil on all sides the guardians lay encamped in their subsidiary huts to watch and cleanse it no other foot of man was suffered to draw near only the priest in the days of his running came there to sleepperhaps to dream of his ungodly errand but in the time of the feast the clan trooped to the high place in a body and each had his appointed seat there were places for the chiefs the drummers the dancers the women and the priests the drumsperhaps twenty strong and some of them twelve feet highcontinuously throbbed in time in time the singers kept up their longdrawn lugubrious ululating song in time too the dancers tricked out in singular finery stepped leaped swayed and gesticulatedtheir plumed fingers fluttering in the air like butterflies the sense of time in all these ocean races is extremely perfect and i conceive in such a festival that almost every sound and movement fell in one so much the more unanimously must have grown the agitation of the feasters so much the more wild must have been the scene to any european who could have beheld them there in the strong sun and the strong shadow of the banyan rubbed with saffron to throw in a more high relief the arabesque of the tattoo the women bleached by days of confinement to a complexion almost european the chiefs crowned with silver plumes of old mens beards and girt with kirtles of the hair of dead women all manner of island food was meanwhile spread for the women and the commons and for those who were privileged to eat of it there were carried up to the deadhouse the baskets of longpig it is told that the feasts were long kept up the people came from them brutishly exhausted with debauchery and the chiefs heavy with their beastly food there are certain sentiments which we call emphatically humandenying the honour of that name to those who lack them in such feastsparticularly where the victim had been slain at home and men banqueting on the poor clay of a comrade with whom they played in infancy or a woman whose favours they had sharedthe whole body of these sentiments is outraged to consider it too closely is to understand if not to excuse these fervours of selfrighteous old shipcaptains who would man their guns and open fire in passing on a cannibal island  and yet it was strange there upon the spot as i stood under the high dripping vault of the forest with the young priest on the one hand in his kilted gown and the brighteyed marquesan schoolboy on the other the whole business appeared infinitely distant and fallen in the cold perspective and dry light of history the bearing of the priest perhaps affected me he smiled he jested with the boy the heir both of these feasters and their meat he clapped his hands and gave me a stave of one of the old illomened choruses centuries might have come and gone since this slimy theatre was last in operation and i beheld the place with no more emotion than i might have felt in visiting stonehenge in hivaoa as i began to appreciate that the thing was still living and latent about my footsteps and that it was still within the bounds of possibility that i might hear the cry of the trapped victim my historic attitude entirely failed and i was sensible of some repugnance for the natives but here too the priests maintained their jocular attitude rallying the cannibals as upon an eccentricity rather absurd than horrible seeking i should say to shame them from the practice by goodnatured ridicule as we shame a child from stealing sugar we may here recognise the temperate and sagacious mind of bishop dordillon     chapter xii  the story of a plantation   taahauku on the southwesterly coast of the island of hivaoatahuku say the slovenly whitesmay be called the port of atuona it is a narrow and small anchorage set between low cliffy points and opening above upon a woody valley a little french fort now disused and deserted overhangs the valley and the inlet atuona itself at the head of the next bay is framed in a theatre of mountains which dominate the more immediate settling of taahauku and give the salient character of the scene they are reckoned at no higher than four thousand feet but tahiti with eight thousand and hawaii with fifteen can offer no such picture of abrupt melancholy alps in the morning when the sun falls directly on their front they stand like a vast wall green to the summit if by any chance the summit should be clearwatercourses here and there delineated on their face as narrow as cracks towards afternoon the light falls more obliquely and the sculpture of the range comes in relief huge gorges sinking into shadow huge tortuous buttresses standing edged with sun at all hours of the day they strike the eye with some new beauty and the mind with the same menacing gloom  the mountains dividing and deflecting the endless airy deluge of the trade are doubtless answerable for the climate a strong draught of wind blew day and night over the anchorage day and night the same fantastic and attenuated clouds fled across the heavens the same dusky cap of rain and vapour fell and rose on the mountain the landbreezes came very strong and chill and the sea like the air was in perpetual bustle the swell crowded into the narrow anchorage like sheep into a fold broke all along both sides high on the one low on the other kept a certain blowhole sounding and smoking like a cannon and spent itself at last upon the beach  on the side away from atuona the sheltering promontory was a nursery of cocotrees some were mere infants none had attained to any size none had yet begun to shoot skyward with that whiplike shaft of the mature palm in the young trees the colour alters with the age and growth now all is of a grasslike hue infinitely dainty next the rib grows golden the fronds remaining green as ferns and then as the trunk continues to mount and to assume its final hue of grey the fans put on manlier and more decided depths of verdure stand out dark upon the distance glisten against the sun and flash like silver fountains in the assault of the wind in this young wood of taahauku all these hues and combinations were exampled and repeated by the score the trees grew pleasantly spaced upon a hilly sward here and there interspersed with a rack for drying copra or a tumbledown hut for storing it every here and there the stroller had a glimpse of the casco tossing in the narrow anchorage below and beyond he had ever before him the dark amphitheatre of the atuona mountains and the cliffy bluff that closes it to seaward the tradewind moving in the fans made a ceaseless noise of summer rain and from time to time with the sound of a sudden and distant drumbeat the surf would burst in a seacave  at the upper end of the inlet its low cliffy lining sinks at both sides into a beach a copra warehouse stands in the shadow of the shoreside trees flitted about for ever by a clan of dwarfish swallows and a line of rails on a high wooden staging bends back into the mouth of the valley walking on this the newlanded traveller becomes aware of a broad freshwater lagoon one arm of which he crosses and beyond of a grove of noble palms sheltering the house of the trader mr keane overhead the cocos join in a continuous and lofty roof blackbirds are heard lustily singing the island cock springs his jubilant rattle and airs his golden plumage cowbells sound far and near in the grove and when you sit in the broad verandah lulled by this symphony you may say to yourself if you are able better fifty years of europe farther on the floor of the valley is flat and green and dotted here and there with stripling cocopalms through the midst with many changes of music the river trots and brawls and along its course where we should look for willows puraos grow in clusters and make shadowy pools after an anglers heart a vale more rich and peaceful sweeter air a sweeter voice of rural sounds i have found nowhere one circumstance alone might strike the experienced here is a convenient beach deep soil good water and yet nowhere any paepaes nowhere any trace of island habitation  it is but a few years since this valley was a place choked with jungle the debatable land and battleground of cannibals two clans laid claim to itneither could substantiate the claim and the roads lay desert or were only visited by men in arms it is for this very reason that it wears now so smiling an appearance cleared planted built upon supplied with railways boathouses and bathhouses for being no mans land it was the more readily ceded to a stranger the stranger was captain john hart ima hati brokenarm the natives call him because when he first visited the islands his arm was in a sling captain hart a man of english birth but an american subject had conceived the idea of cotton culture in the marquesas during the american war and was at first rewarded with success his plantation at anaho was highly productive island cotton fetched a high price and the natives used to debate which was the stronger power ima hati or the french deciding in favour of the captain because though the french had the most ships he had the more money  he marked taahauku for a suitable site acquired it and offered the superintendence to mr robert stewart a fifeshire man already some time in the islands who had just been ruined by a war on tauata mr stewart was somewhat averse to the adventure having some acquaintance with atuona and its notorious chieftain moipu he had once landed there he told me about dusk and found the remains of a man and woman partly eaten on his starting and sickening at the sight one of moipus young men picked up a human foot and provocatively staring at the stranger grinned and nibbled at the heel none need be surprised if mr stewart fled incontinently to the bush lay there all night in a great horror of mind and got off to sea again by daylight on the morrow it was always a bad place atuona commented mr stewart in his homely fifeshire voice in spite of this dire introduction he accepted the captains offer was landed at taahauku with three chinamen and proceeded to clear the jungle  war was pursued at that time almost without interval between the men of atuona and the men of haamau and one day from the opposite sides of the valley battleor i should rather say the noise of battleraged all the afternoon the shots and insults of the opposing clans passing from hill to hill over the heads of mr stewart and his chinamen there was no genuine fighting it was like a bicker of schoolboys only some fool had given the children guns one man died of his exertions in running the only casualty with night the shots and insults ceased the men of haamau withdrew and victory on some occult principle was scored to moipu perhaps in consequence there came a day when moipu made a feast and a party from haamau came under safeconduct to eat of it these passed early by taahauku and some of moipus young men were there to be a guard of honour they were not long gone before there came down from haamau a man his wife and a girl of twelve their daughter bringing fungus several atuona lads were hanging round the store but the day being one of truce none apprehended danger the fungus was weighed and paid for the man of haamau proposed he should have his axe ground in the bargain and mr stewart demurring at the trouble some of the atuona lads offered to grind it for him and set it on the wheel while the axe was grinding a friendly native whispered mr stewart to have a care of himself for there was trouble in hand and all at once the man of haamau was seized and his head and arm stricken from his body the head at one sweep of his own newly sharpened axe in the first alert the girl escaped among the cotton and mr stewart having thrust the wife into the house and locked her in from the outside supposed the affair was over but the business had not passed without noise and it reached the ears of an older girl who had loitered by the way and who now came hastily down the valley crying as she came for her father her too they seized and beheaded i know not what they had done with the axe it was a blunt knife that served their butcherly turn upon the girl and the blood spurted in fountains and painted them from head to foot thus horrible from crime the party returned to atuona carrying the heads to moipu it may be fancied how the feast broke up but it is notable that the guests were honourably suffered to retire these passed back through taahauku in extreme disorder a little after the valley began to be overrun with shouting and triumphing braves and a letter of warning coming at the same time to mr stewart he and his chinamen took refuge with the protestant missionary in atuona that night the store was gutted and the bodies cast in a pit and covered with leaves three days later the schooner had come in and things appearing quieter mr stewart and the captain landed in taahauku to compute the damage and to view the grave which was already indicated by the stench while they were so employed a party of moipus young men decked with red flannel to indicate martial sentiments came over the hills from atuona dug up the bodies washed them in the river and carried them away on sticks that night the feast began  those who knew mr stewart before this experience declare the man to be quite altered he stuck however to his post and somewhat later when the plantation was already well established and gave employment to sixty chinamen and seventy natives he found himself once more in dangerous times the men of haamau it was reported had sworn to plunder and erase the settlement letters came continually from the hawaiian missionary who acted as intelligence department and for six weeks mr stewart and three other whites slept in the cottonhouse at night in a rampart of bales and what was their best defence ostentatiously practised rifleshooting by day upon the beach natives were often there to watch them the practice was excellent and the assault was never deliveredif it ever was intended which i doubt for the natives are more famous for false rumours than for deeds of energy i was told the late french war was a case in point the tribes on the beach accusing those in the mountains of designs which they had never the hardihood to entertain and the same testimony to their backwardness in open battle reached me from all sides captain hart once landed after an engagement in a certain bay one man had his hand hurt an old woman and two children had been slain and the captain improved the occasion by poulticing the hand and taunting both sides upon so wretched an affair it is true these wars were often merely formalcomparable with duels to the first blood captain hart visited a bay where such a war was being carried on between two brothers one of whom had been thought wanting in civility to the guests of the other about onehalf of the population served day about upon alternate sides so as to be well with each when the inevitable peace should follow the forts of the belligerents were over against each other and close by pigs were cooking welloiled braves with welloiled muskets strutted on the paepae or sat down to feast no business however needful could be done and all thoughts were supposed to be centred in this mockery of war a few days later by a regrettable accident a man was killed it was felt at once the thing had gone too far and the quarrel was instantly patched up but the more serious wars were prosecuted in a similar spirit a gift of pigs and a feast made their inevitable end the killing of a single man was a great victory and the murder of defenceless solitaries counted a heroic deed  the foot of the cliffs about all these islands is the place of fishing between taahauku and atuona we saw men but chiefly women some nearly naked some in thin white or crimson dresses perched in little surfbeat promontoriesthe brown precipice overhanging them and the convolvulus overhanging that as if to cut them off the more completely from assistance there they would angle much of the morning and as fast as they caught any fish eat them raw and living where they stood it was such helpless ones that the warriors from the opposite island of tauata slew and carried home and ate and were thereupon accounted mighty men of valour of one such exploit i can give the account of an eyewitness portuguese joe mr keanes cook was once pulling an oar in an atuona boat when they spied a stranger in a canoe with some fish and a piece of tapu the atuona men cried upon him to draw near and have a smoke he complied because i suppose he had no choice but he knew poor devil what he was coming to and as joe said he didnt seem to care about the smoke a few questions followed as to where he came from and what was his business these he must needs answer as he must needs draw at the unwelcome pipe his heart the while drying in his bosom and then of a sudden a big fellow in joes boat leaned over plucked the stranger from his canoe struck him with a knife in the neckinward and downward as joe showed in pantomime more expressive than his wordsand held him under water like a fowl until his struggles ceased whereupon the longpig was hauled on board the boats head turned about for atuona and these marquesan braves pulled home rejoicing moipu was on the beach and rejoiced with them on their arrival poor joe toiled at his oar that day with a white face yet he had no fear for himself they were very good to megave me plenty grub never wished to eat white man said he  if the most horrible experience was mr stewarts it was captain hart himself who ran the nearest danger he had bought a piece of land from timau chief of a neighbouring bay and put some chinese there to work visiting the station with one of the godeffroys he found his chinamen trooping to the beach in terror timau had driven them out seized their effects and was in war attire with his young men a boat was despatched to taahauku for reinforcement as they awaited her return they could see from the deck of the schooner timau and his young men dancing the wardance on the hilltop till past twelve at night and so soon as the boat came bringing three gendarmes armed with chassepots two white men from taahauku station and some native warriors the party set out to seize the chief before he should awake day was not come and it was a very bright moonlight morning when they reached the hilltop where in a house of palmleaves timau was sleeping off his debauch the assailants were fully exposed the interior of the hut quite dark the position far from sound the gendarmes knelt with their pieces ready and captain hart advanced alone as he drew near the door he heard the snap of a gun cocking from within and in sheer selfdefencethere being no other escapesprang into the house and grappled timau timau come with me he cried but timaua great fellow his eyes bloodred with the abuse of kava six foot three in staturecast him on one side and the captain instantly expecting to be either shot or brained discharged his pistol in the dark when they carried timau out at the door into the moonlight he was already dead and upon this unlookedfor termination of their sally the whites appeared to have lost all conduct and retreated to the boats fired upon by the natives as they went captain hart who almost rivals bishop dordillon in popularity shared with him the policy of extreme indulgence to the natives regarding them as children making light of their defects and constantly in favour of mild measures the death of timau has thus somewhat weighed upon his mind the more so as the chieftains musket was found in the house unloaded to a less delicate conscience the matter will seem light if a drunken savage elects to cock a firearm a gentleman advancing towards him in the open cannot wait to make sure if it be charged  i have touched on the captains popularity it is one of the things that most strikes a stranger in the marquesas he comes instantly on two names both new to him both locally famous both mentioned by all with affection and respectthe bishops and the captains it gave me a strong desire to meet with the survivor which was subsequently gratifiedto the enrichment of these pages long after that again in the place dolorousmolokaii came once more on the traces of that affectionate popularity there was a blind white leper there an old sailoran old tough he called himselfwho had long sailed among the eastern islands him i used to visit and being fresh from the scenes of his activity gave him the news this in the true island style was largely a chronicle of wrecks and it chanced i mentioned the case of one not very successful captain and how he had lost a vessel for mr hart thereupon the blind leper broke forth in lamentation did he lose a ship of john harts he cried poor john hart well im sorry it was harts with needless force of epithet which i neglect to reproduce  perhaps if captain harts affairs had continued to prosper his popularity might have been different success wins glory but it kills affection which misfortune fosters and the misfortune which overtook the captains enterprise was truly singular he was at the top of his career ile masse belonged to him given by the french as an indemnity for the robberies at taahauku but the ile masse was only suitable for cattle and his two chief stations were anaho in nukahiva facing the northeast and taahauku in hivaoa some hundred miles to the southward and facing the southwest both these were on the same day swept by a tidal wave which was not felt in any other bay or island of the group the south coast of hivaoa was bestrewn with building timber and camphorwood chests containing goods which on the promise of a reasonable salvage the natives very honestly brought back the chests apparently not opened and some of the wood after it had been built into their houses but the recovery of jetsam could not affect the result it was impossible the captain should withstand this partiality of fortune and with his fall the prosperity of the marquesas ended anaho is truly extinct taahauku but a shadow of itself nor has any new plantation arisen in their stead     chapter xiii  characters   there was a certain traffic in our anchorage at atuona different indeed from the dead inertia and quiescence of the sisterisland nukahiva sails were seen steering from its mouth now it would be a whaleboat manned with native rowdies and heavy with copra for sale now perhaps a single canoe come after commodities to buy the anchorage was besides frequented by fishers not only the lone females perched in niches of the cliff but whole parties who would sometimes camp and build a fire upon the beach and sometimes lie in their canoes in the midst of the haven and jump by turns in the water which they would cast eight or nine feet high to drive as we supposed the fish into their nets the goods the purchasers came to buy were sometimes quaint i remarked one outrigger returning with a single ham swung from a pole in the stern and one day there came into mr keanes store a charming lad excellently mannered speaking french correctly though with a babyish accent very handsome too and much of a dandy as was shown not only in his shining raiment but by the nature of his purchases these were five shipbiscuits a bottle of scent and two balls of washing blue he was from tauata whither he returned the same night in an outrigger daring the deep with these youngladyish treasures the gross of the native passengers were more illfavoured tall powerful fellows well tattooed and with disquieting manners something coarse and jeering distinguished them and i was often reminded of the slums of some great city one night as dusk was falling a whaleboat put in on that part of the beach where i chanced to be alone six or seven ruffianly fellows scrambled out all had enough english to give me goodbye which was the ordinary salutation or goodmorning which they seemed to regard as an intensitive jests followed they surrounded me with harsh laughter and rude looks and i was glad to move away i had not yet encountered mr stewart or i should have been reminded of his first landing at atuona and the humorist who nibbled at the heel but their neighbourhood depressed me and i felt if i had been there a castaway and out of reach of help my heart would have been sick  nor was the traffic altogether native while we lay in the anchorage there befell a strange coincidence a schooner was observed at sea and aiming to enter we knew all the schooners in the group but this appeared larger than any she was rigged besides after the english manner and coming to an anchor some way outside the casco showed at last the blue ensign there were at that time according to rumour no fewer than four yachts in the pacific but it was strange that any two of them should thus lie side by side in that outlandish inlet stranger still that in the owner of the nyanza captain dewar i should find a man of the same country and the same county with myself and one whom i had seen walking as a boy on the shores of the alpes maritimes  we had besides a white visitor from shore who came and departed in a crowded whaleboat manned by natives having read of yachts in the sunday papers and being fired with the desire to see one captain chase as they called him an old whalerman thickset and whitebearded with a strong indiana drawl years old in the country a good backer in battle and one of those dead shots whose practice at the target struck terror in the braves of haamau captain chase dwelt farther east in a bay called hanamate with a mr mcallum or rather they had dwelt together once and were now amicably separated the captain is to be found near one end of the bay in a wreck of a house and waited on by a chinese at the point of the opposing corner another habitation stands on a tall paepae the surf runs there exceeding heavy seas of seven and eight feet high bursting under the walls of the house which is thus continually filled with their clamour and rendered fit only for solitary or at least for silent inmates here it is that mr mcallum with a shakespeare and a burns enjoys the society of the breakers his name and his burns testify to scottish blood but he is an american born somewhere far east followed the trade of a shipcarpenter and was long employed the captain of a hundred indians breaking up wrecks about cape flattery many of the whites who are to be found scattered in the south seas represent the more artistic portion of their class and not only enjoy the poetry of that new life but came there on purpose to enjoy it i have been shipmates with a man no longer young who sailed upon that voyage his first time to sea for the mere love of samoa and it was a few letters in a newspaper that sent him on that pilgrimage mr mcallum was another instance of the same he had read of the south seas loved to read of them and let their image fasten in his heart till at length he could refrain no longermust set forth a new rudel for that unseen homelandand has now dwelt for years in hivaoa and will lay his bones there in the end with full content having no desire to behold again the places of his boyhood only perhapsonce before he diesthe rude and wintry landscape of cape flattery yet he is an active man full of schemes has bought land of the natives has planted five thousand cocopalms has a desert island in his eye which he desires to lease and a schooner in the stocks which he has laid and built himself and even hopes to finish mr mcallum and i did not meet but like gallant troubadours corresponded in verse i hope he will not consider it a breach of copyright if i give here a specimen of his muse he and bishop dordillon are the two european bards of the marquesas    sail ho ahoy casco      first among the pleasure fleet      that came around to greet    these isles from san francisco     and first too only one      among the literary men      that this way has ever been    welcome then to stevenson     please not offended be      at this little notice      of the casco captain otis    with the novelists family     avoir une voyage magnifical      is our wish sincere      that youll have from here    allant sur la grande pacifical  but our chief visitor was one mapiao a great tahukuwhich seems to mean priest wizard tattooer practiser of any art or in a word esoteric personand a man famed for his eloquence on public occasions and witty talk in private his first appearance was typical of the man he came down clamorous to the eastern landing where the surf was running very high scorned all our signals to go round the bay carried his point was brought aboard at some hazard to our skiff and set down in one corner of the cockpit to his appointed task he had been hired as one cunning in the art to make my old mens beards into a wreath what a wreath for celias arbour his own beard which he carried for greater safety in a sailors knot was not merely the adornment of his age but a substantial piece of property one hundred dollars was the estimated value and as brother michel never knew a native to deposit a greater sum with bishop dordillon our friend was a rich man in virtue of his chin he had something of an east indian cast but taller and stronger his nose hooked his face narrow his forehead very high the whole elaborately tattooed i may say i have never entertained a guest so trying in the least particular he must be waited on he would not go to the scuttlebutt for water it must be given him in his hand if aid were denied him he would fold his arms bow his head and go without only the work would suffer early the first forenoon he called aloud for biscuit and salmon biscuit and ham were brought he looked on them inscrutably and signed they should be set aside a number of considerations crowded on my mind how the sort of work on which he was engaged was probably tapu in a higher degree should by rights perhaps be transacted on a tapu platform which no female might approach and it was possible that fish might be the essential diet some salted fish i therefore brought him and along with that a glass of rum at sight of which mapiao displayed extraordinary animation pointed to the zenith made a long speech in which i picked up umatithe word for the sunand signed to me once more to place these dainties out of reach at last i had understood and every day the programme was the same at an early period of the morning his dinner must be set forth on the roof of the house and at a proper distance full in view but just out of reach and not until the fit hour which was the point of noon would the artificer partake this solemnity was the cause of an absurd misadventure he was seated plaiting as usual at the beards his dinner arrayed on the roof and not far off a glass of water standing it appears he desired to drink was of course far too great a gentleman to rise and get the water for himself and spying mrs stevenson imperiously signed to her to hand it the signal was misunderstood mrs stevenson was by this time prepared for any eccentricity on the part of our guest and instead of passing him the water flung his dinner overboard i must do mapiao justice all laughed but his laughter rang the loudest  these troubles of service were at worst occasional the embarrassment of the mans talk incessant he was plainly a practised conversationalist the nicety of his inflections the elegance of his gestures and the fine play of his expression told us that we meanwhile sat like aliens in a playhouse we could see the actors were upon some material business and performing well but the plot of the drama remained undiscoverable names of places the name of captain hart occasional disconnected words tantalised without enlightening us and the less we understood the more gallantly the more copiously and with still the more explanatory gestures mapiao returned to the assault we could see his vanity was on the rack being come to a place where that fine jewel of his conversational talent could earn him no respect and he had times of despair when he desisted from the endeavour and instants of irritation when he regarded us with unconcealed contempt yet for me as the practitioner of some kindred mystery to his own he manifested to the last a measure of respect as we sat under the awning in opposite corners of the cockpit he braiding hairs from dead mens chins i forming runes upon a sheet of folio paper he would nod across to me as one tahuku to another or crossing the cockpit study for a while my shapeless scrawl and encourage me with a heartfelt mitaigood so might a deaf painter sympathise far off with a musician as the slave and master of some uncomprehended and yet kindred art a silly trade he doubtless considered it but a man must make an allowance for barbarians chaque pays a ses coutumesand he felt the principle was there  the time came at last when his labours which resembled those rather of penelope than hercules could be no more spun out and nothing remained but to pay him and say farewell after a long learned argument in marquesan i gathered that his mind was set on fishhooks with three of which and a brace of dollars i thought he was not ill rewarded for passing his forenoons in our cockpit eating drinking delivering his opinions and pressing the ships company into his menial service for all that he was a man of so high a bearing and so like an uncle of my own who should have gone mad and got tattooed that i applied to him when we were both on shore to know if he were satisfied mitai ehipe i asked and he with rich unction offering at the same time his handmitai ehipe mitai kaekae kaoha nuior to translate freely the ship is good the victuals are up to the mark and we part in friendship which testimonial uttered he set off along the beach with his head bowed and the air of one deeply injured  i saw him go on my side with relief it would be more interesting to learn how our relation seemed to mapiao his exigence we may suppose was merely loyal he had been hired by the ignorant to do a piece of work and he was bound that he would do it the right way countless obstacles continual ignorant ridicule availed not to dissuade him he had his dinner laid out watched it as was fit the while he worked ate it at the fit hour was in all things served and waited on and could take his hire in the end with a clear conscience telling himself the mystery was performed duly the beards rightfully braided and we in spite of ourselves correctly served his view of our stupidity even he the mighty talker must have lacked language to express he never interfered with my tahuku work civilly praised it idle as it seemed civilly supposed that i was competent in my own mystery such being the attitude of the intelligent and the polite and we on the other handwho had yet the most to gain or lose since the product was to be ourswho had professed our disability by the very act of hiring him to do itwere never weary of impeding his own more important labours and sometimes lacked the sense and the civility to refrain from laughter     chapter xiv  in a cannibal valley   the road from taahauku to atuona skirted the northwesterly side of the anchorage somewhat high up edged and sometimes shaded by the splendid flowers of the flamboyantits english name i do not know at the turn of the land atuona came in view a long beach a heavy and loud breach of surf a shoreside village scattered among trees and the guttered mountains drawing near on both sides above a narrow and rich ravine its infamous repute perhaps affected me but i thought it the loveliest and by far the most ominous and gloomy spot on earth beautiful it surely was and even more salubrious the healthfulness of the whole group is amazing that of atuona almost in the nature of a miracle in atuona a village planted in a shoreside marsh the houses standing everywhere intermingled with the pools of a tarogarden we find every condition of tropical danger and discomfort and yet there are not even mosquitoesnot even the hateful dayfly of nukahivaand fever and its concomitant the island feefee4 are unknown  this is the chief station of the french on the maneating isle of hivaoa the sergeant of gendarmerie enjoys the style of the viceresident and hoists the french colours over a quite extensive compound a chinaman a waif from the plantation keeps a restaurant in the rear quarters of the village and the mission is well represented by the sisters school and brother michels church father orens a wonderful octogenarian his frame scarce bowed the fire of his eye undimmed has lived and trembled and suffered in this place since 1843 again and again when moipu had made cocobrandy he has been driven from his house into the woods a mouse that dwelt in a cats ear had a more easy restingplace and yet i have never seen a man that bore less mark of years he must show us the church still decorated with the bishops artless ornaments of paperthe last work of industrious old hands and the last earthly amusement of a man that was much of a hero in the sacristy we must see his sacred vessels and in particular a vestment which was a vraie curiosité because it had been given by a gendarme to the protestant there is always something embarrassing in the eagerness with which grown and holy men regard these trifles but it was touching and pretty to see orens his aged eyes shining in his head display his sacred treasures  august 26the vale behind the village narrowing swiftly to a mere ravine was choked with profitable trees a river gushed in the midst overhead the tall cocopalms made a primary covering above that from one wall of the mountain to another the ravine was roofed with cloud so that we moved below amid teeming vegetation in a covered house of heat on either hand at every hundred yards instead of the houseless disembowelling paepaes of nukahiva populous houses turned out their inhabitants to cry kaoha to the passersby the road too was busy strings of girls fair and foul as in less favoured countries men bearing breadfruit the sisters with a little guard of pupils a fellow bestriding a horsepassed and greeted us continually and now it was a chinaman who came to the gate of his floweryard and gave us goodday in excellent english and a little farther on it would be some natives who set us down by the wayside made us a feast of mummyapple and entertained us as we ate with drumming on a tin case with all this fine plenty of men and fruit death is at work here also the population according to the highest estimate does not exceed six hundred in the whole vale of atuona and yet when i once chanced to put the question brother michel counted up ten whom he knew to be sick beyond recovery it was here too that i could at last gratify my curiosity with the sight of a native house in the very article of dissolution it had fallen flat along the paepae its poles sprawling ungainly the rains and the mites contended against it what remained seemed sound enough but much was gone already and it was easy to see how the insects consumed the walls as if they had been bread and the air and the rain ate into them like vitriol  a little ahead of us a young gentleman very well tattooed and dressed in a pair of white trousers and a flannel shirt had been marching unconcernedly of a sudden without apparent cause he turned back took us in possession and led us undissuadably along a bypath to the rivers edge there in a nook of the most attractive amenity he bade us to sit down the stream splashing at our elbow a shock of nondescript greenery enshrining us from above and thither after a brief absence he brought us a cocoanut a lump of sandalwood and a stick he had begun to carve the nut for present refreshment the sandalwood for a precious gift and the stickin the simplicity of his vanityto harvest premature praise only one section was yet carved although the whole was pencilmarked in lengths and when i proposed to buy it poni for that was the artists name recoiled in horror but i was not to be moved and simply refused restitution for i had long wondered why a people who displayed in their tattooing so great a gift of arabesque invention should display it nowhere else here at last i had found something of the same talent in another medium and i held the incompleteness in these days of worldwide brummagem for a happy mark of authenticity neither my reasons nor my purpose had i the means of making clear to poni i could only hold on to the stick and bid the artist follow me to the gendarmerie where i should find interpreters and money but we gave him in the meanwhile a boatcall in return for his sandalwood as he came behind us down the vale he sounded upon this continually and continually from the wayside houses there poured forth little groups of girls in crimson or of men in white and to these must poni pass the news of who the strangers were of what they had been doing of why it was that poni had a boatwhistle and of why he was now being haled to the viceresidency uncertain whether to be punished or rewarded uncertain whether he had lost a stick or made a bargain but hopeful on the whole and in the meanwhile highly consoled by the boatwhistle whereupon he would tear himself away from this particular group of inquirers and once more we would hear the shrill call in our wake  august 27i made a more extended circuit in the vale with brother michel we were mounted on a pair of sober nags suitable to these rude paths the weather was exquisite and the company in which i found myself no less agreeable than the scenes through which i passed we mounted at first by a steep grade along the summit of one of those twisted spurs that from a distance mark out provinces of sun and shade upon the mountainside the ground fell away on either hand with an extreme declivity from either hand out of profound ravines mounted the song of falling water and the smoke of household fires here and there the hills of foliage would divide and our eye would plunge down upon one of these deepnested habitations and still high in front arose the precipitous barrier of the mountain greened over where it seemed that scarce a harebell could find root barred with the zigzags of a human road where it seemed that not a goat could scramble and in truth for all the labour that it cost the road is regarded even by the marquesans as impassable they will not risk a horse on that ascent and those who lie to the westward come and go in their canoes i never knew a hill to lose so little on a near approach a consequence i must suppose of its surprising steepness when we turned about i was amazed to behold so deep a view behind and so high a shoulder of blue sea crowned by the whalelike island of motane and yet the wall of mountain had not visibly dwindled and i could even have fancied as i raised my eyes to measure it that it loomed higher than before  we struck now into covert paths crossed and heard more near at hand the bickering of the streams and tasted the coolness of those recesses where the houses stood the birds sang about us as we descended all along our path my guide was being hailed by voices mikaëlkaoha mikaël from the doorstep from the cottonpatch or out of the deep grove of islandchestnuts these friendly cries arose and were cheerily answered as we passed in a sharp angle of a glen on a rushing brook and under fathoms of cool foliage we struck a house upon a wellbuilt paepae the fire brightly burning under the popoished against the evening meal and here the cries became a chorus and the house folk running out obliged us to dismount and breathe it seemed a numerous family we saw eight at least and one of these honoured me with a particular attention this was the mother a woman naked to the waist of an aged countenance but with hair still copious and black and breasts still erect and youthful on our arrival i could see she remarked me but instead of offering any greeting disappeared at once into the bush thence she returned with two crimson flowers goodbye was her salutation uttered not without coquetry and as she said it she pressed the flowers into my handgoodbye i speak inglis it was from a whalerman who she informed me was a plenty good chap that she had learned my language and i could not but think how handsome she must have been in these times of her youth and could not but guess that some memories of the dandy whalerman prompted her attentions to myself nor could i refrain from wondering what had befallen her lover in the rain and mire of what seaports he had tramped since then in what close and garish drinkingdens had found his pleasure and in the ward of what infirmary dreamed his last of the marquesas but she the more fortunate lived on in her green island the talk in this lost house upon the mountains ran chiefly upon mapiao and his visits to the casco the news of which had probably gone abroad by then to all the island so that there was no paepae in hivaoa where they did not make the subject of excited comment  not much beyond we came upon a high place in the foot of the ravine two roads divided it and met in the midst save for this intersection the amphitheatre was strangely perfect and had a certain ruder air of things roman depths of foliage and the bulk of the mountain kept it in a grateful shadow on the benches several young folk sat clustered or apart one of these a girl perhaps fourteen years of age buxom and comely caught the eye of brother michel why was she not at schoolshe was done with school now what was she doing hereshe lived here now why sono answer but a deepening blush there was no severity in brother michels manner the girls own confusion told her story elle a honte was the missionarys comment as we rode away near by in the stream a grown girl was bathing naked in a goyle between two steppingstones and it amused me to see with what alacrity and real alarm she bounded on her manycoloured underclothes even in these daughters of cannibals shame was eloquent  it is in hivaoa owing to the inveterate cannibalism of the natives that local beliefs have been most rudely trodden underfoot it was here that three religious chiefs were set under a bridge and the women of the valley made to defile over their heads upon the roadway the poor dishonoured fellows sitting there all observers agree with streaming tears not only was one road driven across the high place but two roads intersected in its midst there is no reason to suppose that the last was done of purpose and perhaps it was impossible entirely to avoid the numerous sacred places of the islands but these things are not done without result i have spoken already of the regard of marquesans for the dead making as it does so strange a contrast with their unconcern for death early on this days ride for instance we encountered a petty chief who inquired of course where we were going and suggested by way of amendment why do you not rather show him the cemetery i saw it it was but newly opened the third within eight years they are great builders here in hivaoa i saw in my ride paepaes that no european drystone mason could have equalled the black volcanic stones were laid so justly the corners were so precise the levels so true but the retainingwall of the new graveyard stood apart and seemed to be a work of love the sentiment of honour for the dead is therefore not extinct and yet observe the consequence of violently countering mens opinions of the four prisoners in atuona gaol three were of course thieves the fourth was there for sacrilege he had levelled up a piece of the graveyardto give a feast upon as he informed the courtand declared he had no thought of doing wrong why should he he had been forced at the point of the bayonet to destroy the sacred places of his own piety when he had recoiled from the task he had been jeered at for a superstitious fool and now it is supposed he will respect our european superstitions as by second nature   footnote    4 elephantiasis     chapter xv  the two chiefs of atuona   it had chanced as the casco beat through the bordelais straits for taahauku she approached on one board very near the land in the opposite isle of tauata where houses were to be seen in a grove of tall cocopalms brother michel pointed out the spot i am at home now said he i believe i have a large share in these cocoanuts and in that house madame my mother lives with her two husbands with two husbands somebody inquired cest ma honte replied the brother drily  a word in passing on the two husbands i conceive the brother to have expressed himself loosely it seems common enough to find a native lady with two consorts but these are not two husbands the first is still the husband the wife continues to be referred to by his name and the position of the coadjutor or pikio although quite regular appears undoubtedly subordinate we had opportunities to observe one household of the sort the pikio was recognised appeared openly along with the husband when the lady was thought to be insulted and the pair made common cause like brothers at home the inequality was more apparent the husband sat to receive and entertain visitors the pikio was running the while to fetch cocoanuts like a hired servant and i remarked he was sent on these errands in preference even to the son plainly we have here no second husband plainly we have the tolerated lover only in the marquesas instead of carrying his ladys fan and mantle he must turn his hand to do the husbands housework  the sight of brother michels family estate led the conversation for some while upon the method and consequence of artificial kinship our curiosity became extremely whetted the brother offered to have the whole of us adopted and some two days later we became accordingly the children of paaaeua appointed chief of atuona i was unable to be present at the ceremony which was primitively simple the two mrs stevensons and mr osbourne along with paaaeua his wife and an adopted child of theirs son of a shipwrecked austrian sat down to an excellent island meal of which the principal and the only necessary dish was pig a concourse watched them through the apertures of the house but none not even brother michel might partake for the meal was sacramental and either creative or declaratory of the new relationship in tahiti things are not so strictly ordered when ori and i made brothers both our families sat with us at table yet only he and i who had eaten with intention were supposed to be affected by the ceremony for the adoption of an infant i believe no formality to be required the child is handed over by the natural parents and grows up to inherit the estates of the adoptive presents are doubtless exchanged as at all junctures of island life social or international but i never heard of any banquetthe childs presence at the daily board perhaps sufficing we may find the rationale in the ancient arabian idea that a common diet makes a common blood with its derivative axiom that he is the father who gives the child its morning draught in the marquesan practice the sense would thus be evanescent from the tahitian a mere survival it will have entirely fled an interesting parallel will probably occur to many of my readers  what is the nature of the obligation assumed at such a festival it will vary with the characters of those engaged and with the circumstances of the case thus it would be absurd to take too seriously our adoption at atuona on the part of paaaeua it was an affair of social ambition when he agreed to receive us in his family the man had not so much as seen us and knew only that we were inestimably rich and travelled in a floating palace we upon our side ate of his baked meats with no true animus affiliandi but moved by the single sentiment of curiosity the affair was formal and a matter of parade as when in europe sovereigns call each other cousin yet had we stayed at atuona paaaeua would have held himself bound to establish us upon his land and to set apart young men for our service and trees for our support i have mentioned the austrian he sailed in one of two sister ships which left the clyde in coal both rounded the horn and both at several hundred miles of distance though close on the same point of time took fire at sea on the pacific one was destroyed the derelict iron frame of the second after long aimless cruising was at length recovered refitted and hails today from san francisco a boats crew from one of these disasters reached after great hardships the isle of hivaoa some of these men vowed they would never again confront the chances of the sea but alone of them all the austrian has been exactly true to his engagement remains where he landed and designs to die where he has lived now with such a man falling and taking root among islanders the processes described may be compared to a gardeners graft he passes bodily into the native stock ceases wholly to be alien has entered the commune of the blood shares the prosperity and consideration of his new family and is expected to impart with the same generosity the fruits of his european skill and knowledge it is this implied engagement that so frequently offends the ingrafted white to snatch an immediate advantageto get let us say a station for his storehe will play upon the native custom and become a son or a brother for the day promising himself to cast down the ladder by which he shall have ascended and repudiate the kinship so soon as it shall grow burdensome and he finds there are two parties to the bargain perhaps his polynesian relative is simple and conceived the bloodbond literally perhaps he is shrewd and himself entered the covenant with a view to gain and either way the store is ravaged the house littered with lazy natives and the richer the man grows the more numerous the more idle and the more affectionate he finds his native relatives most men thus circumstanced contrive to buy or brutally manage to enforce their independence but many vegetate without hope strangled by parasites  we had no cause to blush with brother michel our new parents were kind gentle wellmannered and generous in gifts the wife was a most motherly woman the husband a man who stood justly high with his employers enough has been said to show why moipu should be deposed and in paaaeua the french had found a reputable substitute he went always scrupulously dressed and looked the picture of propriety like a dark handsome stupid and probably religious young man hot from a european funeral in character he seemed the ideal of what is known as the good citizen he wore gravity like an ornament none could more nicely represent the desired character as an appointed chief the outpost of civilisation and reform and yet were the french to go and native manners to revive fancy beholds him crowned with old mens beards and crowding with the first to a maneating festival but i must not seem to be unjust to paaaeua his respectability went deeper than the skin his sense of the becoming sometimes nerved him for unexpected rigours  one evening captain otis and mr osbourne were on shore in the village all was agog dancing had begun it was plain it was to be a night of festival and our adventurers were overjoyed at their good fortune a strong fall of rain drove them for shelter to the house of paaaeua where they were made welcome wiled into a chamber and shut in presently the rain took off the fun was to begin in earnest and the young bloods of atuona came round the house and called to my fellowtravellers through the interstices of the wall late into the night the calls were continued and resumed and sometimes mingled with taunts late into the night the prisoners tantalised by the noises of the festival renewed their efforts to escape but all was vain right across the door lay that godfearing householder paaaeua feigning sleep and my friends had to forego their junketing in this incident so delightfully european we thought we could detect three strands of sentiment in the first place paaaeua had a charge of souls these were young men and he judged it right to withhold them from the primrose path secondly he was a public character and it was not fitting that his guests should countenance a festival of which he disapproved so might some strict clergyman at home address a worldly visitor go to the theatre if you like but by your leave not from my house thirdly paaaeua was a man jealous and with some cause as shall be shown for jealousy and the feasters were the satellites of his immediate rival moipu  for the adoption had caused much excitement in the village it made the strangers popular paaaeua in his difficult posture of appointed chief drew strength and dignity from their alliance and only moipu and his followers were malcontent for some reason nobody except myself appears to dislike moipu captain hart who has been robbed and threatened by him father orens whom he has fired at and repeatedly driven to the woods my own family and even the french officialsall seemed smitten with an irrepressible affection for the man his fall had been made soft his son upon his death was to succeed paaaeua in the chieftaincy and he lived at the time of our visit in the shoreward part of the village in a good house and with a strong following of young men his late braves and pothunters in this society the coming of the casco the adoption the return feast on board and the presents exchanged between the whites and their new parents were doubtless eagerly and bitterly canvassed it was felt that a few years ago the honours would have gone elsewhere in this unwonted business in this reception of some hitherto undreamedof and outlandish potentatesome prester john or old assaracusa few years back it would have been the part of moipu to play the hero and the host and his young men would have accompanied and adorned the various celebrations as the acknowledged leaders of society and now by a malign vicissitude of fortune moipu must sit in his house quite unobserved and his young men could but look in at the door while their rivals feasted perhaps m grévy felt a touch of bitterness towards his successor when he beheld him figure on the broad stage of the centenary of eightynine the visit of the casco which moipu had missed by so few years was a more unusual occasion in atuona than a centenary in france and the dethroned chief determined to reassert himself in the public eye  mr osbourne had gone into atuona photographing the population of the village had gathered together for the occasion on the place before the church and paaaeua highly delighted with this new appearance of his family played the master of ceremonies the church had been taken with its jolly architect before the door the nuns with their pupils sundry damsels in the ancient and singularly unbecoming robes of tapa and father orens in the midst of a group of his parishioners i know not what else was in hand when the photographer became aware of a sensation in the crowd and looking around beheld a very noble figure of a man appear upon the margin of a thicket and stroll nonchalantly near the nonchalance was visibly affected it was plain that he came there to arouse attention and his success was instant he was introduced he was civil he was obliging he was always ineffably superior and certain of himself a wellgraced actor it was presently suggested that he should appear in his war costume he gracefully consented and returned in that strange inappropriate and illomened array which very well became his handsome person to strut in a circle of admirers and be thenceforth the centre of photography thus had moipu effected his introduction as by accident to the white strangers made it a favour to display his finery and reduced his rival to a secondary rôle on the theatre of the disputed village paaaeua felt the blow and with a spirit we never dreamed he could possess asserted his priority it was found impossible that day to get a photograph of moipu alone for whenever he stood up before the camera his successor placed himself unbidden by his side and gently but firmly held to his position the portraits of the pair jacob and esau standing shoulder to shoulder one in his careful european dress one in his barbaric trappings figure the past and present of their island a graveyard with its humble crosses would be the aptest symbol of the future  we are all impressed with the belief that moipu had planned his campaign from the beginning to the end it is certain that he lost no time in pushing his advantage mr osbourne was inveigled to his house various gifts were fished out of an old seachest father orens was called into service as interpreter and moipu formally proposed to make brothers with matagalahiglasseyesthe not very euphonious name under which mr osbourne passed in the marquesas the feast of brotherhood took place on board the casco paaaeua had arrived with his family like a plain man and his presents which had been numerous had followed one another at intervals through several days moipu as if to mark at every point the opposition came with a certain feudal pomp attended by retainers bearing gifts of all descriptions from plumes of old mens beard to little pious catholic engravings  i had met the man before this in the village and detested him on sight there was something indescribably raffish in his looks and ways that raised my gorge and when maneating was referred to and he laughed a low cruel laugh part boastful part bashful like one reminded of some dashing peccadillo my repugnance was mingled with nausea this is no very human attitude nor one at all becoming in a traveller and seen more privately the man improved something negroid in character and face was still displeasing but his ugly mouth became attractive when he smiled his figure and bearing were certainly noble and his eyes superb in his appreciation of jams and pickles in his delight in the reverberating mirrors of the dining cabin and consequent endless repetition of moipus and matagalahis he showed himself engagingly a child and yet i am not sure and what seemed childishness may have been rather courtly art his manners struck me as beyond the mark they were refined and caressing to the point of grossness and when i think of the serene absentmindedness with which he first strolled in upon our party and then recall him running on hands and knees along the cabin sofas pawing the velvet dipping into the beds and bleating commendatory mitais with exaggerated emphasis like some enormous overmannered ape i feel the more sure that both must have been calculated and i sometimes wonder next if moipu were quite alone in this polite duplicity and ask myself whether the casco were quite so much admired in the marquesas as our visitors desired us to suppose  i will complete this sketch of an incurable cannibal grandee with two incongruous traits his favourite morsel was the human hand of which he speaks today with an illfavoured lustfulness and when he said goodbye to mrs stevenson holding her hand viewing her with tearful eyes and chanting his farewell improvisation in the falsetto of marquesan high society he wrote upon her mind a sentimental impression which i try in vain to share     part ii  the paumotus     chapter i  the dangerous archipelagoatolls at a distance   in the early morning of 4th september a whaleboat manned by natives dragged us down the green lane of the anchorage and round the spouting promontory on the shore level it was a hot breathless and yet crystal morning but high overhead the hills of atuona were all cowled in cloud and the oceanriver of the trades streamed without pause as we crawled from under the immediate shelter of the land we reached at last the limit of their influence the wind fell upon our sails in puffs which strengthened and grew more continuous presently the casco heeled down to her days work the whaleboat quite outstripped clung for a noisy moment to her quarter the stipulated bread rum and tobacco were passed in a moment more and the boat was in our wake and our late pilots were cheering our departure  this was the more inspiriting as we were bound for scenes so different and though on a brief voyage yet for a new province of creation that wide field of ocean called loosely the south seas extends from tropic to tropic and from perhaps 120 degrees w to 150 degrees e a parallelogram of one hundred degrees by fortyseven where degrees are the most spacious much of it lies vacant much is closely sown with isles and the isles are of two sorts no distinction is so continually dwelt upon in south sea talk as that between the low and the high island and there is none more broadly marked in nature the himalayas are not more different from the sahara on the one hand and chiefly in groups of from eight to a dozen volcanic islands rise above the sea few reach an altitude of less than 4000 feet one exceeds 13000 their tops are often obscured in cloud they are all clothed with various forests all abound in food and are all remarkable for picturesque and solemn scenery on the other hand we have the atoll a thing of problematic origin and history the reputed creature of an insect apparently unidentified rudely annular in shape enclosing a lagoon rarely extending beyond a quarter of a mile at its chief width often rising at its highest point to less than the stature of a manman himself the rat and the land crab its chief inhabitants not more variously supplied with plants and offering to the eye even when perfect only a ring of glittering beach and verdant foliage enclosing and enclosed by the blue sea  in no quarter are the atolls so thickly congregated in none are they so varied in size from the greatest to the least and in none is navigation so beset with perils as in that archipelago that we were now to thread the huge system of the trades is for some reason quite confounded by this multiplicity of reefs the wind intermits squalls are frequent from the west and southwest hurricanes are known the currents are besides inextricably intermixed dead reckoning becomes a farce the charts are not to be trusted and such is the number and similarity of these islands that even when you have picked one up you may be none the wiser the reputation of the place is consequently infamous insurance offices exclude it from their field and it was not without misgiving that my captain risked the casco in such waters i believe indeed it is almost understood that yachts are to avoid this baffling archipelago and it required all my instancesand all mr otiss private taste for adventureto deflect our course across its midst  for a few days we sailed with a steady trade and a steady westerly current setting us to leeward and toward sundown of the seventh it was supposed we should have sighted takaroa one of cooks socalled king george islands the sun set yet a while longer the old moonsemibrilliant herself and with a silver belly which was her successorsailed among gathering clouds she too deserted us stars of every degree of sheen and clouds of every variety of form disputed the sublustrous night and still we gazed in vain for takaroa the mate stood on the bowsprit his tall grey figure slashing up and down against the stars and still                nihil astra præter   vidit et undas  the rest of us were grouped at the port anchor davit staring with no less assiduity but with far less hope on the obscure horizon islands we beheld in plenty but they were of such stuff as dreams are made on and vanished at a wink only to appear in other places and by and by not only islands but refulgent and revolving lights began to stud the darkness lighthouses of the mind or of the wearied optic nerve solemnly shining and winking as we passed at length the mate himself despaired scrambled on board again from his unrestful perch and announced that we had missed our destination he was the only man of practice in these waters our sole pilot shipped for that end at taiohae if he declared we had missed takaroa it was not for us to quarrel with the fact but if we could to explain it we had certainly run down our southing our canted wake upon the sea and our somewhat drunkenlooking course upon the chart both testified with no less certainty to an impetuous westward current we had no choice but to conclude we were again set down to leeward and the best we could do was to bring the casco to the wind keep a good watch and expect morning  i slept that night as was then my somewhat dangerous practice on deck upon the cockpit bench a stir at last awoke me to see all the eastern heaven dyed with faint orange the binnacle lamp already dulled against the brightness of the day and the steersman leaning eagerly across the wheel there it is sir he cried and pointed in the very eyeball of the dawn for a while i could see nothing but the bluish ruins of the morning bank which lay far along the horizon like melting icebergs then the sun rose pierced a gap in these débris of vapours and displayed an inconsiderable islet flat as a plate upon the sea and spiked with palms of disproportioned altitude  so far so good here was certainly an atoll and we were certainly got among the archipelago but which and where the isle was too small for either takaroa in all our neighbourhood indeed there was none so inconsiderable save only tikei and tikei one of roggeweins socalled pernicious islands seemed beside the question at that rate instead of drifting to the west we must have fetched up thirty miles to windward and how about the current it had been setting us down by observation all these days by the deflection of our wake it should be setting us down that moment when had it stopped when had it begun again and what kind of torrent was that which had swept us eastward in the interval to these questions so typical of navigation in that range of isles i have no answer such were at least the facts tikei our island turned out to be and it was our first experience of the dangerous archipelago to make our landfall thirty miles out  the sight of tikei thrown direct against the splendour of the morning robbed of all its colour and deformed with disproportioned trees like bristles on a broom had scarce prepared us to be much in love with atolls later the same day we saw under more fit conditions the island of taiaro lost in the sea is possibly the meaning of the name and it was so we saw it lost in blue sea and sky a ring of white beach green underwood and tossing palms gemlike in colour of a fairy of a heavenly prettiness the surf ran all around it white as snow and broke at one point far to seaward on what seemed an uncharted reef there was no smoke no sign of man indeed the isle is not inhabited only visited at intervals and yet a trader mr narii salmon was watching from the shore and wondering at the unexpected ship i have spent since then long months upon low islands i know the tedium of their undistinguished days i know the burden of their diet with whatever envy we may have looked from the deck on these green coverts it was with a tenfold greater that mr salmon and his comrades saw us steer in our trim ship to seaward  the night fell lovely in the extreme after the moon went down the heaven was a thing to wonder at for stars and as i lay in the cockpit and looked upon the steersman i was haunted by emersons verses    and the lone seaman all the night    sails astonished among stars  by this glittering and imperfect brightness about four bells in the first watch we made our third atoll raraka the low line of the isle lay straight along the sky so that i was at first reminded of a towpath and we seemed to be mounting some engineered and navigable stream presently a red star appeared about the height and brightness of a danger signal and with that my simile was changed we seemed rather to skirt the embankment of a railway and the eye began to look instinctively for the telegraphposts and the ear to expect the coming of a train here and there but rarely faint treetops broke the level and the sound of the surf accompanied us now in a drowsy monotone now with a menacing swing  the isle lay nearly east and west barring our advance on fakarava we must therefore hug the coast until we gained the western end where through a passage eight miles wide we might sail southward between raraka and the next isle kauehi we had the wind free a lightish air but clouds of an inky blackness were beginning to arise and at times it lightenedwithout thunder something i know not what continually set us up upon the island we lay more and more to the norard and you would have thought the shore copied our manoeuvre and outsailed us once and twice raraka headed us againagain in the sea fashion the quite innocent steersman was abusedand again the casco kept away had i been called on with no more light than that of our experience to draw the configuration of that island i should have shown a series of bowwindow promontories each overlapping the other to the norard and the trend of the land from the southeast to the northwest and behold on the chart it lay near east and west in a straight line  we had but just repeated our manoeuvre and kept awayfor not more than five minutes the railway embankment had been lost to view and the surf to hearingwhen i was aware of land again not only on the weather bow but dead ahead i played the part of the judicious landsman holding my peace till the last moment and presently my mariners perceived it for themselves  land ahead said the steersman  by god its kauehi cried the mate  and so it was and with that i began to be sorry for cartographers we were scarce doing three and a half and they asked me to believe that in five minutes we had dropped an island passed eight miles of open water and run almost high and dry upon the next but my captain was more sorry for himself to be afloat in such a labyrinth laid the casco to with the log line up and down and sat on the stern rail and watched it till the morning he had enough of night in the paumotus  by daylight on the 9th we began to skirt kauehi and had now an opportunity to see near at hand the geography of atolls here and there where it was high the farther side loomed up here and there the near side dipped entirely and showed a broad path of water into the lagoon here and there both sides were equally abased and we could look right through the discontinuous ring to the sea horizon on the south conceive on a vast scale the submerged hoop of the duckhunter trimmed with green rushes to conceal his headwater within water withoutyou have the image of the perfect atoll conceive one that has been partly plucked of its rush fringe you have the atoll of kauehi and for either shore of it at closer quarters conceive the line of some old roman highway traversing a wet morass and here sunk out of view and there rearising crowned with a green tuft of thicket only instead of the stagnant waters of a marsh the live ocean now boiled against now buried the frail barrier last nights impression in the dark was thus confirmed by day and not corrected we sailed indeed by a mere causeway in the sea of natures handiwork yet of no greater magnitude than many of the works of man  the isle was uninhabited it was all green brush and white sand set in transcendently blue water even the cocopalms were rare though some of these completed the bright harmony of colour by hanging out a fan of golden yellow for long there was no sign of life beyond the vegetable and no sound but the continuous grumble of the surf in silence and desertion these fair shores slipped past and were submerged and rose again with clumps of thicket from the sea and then a bird or two appeared hovering and crying swiftly these became more numerous and presently looking ahead we were aware of a vast effervescence of winged life in this place the annular isle was mostly under water carrying here and there on its submerged line a wooded islet over one of these the birds hung and flew with an incredible density like that of gnats or hiving bees the mass flashed white and black and heaved and quivered and the screaming of the creatures rose over the voice of the surf in a shrill clattering whirr as you descend some inland valley a not dissimilar sound announces the nearness of a mill and pouring river some stragglers as i said came to meet our approach a few still hung about the ship as we departed the crying died away the last pair of wings was left behind and once more the low shores of kauehi streamed past our eyes in silence like a picture i supposed at the time that the birds lived like ants or citizens concentred where we saw them i have been told since i know not if correctly that the whole isle or much of it is similarly peopled and that the effervescence at a single spot would be the mark of a boats crew of egghunters from one of the neighbouring inhabited atolls so that here at kauehi as the day before at taiaro the casco sailed by under the fire of unsuspected eyes and one thing is surely true that even on these ribbons of land an army might lie hid and no passing mariner divine its presence     chapter ii  fakarava an atoll at hand   by a little before noon we were running down the coast of our destination fakarava the air very light the sea near smooth though still we were accompanied by a continuous murmur from the beach like the sound of a distant train the isle is of a huge longitude the enclosed lagoon thirty miles by ten or twelve and the coral towpath which they call the land some eighty or ninety miles by possibly one furlong that part by which we sailed was all raised the underwood excellently green the topping wood of cocopalms continuousa mark if i had known it of mans intervention for once more and once more unconsciously we were within hail of fellowcreatures and that vacant beach was but a pistolshot from the capital city of the archipelago but the life of an atoll unless it be enclosed passes wholly on the shores of the lagoon it is there the villages are seated there the canoes ply and are drawn up and the beach of the ocean is a place accursed and deserted the fit scene only for wizardry and shipwreck and in the native belief a haunting ground of murderous spectres  by and by we might perceive a breach in the low barrier the woods ceased a glittering point ran into the sea tipped with an emerald shoal the mark of entrance as we drew near we met a little run of seathe private sea of the lagoon having there its origin and end and here in the jaws of the gateway trying vain conclusions with the more majestic heave of the pacific the casco scarce avowed a shock but there are times and circumstances when these harbour mouths of inland basins vomit floods deflecting burying and dismasting ships for conceive a lagoon perfectly sealed but in the one point and that of merely navigable width conceive the tide and wind to have heaped for hours together in that coral fold a superfluity of waters and the tide to change and the wind fallthe open sluice of some great reservoirs at home will give an image of the unstemmable effluxion  we were scarce well headed for the pass before all heads were craned over the rail for the water shoaling under our board became changed in a moment to surprising hues of blue and grey and in its transparency the coral branched and blossomed and the fish of the inland sea cruised visibly below us stained and stripped and even beaked like parrots i have paid in my time to view many curiosities never one so curious as that first sight over the ships rail in the lagoon of fakarava but let not the reader be deceived with hope i have since entered i suppose some dozen atolls in different parts of the pacific and the experience has never been repeated that exquisite hue and transparency of submarine day and these shoals of rainbow fish have not enraptured me again  before we could raise our eyes from that engaging spectacle the schooner had slipped betwixt the pierheads of the reef and was already quite committed to the sea within the containing shores are so little erected and the lagoon itself is so great that for the more part it seemed to extend without a check to the horizon here and there indeed where the reef carried an inlet like a signetring upon a finger there would be a pencilling of palms here and there the green wall of wood ran solid for a length of miles and on the port hand under the highest grove of trees a few houses sparkled whiterotoava the metropolitan settlement of the paumotus hither we beat in three tacks and came to an anchor close in shore in the first smooth water since we had left san francisco five fathoms deep where a man might look overboard all day at the vanishing cable the coral patches and the manycoloured fish  fakarava was chosen to be the seat of government from nautical considerations only it is eccentrically situate the productions even for a low island poor the population neither many norfor low islandersindustrious but the lagoon has two good passages one to leeward one to windward so that in all states of the wind it can be left and entered and this advantage for a government of scattered islands was decisive a pier of coral landingstairs a harbour light upon a staff and pillar and two spacious government bungalows in a handsome fence give to the northern end of rotoava a great air of consequence this is confirmed on the one hand by an empty prison on the other by a gendarmerie pasted over with handbills in tahitian landlaw notices from papeete and republican sentiments from paris signed a little after date jules grévy perihidente quite at the far end a belfried catholic chapel concludes the town and between on a smooth floor of white coral sand and under the breezy canopy of cocopalms the houses of the natives stand irregularly scattered now close on the lagoon for the sake of the breeze now back under the palms for love of shadow  not a soul was to be seen but for the thunder of the surf on the far side it seemed you might have heard a pin drop anywhere about that capital city there was something thrilling in the unexpected silence something yet more so in the unexpected sound here before us a sea reached to the horizon rippling like an inland mere and behold close at our back another sea assaulted with assiduous fury the reverse of the position at night the lantern was run up and lit a vacant pier in one house lights were seen and voices heard where the population i was told sat playing cards a little beyond from deep in the darkness of the palm grove we saw the glow and smelt the aromatic odour of a coal of cocoanut husk a relic of the evening kitchen crickets sang some shrill thing whistled in a tuft of weeds and the mosquito hummed and stung there was no other trace that night of man bird or insect in the isle the moon now three days old and as yet but a silver crescent on a still visible sphere shone through the palm canopy with vigorous and scattered lights the alleys where we walked were smoothed and weeded like a boulevard here and there were plants set out here and there dusky cottages clustered in the shadow some with verandahs a public garden by night a rich and fashionable wateringplace in a byseason offer sights and vistas not dissimilar and still on the one side stretched the lapping mere and from the other the deep sea still growled in the night but it was most of all on board in the dead hours when i had been better sleeping that the spell of fakarava seized and held me the moon was down the harbour lantern and two of the greater planets drew varicoloured wakes on the lagoon from shore the cheerful watchcry of cocks rang out at intervals above the organpoint of surf and the thought of this depopulated capital this protracted thread of annular island with its crest of cocopalms and fringe of breakers and that tranquil inland sea that stretched before me till it touched the stars ran in my head for hours with delight  so long as i stayed upon that isle these thoughts were constant i lay down to sleep and woke again with an unblunted sense of my surroundings i was never weary of calling up the image of that narrow causeway on which i had my dwelling lying coiled like a serpent tail to mouth in the outrageous ocean and i was never weary of passinga mere quarterdeck paradefrom the one side to the other from the shady habitable shores of the lagoon to the blinding desert and uproarious breakers of the opposite beach the sense of insecurity in such a thread of residence is more than fanciful hurricanes and tidal waves overleap these humble obstacles oceanus remembers his strength and where houses stood and palms flourished shakes his white beard again over the barren coral fakarava itself has suffered the trees immediately beyond my house were all of recent replantation and anaa is only now recovered from a heavier stroke i knew one who was then dwelling in the isle he told me that he and two ship captains walked to the sea beach there for a while they viewed the oncoming breakers till one of the captains clapped suddenly his hand before his eyes and cried aloud that he could endure no longer to behold them this was in the afternoon in the dark hours of the night the sea burst upon the island like a flood the settlement was razed all but the church and presbytery and when day returned the survivors saw themselves clinging in an abattis of uprooted cocopalms and ruined houses  danger is but a small consideration but men are more nicely sensible of a discomfort and the atoll is a discomfortable home there are some and these probably ancient where a deep soil has formed and the most valuable fruittrees prosper i have walked in one with equal admiration and surprise through a forest of huge breadfruits eating bananas and stumbling among taro as i went this was in the atoll of namorik in the marshall group and stands alone in my experience to give the opposite extreme which is yet far more near the average i will describe the soil and productions of fakarava the surface of that narrow strip is for the more part of broken coral limestone like volcanic clinkers and excruciating to the naked foot in some atolls i believe not in fakarava it gives a fine metallic ring when struck here and there you come upon a bank of sand exceeding fine and white and these parts are the least productive the plants such as they are spring from and love the broken coral whence they grow with that wonderful verdancy that makes the beauty of the atoll from the sea the cocopalm in particular luxuriates in that stern solum striking down his roots to the brackish percolated water and bearing his green head in the wind with every evidence of health and pleasure and yet even the cocopalm must be helped in infancy with some extraneous nutriment and through much of the low archipelago there is planted with each nut a piece of ships biscuit and a rusty nail the pandanus comes next in importance being also a food tree and he too does bravely a green bush called miki runs everywhere occasionally a purao is seen and there are several useless weeds according to m cuzent the whole number of plants on an atoll such as fakarava will scarce exceed even if it reaches to one score not a blade of grass appears not a grain of humus save when a sack or two has been imported to make the semblance of a garden such gardens as bloom in cities on the windowsill insect life is sometimes dense a cloud of mosquitoes and what is far worse a plague of flies blackening our food have sometimes driven us from a meal on apemama and even in fakarava the mosquitoes were a pest the land crab may be seen scuttling to his hole and at night the rats besiege the houses and the artificial gardens the crab is good eating possibly so is the rat i have not tried pandanus fruit is made in the gilberts into an agreeable sweetmeat such as a man may trifle with at the end of a long dinner for a substantial meal i have no use for it the rest of the foodsupply in a destitute atoll such as fakarava can be summed up in the favourite jest of the archipelagococoanut beefsteak cocoanut green cocoanut ripe cocoanut germinated cocoanut to eat and cocoanut to drink cocoanut raw and cooked cocoanut hot and coldsuch is the bill of fare and some of the entrees are no doubt delicious the germinated nut cooked in the shell and eaten with a spoon forms a good pudding cocoanut milkthe expressed juice of a ripe nut not the water of a green onegoes well in coffee and is a valuable adjunct in cookery through the south seas and cocoanut salad if you be a millionaire and can afford to eat the value of a field of corn for your dessert is a dish to be remembered with affection but when all is done there is a sameness and the israelites of the low islands murmur at their manna  the reader may think i have forgot the sea the two beaches do certainly abound in life and they are strangely different in the lagoon the water shallows slowly on a bottom of fine slimy sand dotted with clumps of growing coral then comes a strip of tidal beach on which the ripples lap in the coral clumps the great holywater clam tridacna grows plentifully a little deeper lie the beds of the pearloyster and sail the resplendent fish that charmed us at our entrance and these are all more or less vigorously coloured but the other shells are white like lime or faintly tinted with a little pink the palest possible display many of them dead besides and badly rolled on the ocean side on the mounds of the steep beach over all the width of the reef right out to where the surf is bursting in every cranny under every scattered fragment of the coral an incredible plenty of marine life displays the most wonderful variety and brilliancy of hues the reef itself has no passage of colour but is imitated by some shell purple and red and white and green and yellow pied and striped and clouded the living shells wear in every combination the livery of the dead reefif the reef be deadso that the eye is continually baffled and the collector continually deceived i have taken shells for stones and stones for shells the one as often as the other a prevailing character of the coral is to be dotted with small spots of red and it is wonderful how many varieties of shell have adopted the same fashion and donned the disguise of the red spot a shell i had found in plenty in the marquesas i found here also unchanged in all things else but there were the red spots a lively little crab wore the same marking the case of the hermit or soldier crab was more conclusive being the result of conscious choice this nasty little wrecker scavenger and squatter has learned the value of a spotted house so it be of the right colour he will choose the smallest shard tuck himself in a mere corner of a broken whorl and go about the world half naked but i never found him in this imperfect armour unless it was marked with the red spot  some two hundred yards distant is the beach of the lagoon collect the shells from each set them side by side and you would suppose they came from different hemispheres the one so pale the other so brilliant the one prevalently white the other of a score of hues and infected with the scarlet spot like a disease this seems the more strange since the hermit crabs pass and repass the island and i have met them by the residency well which is about central journeying either way without doubt many of the shells in the lagoon are dead but why are they dead without doubt the living shells have a very different background set for imitation but why are these so different we are only on the threshold of the mysteries  either beach i have said abounds with life on the seaside and in certain atolls this profusion of vitality is even shocking the rock under foot is mined with it i have broken oftnotably in funafuti and arorai5great lumps of ancient weathered rock that rang under my blows like iron and the fracture has been full of pendent worms as long as my hand as thick as a childs finger of a slightly pinkish white and set as close as three or even four to the square inch even in the lagoon where certain shellfish seem to sicken others it is notorious prosper exceedingly and make the riches of these islands fish too abound the lagoon is a closed fishpond such as might rejoice the fancy of an abbot sharks swarm there and chiefly round the passages to feast upon this plenty and you would suppose that man had only to prepare his angle alas it is not so of these painted fish that came in hordes about the entering casco some bore poisonous spines and others were poisonous if eaten the stranger must refrain or take his chance of painful and dangerous sickness the native on his own isle is a safe guide transplant him to the next and he is as helpless as yourself for it is a question both of time and place a fish caught in a lagoon may be deadly the same fish caught the same day at sea and only a few hundred yards without the passage will be wholesome eating in a neighbouring isle perhaps the case will be reversed and perhaps a fortnight later you shall be able to eat of them indifferently from within and from without according to the natives these bewildering vicissitudes are ruled by the movement of the heavenly bodies the beautiful planet venus plays a great part in all island tales and customs and among other functions some of them more awful she regulates the season of good fish with venus in one phase as we had her certain fish were poisonous in the lagoon with venus in another the same fish was harmless and a valued article of diet white men explain these changes by the phases of the coral  it adds a last touch of horror to the thought of this precarious annular gangway in the sea that even what there is of it is not of honest rock but organic part alive part putrescent even the clean sea and the bright fish about it poisoned the most stubborn boulder burrowed in by worms the lightest dust venomous as an apothecarys drugs   footnote    5 arorai is in the gilberts funafuti in the ellice islandsed     chapter iii  a house to let in a low island   never populous it was yet by a chapter of accidents that i found the island so deserted that no sound of human life diversified the hours that we walked in the trim public garden of a town among closed houses without even a lodgingbill in a window to prove some tenancy in the back quarters and when we visited the government bungalow that mr donat acting viceresident greeted us alone and entertained us with cocoanut punches in the sessions hall and seat of judgment of that widespread archipelago our glasses standing arrayed with summonses and census returns the unpopularity of the late viceresident had begun the movement of exodus his native employés resigning court appointments and retiring each to his own cocopatch in the remoter districts of the isle upon the back of that the governor in papeete issued a decree all land in the paumotus must be defined and registered by a certain date now the folk of the archipelago are half nomadic a man can scarce be said to belong to a particular atoll he belongs to several perhaps holds a stake and counts cousinship in half a score and the inhabitants of rotoava in particular man woman and child and from the gendarme to the mormon prophet and the schoolmaster ownedi was going to say landowned at least coral blocks and growing cocopalms in some adjacent isle thitherfrom the gendarme to the babe in arms the pastor followed by his flock the schoolmaster carrying along with him his scholars and the scholars with their books and slatesthey had taken ship some two days previous to our arrival and were all now engaged disputing boundaries fancy overhears the shrillness of their disputation mingle with the surf and scatter seafowl it was admirable to observe the completeness of their flight like that of hibernating birds nothing left but empty houses like old nests to be reoccupied in spring and even the harmless necessary dominie borne with them in their transmigration fifty odd set out and only seven i was informed remained but when i made a feast on board the casco more than seven and nearer seven times seven appeared to be my guests whence they appeared how they were summoned whither they vanished when the feast was eaten i have no guess in view of low island tales and that awful frequentation which makes men avoid the seaward beaches of an atoll some two score of those that ate with us may have returned for the occasion from the kingdom of the dead  it was this solitude that put it in our minds to hire a house and become for the time being indwellers of the islea practice i have ever since when it was possible adhered to mr donat placed us with that intent under the convoy of one taniera mahinui who combined the incongruous characters of catechist and convict the reader may smile but i affirm he was well qualified for either part for that of convict first of all by a good substantial felony such as in all lands casts the perpetrator in chains and dungeons taniera was a man of birththe chief a while ago as he loved to tell of a district in anaa of 800 souls in an evil hour it occurred to the authorities in papeete to charge the chiefs with the collection of the taxes it is a question if much were collected it is certain that nothing was handed on and taniera who had distinguished himself by a visit to papeete and some high living in restaurants was chosen for the scapegoat the reader must understand that not taniera but the authorities in papeete were first in fault the charge imposed was disproportioned i have not yet heard of any polynesian capable of such a burden honest and upright hawaiiansone in particular who was admired even by the whites as an inflexible magistratehave stumbled in the narrow path of the trustee and taniera when the pinch came scorned to denounce accomplices others had shared the spoil he bore the penalty alone he was condemned in five years the period when i had the pleasure of his friendship was not yet expired he still drew prison rations the sole and not unwelcome reminder of his chains and i believe looked forward to the date of his enfranchisement with mere alarm for he had no sense of shame in the position complained of nothing but the defective table of his place of exile regretted nothing but the fowls and eggs and fish of his own more favoured island and as for his parishioners they did not think one hair the less of him a schoolboy mulcted in ten thousand lines of greek and dwelling sequestered in the dormitories enjoys unabated consideration from his fellows so with taniera a marked man not a dishonoured having fallen under the lash of the unthinkable gods a job perhaps or say a taniera in the den of lions songs are likely made and sung about this saintly robin hood on the other hand he was even highly qualified for his office in the church being by nature a grave considerate and kindly man his face rugged and serious his smile bright the master of several trades a builder both of boats and houses endowed with a fine pulpit voice endowed besides with such a gift of eloquence that at the grave of the late chief of fakarava he set all the assistants weeping i never met a man of a mind more ecclesiastical he loved to dispute and to inform himself of doctrine and the history of sects and when i showed him the cuts in a volume of chamberss encyclopædiaexcept for one of an apereserved his whole enthusiasm for cardinals hats censers candlesticks and cathedrals methought when he looked upon the cardinals hat a voice said low in his ear your foot is on the ladder  under the guidance of taniera we were soon installed in what i believe to have been the bestappointed private house in fakarava it stood just beyond the church in an oblong patch of cultivation more than three hundred sacks of soil were imported from tahiti for the residency garden and this must shortly be renewed for the earth blows away sinks in crevices of the coral and is sought for at last in vain i know not how much earth had gone to the garden of my villa some at least for an alley of prosperous bananas ran to the gate and over the rest of the enclosure which was covered with the usual clinkerlike fragments of smashed coral not only cocopalms and mikis but also figtrees flourished all of a delicious greenness of course there was no blade of grass in front a picket fence divided us from the white road the palmfringed margin of the lagoon and the lagoon itself reflecting clouds by day and stars by night at the back a bulwark of uncemented coral enclosed us from the narrow belt of bush and the nigh ocean beach where the seas thundered the roar and wash of them still humming in the chambers of the house  this itself was of one story verandahed front and back it contained three rooms three sewingmachines three seachests chairs tables a pair of beds a cradle a doublebarrelled gun a pair of enlarged coloured photographs a pair of coloured prints after wilkie and mulready and a french lithograph with the legend le brigade du général lepasset brûlant son drapeau devant metz under the stilts of the house a stove was rusting till we drew it forth and put it in commission not far off was the burrow in the coral whence we supplied ourselves with brackish water there was live stock besides on the estatecocks and hens and a brace of illregulated cats whom taniera came every morning with the sun to feed on grated cocoanut his voice was our regular réveille ringing pleasantly about the garden pootypootypoopoopoo  far as we were from the public offices the nearness of the chapel made our situation what is called eligible in advertisements and gave us a side look on some native life every morning as soon as he had fed the fowls taniera set the bell agoing in the small belfry and the faithful who were not very numerous gathered to prayers i was once present it was the lords day and seven females and eight males composed the congregation a woman played precentor starting with a longish note the catechist joined in upon the second bar and then the faithful in a body some had printed hymnbooks which they followed some of the rest filled up with eheheh the paumotuan tolderol after the hymn we had an antiphonal prayer or two and then taniera rose from the front bench where he had been sitting in his catechists robes passed within the altarrails opened his tahitian bible and began to preach from notes i understood one wordthe name of god but the preacher managed his voice with taste used rare and expressive gestures and made a strong impression of sincerity the plain service the vernacular bible the hymntunes mostly on an english patterngod save the queen i was informed a special favouriteall save some paper flowers upon the altar seemed not merely but austerely protestant it is thus the catholics have met their low island proselytes halfway  taniera had the keys of our house it was with him i made my bargain if that could be called a bargain in which all was remitted to my generosity it was he who fed the cats and poultry he who came to call and pick a meal with us like an acknowledged friend and we long fondly supposed he was our landlord this belief was not to bear the test of experience and as my chapter has to relate no certainty succeeded it  we passed some days of airless quiet and great heat shellgatherers were warned from the ocean beach where sunstroke waited them from ten till four the highest palm hung motionless there was no voice audible but that of the sea on the far side at last about four of a certain afternoon long catspaws flawed the face of the lagoon and presently in the treetops there awoke the grateful bustle of the trades and all the houses and alleys of the island were fanned out to more than one enchanted ship that had lain long becalmed in view of the green shore the wind brought deliverance and by daylight on the morrow a schooner and two cutters lay moored in the port of rotoava not only in the outer sea but in the lagoon itself a certain traffic woke with the reviving breeze and among the rest one françois a halfblood set sail with the first light in his own halfdecked cutter he had held before a court appointment being i believe the residency sweeperout trouble arising with the unpopular viceresident he had thrown his honours down and fled to the far parts of the atoll to plant cabbagesor at least cocopalms thence he was now driven by such need as even a cincinnatus must acknowledge and fared for the capital city the seat of his late functions to exchange half a ton of copra for necessary flour and here for a while the story leaves to tell of his voyaging  it must tell instead of our house where toward seven at night the catechist came suddenly in with his pleased air of being welcome armed besides with a considerable bunch of keys these he proceeded to try on the seachests drawing each in turn from its place against the wall heads of strangers appeared in the doorway and volunteered suggestions all in vain either they were the wrong keys or the wrong boxes or the wrong man was trying them for a little taniera fumed and fretted then had recourse to the more summary method of the hatchet one of the chests was broken open and an armful of clothing male and female baled out and handed to the strangers on the verandah  these were françois his wife and their child about eight am in the midst of the lagoon their cutter had capsized in jibbing they got her righted and though she was still full of water put the child on board the mainsail had been carried away but the jib still drew her sluggishly along and françois and the woman swam astern and worked the rudder with their hands the cold was cruel the fatigue as time went on became excessive and in that preserve of sharks fear haunted them again and again françois the halfbreed would have desisted and gone down but the woman whole blood of an amphibious race still supported him with cheerful words i am reminded of a woman of hawaii who swam with her husband i dare not say how many miles in a high sea and came ashore at last with his dead body in her arms it was about five in the evening after nine hours swimming that françois and his wife reached land at rotoava the gallant fight was won and instantly the more childish side of native character appears they had supped and told and retold their story dripping as they came the flesh of the woman whom mrs stevenson helped to shift was cold as stone and françois having changed to a dry cotton shirt and trousers passed the remainder of the evening on my floor and between open doorways in a thorough draught yet françois the son of a french father speaks excellent french himself and seems intelligent  it was our first idea that the catechist true to his evangelical vocation was clothing the naked from his superfluity then it came out that françois was but dealing with his own the clothes were his so was the chest so was the house françois was in fact the landlord yet you observe he had hung back on the verandah while taniera tried his prentice hand upon the locks and even now when his true character appeared the only use he made of the estate was to leave the clothes of his family drying on the fence taniera was still the friend of the house still fed the poultry still came about us on his daily visits françois during the remainder of his stay holding bashfully aloof and there was stranger matter since françois had lost the whole load of his cutter the half ton of copra an axe bowls knives and clothessince he had in a manner to begin the world again and his necessary flour was not yet bought or paid fori proposed to advance him what he needed on the rent to my enduring amazement he refused and the reason he gaveif that can be called a reason which but darkens counselwas that taniera was his friend his friend you observe not his creditor i inquired into that and was assured that taniera an exile in a strange isle might possibly be in debt himself but certainly was no mans creditor  very early one morning we were awakened by a bustling presence in the yard and found our camp had been surprised by a tall lean old native lady dressed in what were obviously widows weeds you could see at a glance she was a notable woman a housewife sternly practical alive with energy and with fine possibilities of temper indeed there was nothing native about her but the skin and the type abounds and is everywhere respected nearer home it did us good to see her scour the grounds examining the plants and chickens watering feeding trimming them taking angry purposelike possession when she neared the house our sympathy abated when she came to the broken chest i wished i were elsewhere we had scarce a word in common but her whole lean body spoke for her with indignant eloquence my chest it cried with a stress on the possessive my chestbroken open this is a fine state of things i hastened to lay the blame where it belongedon françois and his wifeand found i had made things worse instead of better she repeated the names at first with incredulity then with despair a while she seemed stunned next fell to disembowelling the box piling the goods on the floor and visibly computing the extent of françoiss ravages and presently after she was observed in high speech with taniera who seemed to hang an ear like one reproved  here then by all known marks should be my landlady at last here was every character of the proprietor fully developed should i not approach her on the still depending question of my rent i carried the point to an adviser nonsense he cried thats the old woman the mother it doesnt belong to her i believe thats the man the house belongs to and he pointed to one of the coloured photographs on the wall on this i gave up all desire of understanding and when the time came for me to leave in the judgmenthall of the archipelago and with the awful countenance of the acting governor i duly paid my rent to taniera he was satisfied and so was i but what had he to do with it mr donat acting magistrate and a man of kindred blood could throw no light upon the mystery a plain private person with a taste for letters cannot be expected to do more     chapter iv  traits and sects in the paumotus   the most careless reader must have remarked a change of air since the marquesas the house crowded with effects the bustling housewife counting her possessions the serious indoctrinated island pastor the long fight for life in a lagoon here are traits of a new world i read in a pamphlet i will not give the authors name that the marquesan especially resembles the paumotuan i should take the two races though so near in neighbourhood to be extremes of polynesian diversity the marquesan is certainly the most beautiful of human races and one of the tallestthe paumotuan averaging a good inch shorter and not even handsome the marquesan openhanded inert insensible to religion childishly selfindulgentthe paumotuan greedy hardy enterprising a religious disputant and with a trace of the ascetic character  yet a few years ago and the people of the archipelago were crafty savages their isles might be called sirens isles not merely from the attraction they exerted on the passing mariner but from the perils that awaited him on shore even to this day in certain outlying islands danger lingers and the civilised paumotuan dreads to land and hesitates to accost his backward brother but except in these today the peril is a memory when our generation were yet in the cradle and playroom it was still a living fact between 1830 and 1840 hao for instance was a place of the most dangerous approach where ships were seized and crews kidnapped as late as 1856 the schooner sarah ann sailed from papeete and was seen no more she had women on board and children the captains wife a nursemaid a baby and the two young sons of a captain steven on their way to the mainland for schooling all were supposed to have perished in a squall a year later the captain of the julia coasting along the island variously called bligh lagoon and tematangi saw armed natives follow the course of his schooner clad in many coloured stuffs suspicion was at once aroused the mother of the lost children was profuse of money and one expedition having found the place deserted and returned content with firing a few shots she raised and herself accompanied another none appeared to greet or to oppose them they roamed a while among abandoned huts and empty thickets then formed two parties and set forth to beat from end to end the pandanus jungle of the island one man remained alone by the landingplaceteina a chief of anaa leader of the armed natives who made the strength of the expedition now that his comrades were departed this way and that on their laborious exploration the silence fell profound and this silence was the ruin of the islanders a sound of stones rattling caught the ear of teina he looked thinking to perceive a crab and saw instead the brown hand of a human being issue from a fissure in the ground a shout recalled the search parties and announced their doom to the buried caitiffs in the cave below sixteen were found crouching among human bones and singular and horrid curiosities one was a head of golden hair supposed to be a relic of the captains wife another was half of the body of a european child sundried and stuck upon a stick doubtless with some design of wizardry  the paumotuan is eager to be rich he saves grudges buries money fears not work for a dollar each two natives passed the hours of daylight cleaning our ships copper it was strange to see them so indefatigable and so much at ease in the waterworking at times with their pipes lighted the smoker at times submerged and only the glowing bowl above the surface it was stranger still to think they were next congeners to the incapable marquesan but the paumotuan not only saves grudges and works he steals besides or to be more precise he swindles he will never deny a debt he only flees his creditor he is always keen for an advance so soon as he has fingered it he disappears he knows your ship so soon as it nears one island he is off to another you may think you know his name he has already changed it pursuit in that infinity of isles were fruitless the result can be given in a nutshell it has been actually proposed in a government report to secure debts by taking a photograph of the debtor and the other day in papeete credits on the paumotus to the amount of sixteen thousand pounds were sold for less than fortyquatre cent mille francs pour moins de mille francs even so the purchase was thought hazardous and only the man who made it and who had special opportunities could have dared to give so much  the paumotuan is sincerely attached to those of his own blood and household a touching affection sometimes unites wife and husband their children while they are alive completely rule them after they are dead their bones or their mummies are often jealously preserved and carried from atoll to atoll in the wanderings of the family i was told there were many houses in fakarava with the mummy of a child locked in a seachest after i heard it i would glance a little jealously at those by my own bed in that cupboard also it was possible there was a tiny skeleton  the race seems in a fair way to survive from fifteen islands whose rolls i had occasion to consult i found a proportion of 59 births to 47 deaths for 1887 dropping three out of the fifteen there remained for the other twelve the comfortable ratio of 50 births to 32 deaths long habits of hardship and activity doubtless explain the contrast with marquesan figures but the paumotuan displays besides a certain concern for health and the rudiments of a sanitary discipline public talk with these freespoken people plays the part of the contagious diseases act incomers to fresh islands anxiously inquire if all be well and syphilis when contracted is successfully treated with indigenous herbs like their neighbours of tahiti from whom they have perhaps imbibed the error they regard leprosy with comparative indifference elephantiasis with disproportionate fear but unlike indeed to the tahitian their alarm puts on the guise of selfdefence any one stricken with this painful and ugly malady is confined to the ends of villages denied the use of paths and highways and condemned to transport himself between his house and cocopatch by water only his very footprint being held infectious feefee being a creature of marshes and the sequel of malarial fever is not original in atolls on the single isle of makatea where the lagoon is now a marsh the disease has made a home many suffer they are excluded if mr wilmot be right from much of the comfort of society and it is believed they take a secret vengeance the dejections of the sick are considered highly poisonous early in the morning it is narrated aged and malicious persons creep into the sleeping village and stealthily make water at the doors of the houses of young men thus they propagate disease thus they breathe on and obliterate comeliness and health the objects of their envy whether horrid fact or more abominable legend it equally depicts that something bitter and energetic which distinguishes paumotuan man  the archipelago is divided between two main religions catholic and mormon they front each other proudly with a false air of permanence yet are but shapes their membership in a perpetual flux the mormon attends mass with devotion the catholic sits attentive at a mormon sermon and tomorrow each may have transferred allegiance one man had been a pillar of the church of rome for fifteen years his wife dying he decided that must be a poor religion that could not save a man his wife and turned mormon according to one informant catholicism was the more fashionable in health but on the approach of sickness it was judged prudent to secede as a mormon there were five chances out of six you might recover as a catholic your hopes were small and this opinion is perhaps founded on the comfortable rite of unction  we all know what catholics are whether in the paumotus or at home but the paumotuan mormon seemed a phenomenon apart he marries but the one wife uses the protestant bible observes protestant forms of worship forbids the use of liquor and tobacco practises adult baptism by immersion and after every public sin rechristens the backslider i advised with mahinui whom i found well informed in the history of the american mormons and he declared against the least connection pour moi said he with a fine charity les mormons ici un petit catholiques some months later i had an opportunity to consult an orthodox fellowcountryman an old dissenting highlander long settled in tahiti but still breathing of the heather of tiree why do they call themselves mormons i asked my dear and that is my question he exclaimed for by all that i can hear of their doctrine i have nothing to say against it and their life it is above reproach and for all that mormons they are but of the earlier sowing the socalled josephites the followers of joseph smith the opponents of brigham young  grant then the mormons to be mormons fresh points at once arise what are the israelites and what the kanitus for a long while back the sect had been divided into mormons proper and socalled israelites i never could hear why a few years since there came a visiting missionary of the name of williams who made an excellent collection and retired leaving fresh disruption imminent something irregular as i was told in his way of opening the service had raised partisans and enemies the church was once more rent asunder and a new sect the kanitu issued from the division since then kanitus and israelites like the cameronians and the united presbyterians have made common cause and the ecclesiastical history of the paumotus is for the moment uneventful there will be more doing before long and these isles bid fair to be the scotland of the south two things i could never learn the nature of the innovations of the rev mr williams none would tell me and of the meaning of the name kanitu none had a guess it was not tahitian it was not marquesan it formed no part of that ancient speech of the paumotus now passing swiftly into obsolescence one man a priest god bless him said it was the latin for a little dog i have found it since as the name of a god in new guinea it must be a bolder man than i who should hint at a connection here then is a singular thing a brandnew sect arising by popular acclamation and a nonsense word invented for its name  the design of mystery seems obvious and according to a very intelligent observer mr magee of mangareva this element of the mysterious is a chief attraction of the mormon church it enjoys some of the status of freemasonry at home and there is for the convert some of the exhilaration of adventure other attractions are certainly conjoined perpetual rebaptism leading to a succession of baptismal feasts is found both from the social and the spiritual side a pleasing feature more important is the fact that all the faithful enjoy office perhaps more important still the strictness of the discipline the veto on liquor said mr magee brings them plenty members there is no doubt these islanders are fond of drink and no doubt they refrain from the indulgence a bout on a feastday for instance may be followed by a week or a month of rigorous sobriety mr wilmot attributes this to paumotuan frugality and the love of hoarding it goes far deeper i have mentioned that i made a feast on board the casco to wash down ships bread and jam each guest was given the choice of rum or syrup and out of the whole number only one man votedin a defiant tone and amid shouts of mirthfor trum this was in public i had the meanness to repeat the experiment whenever i had a chance within the four walls of my house and three at least who had refused at the festival greedily drank rum behind a door but there were others thoroughly consistent i said the virtues of the race were bourgeois and puritan and how bourgeois is this how puritanic how scottish and how yankeethe temptation the resistance the public hypocritical conformity the pharisees the holy willies and the true disciples with such a people the popularity of an ascetic church appears legitimate in these strict rules in this perpetual supervision the weak find their advantage the strong a certain pleasure and the doctrine of rebaptism a clean bill and a fresh start will comfort many staggering professors  there is yet another sect or what is called a sectno doubt improperlythat of the whistlers duncan cameron so clear in favour of the mormons was no less loud in condemnation of the whistlers yet i do not know i still fancy there is some connection perhaps fortuitous probably disavowed here at least are some doings in the house of an israelite clergyman or prophet in the island anaa of which i am equally sure that duncan would disclaim and the whistlers hail them for an imitation of their own my informant a tahitian and a catholic occupied one part of the house the prophet and his family lived in the other night after night the mormons in the one end held their evening sacrifice of song night after night in the other the wife of the tahitian lay awake and listened to their singing with amazement at length she could contain herself no longer woke her husband and asked him what he heard i hear several persons singing hymns said he yes she returned but listen again do you not hear something supernatural his attention thus directed he was aware of a strange buzzing voiceand yet he declared it was beautifulwhich justly accompanied the singers the next day he made inquiries it is a spirit said the prophet with entire simplicity which has lately made a practice of joining us at family worship it did not appear the thing was visible and like other spirits raised nearer home in these degenerate days it was rudely ignorant at first could only buzz and had only learned of late to bear a part correctly in the music  the performances of the whistlers are more businesslike their meetings are held publicly with open doors all being cordially invited to attend the faithful sit about the roomaccording to one informant singing hymns according to another now singing and now whistling the leader the wizardlet me rather say the mediumsits in the midst enveloped in a sheet and silent and presently from just above his head or sometimes from the midst of the roof an aerial whistling proceeds appalling to the inexperienced this it appears is the language of the dead its purport is taken down progressively by one of the expert writing i was told as fast as a telegraph operator and the communications are at last made public they are of the baldest triviality a schooner is perhaps announced some idle gossip reported of a neighbour or if the spirit shall have been called to consultation on a case of sickness a remedy may be suggested one of these immersion in scalding water not long ago proved fatal to the patient the whole business is very dreary very silly and very european it has none of the picturesque qualities of similar conjurations in new zealand it seems to possess no kernel of possible sense like some that i shall describe among the gilbert islanders yet i was told that many hardy intelligent natives were inveterate whistlers like mahinui i asked willing to have a standard and i was told yes why should i wonder men more enlightened than my convict catechist sit down at home to follies equally sterile and dull  the medium is sometimes female it was a woman for instance who introduced these practices on the north coast of taiarapu to the scandal of her own connections her brotherinlaw in particular declaring she was drunk but what shocked tahiti might seem fit enough in the paumotus the more so as certain women there possess by the gift of nature singular and useful powers they say they are honest wellintentioned ladies some of them embarrassed by their weird inheritance and indeed the trouble caused by this endowment is so great and the protection afforded so infinitesimally small that i hesitate whether to call it a gift or a hereditary curse you may rob this ladys cocopatch steal her canoes burn down her house and slay her family scatheless but one thing you must not do you must not lay a hand upon her sleepingmat or your belly will swell and you can only be cured by the lady or her husband here is the report of an eyewitness tasmanian born educated a man who has made moneycertainly no fool in 1886 he was present in a house on makatea where two lads began to skylark on the mats and were i think ejected instantly after their bellies began to swell pains took hold on them all manner of island remedies were exhibited in vain and rubbing only magnified their sufferings the man of the house was called explained the nature of the visitation and prepared the cure a cocoanut was husked filled with herbs and with all the ceremonies of a launch and the utterance of spells in the paumotuan language committed to the sea from that moment the pains began to grow more easy and the swelling to subside the reader may stare i can assure him if he moved much among old residents of the archipelago he would be driven to admit one thing of twoeither that there is something in the swollen bellies or nothing in the evidence of man  i have not met these gifted ladies but i had an experience of my own for i have played for one night only the part of the whistling spirit it had been blowing wearily all day but with the fall of night the wind abated and the moon which was then full rolled in a clear sky we went southward down the island on the side of the lagoon walking through longdrawn forest aisles of palm and on a floor of snowy sand no life was abroad nor sound of life till in a clear part of the isle we spied the embers of a fire and not far off in a dark house heard natives talking softly to sit without a light even in company and under cover is for a paumotuan a somewhat hazardous extreme the whole scenethe strong moonlight and crude shadows on the sand the scattered coals the sound of the low voices from the house and the lap of the lagoon along the beachput me i know not how on thoughts of superstition i was barefoot i observed my steps were noiseless and drawing near to the dark house but keeping well in shadow began to whistle the heaving of the lead was my airno very tragic piece with the first note the conversation and all movement ceased silence accompanied me while i continued and when i passed that way on my return i found the lamp was lighted in the house but the tongues were still mute all night as i now think the wretches shivered and were silent for indeed i had no guess at the time at the nature and magnitude of the terrors i inflicted or with what grisly images the notes of that old song had peopled the dark house     chapter v  a paumotuan funeral   no i had no guess of these mens terrors yet i had received ere that a hint if i had understood and the occasion was a funeral  a little apart in the main avenue of rotoava in a low hut of leaves that opened on a small enclosure like a pigsty on a pen an old man dwelt solitary with his aged wife perhaps they were too old to migrate with the others perhaps they were too poor and had no possessions to dispute at least they had remained behind and it thus befell that they were invited to my feast i dare say it was quite a piece of politics in the pigsty whether to come or not to come and the husband long swithered between curiosity and age till curiosity conquered and they came and in the midst of that last merrymaking death tapped him on the shoulder for some days when the sky was bright and the wind cool his mat would be spread in the main highway of the village and he was to be seen lying there inert a mere handful of man his wife inertly seated by his head they seemed to have outgrown alike our needs and faculties they neither spoke nor listened they suffered us to pass without a glance the wife did not fan she seemed not to attend upon her husband and the two poor antiques sat juxtaposed under the high canopy of palms the human tragedy reduced to its bare elements a sight beyond pathos stirring a thrill of curiosity and yet there was one touch of the pathetic haunted me that so much youth and expectation should have run in these starved veins and the man should have squandered all his lees of life on a pleasure party  on the morning of 17th september the sufferer died and time pressing he was buried the same day at four the cemetery lies to seaward behind government house broken coral like so much roadmetal forms the surface a few wooden crosses a few inconsiderable upright stones designate graves a mortared wall high enough to lean on rings it about a clustering shrub surrounds it with pale leaves here was the grave dug that morning doubtless by uneasy diggers to the sound of the nigh sea and the cries of seabirds meanwhile the dead man waited in his house and the widow and another aged woman leaned on the fence before the door no speech upon their lips no speculation in their eyes  sharp at the hour the procession was in march the coffin wrapped in white and carried by four bearers mourners behindnot many for not many remained in rotoava and not many in black for these were poor the men in straw hats white coats and blue trousers or the gorgeous particoloured pariu the tahitian kilt the women with a few exceptions brightly habited far in the rear came the widow painfully carrying the dead mans mat a creature aged beyond humanity to the likeness of some missing link  the dead man had been a mormon but the mormon clergyman was gone with the rest to wrangle over boundaries in the adjacent isle and a layman took his office standing at the head of the open grave in a white coat and blue pariu his tahitian bible in his hand and one eye bound with a red handkerchief he read solemnly that chapter in job which has been read and heard over the bones of so many of our fathers and with a good voice offered up two prayers the wind and the surf bore a burthen by the cemetery gate a mother in crimson suckled an infant rolled in blue in the midst the widow sat upon the ground and polished one of the coffinstretchers with a piece of coral a little later she had turned her back to the grave and was playing with a leaf did she understand god knows the officiant paused a moment stooped and gathered and threw reverently on the coffin a handful of rattling coral dust to dust but the grains of this dust were gross like cherries and the true dust that was to follow sat near by still cohering as by a miracle in the tragic resemblance of a female ape  so far mormon or not it was a christian funeral the wellknown passage had been read from job the prayers had been rehearsed the grave was filled the mourners straggled homeward with a little coarser grain of covering earth a little nearer outcry of the sea a stronger glare of sunlight on the rude enclosure and some incongruous colours of attire the wellremembered form had been observed  by rights it should have been otherwise the mat should have been buried with its owner but the family being poor it was thriftily reserved for a fresh service the widow should have flung herself upon the grave and raised the voice of official grief the neighbours have chimed in and the narrow isle rung for a space with lamentation but the widow was old perhaps she had forgotten perhaps never understood and she played like a child with leaves and coffinstretchers in all ways my guest was buried with maimed rites strange to think that his last conscious pleasure was the casco and my feast strange to think that he had limped there an old child looking for some new good and the good thing rest had been allotted him  but though the widow had neglected much there was one part she must not utterly neglect she came away with the dispersing funeral but the dead mans mat was left behind upon the grave and i learned that by set of sun she must return to sleep there this vigil is imperative from sundown till the rising of the morning star the paumotuan must hold his watch above the ashes of his kindred many friends if the dead have been a man of mark will keep the watchers company they will be well supplied with coverings against the weather i believe they bring food and the rite is persevered in for two weeks our poor survivor if indeed she properly survived had little to cover and few to sit with her on the night of the funeral a strong squall chased her from her place of watch for days the weather held uncertain and outrageous and ere seven nights were up she had desisted and returned to sleep in her low roof that she should be at the pains of returning for so short a visit to a solitary house that this borderer of the grave should fear a little wind and a wet blanket filled me at the time with musings i could not say she was indifferent she was so far beyond me in experience that the court of my criticism waived jurisdiction but i forged excuses telling myself she had perhaps little to lament perhaps suffered much perhaps understood nothing and lo in the whole affair there was no question whether of tenderness or piety and the sturdy return of this old remnant was a mark either of uncommon sense or of uncommon fortitude  yet one thing had occurred that partly set me on the trail i have said the funeral passed much as at home but when all was over when we were trooping in decent silence from the graveyard gate and down the path to the settlement a sudden inbreak of a different spirit startled and perhaps dismayed us two people walked not far apart in our procession my friend mr donatdonatrimaraudonat the muchhandedacting viceresident present ruler of the archipelago by far the man of chief importance on the scene but known besides for one of an unshakable good temper and a certain comely strapping young paumotuan woman the comeliest on the isle not let us hope the bravest or the most polite of a sudden ere yet the grave silence of the funeral was broken she made a leap at the resident with pointed finger shrieked a few words and fell back again with a laughter not a natural mirth what did she say to you i asked she did not speak to me said donat a shade perturbed she spoke to the ghost of the dead man and the purport of her speech was this see there donat will be a fine feast for you tonight  m donat called it a jest i wrote at the time in my diary it seemed to me more in the nature of a terrified conjuration as though she would divert the ghosts attention from herself a cannibal race may well have cannibal phantoms the guesses of the traveller appear foredoomed to be erroneous yet in these i was precisely right the woman had stood by in terror at the funeral being then in a dread spot the graveyard she looked on in terror to the coming night with that ogre a new spirit loosed upon the isle and the words she had cried in donats face were indeed a terrified conjuration basely to shield herself basely to dedicate another in her stead one thing is to be said in her excuse doubtless she partly chose donat because he was a man of great goodnature but partly too because he was a man of the halfcaste for i believe all natives regard white blood as a kind of talisman against the powers of hell in no other way can they explain the unpunished recklessness of europeans     chapter vi  graveyard stories   with my superstitious friend the islander i fear i am not wholly frank often leading the way with stories of my own and being always a grave and sometimes an excited hearer but the deceit is scarce mortal since i am as pleased to hear as he to tell as pleased with the story as he with the belief and besides it is entirely needful for it is scarce possible to exaggerate the extent and empire of his superstitions they mould his life they colour his thinking and when he does not speak to me of ghosts and gods and devils he is playing the dissembler and talking only with his lips with thoughts so different one must indulge the other and i would rather that i should indulge his superstition than he my incredulity of one thing besides i may be sure let me indulge it as i please i shall not hear the whole for he is already on his guard with me and the amount of the lore is boundless  i will give but a few instances at random chiefly from my own doorstep in upolu during the past month october 1890 one of my workmen was sent the other day to the banana patch there to dig this is a hollow of the mountain buried in woods out of all sight and cry of mankind and long before dusk lafaele was back again beside the cookhouse with embarrassed looks he dared not longer stay alone he was afraid of spilits in the bush it seems these are the souls of the unburied dead haunting where they fell and wearing woodland shapes of pig or bird or insect the bush is full of them they seem to eat nothing slay solitary wanderers apparently in spite and at times in human form go down the villages and consort with the inhabitants undetected so much i learned a day or so after walking in the bush with a very intelligent youth a native it was a little before noon a grey day and squally and perhaps i had spoken lightly a dark squall burst on the side of the mountain the woods shook and cried the dead leaves rose from the ground in clouds like butterflies and my companion came suddenly to a full stop he was afraid he said of the trees falling but as soon as i had changed the subject of our talk he proceeded with alacrity a day or two before a messenger came up the mountain from apia with a letter i was in the bush he must await my return then wait till i had answered and before i was done his voice sounded shrill with terror of the coming night and the long forest road these are the commons take the chiefs there has been a great coming and going of signs and omens in our group one river ran down blood red eels were captured in another an unknown fish was thrown upon the coast an ominous word found written on its scales so far we might be reading in a monkish chronicle now we come on a fresh note at once modern and polynesian the gods of upolu and savaii our two chief islands contended recently at cricket since then they are at war sounds of battle are heard to roll along the coast a woman saw a man swim from the high seas and plunge direct into the bush he was no man of that neighbourhood and it was known he was one of the gods speeding to a council most perspicuous of all a missionary on savaii who is also a medical man was disturbed late in the night by knocking it was no hour for the dispensary but at length he woke his servant and sent him to inquire the servant looking from a window beheld crowds of persons all with grievous wounds lopped limbs broken heads and bleeding bulletholes but when the door was opened all had disappeared they were gods from the field of battle now these reports have certainly significance it is not hard to trace them to political grumblers or to read in them a threat of coming trouble from that merely human side i found them ominous myself but it was the spiritual side of their significance that was discussed in secret council by my rulers i shall best depict this mingled habit of the polynesian mind by two connected instances i once lived in a village the name of which i do not mean to tell the chief and his sister were persons perfectly intelligent gentlefolk apt of speech the sister was very religious a great churchgoer one that used to reprove me if i stayed away i found afterwards that she privately worshipped a shark the chief himself was somewhat of a freethinker at the least a latitudinarian he was a man besides filled with european knowledge and accomplishments of an impassive ironical habit and i should as soon have expected superstition in mr herbert spencer hear the sequel i had discovered by unmistakable signs that they buried too shallow in the village graveyard and i took my friend as the responsible authority to task there is something wrong about your graveyard said i which you must attend to or it may have very bad results something wrong what is it he asked with an emotion that surprised me if you care to go along there any evening about nine oclock you can see for yourself said i he stepped backward a ghost he cried  in short in the whole field of the south seas there is not one to blame another half blood and whole pious and debauched intelligent and dull all men believe in ghosts all men combine with their recent christianity fear of and a lingering faith in the old island deities so in europe the gods of olympus slowly dwindled into village bogies so today the theological highlander sneaks from under the eye of the free church divine to lay an offering by a sacred well  i try to deal with the whole matter here because of a particular quality in paumotuan superstitions it is true i heard them told by a man with a genius for such narrations close about our evening lamp within sound of the island surf we hung on his words thrilling the reader in far other scenes must listen close for the faint echo  this bundle of weird stories sprang from the burial and the womans selfish conjuration i was dissatisfied with what i heard harped upon questions and struck at last this vein of metal it is from sundown to about four in the morning that the kinsfolk camp upon the grave and these are the hours of the spirits wanderings at any time of the nightit may be earlier it may be latera sound is to be heard below which is the noise of his liberation at four sharp another and louder marks the instant of the reimprisonment betweenwhiles he goes his malignant rounds did you ever see an evil spirit was once asked of a paumotuan once under what form it was in the form of a crane and how did you know that crane to be a spirit was asked i will tell you he answered and this was the purport of his inconclusive narrative his father had been dead nearly a fortnight others had wearied of the watch and as the sun was setting he found himself by the grave alone it was not yet dark rather the hour of the afterglow when he was aware of a snowwhite crane upon the coral mound presently more cranes came some white some black then the cranes vanished and he saw in their place a white cat to which there was silently joined a great company of cats of every hue conceivable then these also disappeared and he was left astonished  this was an anodyne appearance take instead the experience of ruaamariterangi on the isle of katiu he had a need for some pandanus and crossed the isle to the seabeach where it chiefly flourishes the day was still and rua was surprised to hear a crashing sound among the thickets and then the fall of a considerable tree here must be some one building a canoe and he entered the margin of the wood to find and pass the time of day with this chance neighbour the crashing sounded more at hand and then he was aware of something drawing swiftly near among the treetops it swung by its heels downward like an ape so that its hands were free for murder it depended safely by the slightest twigs the speed of its coming was incredible and soon rua recognised it for a corpse horrible with age its bowels hanging as it came prayer was the weapon of christian in the valley of the shadow and it is to prayer that ruaamariterangi attributes his escape no merely human expedition had availed  this demon was plainly from the grave yet you will observe he was abroad by day and inconsistent as it may seem with the hours of the night watch and the many references to the rising of the morning star it is no singular exception i could never find a case of another who had seen this ghost diurnal and arboreal in its habits but others have heard the fall of the tree which seems the signal of its coming mr donat was once pearling on the uninhabited isle of haraiki it was a day without a breath of wind such as alternate in the archipelago with days of contumelious breezes the divers were in the midst of the lagoon upon their employment the cook a boy of ten was over his pots in the camp thus were all souls accounted for except a single native who accompanied donat into the woods in quest of seafowls eggs in a moment out of the stillness came the sound of the fall of a great tree donat would have passed on to find the cause no cried his companion that was no tree it was something not right let us go back to camp next sunday the divers were turned on all that part of the isle was thoroughly examined and sure enough no tree had fallen a little later mr donat saw one of his divers flee from a similar sound in similar unaffected panic on the same isle but neither would explain and it was not till afterwards when he met with rua that he learned the occasion of their terrors  but whether by day or night the purpose of the dead in these abhorred activities is still the same in samoa my informant had no idea of the food of the bush spirits no such ambiguity would exist in the mind of a paumotuan in that hungry archipelago living and dead must alike toil for nutriment and the race having been cannibal in the past the spirits are so still when the living ate the dead horrified nocturnal imagination drew the shocking inference that the dead might eat the living doubtless they slay men doubtless even mutilate them in mere malice marquesan spirits sometimes tear out the eyes of travellers but even that may be more practical than appears for the eye is a cannibal dainty and certainly the rootidea of the dead at least in the far eastern islands is to prowl for food it was as a dainty morsel for a meal that the woman denounced donat at the funeral there are spirits besides who prey in particular not on the bodies but on the souls of the dead the point is clearly made in a tahitian story a child fell sick grew swiftly worse and at last showed signs of death the mother hastened to the house of a sorcerer who lived hard by you are yet in time said he a spirit has just run past my door carrying the soul of your child wrapped in the leaf of a purao but i have a spirit stronger and swifter who will run him down ere he has time to eat it wrapped in a leaf like other things edible and corruptible  or take an experience of mr donats on the island of anaa it was a night of a high wind with violent squalls his child was very sick and the father though he had gone to bed lay wakeful hearkening to the gale all at once a fowl was violently dashed on the house wall supposing he had forgot to put it in shelter with the rest donat arose found the bird a cock lying on the verandah and put it in the henhouse the door of which he securely fastened fifteen minutes later the business was repeated only this time as it was being dashed against the wall the bird crew again donat replaced it examining the henhouse thoroughly and finding it quite perfect as he was so engaged the wind puffed out his light and he must grope back to the door a good deal shaken yet a third time the bird was dashed upon the wall a third time donat set it now near dead beside its mates and he was scarce returned before there came a rush like that of a furious strong man against the door and a whistle as loud as that of a railway engine rang about the house the sceptical reader may here detect the finger of the tempest but the women gave up all for lost and clustered on the beds lamenting nothing followed and i must suppose the gale somewhat abated for presently after a chief came visiting he was a bold man to be abroad so late but doubtless carried a bright lantern and he was certainly a man of counsel for as soon as he heard the details of these disturbances he was in a position to explain their nature your child said he must certainly die this is the evil spirit of our island who lies in wait to eat the spirits of the newly dead and then he went on to expatiate on the strangeness of the spirits conduct he was not usually he explained so open of assault but sat silent on the housetop waiting in the guise of a bird while within the people tended the dying and bewailed the dead and had no thought of peril but when the day came and the doors were opened and men began to go abroad bloodstains on the wall betrayed the tragedy  this is the quality i admire in paumotuan legend in tahiti the spiriteater is said to assume a vesture which has much more of pomp but how much less of horror it has been seen by all sorts and conditions native and foreign only the last insists it is a meteor my authority was not so sure he was riding with his wife about two in the morning both were near asleep and the horses not much better it was a brilliant and still night and the road wound over a mountain near by a deserted marae old tahitian temple all at once the appearance passed above them a form of light the head round and greenish the body long red and with a focus of yet redder brilliancy about the midst a buzzing hoot accompanied its passage it flew direct out of one marae and direct for another down the mountainside and this as my informant argued is suggestive for why should a mere meteor frequent the altars of abominable gods the horses i should say were equally dismayed with their riders now i am not dismayed at allnot even agreeably give me rather the bird upon the housetop and the morning bloodgouts on the wall  but the dead are not exclusive in their diet they carry with them to the grave in particular the polynesian taste for fish and enter at times with the living into a partnership in fishery ruaamariterangi is again my authority i feel it diminishes the credit of the fact but how it builds up the image of this inveterate ghostseer he belongs to the miserably poor island of taenga yet his fathers house was always well supplied as rua grew up he was called at last to go afishing with this fortunate parent they rowed into the lagoon at dusk to an unlikely place and the boy lay down in the stern and the father began vainly to cast his line over the bows it is to be supposed that rua slept and when he awoke there was the figure of another beside his father and his father was pulling in the fish hand over hand who is that man father rua asked it is none of your business said the father and rua supposed the stranger had swum off to them from shore night after night they fared into the lagoon often to the most unlikely places night after night the stranger would suddenly be seen on board and as suddenly be missed and morning after morning the canoe returned laden with fish my father is a very lucky man thought rua at last one fine day there came first one boat party and then another who must be entertained father and son put off later than usual into the lagoon and before the canoe was landed it was four oclock and the morning star was close on the horizon then the stranger appeared seized with some distress turned about showing for the first time his face which was that of one long dead with shining eyes stared into the east set the tips of his fingers to his mouth like one acold uttered a strange shuddering sound between a whistle and a moana thing to freeze the blood and the daystar just rising from the sea he suddenly was not then rua understood why his father prospered why his fishes rotted early in the day and why some were always carried to the cemetery and laid upon the graves my informant is a man not certainly averse to superstition but he keeps his head and takes a certain superior interest which i may be allowed to call scientific the last point reminding him of some parallel practice in tahiti he asked rua if the fish were left or carried home again after a formal dedication it appears old mariterangi practised both methods sometimes treating his shadowy partner to a mere oblation sometimes honestly leaving his fish to rot upon the grave  it is plain we have in europe stories of a similar complexion and the polynesian varua ino or aitu o le vao is clearly the near kinsman of the transylvanian vampire here is a tale in which the kinship appears broadly marked on the atoll of penrhyn then still partly savage a certain chief was long the salutary terror of the natives he died he was buried and his late neighbours had scarce tasted the delights of licence ere his ghost appeared about the village fear seized upon all a council was held of the chief men and sorcerers and with the approval of the rarotongan missionary who was as frightened as the rest and in the presence of several whitesmy friend mr ben hird being onethe grave was opened deepened until water came and the body reinterred face down the still recent staking of suicides in england and the decapitation of vampires in the east of europe form close parallels  so in samoa only the spirits of the unburied awake fear during the late war many fell in the bush their bodies sometimes headless were brought back by native pastors and interred but this i know not why was insufficient and the spirit still lingered on the theatre of death when peace returned a singular scene was enacted in many places and chiefly round the high gorges of lotoanuu where the struggle was long centred and the loss had been severe kinswomen of the dead came carrying a mat or sheet and guided by survivors of the fight the place of death was earnestly sought out the sheet was spread upon the ground and the women moved with pious anxiety sat about and watched it if any living thing alighted it was twice brushed away upon the third coming it was known to be the spirit of the dead was folded in carried home and buried beside the body and the aitu rested the rite was practised beyond doubt in simple piety the repose of the soul was its object its motive reverent affection the present king disowns indeed all knowledge of a dangerous aitu he declares the souls of the unburied were only wanderers in limbo lacking an entrance to the proper country of the dead unhappy nowise hurtful and this severely classic opinion doubtless represents the views of the enlightened but the flight of my lafaele marks the grosser terrors of the ignorant  this belief in the exorcising efficacy of funeral rites perhaps explains a fact otherwise amazing that no polynesian seems at all to share our european horror of human bones and mummies of the first they made their cherished ornaments they preserved them in houses or in mortuary caves and the watchers of royal sepulchres dwelt with their children among the bones of generations the mummy even in the making was as little feared in the marquesas on the extreme coast it was made by the household with continual unction and exposure to the sun in the carolines upon the farthest west it is still cured in the smoke of the family hearth headhunting besides still lives around my doorstep in samoa and not ten years ago in the gilberts the widow must disinter cleanse polish and thenceforth carry about her by day and night the head of her dead husband in all these cases we may suppose the process whether of cleansing or drying to have fully exorcised the aitu  but the paumotuan belief is more obscure here the man is duly buried and he has to be watched he is duly watched and the spirit goes abroad in spite of watches indeed it is not the purpose of the vigils to prevent these wanderings only to mollify by polite attention the inveterate malignity of the dead neglect it is supposed may irritate and thus invite his visits and the aged and weakly sometimes balance risks and stay at home observe it is the dead mans kindred and next friends who thus deprecate his fury with nocturnal watchings even the placatory vigil is held perilous except in company and a boy was pointed out to me in rotoava because he had watched alone by his own father not the ties of the dead nor yet their proved character affect the issue a late resident who died in fakarava of sunstroke was beloved in life and is still remembered with affection none the less his spirit went about the island clothed with terrors and the neighbourhood of government house was still avoided after dark we may sum up the cheerful doctrine thus all men become vampires and the vampire spares none and here we come face to face with a tempting inconsistency for the whistling spirits are notoriously clannish i understood them to wait upon and to enlighten kinsfolk only and that the medium was always of the race of the communicating spirit here then we have the bonds of the family on the one hand severed at the hour of death on the other helpfully persisting  the childs soul in the tahitian tale was wrapped in leaves it is the spirits of the newly dead that are the dainty when they are slain the house is stained with blood ruas dead fisherman was decomposed soand horriblywas his arboreal demon the spirit then is a thing material and it is by the material ensigns of corruption that he is distinguished from the living man this opinion is widespread adds a gross terror to the more ugly polynesian tales and sometimes defaces the more engaging with a painful and incongruous touch i will give two examples sufficiently wide apart one from tahiti one from samoa  and first from tahiti a man went to visit the husband of his sister then some time dead in her life the sister had been dainty in the island fashion and went always adorned with a coronet of flowers in the midst of the night the brother awoke and was aware of a heavenly fragrance going to and fro in the dark house the lamp i must suppose to have burned out no tahitian would have lain down without one lighted a while he lay wondering and delighted then called upon the rest do none of you smell flowers he asked o said his brotherinlaw we are used to that here the next morning these two men went walking and the widower confessed that his dead wife came about the house continually and that he had even seen her she was shaped and dressed and crowned with flowers as in her lifetime only she moved a few inches above the earth with a very easy progress and flitted dryshod above the surface of the river and now comes my point it was always in a back view that she appeared and these brothersinlaw debating the affair agreed that this was to conceal the inroads of corruption  now for the samoan story i owe it to the kindness of dr f otto sierich whose collection of folktales i expect with a high degree of interest a man in manua was married to two wives and had no issue he went to savaii married there a third and was more fortunate when his wife was near her time he remembered he was in a strange island like a poor man and when his child was born he must be shamed for lack of gifts it was in vain his wife dissuaded him he returned to his father in manua seeking help and with what he could get he set off in the night to reembark now his wives heard of his coming they were incensed he did not stay to visit them and on the beach by his canoe intercepted and slew him now the third wife lay asleep in savaii her babe was born and slept by her side and she was awakened by the spirit of her husband get up he said my father is sick in manua and we must go to visit him it is well said she take you the child while i carry its mats i cannot carry the child said the spirit i am too cold from the sea when they were got on board the canoe the wife smelt carrion how is this she said what have you in the canoe that i should smell carrion it is nothing in the canoe said the spirit it is the landwind blowing down the mountains where some beast lies dead it appears it was still night when they reached manuathe swiftest passage on recordand as they entered the reef the balefires burned in the village again she asked him to carry the child but now he need no more dissemble i cannot carry your child said he for i am dead and the fires you see are burning for my funeral  the curious may learn in dr sierichs book the unexpected sequel of the tale here is enough for my purpose though the man was but new dead the ghost was already putrefied as though putrefaction were the mark and of the essence of a spirit the vigil on the paumotuan grave does not extend beyond two weeks and they told me this period was thought to coincide with that of the resolution of the body the ghost always marked with decaythe danger seemingly ending with the process of dissolutionhere is tempting matter for the theorist but it will not do the lady of the flowers had been long dead and her spirit was still supposed to bear the brand of perishability the resident had been more than a fortnight buried and his vampire was still supposed to go the rounds  of the lost state of the dead from the lurid mangaian legend in which infernal deities hocus and destroy the souls of all to the various submarine and aerial limbos where the dead feast float idle or resume the occupations of their life on earth it would be wearisome to tell one story i give for it is singular in itself is well known in tahiti and has this of interest that it is postchristian dating indeed from but a few years back a princess of the reigning house died was transported to the neighbouring isle of raiatea fell there under the empire of a spirit who condemned her to climb cocopalms all day and bring him the nuts was found after some time in this miserable servitude by a second spirit one of her own house and by him upon her lamentations reconveyed to tahiti where she found her body still waked but already swollen with the approaches of corruption it is a lively point in the tale that on the sight of this dishonoured tabernacle the princess prayed she might continue to be numbered with the dead but it seems it was too late her spirit was replaced by the least dignified of entrances and her startled family beheld the body move the seemingly purgatorial labours the helpful kindred spirit and the horror of the princess at the sight of her tainted body are all points to be remarked  the truth is the tales are not necessarily consistent in themselves and they are further darkened for the stranger by an ambiguity of language ghosts vampires spirits and gods are all confounded and yet i seem to perceive that with exceptions those whom we would count gods were less maleficent permanent spirits haunt and do murder in corners of samoa but those legitimate gods of upolu and savaii whose wars and cricketings of late convulsed society i did not gather to be dreaded or not with a like fear the spirit of anaa that ate souls is certainly a fearsome inmate but the high gods even of the archipelago seem helpful mahinuifrom whom our convictcatechist had been namedthe spirit of the sea like a proteus endowed with endless avatars came to the assistance of the shipwrecked and carried them ashore in the guise of a rayfish the same divinity bore priests from isle to isle about the archipelago and by his aid within the century persons have been seen to fly the tutelar deity of each isle is likewise helpful and by a particular form of wedgeshaped cloud on the horizon announces the coming of a ship  to one who conceives of these atolls so narrow so barren so beset with sea here would seem a superfluity of ghostly denizens and yet there are more in the various brackish pools and ponds beautiful women with long red hair are seen to rise and bathe only timid as mice on the first sound of feet upon the coral they dive again for ever they are known to be healthy and harmless living people dwellers of an underworld and the same fancy is current in tahiti where also they have the hair red tetea is the tahitian name the paumotuan mokurea     part iii  the eight islands     chapter i  the kona coast   of the island of hawaii though i have passed days becalmed under its lee and spent a week upon its shores i have never yet beheld the profile dense clouds continued to enshroud it far below its midst not only the zone of snow and fire but a great part of the forest region covered or at least veiled by a perpetual rain and yet even on my first sight beholding so little and that through a glass from the deck of the casco the rude plutonic structure of the isle was conspicuous here was none of the accustomed glitter of the beach none of the close shoreside forests of the typical high island all seemed black and barren and to slope sheer into the sea unexpected movements of the land caught the attention folds that glittered with a certain vitreosity black mouths of caves ranges of low cliffs vigorously designed awhile in sun and shadow and that sank again into the general declivity of the island glacis under its gigantic cowl of cloud the coast frowned upon us with a face of desolation  on my return i passed from a humming city with shops and palaces and busy wharves plying cabs and tramcars telephones in operation and a railway in the building mounted a strong and comfortable local steamer sailed under desolate shores indeed but guided in the night by sea and harbour lights and was set down at last in a village uninhabited by any white the creature of pure native tasteof which what am i to say but that i know no such village in europe a welltodo western hamlet in the states would be the closest parallel and it is a moderate prophecy to call it so already  hookena is its name it stands on the same coast which i had wondered at before from the tossing casco the same coast on which the far voyager cook ended a noble career not very nobly that district of kona where he fell is one illustrious in the history of hawaii it was at first the centre of the dominion of the great kamehameha there in an unknown sepulchre his bones are still hidden there too his reputed treasures spoils of a buccaneer lie and are still vainly sought for in one of the thousand caverns of the lava there the tabus were first broken there the missionaries first received and but for the new use of ships and the new need of harbours here might be still the chief city and the organs of the kingdom yet a nearer approach confirmed the impression of the distance it presents to the seaward one immense decline streams of lava have followed and submerged each other down this slope and overflowed into the sea these cooled and shrank and were buried under fresh inundations or dislocated by fresh tremors of the mountain a multiplicity of caves is the result the mouths of caves are everywhere the lava is tunnelled with corridors and halls under houses high on the mountain the sea can be heard throbbing in the bowels of the land and there is one gallery of miles which has been used by armies as a pass streams are thus unknown the rain falls continually in the highlands an isle that rises nearly fourteen thousand feet sheer from the sea could never fail of rain but the treasure is squandered on a sieve and by sunless conduits returns unseen into the ocean corrugated slopes of lava bristling lava cliffs spouts of metallic clinkers miles of coast without a well or rivulet scarce anywhere a beach nowhere a harbour here seems a singular land to be contended for in battle as a seat for courts and princes yet it possessed in the eyes of the natives one more than countervailing advantage the windward shores of the isle are beaten by a monstrous surf there are places where goods and passengers must be hauled up and lowered by a rope there are coves which even the daring boatmen of hamakua dread to enter and men live isolated in their hamlets or communicate by giddy footpaths in the cliff upon the side of kona the tablelike margin of the lava affords almost everywhere a passage by land and the waves reduced by the vast breakwater of the island allow an almost continual communication by way of sea  yet even here the surf of the pacific appears formidable to the stranger as he lands and daily delights him with its beauty as he walks the shore  it was on a saturday afternoon that the steamer hall conveyed me to hookena she was charged with tourists on their way to the volcano and i found it hard to justify my choice of a week in an unheardof hamlet rather than a visit to one of the admitted marvels of the world i do not know that i can justify it now and to a larger audience i should prefer indeed to have seen both but i was at the time embarrassed with arrears of work it was imperative that i should choose and i chose one week in a kona village and another in the lazaretto and renounced the craters of maunaloa and haleakala for there are some so constituted as to find a man or a society more curious than the highest mountain some in whom the lava foreshores of kona and kaú will move as deep a wonder as the fiery vents that made them what they are  the land and sea breezes alternate on the kona coast with regularity and the veil of rain draws up and down the talus of the mountain now retiring to the zone of forests now descending to the margin of the sea it was in one of the latter and rarer moments that i was set on board a whale boat full of intermingled barrels passengers and oarsmen the rain fell and blotted the crude and sombre colours of the scene the coast rose but a little way it was then intercepted by the cloud and for all that appeared we might have been landing on an isle of some two hundred feet of elevation on the immediate foreshore under a low cliff there stood some score of houses trellised and verandahed set in narrow gardens and painted gaudily in green and white the whole surrounded and shaded by a grove of cocoapalms and fruit trees springing as by miracle from the bare lava in front the population of the neighbourhood were gathered for the weekly incident the passage of the steamer sixty to eighty strong and attended by a disproportionate allowance of horses mules and donkeys for this land of rock is singular to say a land of breeding the green trees the painted houses the gay dresses of the women were everywhere relieved on the uncompromising blackness of the lava and the rain which fell unheeded by the sightseers blended and beautified the contrast  the boat was run in upon a breaker and we passengers ejected on a flat rock where the next wave submerged us to the knees there we continued to stand the rain drenching us from above the sea from below like people mesmerised and as we were all being travellers tricked out with the green garlands of departure we must have offered somewhat the same appearance as a shipwrecked picnic  the purser spied and introduced me to my host exjudge nahinu who was then deep in business despatching and receiving goods he was dressed in pearlgrey tweed like any selfrespecting englishman only the band of his wideawake was made of peacocks featherhouse by and by said he his english being limited and carried me to the shelter of a rather lofty shed on three sides it was open on the fourth closed by a house it was reached from without by five or six wooden steps on the fourth side a farther flight of ten conducted to the balcony of the house a table spread with goods divided it across so that i knew it for the village store and according to the laws that rule in country life the village loungingplace people sat with dangling feet along the house verandah they sat on benches on the level of the shed or among the goods upon the counter they came and went they talked and waited they opened skimmed and pocketed halfread their letters they opened the journal and found a moment not for the news but for the current number of the story methought i might have been in france and the paper the petit journal instead of the nupepa eleele on other islands i had been the centre of attention here none observed my presence one hundred and ten years before the ancestors of these indifferents had looked in the faces of cook and his seamen with admiration and alarm called them gods called them volcanoes took their clothes for a loose skin confounded their hats and their heads and described their pockets as a treasure door through which they plunge their hands into their bodies and bring forth cutlery and necklaces and cloth and nails and today the coming of the most attractive stranger failed it would appear to divert them from miss porters scottish chiefs for that was the novel of the day  my host returned and led me round the shore among the mules and donkeys to his house like all the houses of the hamlet it was on the european or to be more descriptive on the american plan the parlour was fitted with the usual furniture and ornamented with the portraits of kamehameha the third lunalilo kalakaua the queen consort of the isles and queen victoria there was a bible on the table other books stood on a shelf a comfortable bedroom was placed at my service the welcome afforded me was cordial and unembarrassed the food good and plentiful my host my hostess his grown daughters strapping lassies his young hopefuls misbehaving at a meal or perfunctorily employed upon their schoolbooks all that i found in that house beyond the speech and a few exotic dishes on the table would have been familiar and exemplary in europe  i walked that night beside the sea the steamer with its lights and crowd of tourists was gone by it had left me alone among these aliens and i felt no touch of strangeness the trim lamplit houses shining quietly like villas each in its narrow garden the gentle sound of speech from within the room that awaited my return with the lamp and the books and the spectacled householder studying his biblethere was nothing changed it was in such conditions i had myself grown up and played a child beside the borders of another sea and some ten miles from where i walked cook was adored as a deity his bones when he was dead were cleansed for worship his entrails devoured in a mistake by rambling children  a day of session in the hookena courthouse equally surprised me the judge a very intelligent serious hawaiian sat behind a table taking careful notes two policemen with their bright metal badges standing attention at his back or bustling forth on errands the plaintiff was a portuguese for years he had kept store and raised cattle in the district without trouble or dispute his store stood always open it was standing so seven miles away at the moment of the case and when his cattle strayed they were duly impounded and restored to him on payment of one shilling but recently a gentleman of great acuteness and a thousand imperfect talents had married into the family of a neighbouring proprietor consecutively on which event the storekeepers cattle began to be detained and starved the fine rose to half a dollar and lastly a cow had disappeared the portuguese may have been right or wrong he was convinced the newcomer was the mainspring of the change called a suit in consequence against the fatherinlawand it was the soninlaw who appeared for the defence i saw him there seated at his ease with spectacles on brow still young much of a gentleman in looks and dressed in faultless european clothes and presently for my good fortune he rose to address the court it appears he has already stood for the hawaiian parliament but the people i was told did not think him honest and he was defeated honesty to our ways of thought appears a trifle in a candidate and i think we have few constituencies to refuse so great a charmer i understood but a few dozen words yet i heard the man with delight followed the junctures of his argument knew when he was enumerating points in his own favour when he was admitting those against him when he was putting a question per absurdum when after the due pause he smilingly replied to it there was no haste no heat no prejudice with a hinted gesture with a semitone of intonation the speaker lightly set forth and underlined the processes of reason he could not shift a foot nor touch his spectacles but what persuasion radiated in the courtit is impossible to conceive a style of oratory more rational or civilised the point to which he spoke was pretty in itself the people as i had been told did not think the orator honest some judge on a particular occasion had inclined to the same view and the man of talent was disbarred by a clause in a statute a layman or a disbarred lawyer might conduct a case for himself or for one of his own family is a fatherinlaw one of a mans own family yes argued the orator no with less grace and perspicuity nahinu retained by the portuguese the laws of the tight little kingdom are conceived in duplicate for the hawaiian hare and his many white friends the native text appearing inconclusive an appeal was made to the english and i as amicus curiæ was led out installed upon the courthouse steps and painfully examined as to its precise significance the judge heard the orator he heard nahinu he received by the mouth of the schoolmaster my report for which he thanked me with a bow and ruled the claimant out this skirmish decided the fate of the engagement fortune was faithful to the portuguese and late in the afternoon the capable judge rode off homeward with his portfolio under his arm no court could have been more equally and decently conducted judge parties lawyers and police were all decorous and competent and but for the plaintiff the business was entirely native  the portuguese had come seven miles to hookena sure of substantial justice and he left his store open fearless of being robbed another white man of strong sense and much frugality and choler thus reckoned up what he had lost by theft in thirtynine years among the different islands of hawaii a pair of shoes an umbrella some feet of hosepipe and one batch of chickens it is his continual practice to send hawaiians by a perilous solitary path with sums in specie at any moment the messenger might slip the moneybag roll down a thousand feet of precipice and lodge in fissures inaccessible to man and consider how easy it were to invent such misadventuresi should have to know a white man well before i trusted him he said i trust hawaiians without fear it would be villainous of me to say less it should be remembered the hawaiians of yore were not particular they were eager to steal from cook whom they believed to be a god and it was a theft that led to the tragedy at kealakekua bay and it must not be forgotten that the hawaiians of today are many of them poor one residual trait of savage incompetence i have already referred to they cannot administer a trusti was told there had never yet been a case known even a judge skilled in the knowledge of the law and upright in its administration was found insusceptible of those duties and distinctions which appear so natural and come so easy to the european but the disability stands alone a single survival in the midst of change and the faults of the modern hawaiian incline to the other side my orator of hookena courtroom may be a gentleman much maligned i may have received his character from the lips of his political opponents but the type described is common the islands begin to fill with lawyers many of whom justly or unjustly are disbarred and to the age of kamehameha the age of glossin has succeeded thus none would rob the store of the portuguese but the law was wrested to oppress him  it was of old a warlike and industrious race they were diggers and builders the isles are still full of their deserted monuments the modern word for law kanawai water rights still serves to remind us of their ancient irrigation and the island story is compact of battles their courage and goodwill to labour seems now confined to the sea where they are active sailors and fearless boatmen pursue the shark in his own element and make a pastime of their incomparable surf on shore they flee equally from toil and peril and are all turned to carpet occupations and to parlous frauds nahinu an exjudge was paid but two dollars for a hard day in court and he is paying a dollar a day to the labourers among his coffee all hawaiians envy and are ready to compete with him for this odd chance of an occasional fee for some hours talking he cannot find one to earn a certain hire under the sun in his plantation and the work is all transacted by immigrant chinese one cannot but be reminded of the love of the french middle class for office work but in hawaii it is the race in bulk that shrinks from manly occupation during a late revolution a lady found a powerful young hawaiian crouching among the grass in her garden what are you doing here she cried for she was a strong partisan do you not know they are murdering your king i know said the skulker why do you not go to help him she asked aflaid said the poor craven and crouched again among the grass here was a strange grandchild for the warriors that followed or faced kamehameha i give the singular instance as the more explicit but the whole race must have been stricken at the moment with a similar weakness no man dare say of this revolution that it was unprovoked but its means were treachery and violence the numbers and position of those engaged made the design one of the most insolent in history and a mere modicum of native boldness and cohesion must have brought it to the dust my race had one virtue they were brave said a typical hawaiian and now they have taken that away  i have named a french example but the thought that haunts the stranger in hawaii is that of italy the ruggedness of feature which marks out the race among polynesians is the italian ruggedness countenances of the same eloquent harshness manners of the same vivacious cordiality are to be found in hawaii and amongst italian fisherfolk or whose people in the midst of life retain more charm i recall faces both of men and women with a certain leonine stamp trusty sagacious brave beautiful in plainness faces that take the heart captive the tougher struggle of the race in these hard isles has written history there energy enlivens the hawaiian strengthor did so once and the faces are still eloquent of the lost possession the stock that has produced a cæsar a kamehameha a káahumanu retains their signature     chapter ii  a ride in the forest   by the hawaiian tongue the slope of these steep islands is parcelled out in zones as we mount from the seaboard we pass by the region of ilima named for a flowering shrub and the region of apaa named for a wind to mau the place of mist this has a secondary name the au or waokanaka the place of men by exclusion man not dwelling higher the next accordingly is called the waoakua region of gods and goblins other names some apparently involving thoughts of solitude and danger follow till the top is reached the mountain itself might be a god or the seat of a god it might be a volcano the home of the dread pele and into desert places few would venture but such as were adroit to snare the whispering spirits of the dead today from the waoakua or the waomaukele the gods have perhaps fled the descendants of vancouvers cattle fill them with less questionable terrors  as we mounted the glacis of the island the horses clattering on the lava we saw far above us the curtain of the rain exclude the view the sky was clear the sun strong overhead around us a thin growth of bushes and creepers glittered green in their black setting like plants upon a ruinous pavement all else was lavawastes of lava some of them enclosed it seemed in wantonness with drystone walls but the bushes when the rain descends often enough from its residential altitudes flourish extremely and cattle and asses walking on these resonant slabs collect a livelihood here and there a pricklypear came to the bigness of a standard tree and made a space of shade under one i saw a donkeyunder another no less than three cows huddled from the sun thus we had before our eyes the rationale of two of the native distinctions traversed the zone of flowering shrubs and saw above us the mist hang perennial in mau  as we continued to draw nearer to the rain trees began to be mingled with the shrubs and we came at last to where a house stood in an orchard of papaias with their palmlike growth and collar of green gourds in an outhouse stood the waterbarrel that necessity of kona life for all the water comes from heaven and must be caught and stored and the name of hookena itself may very well imply a cistern and a cup of water for the traveller along the coast the house belonged to nahinu but was in occupation by an american seeking to make butter there if i understood without success the butterman was gone to muse perhaps on fresh expedients his house was closed and i was able to observe his three chambers only through the windows in the first were milk pans and remains of breakfast in the second a bed in the third a scanty wardrobe hung from pegs and two pirated novels lay on the floor one was reversed and could not be identified the name of the other i made out it was little loo happy mr clark russell making life pleasant for the exile in his garden of papaias high over sea upon the forest edge and where the breeze comes freely  a little way beyond we plunged into the forest it grew at first very sparse and parklike the trees of a pale verdure but healthy the parasites per contra often dead underfoot the ground was still a rockery of fractured lava but now the interstices were filled with soil a sedgelike grass buffalo grass grew everywhere and the horses munched it by the way with relish candlenut trees with their white foliage stood in groves breadfruits were here and there but never welltodo hawaii is no true mother for the breadfruit or the cocoapalm mangoes on the other hand attained a splendid bigness many of them discoloured on one side with a purplish hue which struck the note of autumn the same note was repeated by a certain aerial creeper which drops you might suppose from heaven like the wreck of an old kite and roosts on treetops with a pendent raffle of airroots the whole of a colour like a wintry beechs these are clannish plants five or six may be quartered on a single tree thirty or forty on a grove the wood dies under them to skeletons and they swing there like things hung out from washing over the death they have provoked  we had now turned southward towards kaa following a shapeless bridletrack which is the high road of hawaii the sea was on one hand our way was acrossthe woods we threaded did but cling uponthe vast declivity of the island front for long as we still skirted the margin of the forest we kept an open view of the whole falling seaboard the white edge of surf now soundless to our ears and the high blue sea marbled by tide rips and showing under the clouds of an opalescent milky white the height the breeze the giddy gradient of the isle delighted me i observed a spider plant its abhorred st andrews cross against the sea and sky certainly fifty yards from where i rode and five feet at least from either tree so wide was its deathgossamer spread so huge the ugly vermin  presently the sea was lost the forest swallowed us ferns joined their fronds above a horsemans head high over these the dead and the living rose and were hung with tattered parasites the breeze no longer reached us it was steaming hot and the way went up and down so abruptly that in one place my saddlegirth was burst and we must halt for repairs in the midst of this rough wilderness i was reminded of the aim of our excursion the schoolmaster and certain others of hookena had recently bought a tract of land for some four thousand dollars set out coffee and hired a chinaman to mind it the thing was notable in itself natives selling land is a thing of daily custom of natives buying i have heard no other instance and it was civil to show interest but when i asked shall we come to your coffee plantation this is it said he and pointed down their bushes grew on the pathside our horses breasted them as they went by and the gray wood on every hand enclosed and overarched that thread of cultivation  a little farther we strung in single file through the hot crypt our horses munching grass their riders chewing unpalatable gum collected from a tree next the wood opened and we issued forth again into the day on the precipitous broadside of the isle a village was before us a catholic church and perhaps a dozen scattered houses some of grass in the old island fashion others spickandspan with outside stair and balcony and trellis and white paint and green in the more modern taste one arrested my attention it stood on the immediate verge of a deep precipice two stories high with double balconies painted white and showing by my count fifteen windows there is a fine house said i outside returned the schoolmaster drily that is the way with natives they spend money on the outside let us go there you will find they live in the verandah and have no furniture we were made welcome sure enough on the verandah and in the lower room which i entered there was not a chair or table only mats on the floor and photographs and lithographs upon the wall the house was an eidolon designed to gladden the eye and enlarge the heart of the proprietor returning from hookena and its fifteen windows were only to be numbered from without doubtless that owner had attained his end for i observed when we were home again at hookena and nahinu was describing our itinerary to his wife he mentioned we had baited at kahalenuithe great house  the photographs were of the royal family that goes without saying in hawaii of the two lithographs made in san francisco one i knew at the first sight for general garfield the second tempted and tantalised me it could not be i thoughtand yet it must it was this dubiety which carried me across the threshold and behold it was indeed the duke of thunder his name printed under his effigies in the hawaiianised form of nelesona i thought it a fine instance of fame that his features and his empty sleeve should have been drawn on stone in san fransisco which was a lone mexican mission while he lived and lettered for a market in those islands which were not yet united under kamehameha when he died and then i had a cold fit and wondered after all if these good folk knew anything of the mans worldshaking deeds and gunpowder weaknesses or if he was to them a bare appellation and a face on stone and turning to the schoolmaster i asked of him the question yes the hawaiians knew of nelesona there had been a story in the papers where he figured and the portrait had been given for a supplement so he was known as a character of romance brave men since agamemnon like the brave before must patiently expect the inspired author and nowhere has fiction deeper roots than in the world of polynesia they are all tellers and hearers of tales and the first requisite of any native paper is a story from the english or the french these are of all sorts and range from the works of good miss porter to the lightning detective miss porter i was told was drawing in hawaii and dumas and the arabian nights were named as having pleased extremely  our homeward way was down the hill and by the sea in the black open we traversed a waste of shattered lava spires ravines wellholes showing the entrance to vast subterranean vaults in whose profundities our horsehooves doubtless echoed the whole was clothed with stone fiorituri fantastically fashioned like débris from the workshop of some brutal sculptor dogs heads devils stone trees and gargoyles broken in the making from a distance so intricate was the detail the side of a hummock wore the appearance of some coarse and dingy sort of coral or a scorched growth of heather amid this jumbled wreck naked itself and the evidence of old disaster frequent plants found root roseapples bore their rosy flowers and a bush between a cypress and a juniper attained at times a height of twenty feet  the breakneck path had descended almost to the sea and we were already within sound of its reverberations when a cliff hove up suddenly on the landward hand very rugged and broken streaked with white lichen laddered with green lianas and pierced with the apertures of half a hundred caves two of these were piously sealed with doors the wood scarce weathered for the hawaiian remembers the repository of the bones of old and is still jealous of the safety of ancestral relics nor without cause for the white man comes and goes upon the hunt for curiosities and one it is rumoured consults soothsayers and explores the caves of kona after the fabled treasures of kamehameha     chapter iii  the city of refuge   our way was northward on the naked lava of the coast the schoolmaster led the march on a trumpeting black stallion not without anxious thought i followed after on a mare the sun smote us fair and full the air streamed from the hot rock the distant landscape gleamed and trembled through its vortices on the left the coast heaved bodily upward to mau the zone of mists and forests where it rains all day and the clouds creep up and down and the groves loom and vanish in the margin  the land was still a crust of lava here and there ramparted with cliffs and which here and there breaks down and shows the mouths of branching galleries mines and tombs of natures making endlessly vaulted and ramified below our passage wherever a house is cocoapalms spring sheer out of the rock a little shabby in this northern latitude not visibly the worse for their inclement rooting hookena had shone out green under the black lip of the overhanging crag green as a may orchard the lava might have been some rich black loam everywhere in the fissures of the rock green herbs and flowering bushes prospered donkeys and cattle were everywhere everywhere too their whitened bones telling of drought no sound but of the sea pervades this region and it smells strong of the open water and of aromatic plants  we skirted one cliffy cove full of bursting surges and if it had not been for the palms and the houses and the canoes that were putting out to fish and the colour of the cliffs and the bright dresses lilac red and green of the women that sat about the doors at work i might have thought myself in devonshire a little further we passed a garden enclosed in dry stone walls from the surrounding blackness it seemed a wonder of fertility hard by was the owner a white man waiting the turn of the tide by the margin of his well so soon as the sea flowed he might begin to irrigate with brackish water the children hailed my companion from wayside houses with one little maid knotting her gown about her in embarrassment so as to define her little person like a suit of tights we held a conversation more prolonged will you be at school tomorrow yes sir do you like school yes sir do you like bathing no maam with a staggering change of sex another maiden of more tender growth and wholly naked fled into the house at our approach and appeared again with a corner of a towel leaning one hand on the post and applying her raiment with the other she stood in the door and watched us haughtily the white flag of a surveyor and a poundmasters notice on a board told of the reign of law  at length we turned the corner of a point and debouched on a flat of lava on the landward hand cliffs made a quadrant of an amphitheatre melting on either side into the general mountain of the isle over these rivers of living lava had once flowed had frozen as they fell and now depended like a sculptured drapery here and there the mouth of a cave was seen half blocked some green lianas beckoning in the entrance in front the fissured pavement of the lava stretched into the sea and made a surfy point a scattered village two white churches one catholic one protestant a grove of tall and scraggy palms and a long bulk of ruin occupy the end off the point not a cables length beyond the breaching surf a schooner rode come to discharge houseboards and presently due at hookena to load lepers the village is honaunau the ruin the hale keawe temple and city of refuge  the ruin made a massive figure rising from the flat lava in ramparts twelve to fifteen feet high of an equal thickness and enclosing an area of several acres the unmortared stones were justly set in places the bulwark was still true to the plummet in places ruinous from the shock of earthquakes the enclosure was divided in unequal partsthe greater the city of refuge the smaller the heiau or temple the socalled house of keawe or reliquary of his royal bones not his alone but those of many monarchs of hawaii were treasured here but whether as the founder of the shrine or because he had been more renowned in life keawe was the reigning and the hallowing saint and keawe can produce at least one claim to figure on the canon for since his death he has wrought miracles as late as 1829 kaahumanu sent messengers to bring the relics of the kings from their long repose at honaunau first to the keepers wife and then to the keeper the spirit of keawe appeared in a dream bidding them prevent the desecration upon the second summons they rose trembling hasted with a torch into the crypt exchanged the bones of keawe with those of some less holy chieftains and were back in bed but not yet asleep and the day had not yet dawned before the messengers arrived so it comes that to this hour the bones of keawe like those of his great descendant sleep in some unknown crevice of that caverned isle  when ellis passed in 1823 six years before this intervention of the dead the temple still preserved some shadow of its ancient credit and presented much of its original appearance he has sketched it rudely in a drawing more effectively in words several rudely carved male and female images of wood were placed on the outside of the enclosure some on low pedestals under the shade of an adjacent tree others on high posts on the jutting rocks that hung over the edge of the water a number stood on the fence at unequal distances all around but the principal assemblage of these frightful representatives of their former deities was at the southeast end of the enclosed space where forming a semicircle twelve of them stood in grim array as if perpetual guardians of the mighty dead reposing in the house adjoining once they had evidently been clothed but now they appeared in the most indigent nakedness the horrid stare of these idols the tattered garments upon some of them and the heaps of rotting offerings before them seemed to us no improper emblems of the system they were designed to support distinguished alike by its cruelty folly and wretchedness we endeavoured to gain admission to the inside of the house but were told it was strictly prohibited however by pushing one of the boards across the doorway a little on one side we looked in and saw many large images with distended mouths large rows of sharks teeth and pearlshell eyes we also saw several bundles apparently of human bones cleaned carefully tied up with sinnet made of cocoanut fibre and placed in different parts of the house together with some rich shawls and other valuable articles probably worn by those to whom the bones belonged thus the careless eyes of ellis viewed and passed over the bones of sacrosanct keawe in his house which he had builded  cities of refuge are found not only in hawaii but in the gilberts where their name is now invariably used for a mosquitonet but the refuge of the gilberts was only a house in a village and only offered like european churches a sanctuary for the time the hunted man might harbour there and live on charity woe to him if he stepped without the city of refuge of honaunau possessed a larger efficacy its gate once passed an appearance made before the priest on duty a hasty prayer addressed to the chief idol and the guilty man was free to go again relieved from all the consequences of his crime or his misfortune in time of war its bulwarks were advertised by pennons of white tapa and the aged the children and the poorerhearted of the women of the district awaited there the issue of the battle but the true wives followed their lords into the field and shared with them their toil and danger  the city had yet another function there was in hawaii a class apart comparable to the doomed families of tahiti whose special mission was to supply the altar it seems the victim fell usually on the holy day of which there were four in the month between these the man was not only safe but enjoyed in virtue of his destiny a singular licence of behaviour his immunities exceeded those of the mediæval priest and jester rolled in one he might have donned the kings girdle the height of sacrilege and treason and gone abroad with it unpunished and apparently unblamed and with a little care and some acquaintance in priests families he might prolong this life of licence to old age but the laws of human nature are implacable their destiny of privilege and peril turned the mens heads even at dangerous seasons they went recklessly abroad upon their pleasures were often sighted in the open and must run for the city of refuge with the priestly murderers at their heels it is strange to think it was a priest also who stood in the door to welcome and protect them  the enclosure of the sanctuary was all paved with the lava scattered blocks encumbered it in places everywhere tall cocoapalms jutted from the fissures and drew shadows on the floor a loud continuous sound of the near sea burthened the ear these rude monumental ruins and the thought of that life and faith of which they stood memorial threw me in a muse there are times and places where the past becomes more vivid than the present and the memory dominates the ear and eye i have found it so in the presence of the vestiges of rome i found it so again in the city of refuge at honaunau and the strange busy and perilous existence of the old hawaiian the grinning idols of the heiau the priestly murderers and the fleeing victim rose before and mastered my imagination  some dozen natives of honaunau followed me about to show the boundaries and i was recalled from these scattering thoughts by one of my guides laying his hand on a big block of lava  this stone is called kaahumanu said he it is here she lay hid with her dog from kamehameha  and he told me an anecdote which would not interest the reader as it interested me till he has learned what manner of woman kaahumanu was     chapter iv  kaahumanu   kamehameha the first founder of the realm of the eight islands was a man properly entitled to the style of great all chiefs in polynesia are tall and portly and kamehameha owed his life in the battle with the puna fishers to the vigour of his body he was skilled in single combat as a general he was almost invariably the victor yet it is not as a soldier that he remains fixed upon the memory rather as a kindly and wise monarch full of sense and shrewdness like an old plain country farmer when he had a mind to make a present of fish he went to the fishing himself when famine fell on the land he remitted the tributes cultivated a garden for his own support with his own hands and set all his friends to do the like their patches of land each still known by the name of its highborn gardener were shown to ellis on his tour he passed laws against cutting down young sandalwood trees and against the killing of the bird from which the feather mantles of the archipelago were made the yellow feathers were to be plucked he directed and the bird dismissed again to freedom his people were astonished you are old they argued soon you will die what use will it be to you let the bird go said the king it will be for my children afterwards alas that his laws had not prevailed sandalwood and yellow feathers are now things of yesterday in his dominions  the attitude of this brave old fellow to the native religion was for some while before his death ambiguous a white man tradition says had come to hawaii upon a visit king kalakaua assures me he was an englishman and a missionary if that be so he should be easy to identify it was this missionarys habit to go walking in the morning ere the sun was up and before doing so to kindle a light and make tea the king who rose early himself to watch the behaviour of his people observed the light made inquiries learned of and grew curious about these morning walks threw himself at last in the missionarys path and drew him into talk the meeting was repeated and the missionary began to press the king with christianity if you will throw yourself from that cliff said kamehameha and come down uninjured i will accept your religion not unless but the missionary was a man of parts he wrote a deep impression on his hearers mind and after he had left for home kamehameha called his chief priest and announced he was about to break the tabus and to change his faith the kahuna replied that he was the kings servant but the step was grave and it would be wiser to proceed by divination kamehameha consented each built a new heiau over against the others and when both were finished a game of what we call french and english or the tug of war was played upon the intervening space the party of the priest prevailed the kings men were dragged in a body into the opposite temple and the tabus were maintained none employed in this momentous foolery were informed of its significance the kings misgivings were studiously concealed but there is little doubt he continued to cherish them in secret at his death he had another memorable word testifying to his old preoccupation for his sons estate implying besides a weakened confidence in the island deities his sickness was heavy upon him the time had manifestly come to offer sacrifice the people had fled already from the then dangerous vicinity and lay hid none but priests and chiefs remained about the king a man to your god they urgeda man to your god that you may recover the man is sacred to my son the king replied kamehameha so much appeared in public but it is believed that he left secret commands upon the high chief kalanimoku and on kaahumanu the most beautiful and energetic of his wives to do as soon as he was dead that which he had spared to do while living  no time was lost the very day of his death may 8th 1819 the women of the court ate of forbidden food and some of the men sat down with them to meat infidelity must have been deepseated in the circle of kamehameha for no portent followed this defiance of the gods and none of the transgressors died but the priests were doubtless informed of what was doing the blame lay clearly on the shoulders of kaahumanu the most conspicuous person in the land named by the dying kamehameha for a conditional successor if liholiho do amiss let kaahumanu take the kingdom and preserve it the priests met in council of diviners and by a natural retort it was upon kaahumanu that they laid the fault of the kings death this conspiracy appears to have been quite in vain kaahumanu sat secure on the day of the coronation when the young king came forth from the heiau clad in a red robe and crowned with his english diadem it was almost as an equal that she met and spoke to him son of heaven i name to you the possessions of your father here are the chiefs there are the people of your father there are your guns here is your land but let you and me enjoy that land together he must have known already she was a freeeater and there is no doubt he trembled at the thought of that impiety and of its punishment yet he consented to what seems her bold proposal the same day he met his own mother who signed to him privately that he should eat free but liholiho the poor drunkard who died in london was incapable of so much daring he hung long apart from the court circle with a clique of the more superstitious and it was not till five months later after a drinking bout in a canoe at sea that he was decoyed to land by stronger spirits and was seen perhaps scarce conscious of his acts to eat of a dog drink rum and smoke tobacco with his servant women thus the food tabu fell finally at court ere it could be stamped out upon hawaii a war must be fought wherein the chief of the old party fell in battle his brave wife manono by his side mourned even by the missionary ellis  the fall of one tabu involved the fall of others the land was plunged in dissolution morals ceased when the missionaries came april 1820 all the wisdom in the kingdom was prepared to embrace the succour of some new idea kaahumanu early ranged upon that side perhaps at first upon a ground of politics but gradually she fell more and more under the influence of the new teachers loved them served them valorously defended them in dangers which she shared and put away at their command her second husband to the end of a long life she played an almost sovereign part so that in the ephemerides of hawaii the progresses of kaahumanu are chronicled along with the deaths and the accessions of kings for two successive sovereigns and in troublous periods she held the reins of regency with a fortitude that has not been called in question with a loyalty beyond reproach and at last on 5th june 1832 this duke of wellington of a woman made the end of a saint fiftyseven years after her marriage with the conqueror the date of her birth it seems is lost we may call her seventy  kaahumanu was a woman of the chiefly stature and of celebrated beauty bingham admits she was beautiful for a polynesian and her husband cherished her exceedingly he had the indelicacy to frame and publish an especial law declaring death against the man who should approach her and yet no penalty against herself and in 1809 after thirtyfour years of marriage and when she must have been nearing fifty an island chastelard of the name of kanihonui was found to be her lover and paid the penalty of life she cynically surviving some twenty years later one of the missionaries had written home denouncing the misconduct of an english whaler the whaler got word of the denunciation and with the complicity of the english consul sought to make a crime of it against the mission party spirit ran very violent in the islands tears were shed threats flying and kaahumanu called a council of the chiefs in that day stood forth the native historian david malo though his name should rather have been nathan and pressed the regent with historic instances who was to be punishedthe whaler guilty of the act the missionary whose denunciation had provoked the scandal o you the wife of kamehameha said he kanihonui came and slept with you luheluhe declared to kamehameha the sleeping together of you two i ask you which of these two persons was slain by kamehameha was it luheluhe and she answered it was kanihonui shakespeare never imagined such a character and it would require none less than he to represent her sublimities and contradictions  after this heroine the stone in the precinct of honaunau had been named here is the reason and the tale completes her portrait kamehameha was of course polygamous the number of his wives rose at last to twentyfive and out of these no less than two were the sisters of kaahumanu the favourite was of a jealous habit and when it came to a sister for a rival her jealousy overflowed she fled by night plunged in the sea came swimming to honaunau entered the precinct by the seagate and hid herself behind the stone there she lay naked and refused food the flight was discovered as she had come swimming none had seen her pass the priests of the temple were bound it seems to silence and kona was filled with the messengers of the dismayed kamehameha vainly seeking the favourite now kaahumanu had a dog who was much attached to her who had accompanied her in her long swim and lay by her side behind the stone and it chanced as the messengers ran past the city of refuge that the dog perhaps recognising them began to bark ah there is the dog of kaahumanu said the messengers and returned and told the king she was at the hale o keawe thence kamehameha fetched or sent for her and the breach in their relations was restored  a king preferred this woman out of a kingdom kanihonui died for her when she was fifty even her dog adored her even bingham who did not see her until 1820 thought her beautiful for a polynesian and while she was thus in person an emblem of womanly charm she made her life illustrious with the manly virtues there are some who give to mary queen of scots the place of saint and muse in their historic meditations i recommend to them instead the wife and widow of the island conqueror the hawaiian was the nobler woman with the nobler story and no disenchanting portrait will be found to shatter an ideal     chapter v  the lepers of kona   a step beyond hookena a wooden house with two doors stands isolated in a field of broken lava like ploughed land i had approached it on the night of my arrival and found it black and silent yet even then it had inmates a man and a woman sat there captive and the man had a knife brought to him in secret by his family not long perhaps after i was by the man silencing by threats his fellowprisoner cut through the floor and escaped to the mountain it was known he had a comrade there hunted on the same account and their friends kept them supplied with food and ammunition upon the mountains in most islands of the group similar outlaws rove in bands or dwell alone unsightly hermits and but the other day an officer was wounded while attempting an arrest some are desperate fellows some mournful womenmothers and wives some stripling girls a day or two for instance after the man had escaped the police got word of another old offender made a forced march and took the quarry sitting this time with little peril to themselves for the outlaw was a girl of nineteen who had been two years under the rains in the high forest with her mother for comrade and accomplice how does their own poet sing              in the land of distress   my dwelling was on the mountain height   my talking companions were the birds   the decaying leaves of the ki my clothing  it is for no crime this lawabiding race flee to the woods it is no fear of the gallows or the dungeon that nerves themselves to resist and their friends to aid and to applaud them their liability is for disease they are lepers and what they combine to combat is not punishment but segregation while china and england and france in their tropical possessions either attempt nothing or effect little hawaii has honourably faced the problem of this ancient and apparently reviving malady her small extent is an advantage but the ruggedness of the physical characters the desert woods and mountains and the habit of the native mind oppose success to the native mind our medical opinions seem unfounded we smile to hear of ghosts and gods they when they are told to keep warm in fevers or to avoid contagion leprosy in particular they cannot be persuaded to avoid but no mere opinion would exalt them to resist the law and lie in forests did not a question of the family bond embitter and exasperate the opposition their family affection is strong but unerect it is luxuriously selfindulgent circumscribed within the passing moment without providence without nobility incapable of healthful rigour the presence and the approval of the loved one it matters not how purchased there is the single demand of the polynesian by a natural consequence when death intervenes he is consoled the more easily against this undignified fervour of attachment marital and parental the law of segregation often beats in vain it is no fear of the lazaretto they know the dwellers are well used in molokai they receive letters from friends already there who praise the place and could the family be taken in a body they would go with glee overjoyed to draw rations from government but all cannot become pensioners at once a proportion of ratepayers must be kept and the leper must go alone or with a single relative and the native instinctively resists the separation as a weasel bites a similar reluctance can be shown in molokai itself by a recent law clean children born within the precinct are taken from their leper parents sent to an intermediate hospital and given a chance of life and health and liberty i have stood by while mr meyer and mr hutchinson the luna and the subluna of the lazaretto opened the petitions of the settlement as they sat together on the steps of the guesthouse at kalawao letter after letter was passed between them with a sneer and flung upon the ground till i was at last struck with this cavalier procedure and inquired the nature of the appeals they were all the same all from leper parents all pleading to have their clean children retained in that abode of sorrow and all alleging the same reasonaloha nuinuian extreme affection such was the extreme affection of kaahumanu for kanihonui by which she indulged her wantonness in safety and he died but love has a countenance more severe  the scenes i am about to describe moving as they were to witness have thus an element of something weak and false sympathy may flow freely for the leper girl it may flow for her mother with reserve it must not betray us into a shadow of injustice for the government whose laws they had attempted to evade that which is pathetic is not needfully wrong  i walked in a bright sun after a grateful rain upon the shore beyond hookena the breeze was of heavenly freshness the surf was jubilant in all the caves it was a morning to put a man in thought of the antiquity the health and cleanness of the earth and behold when i came abreast of the little pesthouse on the lava both the doors were open in front a circle of some halfadozen women and children sat conspicuous in the usual bright raiment in their midst was a crouching and bowed figure swathed in a black shawl and motionless and as i drew more near i was aware of a continuous and highpitched drone of song the figure in the midst was the leper girl the song was the improvisation of the mother pouring out her sorrow in the island way that was not singing explained the schoolmasters wife on my return that was crying and she sketched for me the probable tenor of the lament o my daughter o my child now you are going away from me now you are taken away from me at last and so on without end  the thought of the girl so early separated from her fellowsthe look of her lying there covered from eyesight like an untimely birthperhaps more than all the penetrating note of the lamentsubdued my courage utterly with the natural impulse i began to seek some outlet for my pain it occurred to me that after two years in the woods the family affairs might well have suffered and in view of the transplantation clothes furniture or money might be needful i believe it was not done wisely since it was gone about in ignorance i dare say it flowed from a sentiment no more erect than that of polynesians i am sure there were many in england to whom my superfluity had proved more useful but the next morning saw me at the pesthouse under convoy of the schoolmaster and the policeman  the doors were again open a fire was burning and a pot cooking on the lava under the supervision of an old woman in a grassgreen sacque this dame who seemed more merry than refined hailed me seized me and tried to seat me in her lap a jolly and coarse old girl from whom in my hour of sentiment i fled with craven shrinking to whom upon a retrospect i do more justice the two lepers both women sat in the midst of their visitors even the children to my grief touching them freely the elder chatting at intervalsthe girl in the same black weed and bowed in the same attitude as yesterday it was painfully plain she would conceal if possible her face perhaps she had been beautiful certainly poor soul she had been vaina gift of equal value some consultation followed i was told that nothing was required for outfit but a gift in money would be gratefully received and this forgetting i was in the south seas i was about to make in silence the confounded expression of the schoolmaster reminded me of where i was we stood up accordingly side by side before the lepers i made the necessary speech which the schoolmaster translated sentence by sentence the money thus hallowed by oratory was handed over and received and the two women each returned a dry mahalo the girl not even then exhibiting her face  between nine and ten of the same morning the schooner layto off hookena and a whaleboat came ashore the village clustered on the rocks for the farewell a grief perhapsa performance certainly we miss in our modern life these operatic consolations of the past the lepers came singly and unattended the elder first the girl a little after tricked out in a red dress and with a fine red feather in her hat in this bravery it was the more affecting to see her move apart on the rocks and crouch in her accustomed attitude but this time i had seen her face it was scarce horribly affected but had a haunting look of an unfinished wooden doll at once expressionless and disproportioned doubtless a sore spectacle in the mirror of youth next there appeared a woman of the middle life of a swaggering gait a gallant figure and a bold handsome face she came swinging her hat rolling her eyes and shoulders visibly working herself up the crowd stirred and murmured on her passage and i knew without being told this was the mother and protagonist close by the sea in the midst of the spectators she sat down and raised immediately the notes of the lament one after another of her friends approached her to one after the other she reached out an arm embraced them down rocked awhile with them embraced and passionately kissed them in the island fashion with the pressed face the leper girl at last as at some signal rose from her seat apart drew near was inarmed like the rest and with a small knot i suppose of the most intimate held some while in a general clasp through all the wail continued rising into words and a sort of passionate declamatory recitation as each friend approached sinking again as the pair rocked together into the tremolo drone at length the scene was over the performers rose the lepers and the mother were helped in silence to their places the whaleboat was urged between the reefs into a bursting surge and swung next moment without on the smooth swell almost every countenance about me streamed with tears  it was odd but perhaps natural amongst a ceremonious oratorical race that the boat should have waited while a passenger publicly lamented on the beach it was more odd still that the mother should have been the chief rather the only actor she was leaving indeed she hoped to be taken as a kokua or clean assistant and thus accompany her daughter to the settlement but she was far from sure and it was highly possible she might return to kona in a month the lepers on the other hand took leave for ever in so far as regarded their own isle and birthplace and for their friends and families it was their day of death    the soldier from the war returns    the sailor from the main  but not the sick from the gray island yet they went unheeded and the chief part and the whole stage and sympathy was for their travelling companion  at the time i was too deeply moved to criticise mere sympathy oppressed my spirit it had always been a point with me to visit the station if i could on the rocks of hookena the design was fixed i had seen the departure of lepers for the place of exile i must see their arrival and that place itself6   footnote    6 for an account of the writers visit to the leper settlement see     letters section x     part iv  the gilberts     chapter i  butaritari   at honolulu we had said farewell to the casco and to captain otis and our next adventure was made in changed conditions passage was taken for myself my wife mr osbourne and my china boy ah fu on a pigmy trading schooner the equator captain dennis reid and on a certain bright june day in 1889 adorned in the hawaiian fashion with the garlands of departure we drew out of port and bore with a fair wind for micronesia  the whole extent of the south seas is desert of ships more especially that part where we were now to sail no post runs in these islands communication is by accident where you may have designed to go is one thing where you shall be able to arrive another it was my hope for instance to have reached the carolines and returned to the light of day by way of manila and the china ports and it was in samoa that we were destined to reappear and be once more refreshed with the sight of mountains since the sunset faded from the peaks of oahu six months had intervened and we had seen no spot of earth so high as an ordinary cottage our path had been still on the flat sea our dwellings upon unerected coral our diet from the pickletub or out of tins i had learned to welcome shark flesh for a variety and a mountain an onion an irish potato or a beefsteak had been long lost to sense and dear to aspiration  the two chief places of our stay butaritari and apemama lie near the line the latter within thirty miles both enjoy a superb ocean climate days of blinding sun and bracing wind nights of a heavenly brightness both are somewhat wider than fakarava measuring perhaps at the widest a quarter of a mile from beach to beach in both a coarse kind of taro thrives its culture is a chief business of the natives and the consequent mounds and ditches make miniature scenery and amuse the eye in all else they show the customary features of an atoll the low horizon the expanse of the lagoon the sedgelike rim of palmtops the sameness and smallness of the land the hugely superior size and interest of sea and sky life on such islands is in many points like life on shipboard the atoll like the ship is soon taken for granted and the islanders like the ships crew become soon the centre of attention the isles are populous independent seats of kinglets recently civilised little visited in the last decade many changes have crept in women no longer go unclothed till marriage the widow no longer sleeps at night and goes abroad by day with the skull of her dead husband and firearms being introduced the spear and the sharktooth sword are sold for curiosities ten years ago all these things and practices were to be seen in use yet ten years more and the old society will have entirely vanished we came in a happy moment to see its institutions still erect and in apemama scarce decayed  populous and independentwarrens of men ruled over with some rustic pompsuch was the first and still the recurring impression of these tiny lands as we stood across the lagoon for the town of butaritari a stretch of the low shore was seen to be crowded with the brown roofs of houses those of the palace and kings summer parlour which are of corrugated iron glittered near one end conspicuously bright the royal colours flew hard by on a tall flagstaff in front on an artificial islet the gaol played the part of a martello even upon this first and distant view the place had scarce the air of what it truly was a village rather of that which it was also a petty metropolis a city rustic and yet royal  the lagoon is shoal the tide being out we waded for some quarter of a mile in tepid shallows and stepped ashore at last into a flagrant stagnancy of sun and heat the lee side of a line island after noon is indeed a breathless place on the ocean beach the trade will be still blowing boisterous and cool out in the lagoon it will be blowing also speeding the canoes but the screen of bush completely intercepts it from the shore and sleep and silence and companies of mosquitoes brood upon the towns  we may thus be said to have taken butaritari by surprise a few inhabitants were still abroad in the north end at which we landed as we advanced we were soon done with encounter and seemed to explore a city of the dead only between the posts of open houses we could see the townsfolk stretched in the siesta sometimes a family together veiled in a mosquito net sometimes a single sleeper on a platform like a corpse on a bier  the houses were of all dimensions from those of toys to those of churches some might hold a battalion some were so minute they could scarce receive a pair of lovers only in the playroom when the toys are mingled do we meet such incongruities of scale many were open sheds some took the form of roofed stages others were walled and the walls pierced with little windows a few were perched on piles in the lagoon the rest stood at random on a green through which the roadway made a ribbon of sand or along the embankments of a sheet of water like a shallow dock one and all were the creatures of a single tree palmtree wood and palmtree leaf their materials no nail had been driven no hammer sounded in their building and they were held together by lashings of palmtree sinnet  in the midst of the thoroughfare the church stands like an island a lofty and dim house with rows of windows a rich tracery of framing sustains the roof and through the door at either end the street shows in a vista the proportions of the place in such surroundings and built of such materials appeared august and we threaded the nave with a sentiment befitting visitors in a cathedral benches run along either side in the midst on a crazy dais two chairs stand ready for the king and queen when they shall choose to worship over their heads a hoop apparently from a hogshead depends by a strip of red cotton and the hoop which hangs askew is dressed with streamers of the same material red and white  this was our first advertisement of the royal dignity and presently we stood before its seat and centre the palace is built of imported wood upon a european plan the roof of corrugated iron the yard enclosed with walls the gate surmounted by a sort of lychhouse it cannot be called spacious a labourer in the states is sometimes more commodiously lodged but when we had the chance to see it within we found it was enriched beyond all island expectation with coloured advertisements and cuts from the illustrated papers even before the gate some of the treasures of the crown stand public a bell of a good magnitude two pieces of cannon and a single shell the bell cannot be rung nor the guns fired they are curiosities proofs of wealth a part of the parade of the royalty and stand to be admired like statues in a square a straight gut of water like a canal runs almost to the palace door the containing quaywalls excellently built of coral over against the mouth by what seems an effect of landscape art the martellolike islet of the gaol breaks the lagoon vassal chiefs with tribute neighbour monarchs come aroving might here sail in view with surprise these extensive public works and be awed by these mouths of silent cannon it was impossible to see the place and not to fancy it designed for pageantry but the elaborate theatre then stood empty the royal house deserted its doors and windows gaping the whole quarter of the town immersed in silence on the opposite bank of the canal on a roofed stage an ancient gentleman slept publicly sole visible inhabitant and beyond on the lagoon a canoe spread a striped lateen the sole thing moving  the canal is formed on the south by a pier or causeway with a parapet at the far end the parapet stops and the quay expands into an oblong peninsula in the lagoon the breathingplace and summer parlour of the king the midst is occupied by an open house or permanent marqueecalled here a maniapa or as the word is now pronounced a maniapat the lowest estimation forty feet by sixty the iron roof lofty but exceedingly lowbrowed so that a woman must stoop to enter is supported externally on pillars of coral within by a frame of wood the floor is of broken coral divided in aisles by the uprights of the frame the house far enough from shore to catch the breeze which enters freely and disperses the mosquitoes and under the low eaves the sun is seen to glitter and the waves to dance on the lagoon  it was now some while since we had met any but slumberers and when we had wandered down the pier and stumbled at last into this bright shed we were surprised to find it occupied by a society of wakeful people some twenty souls in all the court and guardsmen of butaritari the court ladies were busy making mats the guardsmen yawned and sprawled half a dozen rifles lay on a rock and a cutlass was leaned against a pillar the armoury of these drowsy musketeers at the far end a little closed house of wood displayed some tinsel curtains and proved upon examination to be a privy on the european model in front of this upon some mats lolled teburcimoa the king behind him on the panels of the house two crossed rifles represented fasces he wore pyjamas which sorrowfully misbecame his bulk his nose was hooked and cruel his body overcome with sodden corpulence his eye timorous and dull he seemed at once oppressed with drowsiness and held awake by apprehension a pepper rajah muddled with opium and listening for the march of the dutch army looks perhaps not otherwise we were to grow better acquainted and first and last i had the same impression he seemed always drowsy yet always to hearken and start and whether from remorse or fear there is no doubt he seeks a refuge in the abuse of drugs  the rajah displayed no sign of interest in our coming but the queen who sat beside him in a purple sacque was more accessible and there was present an interpreter so willing that his volubility became at last the cause of our departure he had greeted us upon our entrancethat is the honourable king and i am his interpreter he had said with more stateliness than truth for he held no appointment in the court seemed extremely illacquainted with the island language and was present like ourselves upon a visit of civility mr williams was his name an american darkey runaway ships cook and barkeeper at the land we live in tavern butaritari i never knew a man who had more words in his command or less truth to communicate neither the gloom of the monarch nor my own efforts to be distant could in the least abash him and when the scene closed the darkey was left talking  the town still slumbered or had but just begun to turn and stretch itself it was still plunged in heat and silence so much the more vivid was the impression that we carried away of the house upon the islet the micronesian saul wakeful amid his guards and his unmelodious david mr williams chattering through the drowsy hours     chapter ii  the four brothers   the kingdom of tebureimoa includes two islands great and little makin some two thousand subjects pay him tribute and two semiindependent chieftains do him qualified homage the importance of the office is measured by the man he may be a nobody he may be absolute and both extremes have been exemplified within the memory of residents  on the death of king tetimararoa tebureimoas father nakaeia the eldest son succeeded he was a fellow of huge physical strength masterful violent with a certain barbaric thrift and some intelligence of men and business alone in his islands it was he who dealt and profited he was the planter and the merchant and his subjects toiled for his behoof in servitude when they wrought long and well their taskmaster declared a holiday and supplied and shared a general debauch the scale of his providing was at times magnificent six hundred dollars worth of gin and brandy was set forth at once the narrow land resounded with the noise of revelry and it was a common thing to see the subjects staggering themselves parade their drunken sovereign on the forehatch of a wrecked vessel king and commons howling and singing as they went at a word from nakaeias mouth the revel ended makin became once more an isle of slaves and of teetotalers and on the morrow all the population must be on the roads or in the taropatches toiling under his bloodshot eye  the fear of nakaeia filled the land no regularity of justice was affected there was no trial there were no officers of the law it seems there was but one penalty the capital and daylight assault and midnight murder were the forms of process the king himself would play the executioner and his blows were dealt by stealth and with the help and countenance of none but his own wives these were his oarswomen one that caught a crab he slew incontinently with the tiller thus disciplined they pulled him by night to the scene of his vengeance which he would then execute alone and return well pleased with his connubial crew the inmates of the harem held a station hard for us to conceive beasts of draught and driven by the fear of death they were yet implicitly trusted with their sovereigns life they were still wives and queens and it was supposed that no man should behold their faces they killed by the sight like basilisks a chance view of one of those boatwomen was a crime to be wiped out with blood in the days of nakaeia the palace was beset with some tall cocopalms which commanded the enclosure it chanced one evening while nakaeia sat below at supper with his wives that the owner of the grove was in a treetop drawing palmtree wine it chanced that he looked down and the king at the same moment looking up their eyes encountered instant flight preserved the involuntary criminal but during the remainder of that reign he must lurk and be hid by friends in remote parts of the isle nakaeia hunted him without remission although still in vain and the palms accessories to the fact were ruthlessly cut down such was the ideal of wifely purity in an isle where nubile virgins went naked as in paradise and yet scandal found its way into nakaeias wellguarded harem he was at that time the owner of a schooner which he used for a pleasurehouse lodging on board as she lay anchored and thither one day he summoned a new wife she was one that had been sealed to him that is to say i presume that he was married to her sister for the husband of an elder sister has the call of the cadets she would be arrayed for the occasion she would come scented garlanded decked with fine mats and family jewels for marriage as her friends supposed for death as she well knew tell me the mans name and i will spare you said nakaeia but the girl was staunch she held her peace saved her lover and the queens strangled her between the mats  nakaeia was feared it does not appear that he was hated deeds that smell to us of murder wore to his subjects the reverend face of justice his orgies made him popular natives to this day recall with respect the firmness of his government and even the whites whom he long opposed and kept at armslength give him the name in the canonical south sea phrase of a perfect gentleman when sober  when he came to lie without issue on the bed of death he summoned his next brother nanteitei made him a discourse on royal policy and warned him he was too weak to reign the warning was taken to heart and for some while the government moved on the model of nakaeias nanteitei dispensed with guards and walked abroad alone with a revolver in a leather mailbag to conceal his weakness he affected a rude silence you might talk to him all day advice reproof appeal and menace alike remained unanswered the number of his wives was seventeen many of them heiresses for the royal house is poor and marriage was in these days a chief means of buttressing the throne nakaeia kept his harem busy for himself nanteitei hired it out to others in his days for instance messrs wightman built a pier with a verandah at the north end of the town the masonry was the work of the seventeen queens who toiled and waded there like fisher lasses but the man who was to do the roofing durst not begin till they had finished lest by chance he should look down and see them  it was perhaps the last appearance of the harem gang for some time already hawaiian missionaries had been seated at butaritarimaka and kanoa two brave childlike men nakaeia would none of their doctrine he was perhaps jealous of their presence being human he had some affection for their persons in the house before the eyes of kanoa he slew with his own hand three sailors of oahu crouching on their backs to knife them and menacing the missionary if he interfered yet he not only spared him at the moment but recalled him afterwards when he had fled with some expressions of respect nanteitei the weaker man fell more completely under the spell maka a lighthearted lovable yet in his own trade very rigorous man gained and improved an influence on the king which soon grew paramount nanteitei with the royal house was publicly converted and with a severity which liberal missionaries disavow the harem was at once reduced it was a compendious act the throne was thus impoverished its influence shaken the queens relatives mortified and sixteen chief women some of great possessions cast in a body on the market i have been shipmates with a hawaiian sailor who was successively married to two of these impromptu widows and successively divorced by both for misconduct that two great and rich ladies for both of these were rich should have married a man from another island marks the dissolution of society the laws besides were wholly remodelled not always for the better i love maka as a man as a legislator he has two defects weak in the punishment of crime stern to repress innocent pleasures  war and revolution are the common successors of reform yet nanteitei died of an overdose of chloroform in quiet possession of the throne and it was in the reign of the third brother nabakatokia a man brave in body and feeble of character that the storm burst the rule of the high chiefs and notables seems to have always underlain and perhaps alternated with monarchy the old men as they were called have a right to sit with the king in the speak house and debate and the kings chief superiority is a form of closurethe speaking is over after the long monocracy of nakaeia and the changes of nanteitei the old men were doubtless grown impatient of obscurity and they were beyond question jealous of the influence of maka calumny or rather caricature was called in use a spoken cartoon ran round society maka was reported to have said in church that the king was the first man in the island and himself the second and stung by the supposed affront the chiefs broke into rebellion and armed gatherings in the space of one forenoon the throne of nakaeia was humbled in the dust the king sat in the maniap before the palace gate expecting his recruits maka by his side both anxious men and meanwhile in the door of a house at the north entry of the town a chief had taken post and diverted the succours as they came they came singly or in groups each with his gun or pistol slung about his neck where are you going asked the chief the king called us they would reply here is your place sit down returned the chief with incredible disloyalty all obeyed and sufficient force being thus got together from both sides nabakatokia was summoned and surrendered about this period in almost every part of the group the kings were murdered and on tapituea the skeleton of the last hangs to this day in the chief speak house of the isle a menace to ambition nabakatokia was more fortunate his life and the royal style were spared to him but he was stripped of power the old men enjoyed a festival of public speaking the laws were continually changed never enforced the commons had an opportunity to regret the merits of nakaeia and the king denied the resource of rich marriages and the service of a troop of wives fell not only in disconsideration but in debt  he died some months before my arrival in the islands and no one regretted him rather all looked hopefully to his successor this was by repute the hero of the family alone of the four brothers he had issue a grown son natiata and a daughter three years old it was to him in the hour of the revolution that nabakatokia turned too late for help and in earlier days he had been the right hand of the vigorous nakaeia nantemat mr corpse was his appalling nickname and he had earned it well again and again at the command of nakaeia he had surrounded houses in the dead of night cut down the mosquito bars and butchered families here was the hand of iron here was nakaeia redux he came summoned from the tributary rule of little makin he was installed he proved a puppet and a trembler the unwieldy shuttlecock of orators and the reader has seen the remains of him in his summer parlour under the name of tebureimoa  the change in the mans character was much commented on in the island and variously explained by opium and christianity to my eyes there seemed no change at all rather an extreme consistency mr corpse was afraid of his brother king tebureimoa is afraid of the old men terror of the first nerved him for deeds of desperation fear of the second disables him for the least act of government he played his part of bravo in the past following the line of least resistance butchering others in his own defence today grown elderly and heavy a convert a reader of the bible perhaps a penitent conscious at least of accumulated hatreds and his memory charged with images of violence and blood he capitulates to the old men fuddles himself with opium and sits among his guards in dreadful expectation the same cowardice that put into his hand the knife of the assassin deprives him of the sceptre of a king  a tale that i was told a trifling incident that fell in my observation depict him in his two capacities a chief in little makin asked in an hour of lightness who is kaeia a bird carried the saying and nakaeia placed the matter in the hands of a committee of three mr corpse was chairman the second commissioner died before my arrival the third was yet alive and green and presented so venerable an appearance that we gave him the name of abou ben adhem mr corpse was troubled with a scruple the man from little makin was his adopted brother in such a case it was not very delicate to appear at all to strike the blow which it seems was otherwise expected of him would be worse than awkward i will strike the blow said the venerable abou and mr corpse surely with a sigh accepted the compromise the quarry was decoyed into the bush he was set carrying a log and while his arms were raised abou ripped up his belly at a blow justice being thus done the commission in a childish horror turned to flee but their victim recalled them to his side you need not run away now he said you have done this thing to me stay he was some twenty minutes dying and his murderers sat with him the while a scene for shakespeare all the stages of a violent death the blood the failing voice the decomposing features the changed hue are thus present in the memory of mr corpse and since he studied them in the brother he betrayed he has some reason to reflect on the possibilities of treachery i was never more sure of anything than the tragic quality of the kings thoughts and yet i had but the one sight of him at unawares i had once an errand for his ear it was once more the hour of the siesta but there were loiterers abroad and these directed us to a closed house on the bank of the canal where tebureimoa lay unguarded we entered without ceremony being in some haste he lay on the floor upon a bed of mats reading in his gilbert island bible with compunction on our sudden entrance the unwieldy man reared himself halfsitting so that the bible rolled on the floor stared on us a moment with blank eyes and having recognised his visitors sank again upon the mats so eglon looked on ehud  the justice of facts is strange and strangely just nakaeia the author of these deeds died at peace discoursing on the craft of kings his tool suffers daily death for his enforced complicity not the nature but the congruity of mens deeds and circumstances damn and save them and tebureimoa from the first has been incongruously placed at home in a quiet bystreet of a village the man had been a worthy carpenter and even bedevilled as he is he shows some private virtues he has no lands only the use of such as are impignorate for fines he cannot enrich himself in the old way by marriages thrift is the chief pillar of his future and he knows and uses it eleven foreign traders pay him a patent of a hundred dollars some two thousand subjects pay capitation at the rate of a dollar for a man half a dollar for a woman and a shilling for a child allowing for the exchange perhaps a total of three hundred pounds a year he had been some nine months on the throne had bought his wife a silk dress and hat figure unknown and himself a uniform at three hundred dollars had sent his brothers photograph to be enlarged in san francisco at two hundred and fifty dollars had greatly reduced that brothers legacy of debt and had still sovereigns in his pocket an affectionate brother a good economist he was besides a handy carpenter and cobbled occasionally on the woodwork of the palace it is not wonderful that mr corpse has virtues that tebureimoa should have a diversion filled me with surprise     chapter iii  around our house   when we left the palace we were still but seafarers ashore and within the hour we had installed our goods in one of the six foreign houses of butaritari namely that usually occupied by maka the hawaiian missionary two san francisco firms are here established messrs crawford and messrs wightman brothers the first hard by the palace of the mid town the second at the north entry each with a store and barroom our house was in the wightman compound betwixt the store and bar within a fenced enclosure across the road a few native houses nestled in the margin of the bush and the green wall of palms rose solid shutting out the breeze a little sandy cove of the lagoon ran in behind sheltered by a verandah pier the labour of queens hands here when the tide was high sailed boats lay to be loaded when the tide was low the boats took ground some half a mile away and an endless series of natives descended the pier stair tailed across the sand in strings and clusters waded to the waist with the bags of copra and loitered backward to renew their charge the mystery of the copra trade tormented me as i sat and watched the profits drip on the stair and the sands  in front from shortly after four in the morning until nine at night the folk of the town streamed by us intermittingly along the road families going up the island to make copra on their lands women bound for the bush to gather flowers against the evening toilet and twice a day the toddycutters each with his knife and shell in the first grey of the morning and again late in the afternoon these would straggle past about their treetop business strike off here and there into the bush and vanish from the face of the earth at about the same hour if the tide be low in the lagoon you are likely to be bound yourself across the island for a bath and may enter close at their heels alleys of the palm wood right in front although the sun is not yet risen the east is already lighted with preparatory fires and the huge accumulations of the tradewind cloud glow with and heliograph the coming day the breeze is in your face overhead in the tops of the palms its playthings it maintains a lively bustle look where you will above or below there is no human presence only the earth and shaken forest and right overhead the song of an invisible singer breaks from the thick leaves from farther on a second treetop answers and beyond again in the bosom of the woods a still more distant minstrel perches and sways and sings so all round the isle the toddycutters sit on high and are rocked by the trade and have a view far to seaward where they keep watch for sails and like huge birds utter their songs in the morning they sing with a certain lustiness and bacchic glee the volume of sound and the articulate melody fall unexpected from the treetop whence we anticipate the chattering of fowls and yet in a sense these songs also are but chatter the words are ancient obsolete and sacred few comprehend them perhaps no one perfectly but it was understood the cutters prayed to have good toddy and sang of their old wars the prayer is at least answered and when the foaming shell is brought to your door you have a beverage well worthy of a grace all forenoon you may return and taste it only sparkles and sharpens and grows to be a new drink not less delicious but with the progress of the day the fermentation quickens and grows acid in twelve hours it will be yeast for bread in two days more a devilish intoxicant the counsellor of crime  the men are of a marked arabian cast of features often bearded and moustached often gaily dressed some with bracelets and anklets all stalking hidalgolike and accepting salutations with a haughty lip the hair with the dandies of either sex is worn turbanwise in a frizzled bush and like the daggers of the japanese a pointed stick used for a comb is thrust gallantly among the curls the women from this bush of hair look forth enticingly the race cannot be compared with the tahitian for female beauty i doubt even if the average be high but some of the prettiest girls and one of the handsomest women i ever saw were gilbertines butaritari being the commercial centre of the group is europeanised the coloured sacque or the white shift are common wear the latter for the evening the trade hat loaded with flowers fruit and ribbons is unfortunately not unknown and the characteristic female dress of the gilberts no longer universal the ridi is its name a cutty petticoat or fringe of the smoked fibre of cocoanut leaf not unlike tarry string the lower edge not reaching the midthigh the upper adjusted so low upon the haunches that it seems to cling by accident a sneeze you think and the lady must surely be left destitute the perilous hairbreadth ridi was our word for it and in the conflict that rages over womens dress it has the misfortune to please neither side the prudish condemning it as insufficient the more frivolous finding it unlovely in itself yet if a pretty gilbertine would look her best that must be her costume in that and naked otherwise she moves with an incomparable liberty and grace and life that marks the poetry of micronesia bundle her in a gown the charm is fled and she wriggles like an englishwoman  towards dusk the passersby became more gorgeous the men broke out in all the colours of the rainbowor at least of the traderoomand both men and women began to be adorned and scented with new flowers a small white blossom is the favourite sometimes sown singly in a womans hair like little stars now composed in a thick wreath with the night the crowd sometimes thickened in the road and the padding and brushing of bare feet became continuous the promenades mostly grave the silence only interrupted by some giggling and scampering of girls even the children quiet at nine bedtime struck on a bell from the cathedral and the life of the town ceased at four the next morning the signal is repeated in the darkness and the innocent prisoners set free but for seven hours all must liei was about to say within doors of a place where doors and even walls are an exceptionhoused at least under their airy roofs and clustered in the tents of the mosquitonets suppose a necessary errand to occur suppose it imperative to send abroad the messenger must then go openly advertising himself to the police with a huge brand of cocoanut which flares from house to house like a moving bonfire only the police themselves go darkling and grope in the night for misdemeanants i used to hate their treacherous presence their captain in particular a crafty old man in white lurked nightly about my premises till i could have found it in my heart to beat him but the rogue was privileged  not one of the eleven resident traders came to town no captain cast anchor in the lagoon but we saw him ere the hour was out this was owing to our position between the store and the barthe sans souci as the last was called mr rick was not only messrs wightmans manager but consular agent for the states mrs rick was the only white woman on the island and one of the only two in the archipelago their house besides with its cool verandahs its bookshelves its comfortable furniture could not be rivalled nearer than jaluit or honolulu every one called in consequence save such as might be prosecuting a south sea quarrel hingeing on the price of copra and the odd cent or perhaps a difference about poultry even these if they did not appear upon the north would be presently visible to the southward the sans souci drawing them as with cords in an island with a total population of twelve white persons one of the two drinkingshops might seem superfluous but every bullet has its billet and the double accommodation of butaritari is found in practice highly convenient by the captains and the crews of ships the land we live in being tacitly resigned to the forecastle the sans souci tacitly reserved for the afterguard so aristocratic were my habits so commanding was my fear of mr williams that i have never visited the first but in the other which was the club or rather the casino of the island i regularly passed my evenings it was small but neatly fitted and at night when the lamp was lit sparkled with glass and glowed with coloured pictures like a theatre at christmas the pictures were advertisements the glass coarse enough the carpentry amateur but the effect in that incongruous isle was of unbridled luxury and inestimable expense here songs were sung tales told tricks performed games played the ricks ourselves norwegian tom the barkeeper a captain or two from the ships and perhaps three or four traders come down the island in their boats or by the road on foot made up the usual company the traders all bred to the sea take a humorous pride in their new business south sea merchants is the title they prefer we are all sailors heremerchants if you pleasesouth sea merchantswas a piece of conversation endlessly repeated that never seemed to lose in savour we found them at all times simple genial gay gallant and obliging and across some interval of time recall with pleasure the traders of butaritari there was one black sheep indeed i tell of him here where he lived against my rule for in this case i have no measure to preserve and the man is typical of a class of ruffians that once disgraced the whole field of the south seas and still linger in the rarely visited isles of micronesia he had the name on the beach of a perfect gentleman when sober but i never saw him otherwise than drunk the few shocking and savage traits of the micronesian he has singled out with the skill of a collector and planted in the soil of his original baseness he has been accused and acquitted of a treacherous murder and has since boastfully owned it which inclines me to suppose him innocent his daughter is defaced by his erroneous cruelty for it was his wife he had intended to disfigure and in the darkness of the night and the frenzy of cocobrandy fastened on the wrong victim the wife has since fled and harbours in the bush with natives and the husband still demands from deaf ears her forcible restoration the best of his business is to make natives drink and then advance the money for the fine upon a lucrative mortgage respect for whites is the mans word what is the matter with this island is the want of respect for whites on his way to butaritari while i was there he spied his wife in the bush with certain natives and made a dash to capture her whereupon one of her companions drew a knife and the husband retreated do you call that proper respect for whites he cried at an early stage of the acquaintance we proved our respect for his kind of white by forbidding him our enclosure under pain of death thenceforth he lingered often in the neighbourhood with i knew not what sense of envy or design of mischief his white handsome face which i beheld with loathing looked in upon us at all hours across the fence and once from a safe distance he avenged himself by shouting a recondite island insult to us quite inoffensive on his english lips incredibly incongruous  our enclosure round which this composite of degradations wandered was of some extent in one corner was a trellis with a long table of rough boards here the fourth of july feast had been held not long before with memorable consequences yet to be set forth here we took our meals here entertained to a dinner the king and notables of makin in the midst was the house with a verandah front and back and three rooms within in the verandah we slung our manofwar hammocks worked there by day and slept at night within were beds chairs a round table a fine hanging lamp and portraits of the royal family of hawaii queen victoria proves nothing kalakaua and mrs bishop are diagnostic and the truth is we were the stealthy tenants of the parsonage on the day of our arrival maka was away faithless trustees unlocked his doors and the dear rigorous man the sworn foe of liquor and tobacco returned to find his verandah littered with cigarettes and his parlour horrible with bottles he made but one conditionon the round table which he used in the celebration of the sacraments he begged us to refrain from setting liquor in all else he bowed to the accomplished fact refused rent retired across the way into a native house and plying in his boat beat the remotest quarters of the isle for provender he found us pigsi could not fancy whereno other pigs were visible he brought us fowls and taro when we gave our feast to the monarch and gentry it was he who supplied the wherewithal he who superintended the cooking he who asked grace at table and when the kings health was proposed he also started the cheering with an english hiphiphip there was never a more fortunate conception the heart of the fatted king exulted in his bosom at the sound  take him for all in all i have never known a more engaging creature than this parson of butaritari his mirth his kindness his noble friendly feelings brimmed from the man in speech and gesture he loved to exaggerate to act and overact the momentary part to exercise his lungs and muscles and to speak and laugh with his whole body he had the morning cheerfulness of birds and healthy children and his humour was infectious we were next neighbours and met daily yet our salutations lasted minutes at a stretchshaking hands slapping shoulders capering like a pair of merryandrews laughing to split our sides upon some pleasantry that would scarce raise a titter in an infant school it might be five in the morning the toddycutters just gone by the road empty the shade of the island lying far on the lagoon and the ebullition cheered me for the day  yet i always suspected maka of a secret melancholy these jubilant extremes could scarce be constantly maintained he was besides long and lean and lined and corded and a trifle grizzled and his sabbath countenance was even saturnine on that day we made a procession to the church or as i must always call it the cathedral maka a blot on the hot landscape in tall hat black frockcoat black trousers under his arm the hymnbook and the bible in his face a reverent gravitybeside him mary his wife a quiet wise and handsome elderly lady seriously attiredmyself following with singular and moving thoughts long before to the sound of bells and streams and birds through a green lothian glen i had accompanied sunday by sunday a minister in whose house i lodged and the likeness and the difference and the series of years and deaths profoundly touched me in the great dusky palmtree cathedral the congregation rarely numbered thirty the men on one side the women on the other myself posted for a privilege amongst the women and the small missionary contingent gathered close around the platform we were lost in that round vault the lessons were read antiphonally the flock was catechised a blind youth repeated weekly a long string of psalms hymns were sungi never heard worse singingand the sermon followed to say i understood nothing were untrue there were points that i learned to expect with certainty the name of honolulu that of kalakaua the word capnmanowa the word ship and a description of a storm at sea infallibly occurred and i was not seldom rewarded with the name of my own sovereign in the bargain the rest was but sound to the ears silence for the mind a plain expanse of tedium rendered unbearable by heat a hard chair and the sight through the wide doors of the more happy heathen on the green sleep breathed on my joints and eyelids sleep hummed in my ears it reigned in the dim cathedral the congregation stirred and stretched they moaned they groaned aloud they yawned upon a singing note as you may sometimes hear a dog when he has reached the tragic bitterest of boredom in vain the preacher thumped the table in vain he singled and addressed by name particular hearers i was myself perhaps a more effective excitant and at least to one old gentleman the spectacle of my successful struggles against sleepand i hope they were successfulcheered the flight of time he when he was not catching flies or playing tricks upon his neighbours gloated with a fixed translucent eye upon the stages of my agony and once when the service was drawing towards a close he winked at me across the church  i write of the service with a smile yet i was always therealways with respect for maka always with admiration for his deep seriousness his burning energy the fire of his roused eye the sincere and various accents of his voice to see him weekly flogging a dead horse and blowing a cold fire was a lesson in fortitude and constancy it may be a question whether if the mission were fully supported and he was set free from business avocations more might not result i think otherwise myself i think not neglect but rigour has reduced his flock that rigour which has once provoked a revolution and which today in a man so lively and engaging amazes the beholder no song no dance no tobacco no liquor no alleviative of lifeonly toil and churchgoing so says a voice from his face and the face is the face of the polynesian esau but the voice is the voice of a jacob from a different world and a polynesian at the best makes a singular missionary in the gilberts coming from a country recklessly unchaste to one conspicuously strict from a race hagridden with bogies to one comparatively bold against the terrors of the dark the thought was stamped one morning in my mind when i chanced to be abroad by moonlight and saw all the town lightless but the lamp faithfully burning by the missionarys bed it requires no law no fire and no scouting police to withhold maka and his countrymen from wandering in the night unlighted     chapter iv  a tale of a tapu   on the morrow of our arrival sunday 14th july 1889 our photographers were early stirring once more we traversed a silent town many were yet abed and asleep some sat drowsily in their open houses there was no sound of intercourse or business in that hour before the shadows the quarter of the palace and canal seemed like a landingplace in the arabian nights or from the classic poets here were the fit destination of some faery frigot here some adventurous prince might step ashore among new characters and incidents and the island prison where it floated on the luminous face of the lagoon might have passed for the repository of the grail in such a scene and at such an hour the impression received was not so much of foreign travelrather of past ages it seemed not so much degrees of latitude that we had crossed as centuries of time that we had reascended leaving by the same steps home and today a few children followed us mostly nude all silent in the clear weedy waters of the canal some silent damsels waded baring their brown thighs and to one of the maniaps before the palace gate we were attracted by a low but stirring hum of speech  the oval shed was full of men sitting crosslegged the king was there in striped pyjamas his rear protected by four guards with winchesters his air and bearing marked by unwonted spirit and decision tumblers and black bottles went the round and the talk throughout loud was general and animated i was inclined at first to view this scene with suspicion but the hour appeared unsuitable for a carouse drink was besides forbidden equally by the law of the land and the canons of the church and while i was yet hesitating the kings rigorous attitude disposed of my last doubt we had come thinking to photograph him surrounded by his guards and at the first word of the design his piety revolted we were reminded of the daythe sabbath in which thou shalt take no photographsand returned with a flea in our ear bearing the rejected camera  at church a little later i was struck to find the throne unoccupied so nice a sabbatarian might have found the means to be present perhaps my doubts revived and before i got home they were transformed to certainties tom the barkeeper of the sans souci was in conversation with two emissaries from the court the keen they said wanted din failing which perandi7 no din was toms reply and no perandi but pira if they pleased it seems they had no use for beer and departed sorrowing  why what is the meaning of all this i asked is the island on the spree  such was the fact on the 4th of july a feast had been made and the king at the suggestion of the whites had raised the tapu against liquor there is a proverb about horses it scarce applies to the superior animal of whom it may be rather said that any one can start him drinking not any twenty can prevail on him to stop the tapu raised ten days before was not yet reimposed for ten days the town had been passing the bottle or lying as we had seen it the afternoon before in hoggish sleep and the king moved by the old men and his own appetites continued to maintain the liberty to squander his savings on liquor and to join in and lead the debauch the whites were the authors of this crisis it was upon their own proposal that the freedom had been granted at the first and for a while in the interests of trade they were doubtless pleased it should continue that pleasure had now sometime ceased the bout had been prolonged it was conceded unduly and it now began to be a question how it might conclude hence toms refusal yet that refusal was avowedly only for the moment and it was avowedly unavailing the kings foragers denied by tom at the sans souci would be supplied at the land we live in by the gobbling mr williams  the degree of the peril was not easy to measure at the time and i am inclined to think now it was easy to exaggerate yet the conduct of drunkards even at home is always matter for anxiety and at home our populations are not armed from the highest to the lowest with revolvers and repeating rifles neither do we go on a debauch by the whole townfuland i might rather say by the whole polityking magistrates police and army joining in one common scene of drunkenness it must be thought besides that we were here in barbarous islands rarely visited lately and partly civilised first and last a really considerable number of whites have perished in the gilberts chiefly through their own misconduct and the natives have displayed in at least one instance a disposition to conceal an accident under a butchery and leave nothing but dumb bones this last was the chief consideration against a sudden closing of the bars the barkeepers stood in the immediate breach and dealt direct with madmen too surly a refusal might at any moment precipitate a blow and the blow might prove the signal for a massacre  monday 15that the same hour we returned to the same maniap kümmel of all drinks was served in tumblers in the midst sat the crown prince a fatted youth surrounded by fresh bottles and busily plying the corkscrew and king chief and commons showed the loose mouth the uncertain joints and the blurred and animated eye of the early drinker it was plain we were impatiently expected the king retired with alacrity to dress the guards were despatched after their uniforms and we were left to await the issue of these preparations with a shedful of tipsy natives the orgie had proceeded further than on sunday the day promised to be of great heat it was already sultry the courtiers were already fuddled and still the kümmel continued to go round and the crown prince to play butler flemish freedom followed upon flemish excess and a funny dog a handsome fellow gaily dressed and with a full turban of frizzed hair delighted the company with a humorous courtship of a lady in a manner not to be described it was our diversion in this time of waiting to observe the gathering of the guards they have european arms european uniforms and to their sorrow european shoes we saw one warrior like mars in the article of being armed two men and a stalwart woman were scarce strong enough to boot him and after a single appearance on parade the army is crippled for a week  at last the gates under the kings house opened the army issued one behind another with guns and epaulettes the colours stooped under the gateway majesty followed in his uniform bedizened with gold lace majestys wife came next in a hat and feathers and an ample trained silk gown the royal imps succeeded there stood the pageantry of makin marshalled on its chosen theatre dickens might have told how serious they were how tipsy how the king melted and streamed under his cocked hat how he took station by the larger of his two cannonsaustere majestic but not truly vertical how the troops huddled and were straightened out and clubbed again how they and their firelocks raked at various inclinations like the masts of ships and how an amateur photographer reviewed arrayed and adjusted them to see his dispositions change before he reached the camera  the business was funny to see i do not know that it is graceful to laugh at and our report of these transactions was received on our return with the shaking of grave heads  the day had begun ill eleven hours divided us from sunset and at any moment on the most trifling chance the trouble might begin the wightman compound was in a military sense untenable commanded on three sides by houses and thick bush the town was computed to contain over a thousand stand of excellent new arms and retreat to the ships in the case of an alert was a recourse not to be thought of our talk that morning must have closely reproduced the talk in english garrisons before the sepoy mutiny the sturdy doubt that any mischief was in prospect the sure belief that should any come there was nothing left but to go down fighting the halfamused halfanxious attitude of mind in which we were awaiting fresh developments  the kümmel soon ran out we were scarce returned before the king had followed us in quest of more mr corpse was now divested of his more awful attitude the lawless bulk of him again encased in striped pyjamas a guardsman brought up the rear with his rifle at the trail and his majesty was further accompanied by a rarotongan whalerman and the playful courtier with the turban of frizzed hair there was never a more lively deputation the whalerman was gapingly tearfully tipsy the courtier walked on air the king himself was even sportive seated in a chair in the ricks sittingroom he bore the brunt of our prayers and menaces unmoved he was even rated plied with historic instances threatened with the menofwar ordered to restore the tapu on the spotand nothing in the least affected him it should be done tomorrow he said today it was beyond his power today he durst not is that royal cried indignant mr rick no it was not royal had the king been of a royal character we should ourselves have held a different language and royal or not he had the best of the dispute the terms indeed were hardly equal for the king was the only man who could restore the tapu but the ricks were not the only people who sold drink he had but to hold his ground on the first question and they were sure to weaken on the second a little struggle they still made for the fashions sake and then one exceedingly tipsy deputation departed greatly rejoicing a case of brandy wheeling beside them in a barrow the rarotongan whom i had never seen before wrung me by the hand like a man bound on a far voyage my dear frien he cried goodbye my dear frientears of kümmel standing in his eyes the king lurched as he went the courtier ambleda strange party of intoxicated children to be entrusted with that barrowful of madness  you could never say the town was quiet all morning there was a ferment in the air an aimless movement and congregation of natives in the street but it was not before halfpast one that a sudden hubbub of voices called us from the house to find the whole white colony already gathered on the spot as by concerted signal the sans souci was overrun with rabble the stair and verandah thronged from all these throats an inarticulate babbling cry went up incessantly it sounded like the bleating of young lambs but angrier in the road his royal highness whom i had seen so lately in the part of butler stood crying upon tom on the top step tossed in the hurlyburly tom was shouting to the prince yet a while the pack swayed about the bar vociferous then came a brutal impulse the mob reeled and returned and was rejected the stair showed a stream of heads and there shot into view through the disbanding ranks three men violently dragging in their midst a fourth by his hair and his hands his head forced as low as his knees his face concealed he was wrenched from the verandah and whisked along the road into the village howling as he disappeared had his face been raised we should have seen it bloodied and the blood was not his own the courtier with the turban of frizzed hair had paid the costs of this disturbance with the lower part of one ear  so the brawl passed with no other casualty than might seem comic to the inhumane yet we looked round on serious faces anda fact that spoke volumestom was putting up the shutters on the bar custom might go elsewhither mr williams might profit as he pleased but tom had had enough of barkeeping for that day indeed the event had hung on a hair a man had sought to draw a revolveron what quarrel i could never learn and perhaps he himself could not have told one shot when the room was so crowded could scarce have failed to take effect where many were armed and all tipsy it could scarce have failed to draw others and the woman who spied the weapon and the man who seized it may very well have saved the white community  the mob insensibly melted from the scene and for the rest of the day our neighbourhood was left in peace and a good deal in solitude but the tranquillity was only local din and perandi still flowed in other quarters and we had one more sight of gilbert island violence in the church where we had wandered photographing we were startled by a sudden piercing outcry the scene looking forth from the doors of that great hall of shadow was unforgettable the palms the quaint and scattered houses the flag of the island streaming from its tall staff glowed with intolerable sunshine in the midst two women rolled fighting on the grass the combatants were the more easy to be distinguished because the one was stripped to the ridi and the other wore a holoku sacque of some lively colour the first was uppermost her teeth locked in her adversarys face shaking her like a dog the other impotently fought and scratched so for a moment we saw them wallow and grapple there like vermin then the mob closed and shut them in  it was a serious question that night if we should sleep ashore but we were travellers folk that had come far in quest of the adventurous on the first sign of an adventure it would have been a singular inconsistency to have withdrawn and we sent on board instead for our revolvers mindful of taahauku mr rick mr osbourne and mrs stevenson held an assault of arms on the public highway and fired at bottles to the admiration of the natives captain reid of the equator stayed on shore with us to be at hand in case of trouble and we retired to bed at the accustomed hour agreeably excited by the days events the night was exquisite the silence enchanting yet as i lay in my hammock looking on the strong moonshine and the quiescent palms one ugly picture haunted me of the two women the naked and the clad locked in that hostile embrace the harm done was probably not much yet i could have looked on death and massacre with less revolt the return to these primeval weapons the vision of mans beastliness of his ferality shocked in me a deeper sense than that with which we count the cost of battles there are elements in our state and history which it is a pleasure to forget which it is perhaps the better wisdom not to dwell on crime pestilence and death are in the days work the imagination readily accepts them it instinctively rejects on the contrary whatever shall call up the image of our race upon its lowest terms as the partner of beasts beastly itself dwelling pellmell and huggermugger hairy man with hairy woman in the caves of old and yet to be just to barbarous islanders we must not forget the slums and dens of our cities i must not forget that i have passed dinnerward through soho and seen that which cured me of my dinner   footnote    7 gin and brandy     chapter v  a tale of a tapucontinued   tuesday july 16it rained in the night sudden and loud in gilbert island fashion before the day the crowing of a cock aroused me and i wandered in the compound and along the street the squall was blown by the moon shone with incomparable lustre the air lay dead as in a room and yet all the isle sounded as under a strong shower the eaves thickly pattering the lofty palms dripping at larger intervals and with a louder note in this bold nocturnal light the interior of the houses lay inscrutable one lump of blackness save when the moon glinted under the roof and made a belt of silver and drew the slanting shadows of the pillars on the floor nowhere in all the town was any lamp or ember not a creature stirred i thought i was alone to be awake but the police were faithful to their duty secretly vigilant keeping account of time and a little later the watchman struck slowly and repeatedly on the cathedral bell four oclock the warning signal it seemed strange that in a town resigned to drunkenness and tumult curfew and réveille should still be sounded and still obeyed  the day came and brought little change the place still lay silent the people slept the town slept even the few who were awake mostly women and children held their peace and kept within under the strong shadow of the thatch where you must stop and peer to see them through the deserted streets and past sleeping houses a deputation took its way at an early hour to the palace the king was suddenly awakened and must listen probably with a headache to unpalatable truths mrs rick being a sufficient mistress of that difficult tongue was spokeswoman she explained to the sick monarch that i was an intimate personal friend of queen victorias that immediately on my return i should make her a report upon butaritari and that if my house should have been again invaded by natives a manofwar would be despatched to make reprisals it was scarce the factrather a just and necessary parable of the fact corrected for latitude and it certainly told upon the king he was much affected he had conceived the notion he said that i was a man of some importance but not dreamed it was as bad as this and the missionary house was tapud under a fine of fifty dollars  so much was announced on the return of the deputation not any more and i gathered subsequently that much more had passed the protection gained was welcome it had been the most annoying and not the least alarming feature of the day before that our house was periodically filled with tipsy natives twenty or thirty at a time begging drink fingering our goods hard to be dislodged awkward to quarrel with queen victorias friend who was soon promoted to be her son was free from these intrusions not only my house but my neighbourhood as well was left in peace even on our walks abroad we were guarded and prepared for and like great persons visiting a hospital saw only the fair side for the matter of a week we were thus suffered to go out and in and live in a fools paradise supposing the king to have kept his word the tapu to be revived and the island once more sober  tuesday july 23we dined under a bare trellis erected for the fourth of july and here we used to linger by lamplight over coffee and tobacco in that climate evening approaches without sensible chill the wind dies out before sunset heaven glows a while and fades and darkens into the blueness of the tropical night swiftly and insensibly the shadows thicken the stars multiply their number you look around you and the day is gone it was then that we would see our chinaman draw near across the compound in a lurching sphere of light divided by his shadows and with the coming of the lamp the night closed about the table the faces of the company the spars of the trellis stood out suddenly bright on a ground of blue and silver faintly designed with palmtops and the peaked roofs of houses here and there the gloss upon a leaf or the fracture of a stone returned an isolated sparkle all else had vanished we hung there illuminated like a galaxy of stars in vacuo we sat manifest and blind amid the general ambush of the darkness and the islanders passing with light footfalls and low voices in the sand of the road lingered to observe us unseen  on tuesday the dusk had fallen the lamp had just been brought when a missile struck the table with a rattling smack and rebounded past my ear three inches to one side and this page had never been written for the thing travelled like a cannon ball it was supposed at the time to be a nut though even at the time i thought it seemed a small one and fell strangely  wednesday july 24the dusk had fallen once more and the lamp been just brought out when the same business was repeated and again the missile whistled past my ear one nut i had been willing to accept a second i rejected utterly a cocoanut does not come slinging along on a windless evening making an angle of about fifteen degrees with the horizon cocoanuts do not fall on successive nights at the same hour and spot in both cases besides a specific moment seemed to have been chosen that when the lamp was just carried out a specific person threatened and that the head of the family i may have been right or wrong but i believed i was the mark of some intimidation believed the missile was a stone aimed not to hit but to frighten  no idea makes a man more angry i ran into the road where the natives were as usual promenading in the dark maka joined me with a lantern and i ran from one to another glared in quite innocent faces put useless questions and proffered idle threats thence i carried my wrath which was worthy the son of any queen in history to the ricks they heard me with depression assured me this trick of throwing a stone into a family dinner was not new that it meant mischief and was of a piece with the alarming disposition of the natives and then the truth so long concealed from us came out the king had broken his promise he had defied the deputation the tapu was still dormant the land we live in still selling drink and that quarter of the town disturbed and menaced by perpetual broils but there was worse ahead a feast was now preparing for the birthday of the little princess and the tributary chiefs of kuma and little makin were expected daily strong in a following of numerous and somewhat savage clansmen each of these was believed like a douglas of old to be of doubtful loyalty kuma a little potbellied fellow never visited the palace never entered the town but sat on the beach on a mat his gun across his knees parading his mistrust and scorn karaiti of makin although he was more bold was not supposed to be more friendly and not only were these vassals jealous of the throne but the followers on either side shared in the animosity brawls had already taken place blows had passed which might at any moment be repaid in blood some of the strangers were already here and already drinking if the debauch continued after the bulk of them had come a collision perhaps a revolution was to be expected  the sale of drink is in this group a measure of the jealousy of traders one begins the others are constrained to follow and to him who has the most gin and sells it the most recklessly the lions share of copra is assured it is felt by all to be an extreme expedient neither safe decent nor dignified a trader on tarawa heated by an eager rivalry brought many cases of gin he told me he sat afterwards day and night in his house till it was finished not daring to arrest the sale not venturing to go forth the bush all round him filled with howling drunkards at night above all when he was afraid to sleep and heard shots and voices about him in the darkness his remorse was black  my god he reflected if i was to lose my life on such a wretched business often and often in the story of the gilberts this scene has been repeated and the remorseful trader sat beside his lamp longing for the day listening with agony for the sound of murder registering resolutions for the future for the business is easy to begin but hazardous to stop the natives are in their way a just and lawabiding people mindful of their debts docile to the voice of their own institutions when the tapu is reenforced they will cease drinking but the white who seeks to antedate the movement by refusing liquor does so at his peril  hence in some degree the anxiety and helplessness of mr rick he and tom alarmed by the rabblement of the sans souci had stopped the sale they had done so without danger because the land we live in still continued selling it was claimed besides that they had been the first to begin what step could be taken could mr rick visit mr muller with whom he was not on terms and address him thus i was getting ahead of you now you are getting ahead of me and i ask you to forgo your profit i got my place closed in safety thanks to your continuing but now i think you have continued long enough i begin to be alarmed and because i am afraid i ask you to confront a certain danger it was not to be thought of something else had to be found and there was one person at one end of the town who was at least not interested in copra there was little else to be said in favour of myself as an ambassador i had arrived in the wightman schooner i was living in the wightman compound i was the daily associate of the wightman coterie it was egregious enough that i should now intrude unasked in the private affairs of crawfords agent and press upon him the sacrifice of his interests and the venture of his life but bad as i might be there was none better since the affair of the stone i was besides sharpset to be doing the idea of a delicate interview attracted me and i thought it policy to show myself abroad  the night was very dark there was service in the church and the building glimmered through all its crevices like a dim kirk allowa i saw few other lights but was indistinctly aware of many people stirring in the darkness and a hum and sputter of low talk that sounded stealthy i believe in the old phrase my beard was sometimes on my shoulder as i went mullers was but partly lighted and quite silent and the gate was fastened i could by no means manage to undo the latch no wonder since i found it afterwards to be four or five feet longa fortification in itself as i still fumbled a dog came on the inside and snuffed suspiciously at my hands so that i was reduced to calling house ahoy mr muller came down and put his chin across the paling in the dark who is that said he like one who has no mind to welcome strangers  my name is stevenson said i  o mr stevens i didnt know you come inside  we stepped into the dark store when i leaned upon the counter and he against the wall all the light came from the sleepingroom where i saw his family being put to bed it struck full in my face but mr muller stood in shadow no doubt he expected what was coming and sought the advantage of position but for a man who wished to persuade and had nothing to conceal mine was the preferable  look here i began i hear you are selling to the natives  others have done that before me he returned pointedly  no doubt said i and i have nothing to do with the past but the future i want you to promise you will handle these spirits carefully  now what is your motive in this he asked and then with a sneer are you afraid of your life  that is nothing to the purpose i replied i know and you know these spirits ought not to be used at all  tom and mr rick have sold them before  i have nothing to do with tom and mr rick all i know is i have heard them both refuse  no i suppose you have nothing to do with them then you are just afraid of your life  come now i cried being perhaps a little stung you know in your heart i am asking a reasonable thing i dont ask you to lose your profitthough i would prefer to see no spirits brought here as you would  i dont say i wouldnt i didnt begin this he interjected  no i dont suppose you did said i and i dont ask you to lose i ask you to give me your word man to man that you will make no native drunk  up to now mr muller had maintained an attitude very trying to my temper but he had maintained it with difficulty his sentiment being all upon my side and here he changed ground for the worse it isnt me that sells said he  no its that nigger i agreed but hes yours to buy and sell you have your hand on the nape of his neck and i ask youi have my wife hereto use the authority you have  he hastily returned to his old word i dont deny i could if i wanted said he but theres no danger the natives are all quiet youre just afraid of your life  i do not like to be called a coward even by implication and here i lost my temper and propounded an untimely ultimatum you had better put it plain i cried do you mean to refuse me what i ask  i dont want either to refuse it or grant it he replied  youll find you have to do the one thing or the other and right now i cried and then striking into a happier vein come said i youre a better sort than that i see whats wrong with youyou think i came from the opposite camp i see the sort of man you are and you know that what i ask is right  again he changed ground if the natives get any drink it isnt safe to stop them he objected  ill be answerable for the bar i said we are three men and four revolvers well come at a word and hold the place against the village  you dont know what youre talking about its too dangerous he cried  look here said i i dont mind much about losing that life you talk so much of but i mean to lose it the way i want to and that is putting a stop to all this beastliness  he talked a while about his duty to the firm i minded not at all i was secure of victory he was but waiting to capitulate and looked about for any potent to relieve the strain in the gush of light from the bedroom door i spied a cigarholder on the desk that is well coloured said i  will you take a cigar said he  i took it and held it up unlighted now said i you promise me  i promise you you wont have any trouble from natives that have drunk at my place he replied  that is all i ask said i and showed it was not by immediately offering to try his stock  so far as it was anyway critical our interview here ended mr muller had thenceforth ceased to regard me as an emissary from his rivals dropped his defensive attitude and spoke as he believed i could make out that he would already had he dared have stopped the sale himself not quite daring it may be imagined how he resented the idea of interference from those who had by his own statement first led him on then deserted him in the breach and now sitting themselves in safety egged him on to a new peril which was all gain to them all loss to him i asked him what he thought of the danger from the feast  i think worse of it than any of you he answered they were shooting around here last night and i heard the balls too i said to myself thats bad what gets me is why you should be making this row up at your end i should be the first to go  it was a thoughtless wonder the consolation of being second is not great the fact not the order of goingthere was our concern  scott talks moderately of looking forward to a time of fighting with a feeling that resembled pleasure the resemblance seems rather an identity in modern life contact is ended man grows impatient of endless manoeuvres and to approach the fact to find ourselves where we can push our advantage home and stand a fair risk and see at last what we are made of stirs the blood it was so at least with all my family who bubbled with delight at the approach of trouble and we sat deep into the night like a pack of schoolboys preparing the revolvers and arranging plans against the morrow it promised certainly to be a busy and eventful day the old men were to be summoned to confront me on the question of the tapu muller might call us at any moment to garrison his bar and suppose muller to fail we decided in a family council to take that matter into our own hands the land we live in at the pistols mouth and with the polysyllabic williams dance to a new tune as i recall our humour i think it would have gone hard with the mulatto  wednesday july 24it was as well and yet it was disappointing that these thunderclouds rolled off in silence whether the old men recoiled from an interview with queen victorias son whether muller had secretly intervened or whether the step flowed naturally from the fears of the king and the nearness of the feast the tapu was early that morning reenforced not a day too soon from the manner the boats began to arrive thickly and the town was filled with the big rowdy vassals of karaiti  the effect lingered for some time on the minds of the traders it was with the approval of all present that i helped to draw up a petition to the united states praying for a law against the liquor trade in the gilberts and it was at this request that i added under my own name a brief testimony of what had passeduseless pains since the whole repose probably unread and possibly unopened in a pigeonhole at washington  sunday july 28this day we had the afterpiece of the debauch the king and queen in european clothes and followed by armed guards attended church for the first time and sat perched aloft in a precarious dignity under the barrelhoops before sermon his majesty clambered from the dais stood lopsidedly upon the gravel floor and in a few words abjured drinking the queen followed suit with a yet briefer allocution all the men in church were next addressed in turn each held up his right hand and the affair was overthrone and church were reconciled     chapter vi  the five days festival   thursday july 25the street was this day much enlivened by the presence of the men from little makin they average taller than butaritarians and being on a holiday went wreathed with yellow leaves and gorgeous in vivid colours they are said to be more savage and to be proud of the distinction indeed it seemed to us they swaggered in the town like plaided highlanders upon the streets of inverness conscious of barbaric virtues  in the afternoon the summer parlour was observed to be packed with people others standing outside and stooping to peer under the eaves like children at home about a circus it was the makin company rehearsing for the day of competition karaiti sat in the front row close to the singers where we were summoned i suppose in honour of queen victoria to join him a strong breathless heat reigned under the iron roof and the air was heavy with the scent of wreaths the singers with fine mats about their loins cocoanut feathers set in rings upon their fingers and their heads crowned with yellow leaves sat on the floor by companies a varying number of soloists stood up for different songs and these bore the chief part in the music but the full force of the companies even when not singing contributed continuously to the effect and marked the ictus of the measure mimicking grimacing casting up their heads and eyes fluttering the feathers on their fingers clapping hands or beating loud as a kettledrum on the left breast the time was exquisite the music barbarous but full of conscious art i noted some devices constantly employed a sudden change would be introduced i think of key with no break of the measure but emphasised by a sudden heightening of the voice and a swinging general gesticulation the voices of the soloists would begin far apart in a rude discord and gradually draw together to a unison which when they had reached they were joined and drowned by the full chorus the ordinary hurried barking unmelodious movement of the voices would at times be broken and glorified by a psalmlike strain of melody often well constructed or seeming so by contrast there was much variety of measure and towards the end of each piece when the fun became fast and furious a recourse to this figure  illustration  it is difficult to conceive what fire and devilry they get into these hammering finales all go together voices hands eyes leaves and fluttering fingerrings the chorus swings to the eye the song throbs on the ear the faces are convulsed with enthusiasm and effort  presently the troop stood up in a body the drums forming a halfcircle for the soloists who were sometimes five or even more in number the songs that followed were highly dramatic though i had none to give me any explanation i would at times make out some shadowy but decisive outline of a plot and i was continually reminded of certain quarrelsome concerted scenes in grand operas at home just so the single voices issue from and fall again into the general volume just so do the performers separate and crowd together brandish the raised hand and roll the eye to heavenor the gallery already this is beyond the thespian model the art of this people is already past the embryo song dance drums quartette and soloit is the drama full developed although still in miniature of all socalled dancing in the south seas that which i saw in butaritari stands easily the first the hula as it may be viewed by the speedy globetrotter in honolulu is surely the most dull of mans inventions and the spectator yawns under its length as at a college lecture or a parliamentary debate but the gilbert island dance leads on the mind it thrills rouses subjugates it has the essence of all art an unexplored imminent significance where so many are engaged and where all must make at a given moment the same swift elaborate and often arbitrary movement the toil of rehearsal is of course extreme but they begin as children a child and a man may often be seen together in a maniap the man sings and gesticulates the child stands before him with streaming tears and tremulously copies him in act and sound it is the gilbert island artist learning as all artists must his art in sorrow  i may seem to praise too much here is a passage from my wifes diary which proves that i was not alone in being moved and completes the picturethe conductor gave the cue and all the dancers waving their arms swaying their bodies and clapping their breasts in perfect time opened with an introductory the performers remained seated except two and once three and twice a single soloist these stood in the group making a slight movement with the feet and rhythmical quiver of the body as they sang there was a pause after the introductory and then the real business of the operafor it was no lessbegan an opera where every singer was an accomplished actor the leading man in an impassioned ecstasy which possessed him from head to foot seemed transfigured once it was as though a strong wind had swept over the stagetheir arms their feathered fingers thrilling with an emotion that shook my nerves as well heads and bodies followed like a field of grain before a gust my blood came hot and cold tears pricked my eyes my head whirled i felt an almost irresistible impulse to join the dancers one drama i think i very nearly understood a fierce and savage old man took the solo part he sang of the birth of a prince and how he was tenderly rocked in his mothers arms of his boyhood when he excelled his fellows in swimming climbing and all athletic sports of his youth when he went out to sea in his boat and fished of his manhood when he married a wife who cradled a son of his own in her arms then came the alarm of war and a great battle of which for a time the issue was doubtful but the hero conquered as he always does and with a tremendous burst of the victors the piece closed there were also comic pieces which caused great amusement during one an old man behind me clutched me by the arm shook his finger in my face with a roguish smile and said something with a chuckle which i took to be the equivalent of o you women you women it is true of you all i fear it was not complimentary at no time was there the least sign of the ugly indecency of the eastern islands all was poetry pure and simple the music itself was as complex as our own though constructed on an entirely different basis once or twice i was startled by a bit of something very like the best english sacred music but it was only for an instant at last there was a longer pause and this time the dancers were all on their feet as the drama went on the interest grew the performers appealed to each other to the audience to the heaven above they took counsel with each other the conspirators drew together in a knot it was just an opera the drums coming in at proper intervals the tenor baritone and bass all where they should beexcept that the voices were all of the same calibre a woman once sang from the back row with a very fine contralto voice spoilt by being made artificially nasal i notice all the women affect that unpleasantness at one time a boy of angelic beauty was the soloist and at another a child of six or eight doubtless an infant phenomenon being trained was placed in the centre the little fellow was desperately frightened and embarrassed at first but towards the close warmed up to his work and showed much dramatic talent the changing expressions on the faces of the dancers were so speaking that it seemed a great stupidity not to understand them  our neighbour at this performance karaiti somewhat favours his butaritarian majesty in shape and feature being like him portly bearded and oriental in character he seems the reverse alert smiling jovial jocular industrious at home in his own island he labours himself like a slave and makes his people labour like a slavedriver he takes an interest in ideas george the trader told him about flyingmachines is that true george he asked it is in the papers replied george well said karaiti if that man can do it with machinery i can do it without and he designed and made a pair of wings strapped them on his shoulders went to the end of a pier launched himself into space and fell bulkily into the sea his wives fished him out for his wings hindered him in swimming george said he pausing as he went up to change george you lie he had eight wives for his small realm still follows ancient customs but he showed embarrassment when this was mentioned to my wife tell her i have only brought one here he said anxiously altogether the black douglas pleased us much and as we heard fresh details of the kings uneasiness and saw for ourselves that all the weapons in the summer parlour had been hid we watched with the more admiration the cause of all this anxiety rolling on his big legs with his big smiling face apparently unarmed and certainly unattended through the hostile town the red douglas potbellied kuma having perhaps heard word of the debauch remained upon his fief his vassals thus came uncommanded to the feast and swelled the following of karaiti  friday july 26at night in the dark the singers of makin paraded in the road before our house and sang the song of the princess this is the day she was born today nei kamaunave was born todaya beautiful princess queen of butaritari so i was told it went in endless iteration the song was of course out of season and the performance only a rehearsal but it was a serenade besides a delicate attention to ourselves from our new friend karaiti  saturday july 27we had announced a performance of the magic lantern tonight in church and this brought the king to visit us in honour of the black douglas i suppose his usual two guardsmen were now increased to four and the squad made an outlandish figure as they straggled after him in straw hats kilts and jackets three carried their arms reversed the butts over their shoulders the muzzles menacing the kings plump back the fourth had passed his weapon behind his neck and held it there with arms extended like a backboard the visit was extraordinarily long the king no longer galvanised with gin said and did nothing he sat collapsed in a chair and let a cigar go out it was hot it was sleepy it was cruel dull there was no resource but to spy in the countenance of tebureimoa for some remaining trait of mr corpse the butcher his hawk nose crudely depressed and flattened at the point did truly seem to us to smell of midnight murder when he took his leave maka bade me observe him going down the stair or rather ladder from the verandah old man said maka yes said i and yet i suppose not old man young man returned maka perhaps foty and i have heard since he is most likely younger  while the magic lantern was showing i skulked without in the dark the voice of maka excitedly explaining the scripture slides seemed to fill not the church only but the neighbourhood all else was silent presently a distant sound of singing arose and approached and a procession drew near along the road the hot clean smell of the men and women striking in my face delightfully at the corner arrested by the voice of maka and the lightening and darkening of the church they paused they had no mind to go nearer that was plain they were makin people i believe probably staunch heathens contemners of the missionary and his works of a sudden however a man broke from their company took to his heels and fled into the church next moment three had followed him the next it was a covey of near upon a score all pelting for their lives so the little band of the heathen paused irresolute at the corner and melted before the attractions of a magic lantern like a glacier in spring the more staunch vainly taunted the deserters three fled in a guilty silence but still fled and when at length the leader found the wit or the authority to get his troop in motion and revive the singing it was with much diminished forces that they passed musically on up the dark road  meanwhile inside the luminous pictures brightened and faded i stood for some while unobserved in the rear of the spectators when i could hear just in front of me a pair of lovers following the show with interest the male playing the part of interpreter and like adam mingling caresses with his lecture the wild animals a tiger in particular and that old schooltreat favourite the sleeper and the mouse were hailed with joy but the chief marvel and delight was in the gospel series maka in the opinion of his aggrieved wife did not properly rise to the occasion what is the matter with the man why cant he talk she cried the matter with the man i think was the greatness of the opportunity he reeled under his good fortune and whether he did ill or well the exposure of these pious phantoms did as a matter of fact silence in all that part of the island the voice of the scoffer why then the word went round why then the bible is true and on our return afterwards we were told the impression was yet lively and those who had seen might be heard telling those who had not o yes it is all true these things all happened we have seen the pictures the argument is not so childish as it seems for i doubt if these islanders are acquainted with any other mode of representation but photography so that the picture of an event on the old melodrama principle that the camera cannot lie joseph would appear strong proof of its occurrence the fact amused us the more because our slides were some of them ludicrously silly and one christ before pilate was received with shouts of merriment in which even maka was constrained to join  sunday july 28karaiti came to ask for a repetition of the phantomsthis was the accepted wordand having received a promise turned and left my humble roof without the shadow of a salutation i felt it impolite to have the least appearance of pocketing a slight the times had been too difficult and were still too doubtful and queen victorias son was bound to maintain the honour of his house karaiti was accordingly summoned that evening to the ricks where mrs rick fell foul of him in words and queen victorias son assailed him with indignant looks i was the ass with the lions skin i could not roar in the language of the gilbert islands but i could stare karaiti declared he had meant no offence apologised in a sound hearty gentlemanly manner and became at once at his ease he had in a dagger to examine and announced he would come to price it on the morrow today being sunday this nicety in a heathen with eight wives surprised me the dagger was good for killing fish he said roguishly and was supposed to have his eye upon fish upon two legs it is at least odd that in eastern polynesia fish was the accepted euphemism for the human sacrifice asked as to the population of his island karaiti called out to his vassals who sat waiting him outside the door and they put it at four hundred and fifty but added karaiti jovially there will soon be plenty more for all the women are in the family way long before we separated i had quite forgotten his offence he however still bore it in mind and with a very courteous inspiration returned early on the next day paid us a long visit and punctiliously said farewell when he departed  monday july 29the great day came round at last in the first hours the night was startled by the sound of clapping hands and the chant of nei kamaunava its melancholy slow and somewhat menacing measures broken at intervals by a formidable shout the little morsel of humanity thus celebrated in the dark hours was observed at midday playing on the green entirely naked and equally unobserved and unconcerned  the summer parlour on its artificial islet relieved against the shimmering lagoon and shimmering itself with sun and tinned iron was all day crowded about by eager men and women within it was boxed full of islanders of any age and size and in every degree of nudity and finery so close we squatted that at one time i had a mighty handsome woman on my knees two little naked urchins having their feet against my back there might be a dame in full attire of holoku and hat and flowers and her next neighbour might the next moment strip some little rag of a shift from her fat shoulders and come out a monument of flesh painted rather than covered by the hairbreadth ridi little ladies who thought themselves too great to appear undraped upon so high a festival were seen to pause outside in the broad sunshine their miniature ridis in their hand a moment more and they were fulldressed and entered the concertroom  at either end stood up to sing or sat down to rest the alternate companies of singers kuma and little makin on the north butaritari and its conjunct hamlets to the south both groups conspicuous in barbaric bravery in the midst between these rival camps of troubadours a bench was placed and here the king and queen throned it some two or three feet above the crowded audience on the floortebureimoa as usual in his striped pyjamas with a satchel strapped across one shoulder doubtless in the island fashion to contain his pistols the queen in a purple holoku her abundant hair let down a fan in her hand the bench was turned facing to the strangers a piece of wellconsidered civility and when it was the turn of butaritari to sing the pair must twist round on the bench lean their elbows on the rail and turn to us the spectacle of their broad backs the royal couple occasionally solaced themselves with a clay pipe and the pomp of state was further heightened by the rifles of a picket of the guard  with this kingly countenance and ourselves squatted on the ground we heard several songs from one side or the other then royalty and its guards withdrew and queen victorias son and daughterinlaw were summoned by acclamation to the vacant throne our pride was perhaps a little modified when we were joined on our high places by a certain thriftless loafer of a white and yet i was glad too for the man had a smattering of native and could give me some idea of the subject of the songs one was patriotic and dared tembinok of apemama the terror of the group to an invasion one mixed the planting of taro and the harvesthome some were historical and commemorated kings and the illustrious chances of their time such as a bout of drinking or a war one at least was a drama of domestic interest excellently played by the troop from makin it told the story of a man who has lost his wife at first bewails her loss then seeks another the earlier strains or acts are played exclusively by men but towards the end a woman appears who has just lost her husband and i suppose the pair console each other for the finale seemed of happy omen of some of the songs my informant told me briefly they were like about the weemen this i could have guessed myself each side i should have said was strengthened by one or two women they were all soloists did not very often join in the performance but stood disengaged at the back part of the stage and looked in ridi necklace and dressed hair for all the world like european balletdancers when the song was anyway broad these ladies came particularly to the front and it was singular to see that after each entry the première danseuse pretended to be overcome by shame as though led on beyond what she had meant and her male assistants made a feint of driving her away like one who had disgraced herself similar affectations accompany certain truly obscene dances of samoa where they are very well in place here it was different the words perhaps in this freespoken world were gross enough to make a carter blush and the most suggestive feature was this feint of shame for such parts the women showed some disposition they were pert they were neat they were acrobatic they were at times really amusing and some of them were pretty but this is not the artists field there is the whole width of heaven between such capering and ogling and the strange rhythmic gestures and strange rapturous frenzied faces with which the best of the male dancers held us spellbound through a gilbert island ballet  almost from the first it was apparent that the people of the city were defeated i might have thought them even good only i had the other troop before my eyes to correct my standard and remind me continually of the little more and how much it is perceiving themselves worsted the choir of butaritari grew confused blundered and broke down amid this hubbub of unfamiliar intervals i should not myself have recognised the slip but the audience were quick to catch it and to jeer to crown all the makin company began a dance of truly superlative merit i know not what it was about i was too much absorbed to ask in one act a part of the chorus squealing in some strange falsetto produced very much the effect of our orchestra in another the dancers leaping like jumpingjacks with arms extended passed through and through each others ranks with extraordinary speed neatness and humour a more laughable effect i never saw in any european theatre it would have brought the house down and the island audience roared with laughter and applause this filled up the measure for the rival company and they forgot themselves and decency after each act or figure of the ballet the performers pause a moment standing and the next is introduced by the clapping of hands in triplets not until the end of the whole ballet do they sit down which is the signal for the rivals to stand up but now all rules were to be broken during the interval following on this great applause the company of butaritari leaped suddenly to their feet and most unhandsomely began a performance of their own it was strange to see the men of makin staring i have seen a tenor in europe stare with the same blank dignity into a hissing theatre but presently to my surprise they sobered down gave up the unsung remainder of their ballet resumed their seats and suffered their ungallant adversaries to go on and finish nothing would suffice again at the first interval butaritari unhandsomely cut in makin irritated in turn followed the example and the two companies of dancers remained permanently standing continuously clapping hands and regularly cutting across each other at each pause i expected blows to begin with any moment and our position in the midst was highly unstrategical but the makin people had a better thought and upon a fresh interruption turned and trooped out of the house we followed them first because these were the artists second because they were guests and had been scurvily illused a large population of our neighbours did the same so that the causeway was filled from end to end by the procession of deserters and the butaritari choir was left to sing for its own pleasure in an empty house having gained the point and lost the audience it was surely fortunate that there was no one drunk but drunk or sober where else would a scene so irritating have concluded without blows  the last stage and glory of this auspicious day was of our own providingthe second and positively the last appearance of the phantoms all round the church groups sat outside in the night where they could see nothing perhaps ashamed to enter certainly finding some shadowy pleasure in the mere proximity within about onehalf of the great shed was densely packed with people in the midst on the royal dais the lantern luminously smoked chance rays of light struck out the earnest countenance of our chinaman grinding the handorgan a fainter glimmer showed off the rafters and their shadows in the hollow of the roof the pictures shone and vanished on the screen and as each appeared there would run a hush a whisper a strong shuddering rustle and a chorus of small cries among the crowd there sat by me the mate of a wrecked schooner they would think this a strange sight in europe or the states said he going on in a building like this all tied with bits of string     chapter vii  husband and wife   the trader accustomed to the manners of eastern polynesia has a lesson to learn among the gilberts the ridi is but a spare attire as late as thirty years back the women went naked until marriage within ten years the custom lingered and these facts above all when heard in description conveyed a very false idea of the manners of the group a very intelligent missionary described it in its former state as a paradise of naked women for the resident whites it was at least a platonic paradise where lothario ventured at his peril since 1860 fourteen whites have perished on a single island all for the same cause all found where they had no business and speared by some indignant father of a family the figure was given me by one of their contemporaries who had been more prudent and survived the strange persistence of these fourteen martyrs might seem to point to monomania or a series of romantic passions gin is the more likely key the poor buzzards sat alone in their houses by an open case they drank their brain was fired they stumbled towards the nearest houses on chance and the dart went through their liver in place of a paradise the trader found an archipelago of fierce husbands and of virtuous women of course if you wish to make love to them its the same as anywhere else observed a trader innocently but he and his companions rarely so choose  the trader must be credited with a virtue he often makes a kind and loyal husband some of the worst beachcombers in the pacific some of the last of the old school have fallen in my path and some of them were admirable to their native wives and one made a despairing widower the position of a traders wife in the gilberts is besides unusually enviable she shares the immunities of her husband curfew in butaritari sounds for her in vain long after the bell is rung and the great island ladies are confined for the night to their own roof this chartered libertine may scamper and giggle through the deserted streets or go down to bathe in the dark the resources of the store are at her hand she goes arrayed like a queen and feasts delicately every day upon tinned meats and she who was perhaps of no regard or station among natives sits with captains and is entertained on board of schooners five of these privileged dames were some time our neighbours four were handsome skittish lasses gamesome like children and like children liable to fits of pouting they wore dresses by day but there was a tendency after dark to strip these lendings and to career and squall about the compound in the aboriginal ridi games of cards were continually played with shells for counters their course was much marred by cheating and the end of a round above all if a man was of the party resolved itself into a scrimmage for the counters the fifth was a matron it was a picture to see her sail to church on a sunday a parasol in hand a nursemaid following and the baby buried in a trade hat and armed with a patent feedingbottle the service was enlivened by her continual supervision and correction of the maid it was impossible not to fancy the baby was a doll and the church some european playroom all these women were legitimately married it is true that the certificate of one when she proudly showed it proved to run thus that she was married for one night and her gracious partner was at liberty to send her to hell the next morning but she was none the wiser or the worse for the dastardly trick another i heard was married on a work of mine in a pirated edition it answered the purpose as well as a hall bible notwithstanding all these allurements of social distinction rare food and raiment a comparative vacation from toil and legitimate marriage contracted on a pirated edition the trader must sometimes seek long before he can be mated while i was in the group one had been eight months on the quest and he was still a bachelor  within strictly native society the old laws and practices were harsh but not without a certain stamp of highmindedness stealthy adultery was punished with death open elopement was properly considered virtue in comparison and compounded for a fine in land the male adulterer alone seems to have been punished it is correct manners for a jealous man to hang himself a jealous woman has a different remedyshe bites her rival ten or twenty years ago it was a capital offence to raise a womans ridi to this day it is still punished with a heavy fine and the garment itself is still symbolically sacred suppose a piece of land to be disputed in butaritari the claimant who shall first hang a ridi on the tapupost has gained his cause since no one can remove or touch it but himself  the ridi was the badge not of the woman but the wife the mark not of her sex but of her station it was the collar on the slaves neck the brand on merchandise the adulterous woman seems to have been spared were the husband offended it would be a poor consolation to send his draught cattle to the shambles karaiti to this day calls his eight wives his horses some trader having explained to him the employment of these animals on farms and nanteitei hired out his wives to do masonwork husbands at least when of high rank had the power of life and death even whites seem to have possessed it and their wives when they had transgressed beyond forgiveness made haste to pronounce the formula of deprecationi kana kim this form of words had so much virtue that a condemned criminal repeating it on a particular day to the king who had condemned him must be instantly released it is an offer of abasement and strangely enough the reversethe imitationis a common vulgar insult in great britain to this day i give a scene between a trader and his gilbert island wife as it was told me by the husband now one of the oldest residents but then a freshman in the group  go and light a fire said the trader and when i have brought this oil i will cook some fish  the woman grunted at him island fashion  i am not a pig that you should grunt at me said he  i know you are not a pig said the woman neither am i your slave  to be sure you are not my slave and if you do not care to stop with me you had better go home to your people said he but in the meantime go and light the fire and when i have brought this oil i will cook some fish  she went as if to obey and presently when the trader looked she had built a fire so big that the cookhouse was catching in flames  i kana kim she cried as she saw him coming but he recked not and hit her with a cookingpot the leg pierced her skull blood spouted it was thought she was a dead woman and the natives surrounded the house in a menacing expectation another white was present a man of older experience you will have us both killed if you go on like this he cried she had said i kana kim if she had not said i kana kim he might have struck her with a caldron it was not the blow that made the crime but the disregard of an accepted formula  polygamy the particular sacredness of wives their semiservile state their seclusion in kings harems even their privilege of biting all would seem to indicate a mohammedan society and the opinion of the soullessness of woman and not so in the least it is a mere appearance after you have studied these extremes in one house you may go to the next and find all reversed the woman the mistress the man only the first of her thralls the authority is not with the husband as such nor the wife as such it resides in the chief or the chiefwoman in him or her who has inherited the lands of the clan and stands to the clansman in the place of parent exacting their service answerable for their fines there is but the one source of power and the one ground of dignityrank the king married a chiefwoman she became his menial and must work with her hands on messrs wightmans pier the king divorced her she regained at once her former state and power she married the hawaiian sailor and behold the man is her flunkey and can be shown the door at pleasure nay and such lowborn lords are even corrected physically and like grown but dutiful children must endure the discipline  we were intimate in one such household that of nei takauti and nan tok i put the lady first of necessity during one week of fools paradise mrs stevenson had gone alone to the seaside of the island after shells i am very sure the proceeding was unsafe and she soon perceived a man and woman watching her do what she would her guardians held her steadily in view and when the afternoon began to fall and they thought she had stayed long enough took her in charge and by signs and broken english ordered her home on the way the lady drew from her earringhole a clay pipe the husband lighted it and it was handed to my unfortunate wife who knew not how to refuse the incommodious favour and when they were all come to our house the pair sat down beside her on the floor and improved the occasion with prayer from that day they were our family friends bringing thrice a day the beautiful island garlands of white flowers visiting us any evening and frequently carrying us down to their own maniap in return the woman leading mrs stevenson by the hand like one child with another  nan tok the husband was young extremely handsome of the most approved good humour and suffering in his precarious station from suppressed high spirits nei takauti the wife was getting old her grown son by a former marriage had just hanged himself before his mothers eyes in despair at a wellmerited rebuke perhaps she had never been beautiful but her face was full of character her eye of sombre fire she was a high chiefwoman but by a strange exception for a person of her rank was small spare and sinewy with lean small hands and corded neck her full dress of an evening was invariably a white chemiseand for adornment green leaves or sometimes white blossoms stuck in her hair and thrust through her huge earringholes the husband on the contrary changed to view like a kaleidoscope whatever pretty thing my wife might have given to nei takautia string of beads a ribbon a piece of bright fabricappeared the next evening on the person of nan tok it was plain he was a clotheshorse that he wore livery that in a word he was his wifes wife they reversed the parts indeed down to the least particular it was the husband who showed himself the ministering angel in the hour of pain while the wife displayed the apathy and heartlessness of the proverbial man  when nei takauti had a headache nan tok was full of attention and concern when the husband had a cold and a racking toothache the wife heeded not except to jeer it is always the womans part to fill and light the pipe nei takauti handed hers in silence to the wedded page but she carried it herself as though the page were not entirely trusted thus she kept the money but it was he who ran the errands anxiously sedulous a cloud on her face dimmed instantly his beaming looks on an early visit to their maniap my wife saw he had cause to be wary nan tok had a friend with him a giddy young thing of his own age and sex and they had worked themselves into that stage of jocularity when consequences are too often disregarded nei takauti mentioned her own name instantly nan tok held up two fingers his friend did likewise both in an ecstasy of slyness it was plain the lady had two names and from the nature of their merriment and the wrath that gathered on her brow there must be something ticklish in the second the husband pronounced it a welldirected cocoanut from the hand of his wife caught him on the side of the head and the voices and the mirth of these indiscreet young gentlemen ceased for the day  the people of eastern polynesia are never at a loss their etiquette is absolute and plenary in every circumstance it tells them what to do and how to do it the gilbertines are seemingly more free and pay for their freedom like ourselves in frequent perplexity this was often the case with the topsyturvy couple we had once supplied them during a visit with a pipe and tobacco and when they had smoked and were about to leave they found themselves confronted with a problem should they take or leave what remained of the tobacco the piece of plug was taken up it was laid down again it was handed back and forth and argued over till the wife began to look haggard and the husband elderly they ended by taking it and i wager were not yet clear of the compound before they were sure they had decided wrong another time they had been given each a liberal cup of coffee and nan tok with difficulty and disaffection made an end of his nei takauti had taken some she had no mind for more plainly conceived it would be a breach of manners to set down the cup unfinished and ordered her wedded retainer to dispose of what was left i have swallowed all i can i cannot swallow more it is a physical impossibility he seemed to say and his stern officer reiterated her commands with secret imperative signals luckless dog but in mere humanity we came to the rescue and removed the cup  i cannot but smile over this funny household yet i remember the good souls with affection and respect their attention to ourselves was surprising the garlands are much esteemed the blossoms must be sought far and wide and though they had many retainers to call to their aid we often saw themselves passing afield after the blossoms and the wife engaged with her own hands in putting them together it was no want of heart only that disregard so incident to husbands that made nei takauti despise the sufferings of nan tok when my wife was unwell she proved a diligent and kindly nurse and the pair to the extreme embarrassment of the sufferer became fixtures in the sickroom this rugged capable imperious old dame with the wild eyes had deep and tender qualities her pride in her young husband it seemed that she dissembled fearing possibly to spoil him and when she spoke of her dead son there came something tragic in her face but i seemed to trace in the gilbertines a virility of sense and sentiment which distinguishes them like their harsh and uncouth language from their brother islanders in the east     part v  the gilbertsapemama     chapter i  the king of apemama the royal trader   there is one great personage in the gilberts tembinok of apemama solely conspicuous the hero of song the butt of gossip through the rest of the group the kings are slain or fallen in tutelage tembinok alone remains the last tyrant the last erect vestige of a dead society the white man is everywhere else building his houses drinking his gin getting in and out of trouble with the weak native governments there is only one white on apemama and he on sufferance living far from court and hearkening and watching his conduct like a mouse in a cats ear through all the other islands a stream of native visitors comes and goes travelling by families spending years on the grand tour apemama alone is left upon one side the tourist dreading to risk himself within the clutch of tembinok and fear of the same gorgon follows and troubles them at home maiana once paid him tribute he once fell upon and seized nonuti first steps to the empire of the archipelago a british warship coming on the scene the conqueror was driven to disgorge his career checked in the outset his dearbought armoury sunk in his own lagoon but the impression had been made periodical fear of him still shakes the islands rumour depicts him mustering his canoes for a fresh onfall rumour can name his destination and tembinok figures in the patriotic warsongs of the gilberts like napoleon in those of our grandfathers  we were at sea bound from mariki to nonuti and tapituea when the wind came suddenly fair for apemama the course was at once changed all hands were turnedto to clean ship the decks holystoned the cabin washed the traderoom overhauled in all our cruising we never saw the equator so smart as she was made for tembinok nor was captain reid alone in these coquetries for another schooner chancing to arrive during my stay in apemama i found that she also was dandified for the occasion and the two cases stand alone in my experience of south sea traders  we had on board a family of native tourists from the grandsire to the babe in arms trying against an extraordinary series of illluck to regain their native island of peru8 five times already they had paid their fare and taken ship five times they had been disappointed dropped penniless upon strange islands or carried back to butaritari whence they sailed this last attempt had been no betterstarred their provisions were exhausted peru was beyond hope and they had cheerfully made up their minds to a fresh stage of exile in tapituea or nonuti with this slant of wind their random destination became once more changed and like the calendars pilot when the black mountains hove in view they changed colour and beat upon their breasts their camp which was on deck in the ships waist resounded with complaint they would be set to work they must become slaves escape was hopeless they must live and toil and die in apemama in the tyrants den with this sort of talk they so greatly terrified their children that one a big hulking boy must at last be torn screaming from the schooners side and their fears were wholly groundless i have little doubt they were not suffered to be idle but i can vouch for it that they were kindly and generously used for the matter of a year later i was once more shipmate with these inconsistent wanderers on board the janet nicoll their fare was paid by tembinok they who had gone ashore from the equator destitute reappeared upon the janet with new clothes laden with mats and presents and bringing with them a magazine of food on which they lived like fightingcocks throughout the voyage i saw them at length repatriated and i must say they showed more concern on quitting apemama than delight at reaching home  we entered by the north passage sunday september 1st dodging among shoals it was a day of fierce equatorial sunshine but the breeze was strong and chill and the mate who conned the schooner from the crosstrees returned shivering to the deck the lagoon was thick with manytinted wavelets a continuous roaring of the outer sea overhung the anchorage and the long hollow crescent of palm ruffled and sparkled in the wind opposite our berth the beach was seen to be surmounted for some distance by a terrace of white coral seven or eight feet high and crowned in turn by the scattered and incongruous buildings of the palace the village adjoins on the south a cluster of highroofed maniaps and village and palace seemed deserted  we were scarce yet moored however before distant and busy figures appeared upon the beach a boat was launched and a crew pulled out to us bringing the kings ladder tembinok had once an accident has feared ever since to intrust his person to the rotten chandlery of south sea traders and devised in consequence a frame of wood which is brought on board a ship as soon as she appears and remains lashed to her side until she leave the boats crew having applied this engine returned at once to shore they might not come on board neither might we land or not without danger of offence the king giving pratique in person an interval followed during which dinner was delayed for the great man the prelude of the ladder giving us some notion of his weighty body and sensible ingenious character had highly whetted our curiosity and it was with something like excitement that we saw the beach and terrace suddenly blacken with attendant vassals the king and party embark the boat a manofwar gig come flying towards us dead before the wind and the royal coxswain lay us cleverly aboard mount the ladder with a jealous diffidence and descend heavily on deck  not long ago he was overgrown with fat obscured to view and a burthen to himself captains visiting the island advised him to walk and though it broke the habits of a life and the traditions of his rank he practised the remedy with benefit his corpulence is now portable you would call him lusty rather than fat but his gait is still dull stumbling and elephantine he neither stops nor hastens but goes about his business with an implacable deliberation we could never see him and not be struck with his extraordinary natural means for the theatre a beaked profile like dantes in the mask a mane of long black hair the eye brilliant imperious and inquiring for certain parts and to one who could have used it the face was a fortune his voice matched it well being shrill powerful and uncanny with a note like a seabirds where there are no fashions none to set them few to follow them if they were set and none to criticise he dressesas sir charles grandison livedto his own heart now he wears a womans frock now a naval uniform now and more usually figures in a masquerade costume of his own design trousers and a singular jacket with shirt tails the cut and fit wonderful for island workmanship the material always handsome sometimes green velvet sometimes cardinal red silk this masquerade becomes him admirably in the womans frock he looks ominous and weird beyond belief i see him now come pacing towards me in the cruel sun solitary a figure out of hoffmann  a visit on board ship such as that at which we now assisted makes a chief part and by far the chief diversion of the life of tembinok he is not only the sole ruler he is the sole merchant of his triple kingdom apemama aranuka and kuria wellplanted islands the taro goes to the chiefs who divide as they please among their immediate adherents but certain fish turtleswhich abound in kuriaand the whole produce of the cocopalm belong exclusively to tembinok a cobra9 berong me observed his majesty with a wave of his hand and he counts and sells it by the houseful you got copra king i have heard a trader ask i got two three outches10 his majesty replied i think three hence the commercial importance of apemama the trade of three islands being centred there in a single hand hence it is that so many whites have tried in vain to gain or to preserve a footing hence ships are adorned cooks have special orders and captains array themselves in smiles to greet the king if he be pleased with his welcome and the fare he may pass days on board and every day and sometimes every hour will be of profit to the ship he oscillates between the cabin where he is entertained with strange meats and the traderoom where he enjoys the pleasures of shopping on a scale to match his person a few obsequious attendants squat by the house door awaiting his least signal in the boat which has been suffered to drop astern one or two of his wives lie covered from the sun under mats tossed by the short sea of the lagoon and enduring agonies of heat and tedium this severity is now and then relaxed and the wives allowed on board three or four were thus favoured on the day of our arrival substantial ladies airily attired in ridis each had a share of copra her peculium to dispose of for herself the display in the traderoomhats ribbons dresses scents tins of salmonthe pride of the eye and the lust of the fleshtempted them in vain they had but the one ideatobacco the island currency tantamount to minted gold returned to shore with it burthened but rejoicing and late into the night on the royal terrace were to be seen counting the sticks by lamplight in the open air  the king is no such economist he is greedy of things new and foreign house after house chest after chest in the palace precinct is already crammed with clocks musical boxes blue spectacles umbrellas knitted waistcoats bolts of stuff tools rifles fowlingpieces medicines european foods sewingmachines and what is more extraordinary stoves all that ever caught his eye tickled his appetite pleased him for its use or puzzled him with its apparent inutility and still his lust is unabated he is possessed by the seven devils of the collector he hears a thing spoken of and a shadow comes on his face i think i no got him he will say and the treasures he has seem worthless in comparison if a ship be bound for apemama the merchant racks his brain to hit upon some novelty this he leaves carelessly in the main cabin or partly conceals in his own berth so that the king shall spy it for himself how much you want inquires tembinok passing and pointing no king that too dear returns the trader i think i like him says the king this was a bowl of goldfish on another occasion it was scented soap no king that cost too much said the trader too good for a kanaka how much you got i take him all replied his majesty and became the lord of seventeen boxes at two dollars a cake or again the merchant feigns the article is not for sale is private property an heirloom or a gift and the trick infallibly succeeds thwart the king and you hold him his autocratic nature rears at the affront of opposition he accepts it for a challenge sets his teeth like a hunter going at a fence and with no mark of emotion scarce even of interest stolidly piles up the price thus for our sins he took a fancy to my wifes dressingbag a thing entirely useless to the man and sadly battered by years of service early one forenoon he came to our house sat down and abruptly offered to purchase it i told him i sold nothing and the bag at any rate was a present from a friend but he was acquainted with these pretexts from of old and knew what they were worth and how to meet them adopting what i believe is called the object method he drew out a bag of english gold sovereigns and halfsovereigns and began to lay them one by one in silence on the table at each fresh piece reading our faces with a look in vain i continued to protest i was no trader he deigned not to reply there must have been twenty pounds on the table he was still going on and irritation had begun to mingle with our embarrassment when a happy idea came to our delivery since his majesty thought so much of the bag we said we must beg him to accept it as a present it was the most surprising turn in tembinoks experience he perceived too late that his persistence was unmannerly hung his head a while in silence then lifting up a sheepish countenance i shamed said the tyrant it was the first and the last time we heard him own to a flaw in his behaviour half an hour after he sent us a camphorwood chest worth only a few dollarsbut then heaven knows what tembinok had paid for it  cunning by nature and versed for forty years in the government of men it must not be supposed that he is cheated blindly or has resigned himself without resistance to be the milchcow of the passing trader his efforts have been even heroic like nakaeia of makin he has owned schooners more fortunate than nakaeia he has found captains ships of his have sailed as far as to the colonies he has trafficked direct in his own bottoms with new zealand and even so even there the worldenveloping dishonesty of the white man prevented him his profit melted his ship returned in debt the money for the insurance was embezzled and when the coronet came to be lost he was astonished to find he had lost all at this he dropped his weapons owned he might as hopefully wrestle with the winds of heaven and like an experienced sheep submitted his fleece thenceforward to the shearers he is the last man in the world to waste anger on the incurable accepts it with cynical composure asks no more in those he deals with than a certain decency of moderation drives as good a bargain as he can and when he considers he is more than usually swindled writes it in his memory against the merchants name he once ran over to me a list of captains and supercargoes with whom he had done business classing them under three heads he cheat a littyhe cheat plentyand i think he cheat too much for the first two classes he expressed perfect toleration sometimes but not always for the third i was present when a certain merchant was turned about his business and was the means having a considerable influence ever since the bag of patching up the dispute even on the day of our arrival there was like to have been a hitch with captain reid the ground of which is perhaps worth recital among goods exported specially for tembinok there is a beverage known and labelled as hennessys brandy it is neither hennessy nor even brandy it is about the colour of sherry but is not sherry tastes of kirsch and yet neither is it kirsch the king at least has grown used to this amazing brand and rather prides himself upon the taste and any substitution is a double offence being at once to cheat him and to cast a doubt upon his palate a similar weakness is to be observed in all connoisseurs now the last case sold by the equator was found to contain a different and i would fondly fancy a superior distillation and the conversation opened very black for captain reid but tembinok is a moderate man he was reminded and admitted that all men were liable to error even himself accepted the principle that a fault handsomely acknowledged should be condoned and wound the matter up with this proposal tuppoti11 i mitake you peakee me tuppoti you mitake i peakee you mo betta  after dinner and supper in the cabin a glass or two of hennettithe genuine article this time with the kirsch bouquetand five hours lounging on the traderoom counter royalty embarked for home three tacks grounded the boat before the palace the wives were carried ashore on the backs of vassals tembinok stepped on a railed platform like a steamers gangway and was borne shoulderhigh through the shallows up the beach and by an inclined plane paved with pebbles to the glaring terrace where he dwells   footnotes    8 in the gilbert group    9 copra the dried kernel of the cocoanut the chief article of     commerce throughout the pacific islands    10 houses    11 suppose     chapter ii  the king of apemama foundation of equator town   our first sight of tembinok was a matter of concern almost alarm to my whole party we had a favour to seek we must approach in the proper courtly attitude of a suitor and must either please him or fail in the main purpose of our voyage it was our wish to land and live in apemama and see more near at hand the odd character of the man and the odd or rather ancient condition of his island in all other isles of the south seas a white man may land with his chest and set up house for a lifetime if he choose and if he have the money or the trade no hindrance is conceivable but apemama is a close island lying there in the sea with closed doors the king himself like a vigilant officer ready at the wicket to scrutinise and reject intrenching visitors hence the attraction of our enterprise not merely because it was a little difficult but because this social quarantine a curiosity in itself has been the preservative of others  tembinok like most tyrants is a conservative like many conservatives he eagerly welcomes new ideas and except in the field of politics leans to practical reform when the missionaries came professing a knowledge of the truth he readily received them attended their worship acquired the accomplishment of public prayer and made himself a student at their feet it is thusit is by the cultivation of similar passing chancesthat he has learned to read to write to cipher and to speak his queer personal english so different from ordinary beach de mar so much more obscure expressive and condensed his education attended to he found time to become critical of the new inmates like nakaeia of makin he is an admirer of silence in the island broods over it like a great ear has spies who report daily and had rather his subjects sang than talked the service and in particular the sermon were thus sure to become offences here in my island i peak he once observed to me my chieps no peakdo what i talk he looked at the missionary and what did he see see kanaka peak in a big outch he cried with a strong ring of sarcasm yet he endured the subversive spectacle and might even have continued to endure it had not a fresh point arisen he looked again to employ his own figure and the kanaka was no longer speaking he was doing worsehe was building a coprahouse the king was touched in his chief interests revenue and prerogative were threatened he considered besides and some think with him that trade is incompatible with the missionary claims tuppoti mitonary think good man very good tuppoti he think cobra no good i send him away ship such was his abrupt history of the evangelist in apemama  similar deportations are common i send him away ship is the epitaph of not a few his majesty paying the exiles fare to the next place of call for instance being passionately fond of european food he has several times added to his household a white cook and one after another these have been deported they on their side swear they were not paid their wages he on his that they robbed and swindled him beyond endurance both perhaps justly a more important case was that of an agent despatched as i heard the story by a firm of merchants to worm his way into the kings good graces become if possible premier and handle the copra in the interests of his employers he obtained authority to land practised his fascinations was patiently listened to by tembinok supposed himself on the highway to success and behold when the next ship touched at apemama the wouldbe premier was flung into a boathad on boardhis fare paid and so goodbye but it is needless to multiply examples the proof of the pudding is in the eating when we came to apemama of so many white men who have scrambled for a place in that rich market one remaineda silent sober solitary niggardly recluse of whom the king remarks i think he good he no peak  i was warned at the outset we might very well fail in our design yet never dreamed of what proved to be the fact that we should be left fourandtwenty hours in suspense and come within an ace of ultimate rejection captain reid had primed himself no sooner was the king on board and the hennetti question amicably settled than he proceeded to express my request and give an abstract of my claims and virtues the gammon about queen victorias son might do for butaritari it was out of the question here and i now figured as one of the old men of england a person of deep knowledge come expressly to visit tembinoks dominion and eager to report upon it to the no less eager queen victoria the king made no shadow of an answer and presently began upon a different subject we might have thought he had not heard or not understood only that we found ourselves the subject of a constant study as we sat at meals he took us in series and fixed upon each for near a minute at a time the same hard and thoughtful stare as he thus looked he seemed to forget himself the subject and the company and to become absorbed in the process of his thought the look was wholly impersonal i have seen the same in the eyes of portraitpainters the counts upon which whites have been deported are mainly four cheating tembinok meddling overmuch with copra which is the source of his wealth and one of the sinews of his power peaking and political intrigue i felt guiltless upon all but how to show it i would not have taken copra in a gift how to express that quality by my dinnertable bearing the rest of the party shared my innocence and my embarrassment they shared also in my mortification when after two whole mealtimes and the odd moments of an afternoon devoted to this reconnoitring tembinok took his leave in silence next morning the same undisguised study the same silence was resumed and the second day had come to its maturity before i was informed abruptly that i had stood the ordeal i look your eye you good man you no lie said the king a doubtful compliment to a writer of romance later he explained he did not quite judge by the eye only but the mouth as well tuppoti i see man he explained i no tavvy good man bad man i look eye look mouth then i tavvy look eye look mouth he repeated and indeed in our case the mouth had the most to do with it and it was by our talk that we gained admission to the island the king promising himself and i believe really amassing a vast amount of useful knowledge ere we left  the terms of our admission were as follows we were to choose a site and the king should there build us a town his people should work for us but the king only was to give them orders one of his cooks should come daily to help mine and to learn of him in case our stores ran out he would supply us and be repaid on the return of the equator on the other hand he was to come to meals with us when so inclined when he stayed at home a dish was to be sent him from our table and i solemnly engaged to give his subjects no liquor or money both of which they are forbidden to possess and no tobacco which they were to receive only from the royal hand i think i remember to have protested against the stringency of this last article at least it was relaxed and when a man worked for me i was allowed to give him a pipe of tobacco on the premises but none to take away  the site of equator citywe named our city for the schoonerwas soon chosen the immediate shores of the lagoon are windy and blinding tembinok himself is glad to grope bluespectacled on his terrace and we fled the neighbourhood of the red conjunctiva the suppurating eyeball and the beggar who pursues and beseeches the passing foreigner for eyewash behind the town the country is diversified here open sandy uneven and dotted with dwarfish palms here cut up with taro trenches deep and shallow and according to the growth of the plants presenting now the appearance of a sandy tannery now of an alleyed and green garden a path leads towards the sea mounting abruptly to the main level of the islandtwenty or even thirty feet although findlay gives five and just hard by the top of the rise where the cocopalms begin to be well grown we found a grove of pandanus and a piece of soil pleasantly covered with green underbush a well was not far off under a rustic wellhouse nearer still in a sandy cup of the land a pond where we might wash our clothes the place was out of the wind out of the sun and out of sight of the village it was shown to the king and the town promised for the morrow  the morrow came mr osbourne landed found nothing done and carried his complaint to tembinok he heard it rose called for a winchester stepped without the royal palisade and fired two shots in the air a shot in the air is the first apemama warning it has the force of a proclamation in more loquacious countries and his majesty remarked agreeably that it would make his labourers mo bright in less than thirty minutes accordingly the men had mustered the work was begun and we were told that we might bring our baggage when we pleased  it was two in the afternoon ere the first boat was beached and the long procession of chests and crates and sacks began to straggle through the sandy desert towards equator town the grove of pandanus was practically a thing of the past fire surrounded and smoke rose in the green underbush in a wide circuit the axes were still crashing those very advantages for which the place was chosen it had been the kings first idea to abolish and in the midst of this devastation there stood already a goodsized maniap and a small closed house a mat was spread near by for tembinok here he sat superintending in cardinal red a pith helmet on his head a meerschaum pipe in his mouth a wife stretched at his back with custody of the matches and tobacco twenty or thirty feet in front of him the bulk of the workers squatted on the ground some of the bush here survived and in this the commons sat nearly to their shoulders and presented only an arc of brown faces black heads and attentive eyes fixed on his majesty long pauses reigned during which the subjects stared and the king smoked then tembinok would raise his voice and speak shrilly and briefly there was never a response in words but if the speech were jesting there came by way of answer discreet obsequious laughtersuch laughter as we hear in schoolrooms and if it were practical the sudden uprising and departure of the squad twice they so disappeared and returned with further elements of the city a second house and a second maniap it was singular to spy far off through the cocostems the silent oncoming of the maniap at first it seemed swimming spontaneously in the airbut on a nearer view betraying under the eaves many score of moving naked legs in all the affair servile obedience was no less remarkable than servile deliberation the gang had here mustered by the note of a deadly weapon the man who looked on was the unquestioned master of their lives and except for civility they bestirred themselves like so many american hotel clerks the spectator was aware of an unobtrusive yet invincible inertia at which the skipper of a trading dandy might have torn his hair  yet the work was accomplished by dusk when his majesty withdrew the town was founded and complete a new and ruder amphion having called it from nothing with three cracks of a rifle and the next morning the same conjurer obliged us with a further miracle a mystic rampart fencing us so that the path which ran by our doors became suddenly impassable the inhabitants who had business across the isle must fetch a wide circuit and we sat in the midst in a transparent privacy seeing seen but unapproachable like bees in a glass hive the outward and visible sign of this glamour was no more than a few ragged cocoleaf garlands round the stems of the outlying palms but its significance reposed on the tremendous sanction of the tapu and the guns of tembinok  we made our first meal that night in the improvised city where we were to stay two months and whichso soon as we had done with itwas to vanish in a day as it appeared its elements returning whence they came the tapu raised the traffic on the path resumed the sun and the moon peering in vain between the palmtrees for the bygone work the wind blowing over an empty site yet the place which is now only an episode in some memories seemed to have been built and to be destined to endure for years it was a busy hamlet one of the maniaps we made our diningroom one the kitchen the houses we reserved for sleeping they were on the admirable apemama plan out and away the best house in the south seas standing some three feet above the ground on posts the sides of woven flaps which can be raised to admit light and air or lowered to shut out the wind and the rain airy healthy clean and watertight we had a hen of a remarkable kind almost unique in my experience being a hen that occasionally laid eggs not far off mrs stevenson tended a garden of salad and shalots the salad was devoured by the henwhich was her bane the shalots were served out a leaf at a time and welcomed and relished like peaches toddy and green cocoanuts were brought us daily we once had a present of fish from the king and once of a turtle sometimes we shot socalled plover along on the shore sometimes wild chicken in the bush the rest of our diet was from tins  our occupations were very various while some of the party would be away sketching mr osbourne and i hammered away at a novel we read gibbon and carlyle aloud we blew on flageolets we strummed on guitars we took photographs by the light of the sun the moon and flashpowder sometimes we played cards pothunting engaged a part of our leisure i have myself passed afternoons in the exciting but innocuous pursuit of winged animals with a revolver and it was fortunate there were better shots of the party and fortunate the king could lend us a more suitable weapon in the form of an excellent fowlingpiece or our spare diet had been sparer still  night was the time to see our city after the moon was up after the lamps were lighted and so long as the fire sparkled in the cookhouse we suffered from a plague of flies and mosquitoes comparable to that of egypt our dinnertable lent like all our furniture by the king must be enclosed in a tent of netting our citadel and refuge and this became all luminous and bulged and beaconed under the eaves like the globe of some monstrous lamp under the margin of its shade our cabins the sides being propped at a variety of inclinations spelled out strange angular patterns of brightness in his roofed and open kitchen ah fu was to be seen by lamp and firelight dabbling among pots over all there fell in the season an extraordinary splendour of mellow moonshine the sand sparkled as with the dust of diamonds the stars had vanished at intervals a dusky nightbird slow and low flying passed in the colonnade of the tree stems and uttered a hoarse croaking cry     chapter iii  the king of apemama the palace of many women   the palace or rather the ground which it includes is several acres in extent a terrace encloses it toward the lagoon on the side of the land a palisade with several gates these are scarce intended for defence a man if he were strong might easily pluck down the palisade he need not be specially active to leap from the beach upon the terrace there is no parade of guards soldiers or weapons the armoury is under lock and key and the only sentinels are certain inconspicuous old women lurking day and night before the gates by day these crones were often engaged in boiling syrup or the like household occupation by night they lay ambushed in the shadow or crouched along the palisade filling the office of eunuchs to this harem sole guards upon a tyrant life  female wardens made a fit outpost for this palace of many women of the number of the kings wives i have no guess and but a loose idea of their function he himself displayed embarrassment when they were referred to as his wives called them himself my pamily and explained they were his cutcheonscousins we distinguished four of the crowd the kings mother his sister a grave trenchant woman with much of her brothers intelligence the queen proper to whom and to whom alone my wife was formally presented and the favourite of the hour a pretty graceful girl who sat with the king daily and once when he shed tears consoled him with caresses i am assured that even with her his relations are platonic in the background figured a multitude of ladies the lean the plump and the elephantine some in sacque frocks some in the hairbreadth ridi highborn and low slave and mistress from the queen to the scullion from the favourite to the scraggy sentries at the palisade not all of these of course are of my pamilymany are mere attendants yet a surprising number shared the responsibility of the kings trust these were keybearers treasurers wardens of the armoury the napery and the stores each knew and did her part to admiration should anything be requireda particular gun perhaps or a particular bolt of stuffthe right queen was summoned she came bringing the right chest opened it in the kings presence and displayed her charge in perfect preservationthe gun cleaned and oiled the goods duly folded without delay or haste and with the minimum of speech the whole great establishment turned on wheels like a machine nowhere have i seen order more complete and pervasive and yet i was always reminded of norse tales of trolls and ogres who kept their hearts buried in the ground for the mere safety and must confide the secret to their wives for these weapons are the life of tembinok he does not aim at popularity but drives and braves his subjects with a simplicity of domination which it is impossible not to admire hard not to sympathise with should one out of so many prove faithless should the armoury be secretly unlocked should the crones have dozed by the palisade and the weapons find their way unseen into the village revolution would be nearly certain death the most probable result and the spirit of the tyrant of apemama flit to rejoin his predecessors of mariki and tapituea yet those whom he so trusts are all women and all rivals  there is indeed a ministry and staff of males cook steward carpenter and supercargoes the hierarchy of a schooner the spies his majestys daily papers as we called them come every morning to report and go again the cook and steward are concerned with the table only the supercargoes whose business it is to keep tally of the copra at three pounds a month and a percentage are rarely in the palace and two at least are in the other islands the carpenter indeed shrewd and jolly old rubamquery reubenpromoted on my last visit to the greater dignity of governor is daily present altering extending embellishing pursuing the endless series of the kings inventions and his majesty will sometimes pass an afternoon watching and talking with rubam at his work but the males are still outsiders none seems to be armed none is intrusted with a key by dusk they are all usually departed from the palace and the weight of the monarchy and of the monarchs life reposes unshared on the women  here is a household unlike indeed to one of ours more unlike still to the oriental harem that of an elderly childless man his days menaced dwelling alone amid a bevy of women of all ages ranks and relationshipsthe mother the sister the cousin the legitimate wife the concubine the favourite the eldest born and she of yesterday he in their midst the only master the only male the sole dispenser of honours clothes and luxuries the sole mark of multitudinous ambitions and desires i doubt if you could find a man in europe so bold as to attempt this piece of tact and government and seemingly tembinok himself had trouble in the beginning i hear of him shooting at a wife for some levity on board a schooner another on some more serious offence he slew outright he exposed her body in an open box and to make the warning more memorable suffered it to putrefy before the palace gate doubtless his growing years have come to his assistance for upon so large a scale it is more easy to play the father than the husband and today at least to the eye of a stranger all seems to go smoothly and the wives to be proud of their trust proud of their rank and proud of their cunning lord  i conceived they made rather a hero of the man a popular master in a girls school might perhaps offer a figure of his preponderating station but then the master does not eat sleep live and wash his dirty linen in the midst of his admirers he escapes he has a room of his own he leads a private life if he had nothing else he has the holidays and the more unhappy tembinok is always on the stage and on the stretch  in all my coming and going i never heard him speak harshly or express the least displeasure an extreme rather heavy benignitythe benignity of one sure to be obeyedmarked his demeanour so that i was at times reminded of samuel richardson in his circle of admiring women the wives spoke up and seemed to volunteer opinions like our wives at homeor say like doting but respectable aunts altogether i conclude that he rules his seraglio much more by art than terror and those who give a different account and who have none of them enjoyed my opportunities of observation perhaps failed to distinguish between degrees of rank between my pamily and the hangerson laundresses and prostitutes  a notable feature is the evening game of cards when lamps are set forth upon the terrace and i and my pamily play for tobacco by the hour it is highly characteristic of tembinok that he must invent a game for himself highly characteristic of his worshipping household that they should swear by the absurd invention it is founded on poker played with the honours out of many packs and inconceivably dreary but i have a passion for all games studied it and am supposed to be the only white who ever fairly grasped its principle a fact for which the wives with whom i was not otherwise popular admired me with acclamation it was impossible to be deceived this was a genuine feeling they were proud of their private game had been cut to the quick by the want of interest shown in it by others and expanded under the flattery of my attention tembinok puts up a double stake and receives in return two hands to choose from a shallow artifice which the wives in all these years have not yet fathomed he himself when talking with me privately made not the least secret that he was secure of winning and it was thus he explained his recent liberality on board the equator he let the wives buy their own tobacco which pleased them at the moment he won it back at cards which made him once more and without fresh expense that which he ought to bethe sole fount of all indulgences and he summed the matter up in that phrase with which he almost always concludes any account of his policy mo betta  the palace compound is laid with broken coral excruciating to the eyes and the bare feet but exquisitely raked and weeded a score or more of buildings lie in a sort of street along the palisade and scattered on the margin of the terrace dwellinghouses for the wives and the attendants storehouses for the kings curios and treasures spacious maniaps for feast or council some on pillars of wood some on piers of masonry one was still in hand a new invention the kings latest born a european framehouse built for coolness inside a lofty maniap its roof planked like a ships deck to be a raised shady and yet private promenade it was here the king spent hours with rubam here i would sometimes join them the place had a most singular appearance and i must say i was greatly taken with the fancy and joined with relish in the counsels of the architects  suppose we had business with his majesty by day we strolled over the sand and by the dwarfish palms exchanged a konamaori with the crone on duty and entered the compound the wide sheet of coral glared before us deserted all having stowed themselves in dark canvas from the excess of room i have gone to and fro in that labyrinth of a place seeking the king and the only breathing creature i could find was when i peered under the eaves of a maniap and saw the brawny body of one of the wives stretched on the floor a naked amazon plunged in noiseless slumber if it were still the hour of the morning papers the quest would be more easy the halfdozen obsequious sly dogs squatting on the ground outside a house crammed as far as possible in its narrow shadow and turning to the king a row of leering faces tembinok would be within the flaps of the cabin raised the trade blowing through hearing their report like journalists nearer home when the days news were scanty these would make the more of it in words and i have known one to fill up a barren morning with an imaginary conversation of two dogs sometimes the king deigns to laugh sometimes to question or jest with them his voice sounding shrilly from the cabin by his side he may have the heirapparent paul his nephew and adopted son six years old stark naked and a model of young human beauty and there will always be the favourite and perhaps two other wives awake four more lying supine under mats and whelmed in slumber or perhaps we came later fell on a more private hour and found tembinok retired in the house with the favourite an earthenware spittoon a leaden inkpot and a commercial ledger in the last lying on his belly he writes from day to day the uneventful history of his reign and when thus employed he betrayed a touch of fretfulness on interruption with which i was well able to sympathise the royal annalist once read me a page or so translating as he went but the passage being genealogical and the author boggling extremely in his version i own i have been sometimes better entertained nor does he confine himself to prose but touches the lyre too in his leisure moments and passes for the chief bard of his kingdom as he is its sole public character leading architect and only merchant his competence however does not reach to music and his verses when they are ready are taught to a professional musician who sets them and instructs the chorus asked what his songs were about tembinok replied sweethearts and trees and the sea not all the same true all the same lie for a condensed view of lyrical poetry except that he seems to have forgot the stars and flowers this would be hard to mend these multifarious occupations bespeak in a native and an absolute prince unusual activity of mind  the palace court at noon is a spot to be remembered with awe the visitor scrambling there on the loose stones through a splendid nightmare of light and heat but the sweep of the wind delivers it from flies and mosquitoes and with the set of sun it became heavenly i remember it best on moonless nights the air was like a bath of milk countless shining stars were overhead the lagoon paved with them herds of wives squatted by companies on the gravel softly chatting tembinok would doff his jacket and sit bare and silent perhaps meditating songs the favourite usually by him silent also meanwhile in the midst of the court the palace lanterns were being lit and marshalled in rank upon the groundsix or eight square yards of them a sight that gave one strange ideas of the number of my pamily such a sight as may be seen about dusk in a corner of some great terminus at home presently these fared off into all corners of the precinct lighting the last labours of the day lighting one after another to their rest that prodigious company of women a few lingered in the middle of the court for the cardparty and saw the honours shuffled and dealt and tembinok deliberating between his two hands and the queens losing their tobacco then these also were scattered and extinguished and their place was taken by a great bonfire the nightlight of the palace when this was no more smaller fires burned likewise at the gates these were tended by the crones unseen unsleepingnot always unheard should any approach in the dark hours a guarded alert made the circuit of the palisade each sentry signalled her neighbour with a stone the rattle of falling pebbles passed and died away and the wardens of tembinok crouched in their places silent as before     chapter iv  the king of apemama equator town and the palace   five persons were detailed to wait upon us uncle parker who brought us toddy and green nuts was an elderly almost an old man with the spirits the industry and the morals of a boy of ten his face was ancient droll and diabolical the skin stretched over taut sinews like a sail on the guiderope and he smiled with every muscle of his head his nuts must be counted every day or he would deceive us in the tale they must be daily examined or some would prove to be unhusked nothing but the kings name and scarcely that would hold him to his duty after his toils were over he was given a pipe matches and tobacco and sat on the floor in the maniap to smoke he would not seem to move from his position and yet every day when the things fell to be returned the plug had disappeared he had found the means to conceal it in the roof whence he could radiantly produce it on the morrow although this piece of legerdemain was performed regularly before three or four pairs of eyes we could never catch him in the fact although we searched after he was gone we could never find the tobacco such were the diversions of uncle parker a man nearing sixty but he was punished according unto his deeds mrs stevenson took a fancy to paint him and the sufferings of the sitter were beyond description  three lasses came from the palace to do our washing and racket with ah fu they were of the lowest class hangerson kept for the convenience of merchant skippers probably lowborn perhaps outislanders with little refinement whether of manner or appearance but likely and jolly enough wenches in their way we called one guttersnipe for you may find her image in the slums of any city the same lean darkeyed eager vulgar face the same sudden hoarse guffaws the same forward and yet anxious manner as with a tail of an eye on the policeman only the policeman here was a live king and his truncheon a rifle i doubt if you could find anywhere out of the islands or often there the parallel of fatty a mountain of a girl who must have weighed near as many stones as she counted summers could have given a good account of a lifeguardsman had the face of a baby and applied her vast mechanical forces almost exclusively to play but they were all three of the same merry spirit our washing was conducted in a game of romps and they fled and pursued and splashed and pelted and rolled each other in the sand and kept up a continuous noise of cries and laughter like holiday children indeed and however strange their own function in that austere establishment were they not escaped for the day from the largest and strictest ladies school in the south seas  our fifth attendant was no less a person than the royal cook he was strikingly handsome both in face and body lazy as a slave and insolent as a butchers boy he slept and smoked on our premises in various graceful attitudes but so far from helping ah fu he was not at the pains to watch him it may be said of him that he came to learn and remained to teach and his lessons were at times difficult to stomach for example he was sent to fill a bucket from the well about halfway he found my wife watering her onions changed buckets with her and leaving her the empty returned to the kitchen with the full on another occasion he was given a dish of dumplings for the king was told they must be eaten hot and that he should carry them as fast as possible the wretch set oft at the rate of about a mile in the hour head in air toes turned out my patience after a month of trial failed me at the sight i pursued caught him by his two big shoulders and thrusting him before me ran with him down the hill over the sands and through the applauding village to the speak house where the king was then holding a powwow he had the impudence to pretend he was internally injured by my violence and to profess serious apprehensions for his life  all this we endured for the ways of tembinok are summary and i was not yet ripe to take a hand in the mans death but in the meanwhile here was my unfortunate china boy slaving for the pair and presently he fell sick i was now in the position of cimondain lantenac and indeed all the characters in quatrevingttreize to continue to spare the guilty i must sacrifice the innocent i took the usual course and tried to save both with the usual consequence of failure well rehearsed i went down to the palace found the king alone and obliged him with a vast amount of rigmarole the cook was too old to learn i feared he was not making progress how if we had a boy insteadboys were more teachable it was all in vain the king pierced through my disguises to the root of the fact saw that the cook had desperately misbehaved and sat a while glooming i think he tavvy too much he said at last with grim concision and immediately turned the talk to other subjects the same day another high officer the steward appeared in the cooks place and i am bound to say proved civil and industrious  as soon as i left it seems the king called for a winchester and strolled outside the palisade awaiting the defaulter that day tembinok wore the womans frock as like as not his makeup was completed by a pith helmet and blue spectacles conceive the glaring stretch of sandhills the dwarf palms with their noonday shadows the line of the palisade the crone sentries each by a small clear fire cooking syrup on their postsand this chimæra waiting with his deadly engine to him enter at last the cook strolling down the sandhill from equator town listless vain and graceful with no thought of alarm as soon as he was well within range the travestied monarch fired the six shots over his head at his feet and on either hand of him the second apemama warning startling in itself fatal in significance for the next time his majesty will aim to hit i am told the king is a crack shot that when he aims to kill the grave may be got ready and when he aims misses by so near a margin that the culprit tastes six times the bitterness of death the effect upon the cook i had an opportunity of seeing for myself my wife and i were returning from the seaside of the island when we spied one coming to meet us at a very quick disordered pace between a walk and a run as we drew nearer we saw it was the cook beside himself with some emotion his usual warm mulatto colour declined into a bluish pallor he passed us without word or gesture staring on us with the face of a satan and plunged on across the wood for the unpeopled quarter of the island and the long desert beach where he might rage to and fro unseen and froth out the vials of his wrath fear and humiliation doubtless in the curses that he there uttered to the bursting surf and the tropic birds the name of the kaupoithe rich manwas frequently repeated i had made him the laughingstock of the village in the affair of the kings dumplings i had brought him by my machinations into disgrace and the immediate jeopardy of his days last and perhaps bitterest he had found me there by the way to spy upon him in the hour of his disorder  time passed and we saw no more of him the season of the full moon came round when a man thinks shame to lie sleeping and i continued until lateperhaps till twelve or one in the morningto walk on the bright sand and in the tossing shadow of the palms i played as i wandered on a flageolet which occupied much of my attention the fans overhead rattled in the wind with a metallic chatter and a bare foot falls at any rate almost noiseless on that shifting soil yet when i got back to equator town where all the lights were out and my wife who was still awake and had been looking forth asked me who it was that followed me i thought she spoke in jest not at all she said i saw him twice as you passed walking close at your heels he only left you at the corner of the maniap he must be still behind the cookhouse thither i ranlike a fool without any weaponand came face to face with the cook he was within my tapuline which was death in itself he could have no business there at such an hour but either to steal or to kill guilt made him timorous and he turned and fled before me in the night in silence as he went i kicked him in that place where honour lies and he gave tongue faintly like an injured mouse at the moment i dare say he supposed it was a deadly instrument that touched him  what had the man been after i have found my music better qualified to scatter than to collect an audience amateur as i was i could not suppose him interested in my reading of the carnival of venice or that he would deny himself his natural rest to follow my variations on the ploughboy and whatever his design it was impossible i should suffer him to prowl by night among the houses a word to the king and the man were not his case being far beyond pardon but it is one thing to kill a man yourself quite another to bear tales behind his back and have him shot by a third party and i determined to deal with the fellow in some method of my own i told ah fu the story and bade him fetch me the cook whenever he should find him i had supposed this would be a matter of difficulty and far from that he came of his own accord an act really of desperation since his life hung by my silence and the best he could hope was to be forgotten yet he came with an assured countenance volunteered no apology or explanation complained of injuries received and pretended he was unable to sit down i suppose i am the weakest man god made i had kicked him in the least vulnerable part of his big carcase my foot was bare and i had not even hurt my foot ah fu could not control his merriment on my side knowing what must be the nature of his apprehensions i found in so much impudence a kind of gallantry and secretly admired the man i told him i should say nothing of his nights adventure to the king that i should still allow him when he had an errand to come within my tapuline by day but if ever i found him there after the set of the sun i would shoot him on the spot and to the proof showed him a revolver he must have been incredibly relieved but he showed no sign of it took himself off with his usual dandy nonchalance and was scarce seen by us again  these five then with the substitution of the steward for the cook came and went and were our only visitors the circle of the tapu held at armslength the inhabitants of the village as for my pamily they dwelt like nuns in their enclosure only once have i met one of them abroad and she was the kings sister and the place in which i found her the island infirmary was very likely privileged there remains only the king to be accounted for he would come strolling over always alone a little before a mealtime take a chair and talk and eat with us like an old family friend gilbertine etiquette appears defective on the point of leavetaking it may be remembered we had trouble in the matter with karaiti and there was something childish and disconcerting in tembinoks abrupt i want go home now accompanied by a kind of ducking rise and followed by an unadorned retreat it was the only blot upon his manners which were otherwise plain decent sensible and dignified he never stayed long nor drank much and copied our behaviour where he perceived it to differ from his own very early in the day for instance he ceased eating with his knife it was plain he was determined in all things to wring profit from our visit and chiefly upon etiquette the quality of his white visitors puzzled and concerned him he would bring up name after name and ask if its bearer were a big chiep or even a chiep at allwhich as some were my excellent good friends and none were actually born in the purple became at times embarrassing he was struck to learn that our classes were distinguishable by their speech and that certain words for instance were tapu on the quarterdeck of a manofwar and he begged in consequence that we should watch and correct him on the point we were able to assure him that he was beyond correction his vocabulary is apt and ample to an extraordinary degree god knows where he collected it but by some instinct or some accident he has avoided all profane or gross expressions obliged stabbed gnaw lodge power company slender smooth and wonderful are a few of the unexpected words that enrich his dialect perhaps what pleased him most was to hear about saluting the quarterdeck of a manofwar in his gratitude for this hint he became fulsome schooner capn no tell me he cried i think no tavvy you tavvy too much tavvy teama tavvy manawa i think you tavvy everything yet he gravelled me often enough with his perpetual questions and the false mr barlow stood frequently exposed before the royal sandford i remember once in particular we were showing the magiclantern a slide of windsor castle was put in and i told him there was the outch of victoreea how many pathom he high he asked and i was dumb before him it was the builder the indefatigable architect of palaces that spoke collector though he was he did not collect useless information and all his questions had a purpose after etiquette government law the police money and medicine were his chief intereststhings vitally important to himself as a king and the father of his people it was my part not only to supply new information but to correct the old my patha he tell me or white man he tell me would be his constant beginning you think he lie sometimes i thought he did tembinok once brought me a difficulty of this kind which i was long of comprehending a schooner captain had told him of captain cook the king was much interested in the story and turned for more informationnot to mr stephens dictionary not to the britannica but to the bible in the gilbert island version which consists chiefly of the new testament and the psalms here he sought long and earnestly paul he found and festus and alexander the coppersmith no word of cook the inference was obvious the explorer was a myth so hard it is even for a man of great natural parts like tembinok to grasp the ideas of a new society and culture     chapter v  king and commons   we saw but little of the commons of the isle at first we met them at the well where they washed their linen and we drew water for the table the combination was distasteful and having a tyrant at command we applied to the king and had the place enclosed in our tapu it was one of the few favours which tembinok visibly boggled about granting and it may be conceived how little popular it made the strangers many villagers passed us daily going afield but they fetched a wide circuit round our tapu and seemed to avert their looks at times we went ourselves into the villagea strange place dutch by its canals oriental by the height and steepness of the roofs which looked at dusk like temples but we were rarely called into a house no welcome no friendship was offered us and of home life we had but the one view the waking of a corpse a frigid painful scene the widow holding on her lap the cold bluish body of her husband and now partaking of the refreshments which made the round of the company now weeping and kissing the pale mouth i fear you feel this affliction deeply said the scottish minister eh sir and that i do replied the widow ive been greetin a nicht an noo im just gaun to sup this bit parritch and then ill begin an greet again in our walks abroad i have always supposed the islanders avoided us perhaps from distaste perhaps by order and those whom we met we took generally by surprise the surface of the isle is diversified with palm groves thickets and romantic dingles four feet deep relics of old taro plantations and it is thus possible to stumble unawares on folk resting or hiding from their work about pistolshot from our township there lay a pond in the bottom of a jungle here the maids of the isle came to bathe and were several times alarmed by our intrusion not for them are the bright cold rivers of tahiti or upolu not for them to splash and laugh in the hour of the dusk with a villageful of gay companions but to steal here solitary to crouch in a place like a cowwallow and wash if that can be called washing in lukewarm mud brown as their own skins other but still rare encounters occur to my memory i was several times arrested by a tender sound in the bush of voices talking soft as flutes and with quiet intonations hope told a flattering tale i put aside the leaves and behold in place of the expected dryads a pair of all too solid ladies squatting over a clay pipe in the ungraceful ridi the beauty of the voice and the eye was all that remained to these vast dames but that of the voice was exquisite indeed it is strange i should have never heard a more winning sound of speech yet the dialect should be one remarkable for violent ugly and outlandish vocables so that tembinok himself declared it made him weary and professed to find repose in talking english  the state of this folk of whom i saw so little i can merely guess at the king himself explains the situation with some art no i no pay them he once said i give them tobacco they work for me all the same brothers it is true there was a brother once in arden but we prefer the shorter word they bear every servile marklevity like a childs incurable idleness incurious content the insolence of the cook was a trait of his own not so his levity which he shared with the innocent uncle parker with equal unconcern both gambolled under the shadow of the gallows and took liberties with death that might have surprised a careless student of mans nature i wrote of parker that he behaved like a boy of ten what was he else being a slave of sixty he had passed all his years in school fed clad thought for commanded and had grown familiar and coquetted with the fear of punishment by terror you may drive men long but not far here in apemama they work at the constant and the instant peril of their lives and are plunged in a kind of lethargy of laziness it is common to see one go afield in his stiff mat ungirt so that he walks elbowsin like a trussed fowl and whatsoever his right hand findeth to do the other must be off duty holding on his clothes it is common to see two men carrying between them on a pole a single bucket of water to make two bites of a cherry is good enough to make two burthens of a soldiers kit for a distance of perhaps half a furlong passes measure woman being the less childish animal is less relaxed by servile conditions even in the kings absence even when they were alone i have seen apemama women work with constancy but the outside to be hoped for in a man is that he may attack his task in little languid fits and lounge betweenwhiles so i have seen a painter with his pipe going and a friend by the studio fireside you might suppose the race to lack civility even vitality until you saw them in the dance night after night and sometimes day after day they rolled out their choruses in the great speak housesolemn andantes and adagios led by the clapped hand and delivered with an energy that shook the roof the time was not so slow though it was slow for the islands but i have chosen rather to indicate the effect upon the hearer their music had a churchlike character from near at hand and seemed to european ears more regular than the run of island music twice i have heard a discord regularly solved from farther off heard at equator town for instance the measures rose and fell and crepitated like the barking of hounds in a distant kennel  the slaves are certainly not overworkedchildren of ten do more without fatigueand the apemama labourers have holidays when the singing begins early in the afternoon the diet is hard copra and a sweetmeat of pounded pandanus are the only dishes i observed outside the palace but there seems no defect in quantity and the king shares with them his turtles three came in a boat from kuria during our stay one was kept for the palace one sent to us one presented to the village it is the habit of the islanders to cook the turtle in its carapace we had been promised the shells and we asked a tapu on this foolish practice the face of tembinok darkened and he answered nothing hesitation in the question of the well i could understand for water is scarce on a low island that he should refuse to interfere upon a point of cookery was more than i had dreamed of and i gathered rightly or wrongly that he was scrupulous of touching in the least degree the private life and habits of his slaves so that even here in full despotism public opinion has weight even here in the midst of slavery freedom has a corner  orderly sober and innocent life flows in the isle from day to day as in a model plantation under a model planter it is impossible to doubt the beneficence of that stern rule a curious politeness a soft and gracious manner something effeminate and courtly distinguishes the islanders of apemama it is talked of by all the traders it was felt even by residents so little beloved as ourselves and noticeable even in the cook and even in that scoundrels hours of insolence the king with his manly and plain bearing stood out alone you might say he was the only gilbert islander in apemama violence so common in butaritari seems unknown so are theft and drunkenness i am assured the experiment has been made of leaving sovereigns on the beach before the village they lay there untouched in all our time on the island i was but once asked for drink this was by a mighty plausible fellow wearing european clothes and speaking excellent englishtamaiti his name or as the whites have now corrupted it tom white one of the kings supercargoes at three pounds a month and a percentage a medical man besides and in his private hours a wizard he found me one day in the outskirts of the village in a secluded place hot and private where the taropits are deep and the plants high here he buttonholed me and looking about him like a conspirator inquired if i had gin  i told him i had he remarked that gin was forbidden lauded the prohibition a while and then went on to explain that he was a doctor or dogstar as he pronounced the word that gin was necessary to him for his medical infusions that he was quite out of it and that he would be obliged to me for some in a bottle i told him i had passed the king my word on landing but since his case was so exceptional i would go down to the palace at once and had no doubt that tembinok would set me free tom white was immediately overwhelmed with embarrassment and terror besought me in the most moving terms not to betray him and fled my neighbourhood he had none of the cooks valour it was weeks before he dared to meet my eye and then only by the order of the king and on particular business  the more i viewed and admired this triumph of firm rule the more i was haunted and troubled by a problem the problem perhaps of tomorrow for ourselves here was a people protected from all serious misfortune relieved of all serious anxieties and deprived of what we call our liberty did they like it and what was their sentiment towards the ruler the first question i could not of course ask nor perhaps the natives answer even the second was delicate yet at last and under charming and strange circumstances i found my opportunity to put it and a man to reply it was near the full of the moon with a delicious breeze the isle was bright as dayto sleep would have been sacrilege and i walked in the bush playing my pipe it must have been the sound of what i am pleased to call my music that attracted in my direction another wanderer of the night this was a young man attired in a fine mat and with a garland on his hair for he was new come from dancing and singing in the public hall and his body his face and his eyes were all of an enchanting beauty every here and there in the gilberts youth are to be found of this absurd perfection i have seen five of us pass half an hour in admiration of a boy at mariki and te kop my friend in the fine mat and garland i had already several times remarked and long ago set down as the loveliest animal in apemama the philtre of admiration must be very strong or these natives specially susceptible to its effects for i have scarce ever admired a person in the islands but what he has sought my particular acquaintance so it was with te kop he led me to the ocean side and for an hour or two we sat smoking and talking on the resplendent sand and under the ineffable brightness of the moon my friend showed himself very sensible of the beauty and amenity of the hour good night good wind he kept exclaiming and as he said the words he seemed to hug myself i had long before invented such reiterated expressions of delight for a character felipe in the story of olalla intended to be partly bestial but there was nothing bestial in te kop only a childish pleasure in the moment he was no less pleased with his companion or was good enough to say so honoured me before he left by calling me te kop apostrophised me as my name with an intonation exquisitely tender laying his hand at the same time swiftly on my knee and after we had risen and our paths began to separate in the bush twice cried to me with a sort of gentle ecstasy i like you too much from the beginning he had made no secret of his terror of the king would not sit down or speak above a whisper till he had put the whole breadth of the isle between himself and his monarch then harmlessly asleep and even there even within a stonecast of the outer sea our talk covered by the sound of the surf and the rattle of the wind among the palms continued to speak guardedly softening his silver voice which rang loud enough in the chorus and looking about him like a man in fear of spies the strange thing is that i should have beheld him no more in any other island in the whole south seas if i had advanced half as far with any native he would have been at my door next morning bringing and expecting gifts but te kop vanished in the bush for ever my house of course was unapproachable but he knew where to find me on the open beach where i went daily i was the kaupoi the rich man my tobacco and trade were known to be endless he was sure of a present i am at a loss how to explain his behaviour unless it be supposed that he recalled with terror and regret a passage in our interview here it is  the king he good man i asked  suppose he like you he good man replied te kop no like no good  that is one way of putting it of course te kop himself was probably no favourite for he scarce appealed to my judgment as a type of industry and there must be many others whom the king to adhere to the formula does not like do these unfortunates like the king or is not rather the repulsion mutual and the conscientious tembinok like the conscientious braxfield before him and many other conscientious rulers and judges before either surrounded by a considerable body of grumbletonians take the cook for instance when he passed us by blue with rage and terror he was very wroth with me i think by all the old principles of human nature he was not very well pleased with his sovereign it was the rich man he sought to waylay i think it must have been by the turn of a hair that it was not the king he waylaid instead and the king gives or seems to give plenty of opportunities day and night he goes abroad alone whether armed or not i can but guess and the taropatches where his business must so often carry him seem designed for assassination the case of the cook was heavy indeed to my conscience i did not like to kill my enemy at secondhand but had i a right to conceal from the king who had trusted me the dangerous secret character of his attendant and suppose the king should fall what would be the fate of the kings friends it was our opinion at the time that we should pay dear for the closing of the well that our breath was in the kings nostrils that if the king should by any chance be bludgeoned in a taropatch the philosophical and musical inhabitants of equator town might lay aside their pleasant instruments and betake themselves to what defence they had with a very dim prospect of success these speculations were forced upon us by an incident which i am ashamed to betray the schooner hl haseltine since capsized at sea with the loss of eleven lives put in to apemama in a good hour for us who had near exhausted our supplies the king after his habit spent day after day on board the gin proved unhappily to his taste he brought a store of it ashore with him and for some time the sole tyrant of the isle was halfseasover he was not drunkthe man is not a drunkard he has always stores of liquor at hand which he uses with moderationbut he was muzzy dull and confused he came one day to lunch with us and while the cloth was being laid fell asleep in his chair his confusion when he awoke and found he had been detected was equalled by our uneasiness when he was gone we sat and spoke of his peril which we thought to be in some degree our own of how easily the man might be surprised in such a state by grumbletonians of the strange scenes that would followthe royal treasures and stores at the mercy of the rabble the palace overrun the garrison of women turned adrift and as we talked we were startled by a gunshot and a sudden barbaric outcry i believe we all changed colour but it was only the king firing at a dog and the chorus striking up in the speak house a day or two later i learned the king was very sick went down diagnosed the case and took at once the highest medical degree by the exhibition of bicarbonate of soda within the hour richard was himself again and i found him at the unfinished house enjoying the double pleasure of directing rubam and making a dinner off cocoanut dumplings and all eagerness to have the formula of this new sort of painkillerfor painkiller in the islands is the generic name of medicine so ended the kings modest spree and our anxiety  on the face of things i ought to say loyalty appeared unshaken when the schooner at last returned for us after much experience of baffling winds she brought a rumour that tebureimoa had declared war on apemama tembinok became a new man his face radiant his attitude as i saw him preside over a council of chiefs in one of the palace maniaps eager as a boys his voice sounding abroad shrill and jubilant over half the compound war is what he wants and here was his chance the english captain when he flung his arms in the lagoon had forbidden him except in one case all military adventures in the future here was the case arrived all morning the council sat men were drilled arms were bought the sound of firing disturbed the afternoon the king devised and communicated to me his plan of campaign which was highly elaborate and ingenious but perhaps a trifle finespun for the rough and random vicissitudes of war and in all this bustle the temper of the people appeared excellent an unwonted animation in every face and even uncle parker burning with military zeal  of course it was a false alarm tebureimoa had other fish to fry the ambassador who accompanied us on our return to butaritari found him retired to a small island on the reef in a huff with the old men a tiff with the traders and more fear of insurrection at home than appetite for wars abroad the plenipotentiary had been placed under my protection and we solemnly saluted when we met he proved an excellent fisherman and caught bonito over the ships side he pulled a good oar and made himself useful for a whole fiery afternoon towing the becalmed equator off mariki he went to his post and did no good he returned home again having done no harm o si sic omnes     chapter vi  the king of apemama devilwork   the ocean beach of apemama was our daily resort the coast is broken by shallow bays the reef is detached elevated and includes a lagoon about kneedeep the unrestful spendingbasin of the surf the beach is now of fine sand now of broken coral the trend of the coast being convex scarce a quarter of a mile of it is to be seen at once the land being so low the horizon appears within a stonecast and the narrow prospect enhances the sense of privacy man avoids the placeeven his footprints are uncommon but a great number of birds hover and pipe there fishing and leave crooked tracks upon the sand apart from these the only sound and i was going to say the only society is that of the breakers on the reef  on each projection of the coast the bank of coral clinkers immediately above the beach has been levelled and a pillar built perhaps breasthigh these are not sepulchral all the dead being buried on the inhabited side of the island close to mens houses and what is worse to their wells i was told they were to protect the isle against inroads from the seadivine or diabolical martellos probably sacred to taburik god of thunder  the bay immediately opposite equator town which we called fu bay in honour of our cook was thus fortified on either horn it was well sheltered by the reef the enclosed water clear and tranquil the enclosing beach curved like a horseshoe and both steep and broad the path debouched about the midst of the reentrant angle the woods stopping some distance inland in front between the fringe of the wood and the crown of the beach there had been designed a regular figure like the court for some new variety of tennis with borders of round stones imbedded and pointed at the angles with low posts likewise of stone this was the kings pray place when he prayed what he prayed for and to whom he addressed his supplications i could never learn the ground was tapu  in the angle by the mouth of the path stood a deserted maniap near by there had been a house before our coming which was now transported and figured for the moment in equator town it had been and it would be again when we departed the residence of the guardian and wizard of the spottamaiti here in this lone place within sound of the sea he had his dwelling and uncanny duties i cannot call to mind another case of a man living on the ocean side of any open atoll and tamaiti must have had strong nerves the greater confidence in his own spells or what i believe to be the truth an enviable scepticism whether tamaiti had any guardianship of the pray place i never heard but his own particular chapel stood farther back in the fringe of the wood it was a tree of respectable growth around it there was drawn a circle of stones like those that enclosed the pray place in front facing towards the sea a stone of a much greater size and somewhat hollowed like a piscina stood close against the trunk in front of that again a conical pile of gravel in the hollow of what i have called the piscina though it proved to be a magic seat lay an offering of green cocoanuts and when you looked up you found the boughs of the tree to be laden with strange fruit palmbranches elaborately plaited and beautiful models of canoes finished and rigged to the least detail the whole had the appearance of a midsummer and sylvan christmastree al fresco yet we were already well enough acquainted in the gilberts to recognise it at the first sight for a piece of wizardry or as they say in the group of devilwork  the plaited palms were what we recognised we had seen them before on apaiang the most christianised of all these islands where excellent mr bingham lived and laboured and has left golden memories whence all the education in the northern gilberts traces its descent and where we were boarded by little native sundayschool misses in clean frocks with demure faces and singing hymns as to the manner born  our experience of devilwork at apaiang had been as followsit chanced we were benighted at the house of captain tierney my wife and i lodged with a chinaman some half a mile away and thither captain reid and a native boy escorted us by torchlight on the way the torch went out and we took shelter in a small and lonely christian chapel to rekindle it stuck in the rafters of the chapel was a branch of knotted palm what is that i asked o thats devilwork said the captain and what is devilwork i inquired if you like ill show you some when we get to johnnies he replied johnnies was a quaint little house upon the crest of the beach raised some three feet on posts approached by stairs part walled part trellised trophies of advertisementphotographs were hung up within for decoration there was a table and a recessbed in which mrs stevenson slept while i camped on the matted floor with johnnie mrs johnnie her sister and the devils own regiment of cockroaches hither was summoned an old witch who looked the part to horror the lamp was set on the floor the crone squatted on the threshold a green palmbranch in her hand the light striking full on her aged features and picking out behind her from the black night timorous faces of spectators our sorceress began with a chanted incantation it was in the old tongue for which i had no interpreter but ever and again there ran along the crowd outside that laugh which every traveller in the islands learns so soon to recognisethe laugh of terror doubtless these halfchristian folk were shocked these halfheathen folk alarmed chench or taburik thus invoked we put our questions the witch knotted the leaves here a leaf and there a leaf plainly on some arithmetical system studied the result with great apparent contention of mind and gave the answers sidney colvin was in robust health and gone a journey and we should have a fair wind upon the morrow that was the result of our consultation for which we paid a dollar the next day dawned cloudless and breathless but i think captain reid placed a secret reliance on the sibyl for the schooner was got ready for sea by eight the lagoon was flawed with long catspaws and the palms tossed and rustled before ten we were clear of the passage and skimming under all plain sail with bubbling scuppers so we had the breeze which was well worth a dollar in itself but the bulletin about my friend in england proved some six months later when i got my mail to have been groundless perhaps london lies beyond the horizon of the island gods  tembinok in his first dealings showed himself sternly averse from superstition and had not the equator delayed we might have left the island and still supposed him to be an agnostic it chanced one day however that he came to our maniap and found mrs stevenson in the midst of a game of patience she explained the game as well as she was able and wound up jocularly by telling him this was her devilwork and if she won the equator would arrive next day tembinok must have drawn a long breath we were not so highanddry after all he need no longer dissemble and he plunged at once into confessions he made devilwork every day he told us to know if ships were coming in and thereafter brought us regular reports of the results it was surprising how regularly he was wrong but he had always an explanation ready there had been some schooner in the offing out of view but either she was not bound for apemama or had changed her course or lay becalmed i used to regard the king with veneration as he thus publicly deceived himself i saw behind him all the fathers of the church all the philosophers and men of science of the past before him all those that are to come himself in the midst the whole visionary series bowed over the same task of welding incongruities to the end tembinok spoke reluctantly of the island gods and their worship and i learned but little taburik is the god of thunder and deals in wind and weather a while since there were wizards who could call him down in the form of lightning my patha he tell me he see you think he lie tientipronounced something like chench and identified by his majesty with the devilsends and removes bodily sickness he is whistled for in the paumotuan manner and is said to appear but the king has never seen him the doctors treat disease by the aid of chench eclectic tembinok at the same time administering painkiller from his medicinechest so as to give the sufferer both chances i think mo betta observed his majesty with more than his usual selfapproval apparently the gods are not jealous and placidly enjoy both shrine and priest in common on tamaitis medicinetree for instance the model canoes are hung up ex voto for a prosperous voyage and must therefore be dedicated to taburik god of the weather but the stone in front is the place of sick folk come to pacify chench  it chanced by great good luck that even as we spoke of these affairs i found myself threatened with a cold i do not suppose i was ever glad of a cold before or shall ever be again but the opportunity to see the sorcerers at work was priceless and i called in the faculty of apemama they came in a body all in their sundays best and hung with wreaths and shells the insignia of the devilworker tamaiti i knew already terutak i saw for the first time a tall lank rawboned serious northsea fisherman turned brown and there was a third in their company whose name i never heard and who played to tamaiti the part of famulus tamaiti took me in hand first and led me conversing agreeably to the shores of fu bay the famulus climbed a tree for some green cocoanuts tamaiti himself disappeared a while in the bush and returned with coco tinder dry leaves and a spray of waxberry i was placed on the stone with my back to the tree and my face to windward between me and the gravelheap one of the green nuts was set and then tamaiti having previously bared his feet for he had come in canvas shoes which tortured him joined me within the magic circle hollowed out the top of the gravelheap built his fire in the bottom and applied a match it was one of bryant and mays the flame was slow to catch and the irreverent sorcerer filled in the time with talk of foreign placesof london and companies and how much money they had of san francisco and the nefarious fogs all the same smoke which had been so nearly the occasion of his death i tried vainly to lead him to the matter in hand everybody make medicine he said lightly and when i asked him if he were himself a good practitionerno savvy he replied more lightly still at length the leaves burst in a flame which he continued to feed a thick light smoke blew in my face and the flames streamed against and scorched my clothes he in the meanwhile addressed or affected to address the evil spirit his lips moving fast but without sound at the same time he waved in the air and twice struck me on the breast with his green spray so soon as the leaves were consumed the ashes were buried the green spray was imbedded in the gravel and the ceremony was at an end  a reader of the arabian nights felt quite at home here was the suffumigation here was the muttering wizard here was the desert place to which aladdin was decoyed by the false uncle but they manage these things better in fiction the effect was marred by the levity of the magician entertaining his patient with small talk like an affable dentist and by the incongruous presence of mr osbourne with a camera as for my cold it was neither better nor worse  i was now handed over to terutak the leading practitioner or medical baronet of apemama his place is on the lagoon side of the island hard by the palace a rail of light wood some two feet high encloses an oblong piece of gravel like the kings pray place in the midst is a green tree below a stone table bears a pair of boxes covered with a fine mat and in front of these an offering of food a cocoanut a piece of taro or a fish is placed daily on two sides the enclosure is lined with maniaps and one of our party who had been there to sketch had remarked a daily concourse of people and an extraordinary number of sick children for this is in fact the infirmary of apemama the doctor and myself entered the sacred place alone the boxes and the mat were displaced and i was enthroned in their stead upon the stone facing once more to the east for a while the sorcerer remained unseen behind me making passes in the air with a branch of palm then he struck lightly on the brim of my straw hat and this blow he continued to repeat at intervals sometimes brushing instead my arm and shoulder i have had people try to mesmerise me a dozen times and never with the least result but at the first tapon a quarter no more vital than my hatbrim and from nothing more virtuous than a switch of palm wielded by a man i could not even seesleep rushed upon me like an armed man my sinews fainted my eyes closed my brain hummed with drowsiness i resistedat first instinctively then with a certain flurry of despair in the end successfully if that were indeed success which enabled me to scramble to my feet to stumble home somnambulous to cast myself at once upon my bed and sink at once into a dreamless stupor when i awoke my cold was gone so i leave a matter that i do not understand  meanwhile my appetite for curiosities not usually very keen had been strangely whetted by the sacred boxes they were of pandanus wood oblong in shape with an effect of pillaring along the sides like straw work lightly fringed with hair or fibre and standing on four legs the outside was neat as a toy the inside a mystery i was resolved to penetrate but there was a lion in the path i might not approach terutak since i had promised to buy nothing in the island i dared not have recourse to the king for i had already received from him more gifts than i knew how to repay in this dilemma the schooner being at last returned we hit on a device captain reid came forward in my stead professed an unbridled passion for the boxes and asked and obtained leave to bargain for them with the wizard that same afternoon the captain and i made haste to the infirmary entered the enclosure raised the mat and had begun to examine the boxes at our leisure when terutaks wife bounced out of one of the nigh houses fell upon us swept up the treasures and was gone there was never a more absolute surprise she came she took she vanished we had not a guess whither and we remained with foolish looks and laughter on the empty field such was the fit prologue of our memorable bargaining  presently terutak came bringing tamaiti along with him both smiling and we four squatted without the rail in the three maniaps of the infirmary a certain audience was gathered the family of a sick child under treatment the kings sister playing cards a pretty girl who swore i was the image of her father in all perhaps a score terutaks wife had returned even as she had vanished unseen and now sat breathless and watchful by her husbands side perhaps some rumour of our quest had gone abroad or perhaps we had given the alert by our unseemly freedom certain at least that in the faces of all present expectation and alarm were mingled  captain reid announced without preface or disguise that i was come to purchase terutak with sudden gravity refused to sell he was pressed he persisted it was explained we only wanted one no matter two were necessary for the healing of the sick he was rallied he was reasoned with in vain he sat there serious and still and refused all this was only a preliminary skirmish hitherto no sum of money had been mentioned but now the captain brought his great guns to bear he named a pound then two then three out of the maniaps one person after another came to join the group some with mere excitement others with consternation in their faces the pretty girl crept to my side it was then thatsurely with the most artless flatteryshe informed me of my likeness to her father tamaiti the infidel sat with hanging head and every mark of dejection terutak streamed with sweat his eye was glazed his face wore a painful rictus his chest heaved like that of one spent with running the man must have been by nature covetous and i doubt if ever i saw moral agony more tragically displayed his wife by his side passionately encouraged his resistance  and now came the charge of the old guard the captain making a skip named the surprising figure of five pounds at the word the maniaps were emptied the kings sister flung down her cards and came to the front to listen a cloud on her brow the pretty girl beat her breast and cried with wearisome iteration that if the box were hers i should have it terutaks wife was beside herself with pious fear her face discomposed her voice which scarce ceased from warning and encouragement shrill as a whistle even terutak lost that imagelike immobility which he had hitherto maintained he rocked on his mat threw up his closed knees alternately and struck himself on the breast after the manner of dancers but he came gold out of the furnace and with what voice was left him continued to reject the bribe  and now came a timely interjection money will not heal the sick observed the kings sister sententiously and as soon as i heard the remark translated my eyes were unsealed and i began to blush for my employment here was a sick child and i sought in the view of its parents to remove the medicinebox here was the priest of a religion and i a heathen millionaire was corrupting him to sacrilege here was a greedy man torn in twain betwixt greed and conscience and i sat by and relished and lustfully renewed his torments ave cæsar smothered in a corner dormant but not dead we have all the one touch of nature an infant passion for the sand and blood of the arena so i brought to an end my first and last experience of the joys of the millionaire and departed amid silent awe nowhere else can i expect to stir the depths of human nature by an offer of five pounds nowhere else even at the expense of millions could i hope to see the evil of riches stand so legibly exposed of all the bystanders none but the kings sister retained any memory of the gravity and danger of the thing in hand their eyes glowed the girl beat her breast in senseless animal excitement nothing was offered them they stood neither to gain nor to lose at the mere name and wind of these great sums satan possessed them  from this singular interview i went straight to the palace found the king confessed what i had been doing begged him in my name to compliment terutak on his virtue and to have a similar box made for me against the return of the schooner tembinok rubam and one of the daily papershim we used to call the facetiæ columnlaboured for a while of some idea which was at last intelligibly delivered they feared i thought the box would cure me whereas without the wizard it was useless and when i was threatened with another cold i should do better to rely on painkiller i explained i merely wished to keep it in my outch as a thing made in apemama and these honest men were much relieved  late the same evening my wife crossing the isle to windward was aware of singing in the bush nothing is more common in that hour and place than the jubilant carol of the toddycutter swinging high overhead beholding below him the narrow ribbon of the isle the surrounding field of ocean and the fires of the sunset but this was of a graver character and seemed to proceed from the groundlevel advancing a little in the thicket mrs stevenson saw a clear space a fine mat spread in the midst and on the mat a wreath of white flowers and one of the devilwork boxes a womanwhom we guess to have been mrs terutaksat in front now drooping over the box like a mother over a cradle now lifting her face and directing her song to heaven a passing toddycutter told my wife that she was praying probably she did not so much pray as deprecate and perhaps even the ceremony was one of disenchantment for the box was already doomed it was to pass from its green medicinetree reverend precinct and devout attendants to be handled by the profane to cross three seas to come to land under the foolscap of st pauls to be domesticated within hail of lillie bridge there to be dusted by the british housemaid and to take perhaps the roar of london for the voice of the outer sea along the reef before even we had finished dinner chench had begun his journey and one of the newspapers had already placed the box upon my table as the gift of tembinok  i made haste to the palace thanked the king but offered to restore the box for i could not bear that the sick of the island should be made to suffer i was amazed by his reply terutak it appeared had still three or four in reserve against an accident and his reluctance and the dread painted at first on every face was not in the least occasioned by the prospect of medical destitution but by the immediate divinity of chench how much more did i respect the kings command which had been able to extort in a moment and for nothing a sacrilegious favour that i had in vain solicited with millions but now i had a difficult task in front of me it was not in my view that terutak should suffer by his virtue and i must persuade the king to share my opinion to let me enrich one of his subjects and what was yet more delicate to pay for my present nothing shows the king in a more becoming light than the fact that i succeeded he demurred at the principle he exclaimed when he heard it at the sum plenty money cried he with contemptuous displeasure but his resistance was never serious and when he had blown off his illhumoura right said he you give him mo betta  armed with this permission i made straight for the infirmary the night was now come cool dark and starry on a mat hard by a clear fire of wood and cocoshell terutak lay beside his wife both were smiling the agony was over the kings command had reconciled i must suppose their agitating scruples and i was bidden to sit by them and share the circulating pipe i was a little moved myself when i placed five gold sovereigns in the wizards hand but there was no sign of emotion in terutak as he returned them pointed to the palace and named tembinok it was a changed scene when i had managed to explain terutak long dour scots fisherman as he was expressed his satisfaction within bounds but the wife beamed and there was an old gentleman presenther father i supposewho seemed nigh translated his eyes stood out of his head kaupoi kaupoirich rich ran on his lips like a refrain and he could not meet my eye but what he gurgled into foolish laughter  i might now go home leaving that firelit family party gloating over their new millions and consider my strange day i had tried and rewarded the virtue of terutak i had played the millionaire had behaved abominably and then in some degree repaired my thoughtlessness and now i had my box and could open it and look within it contained a miniature sleepingmat and a white shell tamaiti interrogated next day as to the shell explained it was not exactly chench but a cell or body which he would at times inhabit asked why there was a sleepingmat he retorted indignantly why have you mats and this was the sceptical tamaiti but island scepticism is never deeper than the lips     chapter vii  the king of apemama   thus all things on the island even the priests of the gods obey the word of tembinok he can give and take and slay and allay the scruples of the conscientious and do all things apparently but interfere in the cookery of a turtle i got power is his favourite word it interlards his conversation the thought haunts him and is ever fresh and when he has asked and meditates of foreign countries he looks up with a smile and reminds you i got power nor is his delight only in the possession but in the exercise he rejoices in the crooked and violent paths of kingship like a strong man to run a race or like an artist in his art to feel to use his power to embellish his island and the picture of the island life after a private ideal to milk the island vigorously to extend his singular museumthese employ delightfully the sum of his abilities i never saw a man more patently in the right trade  it would be natural to suppose this monarchy inherited intact through generations and so far from that it is a thing of yesterday i was already a boy at school while apemama was yet republican ruled by a noisy council of old men and torn with incurable feuds and tembinok is no bourbon rather the son of a napoleon of course he is wellborn no man need aspire high in the isles of the pacific unless his pedigree be long and in the upper regions mythical and our king counts cousinship with most of the high families in the archipelago and traces his descent to a shark and a heroic woman directed by an oracle she swam beyond sight of land to meet her revolting paramour and received at sea the seed of a predestined family i think lie is the kings emphatic commentary yet he is proud of the legend from this illustrious beginning the fortunes of the race must have declined and teñkoruti the grandfather of tembinok was the chief of a village at the north end of the island kuria and aranuka were yet independent apemama itself the arena of devastating feuds through this perturbed period of history the figure of teñkoruti stalks memorable in war he was swift and bloody several towns fell to his spear and the inhabitants were butchered to a man in civil life his arrogance was unheard of when the council of old men was summoned he went to the speak house delivered his mind and left without waiting to be answered wisdom had spoken let others opine according to their folly he was feared and hated and this was his pleasure he was no poet he cared not for arts or knowledge my granpatha one thing savvy savvy pight observed the king in some lull of their own disputes the old men of apemama adventured on the conquest of apemama and this unlicked caius marcius was elected general of the united troops success attended him the islands were reduced and teñkoruti returned to his own government glorious and detested he died about 1860 in the seventieth year of his age and the full odour of unpopularity he was tall and lean says his grandson looked extremely old and walked all the same young man the same observer gave me a significant detail the survivors of that rough epoch were all defaced with spearmarks there was none on the body of this skilful fighter i see old man no got a spear said the king  teñkoruti left two sons tembaitake and tembinatake tembaitake our kings father was short middling stout a poet a good genealogist and something of a fighter it seems he took himself seriously and was perhaps scarce conscious that he was in all things the creature and nursling of his brother there was no shadow of dispute between the pair the greater man filled with alacrity and content the second place held the breach in war and all the portfolios in the time of peace and when his brother rated him listened in silence looking on the ground like teñkoruti he was tall and lean and a swift walkera rare trait in the islands he possessed every accomplishment he knew sorcery he was the best genealogist of his day he was a poet he could dance and make canoes and armour and the famous mast of apemama which ran one joint higher than the mainmast of a fullrigged ship was of his conception and design but these were avocations and the mans trade was war when my uncle go make wa he laugh said tembinok he forbade the use of field fortification that protractor of native hostilities his men must fight in the open and win or be beaten out of hand his own activity inspired his followers and the swiftness of his blows beat down in one lifetime the resistance of three islands he made his brother sovereign he left his nephew absolute my uncle make all smooth said tembinok i mo king than my patha i got power he said with formidable relish  such is the portrait of the uncle drawn by the nephew i can set beside it another by a different artist who has ofteni may say alwaysdelighted me with his romantic taste in narrative but not alwaysand i may say not oftenpersuaded me of his exactitude i have already denied myself the use of so much excellent matter from the same source that i begin to think it time to reward good resolution and his account of tembinatake agrees so well with the kings that it may very well be what i hope it is the record of a fact and not what i suspect the pleasing exercise of an imagination more than sailorly a for so i had perhaps better call him was walking up the island after dusk when he came on a lighted village of some size was directed to the chiefs house and asked leave to rest and smoke a pipe you will sit down and smoke a pipe and wash and eat and sleep replied the chief and tomorrow you will go again food was brought prayers were held for this was in the brief day of christianity and the chief himself prayed with eloquence and seeming sincerity all evening a sat and admired the man by the firelight he was six feet high lean with the appearance of many years and an extraordinary air of breeding and command he looked like a man who would kill you laughing said a in singular echo of one of the kings expressions and again i had been reading the musketeer books and he reminded me of aramis such is the portrait of tembinatake drawn by an expert romancer  we had heard many tales of my patha never a word of my uncle till two days before we left as the time approached for our departure tembinok became greatly changed a softer a more melancholy and in particular a more confidential man appeared in his stead to my wife he contrived laboriously to explain that though he knew he must lose his father in the course of nature he had not minded nor realised it till the moment came and that now he was to lose us he repeated the experience we showed fireworks one evening on the terrace it was a heavy business the sense of separation was in all our minds and the talk languished the king was specially affected sat disconsolate on his mat and often sighed of a sudden one of the wives stepped forth from a cluster came and kissed him in silence and silently went again it was just such a caress as we might give to a disconsolate child and the king received it with a childs simplicity presently after we said goodnight and withdrew but tembinok detained mr osbourne patting the mat by his side and saying sit down i feel bad i like talk osbourne sat down by him you like some beer said he and one of the wives produced a bottle the king did not partake but sat sighing and smoking a meerschaum pipe i very sorry you go he said at last miss stlevens he good man woman he good man boy he good man all good man woman he smart all the same man my woman glancing towards his wives he good woman no very smart i think miss stlevens he big chiep all the same capn manowa i think miss stlevens he rich man all the same me all go schoona i very sorry my patha he go my uncle he go my cutcheons he go miss stlevens he go all go you no see king cry before king all the same man feel bad he cry i very sorry  in the morning it was the common topic in the village that the king had wept to me he said last night i no can peak too much here laying his hand upon his bosom now you go away all the same my pamily my brothers my uncle go away all the same this was said with a dejection almost passionate and it was the first time i had heard him name his uncle or indeed employ the word the same day he sent me a present of two corselets made in the island fashion of plaited fibre heavy and strong one had been worn by teñkoruti one by tembaitake and the gift being gratefully received he sent me on the return of his messengersa thirdthat of tembinatake my curiosity was roused i begged for information as to the three wearers and the king entered with gusto into the details already given here was a strange thing that he should have talked so much of his family and not once mentioned that relative of whom he was plainly the most proud nay more he had hitherto boasted of his father thenceforth he had little to say of him and the qualities for which he had praised him in the past were now attributed where they were dueto the uncle a confusion might be natural enough among islanders who call all the sons of their grandfather by the common name of father but this was not the case with tembinok now the ice was broken the word uncle was perpetually in his mouth he who had been so ready to confound was now careful to distinguish and the father sank gradually into a selfcomplacent ordinary man while the uncle rose to his true stature as the hero and founder of the race  the more i heard and the more i considered the more this mystery of tembinoks behaviour puzzled and attracted me and the explanation when it came was one to strike the imagination of a dramatist tembinok had two brothers one detected in private trading was banished then forgiven lives to this day in the island and is the father of the heirapparent paul the other fell beyond forgiveness i have heard it was a loveaffair with one of the kings wives and the thing is highly possible in that romantic archipelago war was attempted to be levied but tembinok was too swift for the rebels and the guilty brother escaped in a canoe he did not go alone tembinatake had a hand in the rebellion and the man who had gained a kingdom for a weakling brother was banished by that brothers son the fugitives came to shore in other islands but tembinok remains to this day ignorant of their fate  so far history and now a moment for conjecture tembinok confused habitually not only the attributes and merits of his father and his uncle but their diverse personal appearance before he had even spoken or thought to speak of tembinatake he had told me often of a tall lean father skilled in war and his own schoolmaster in genealogy and island arts how if both were fathers one natural one adoptive how if the heir of tembaitake like the heir of tembinok himself were not a son but an adopted nephew how if the founder of the monarchy while he worked for his brother worked at the same time for the child of his loins how if on the death of tembaitake the two stronger natures father and son king and kingmaker clashed and tembinok when he drove out his uncle drove out the author of his days here is at least a tragedy foursquare  the king took us on board in his own gig dressed for the occasion in the naval uniform he had little to say he refused refreshments shook us briefly by the hand and went ashore again that night the palmtops of apemama had dipped behind the sea and the schooner sailed solitary under the stars     letters from samoa     letters to the times pall mall gazette etc  i  to the editor of the times        yacht casco hawaiian islands feb 10 1889  sirnews from polynesia is apt to come piecemeal and thus fail of its effect the first step being forgotten before the second comes to hand for this reason i should like to be allowed to recapitulate a little of the past before i go on to illustrate the present extraordinary state of affairs in the samoan islands  it is quite true that this group was largely opened up by german enterprise and that the port of apia is much the creation of the godeffroys so far the german case extends no farther apia was governed till lately by a tripartite municipality the american english and german consuls and one other representative of each of the three nations making up the body to both america and germany a harbour had been ceded england i believe had no harbour but that her position was quite equal to that of her neighbours one fact eloquently displays malietoathen king of samoa now a prisoner on the marshall islandsoffered to accept the supremacy of england unhappily for himself his offer was refused her majestys government declaring i am told that they would prefer to see him independent as he now wanders the territory of his island prison under the guns of an imperial warship his independence if it still exist must be confined entirely to his bosom  such was the former equal and pacific state of the three nations at apia it would be curious to tell at length by what steps of encroachment on the one side and weakness on the other the present reign of terror has been brought about but my time before the mail departs is very short your space is limited and in such a history much must be only matter of conjecture briefly and roughly then there came a sudden change in the attitude of germany another treaty was proposed to malietoa and refused the cause of the rebel tamasese was invented or espoused malietoa was seized and deported tamasese installed the tripartite municipality dissolved the german consul seated autocratically in its place and the hawaiian embassy sent by a power of the same race to moderate among samoans dismissed with threats and insults in the course of these events villages have been shelled the german flag has been at least once substituted for the english and the stars and stripes only the other day were burned at matafatatele on the day of the chase after malietoa the houses of both english and americans were violently entered by the germans since the dissolution of the municipality english and americans have paid their taxes into the hands of their own consuls where they accumulate and the german representative unrecognised and unsupported rules single in apia i have had through my hands a file of consular proclamations the most singular readinga state of war declared all other authority but that of the german representative suspended punishment and the punishment of death in particular liberally threatened it is enough to make a man rub his eyes when he reads colonel de coetlogons protest and the highhanded rejoinder posted alongside of it the next day by dr knappe who is dr knappe thus to make peace and war deal in life and death and close with a buffet the mouth of english consuls by what process known to diplomacy has he risen from his onesixth part of municipal authority to be the bismarck of a polynesian island and what spell has been cast on the cabinets of washington and st jamess that mr blacklock should have been so long left unsupported and that colonel de coetlogon must bow his head under a public buffet  i have not said much of the samoans i despair in so short a space to interest english readers in their wrongs with the mass of people at home they will pass for some sort of cannibal islanders with whom faith were superfluous upon whom kindness might be partly thrown away and indeed i recognise with gladness that except as regards the captivity of malietoa the samoans have had throughout the honours of the game tamasese the german puppet has had everywhere the under hand almost none except those of his own clan have ever supported his cause and even these begin now to desert him this is no samoan war said one of them as he transferred his followers and services to the new malietoamataafa this is a german war mataafa if he be cut off from apia and the sea lies inexpugnable in the foothills immediately behind with 5000 warriors at his back and beyond titles to a great deal of land which they extorted in exchange for rifles and ammunition from the partisans of tamasese of all this bloodshed and bullying the germans behold no profit i have it by last advices that dr knappe has approached the king privately with fair speeches assuring him that the state of war bombardments and other evils of the day are not at all directed at samoans but against the english and americans and that when these are extruded peace shall again smile on a german island it can never be proved but it is highly possible he may have said so and whether he said it or not there is a sense in which the thing is true violence has not been found to succeed with the samoans with the two anglosaxon powers it has been found to work like a charm  i conclude with two instances one american one english  firstmr klein an american journalist was on the beach with malietoas men on the night of the recent german defeat seeing the boats approach in the darkness mr klein hailed them and warned them of the samoan ambush and by this innocent and humane step made public the fact of his presence where much else is contested so much appears to be admitted and indeed claimed upon both sides mr klein is now accused of firing on the germans and of advising the samoans to fire both of which he denies he is accused after the fight of succouring only the wounded of malietoas party he himself declares that he helped both and at any rate the offence appears a novel one and the accusation threatens to introduce fresh dangers into red cross work he was on the beach that night in the exercise of his profession if he was with malietoas men which is the real gist of his offence we who are not germans may surely ask why not on what ground is malietoa a rebel the germans have not conquered samoa that i ever heard of they are there on treaty like their neighbours and dr knappe himself in the eyes of justice is no more than the onesixth part of the town council of apia lastly mr kleins innocence stands very clearly proven by the openness with which he declared his presence for all that this gentleman lay for a considerable time watched day and night by german sailors a prisoner in the american consulate even after he had succeeded in running the gauntlet of the german guards and making his escape in a canoe to the american warship nipsic he was imperiously redemanded from under his own flag and it is probable his extradition is being already called for at washington  secondlyan english artist had gone into the bush sketching i believe he had been to malietoas camp so that his guilt stands on somewhat the same ground as mr kleins he was forcibly seized on board the british packet richmond carried halfdressed on board the adler and detained there in spite of all protest until an english warship had been cleared for action this is of notoriety and only one case although a strong one of many is it what the english people understand by the sovereignty of the seasi am etc       robert louis stevenson     ii  to the editor of the times        vailima upolu samoa oct 12 1891  siri beg leave to lay before your readers a copy of a correspondence or should that have reached you by another channel to offer a few words of narrative and comment  on saturday september 5 mr cedercrantz the chief justice of samoa sailed on a visit to fiji leaving behind him certain prisoners in the gaol and baron senfft von pilsach president of the municipal council master of the field the prisoners were five chiefs of manono who had surrendered of their own accord or at the desire of mataafa had been tried by a native magistrate and received sentence of six months confinement under gentlemanly sic conditions as they were marched to prison certain of their countryfolk of manono ran beside and offered an immediate rescue but lieutenant ulfsparre ordered the men of the escort to load and the disturbance blew by how little weight was attached to this incident by the chief justice is sufficiently indicated by the fact of his departure it was unhappily otherwise with those whom he left behind panic seems to have marked them for her own they despaired at once of all lawful defence and on sunday the day after the chief justices departure apia was in consequence startled with strange news dynamite bought from the wrecker ship an electrical machine and a mechanic hired the prison mined and a letter despatched to the people of manono advising them of the fact and announcing that if any rescue were attempted prison and prisoners should be blown upsuch were the voices of rumour and the design appearing equally feeble reckless and wicked considerable agitation was aroused perhaps it had some effect our government at least which had rushed so hastily to one extreme now dashed with the same speed into another sunday was the day of dynamite tuesday dawned the day of deportation a cutter was hurriedly prepared for sea and the prisoners whom the chief justice had left three days before under a sentence of gentlemanly detention found themselves under way to exile in the tokelaus  a government of this agility escapes criticism by multiplying surprises it obliterates the very memory of past mistakes some perhaps forgot the dynamite some hearing no more of it set it down to be a trick of rumour such as we are well used to in the islands but others were not so sure others considered that the rumour even if unfounded was of an ill example might bear deplorable fruit and from all points of view of morality and policy required a public contradiction eleven of these last entered accordingly into the annexed correspondence with the president it will be seen in the crevice of what quibble that gentleman sought refuge and sits inexpugnable in a question affecting his humanity his honour and the wellbeing of the kingdom which he serves he has preferred to maintain what i can only call a voluble silence the public must judge of the result but there is one point to which i may be allowed to draw attentionthat passage in the fourth of the appended documents in which he confesses that he was already acquainted with the rumours in question and that he has been present and apparently not protesting when the scandal was discussed and the proposed enormity commended  the correspondence was still passing when the president surprised apia with a fresh gambado he has been a long while in trouble as to his disposition of the funds his intention to build a house for himselfto all appearance with native moneyhis sending the taxes out of the islands and locking them up in deposits and his noisy squabbles with the king and native parliament as to the currency had all aroused unfavourable comment on saturday the 3rd of october a correspondence on the last point appeared in the local paper by this it appeared that our not too resolute king and parliament had at last and in one particular defied his advice and maintained their own opinion if vengeance were to be the order of the day it might have been expected to fall on the king and parliament but this would have been too direct a course and the blow was turned instead against an innocent municipal council on the 7th the president appeared before that body informed them that his authority was lessened by the publication that he had applied to the king for a months leave of theatrical absence and must now refuse to fulfil his duties with this he retired to his own house which is under the same roof leaving the councillors and the municipality to do what they pleased and drift where they could without him it is reported he has since declared his life to be in danger and even applied to his consul for protection this seems to pass the bounds of credibility but the movements of baron senfft von pilsach have been throughout so agitated and so unexpected that we know not what to look for and the signatories of the annexed addresses if they were accused tomorrow of a design on the mans days would scarce have spirit left to be surprised  it must be clearly pointed out that this is no quarrel of german and antigerman the german officials consular and naval have behaved with perfect loyalty a german wrote the letter to the paper which unchained this thunderbolt and it was a german who took the chair which the president had just vacated at the table of the municipal board and though the baron is himself of german race his conduct presents no appearance of design how much less of conspiracy doubtless certain journals will so attempt to twist it but to the candid it will seem no more than the distracted evolutions of a weak man in a series of panics  such is a rough outline of the events to which i would fain direct the attention of the public at home in the states and still more in germany it has for me but one essential point budgets have been called in question and officials publicly taken the pet before now but the dynamite scandal is unique  if it be unfounded our complaint is already grave it was the presidents duty as a man and as a responsible official to have given it instant and direct denial and since he neither did so of his own motion nor consented to do so on our repeated instances he has shown that he neither understands nor yet is willing to be taught the condition of this country from what i have been able to collect samoans are indignant because the thing was decided between the king and president without consultation with the native parliament the thing itself it does not enter in their thoughts to call in question they receive gratefully a fresh lesson in civilised methods and civilised justice a day may come when they shall put that lesson in practice for themselves and if they are then decried for their barbarityas they will surely beand punished for it as is highly probable i will ask candid people what they are to think how they will say your own white people intended to do this and you said nothing we do it and you call us treacherous savages  this is to suppose the story false suppose it true however still more suppose the plan had been carried out suppose these chiefs to have surrendered to the white mans justice administered or not by a brown judge suppose them tried condemned confined in that snare of a gaol and some fine night their mangled limbs cast in the faces of their countrymen i leave others to predict the consequences of such an objectlesson in the arts of peace and the administration of the law the samoans are a mild race but their patience is in some points limited under captain brandeis a single skirmish and the death of a few youths sufficed to kindle an enduring war and bring on the ruin of the government the residents have no desire for war and they deprecate altogether a war embittered from the beginning by atrocities nor can they think the stakes at all equal between themselves and baron senfft he has nothing to lose but a situation he is here in what he stands in he can swarm tomorrow on board a warship and be off but the residents have some of them sunk capital on these shores some of them are involved in extended affairs they are tied to the stake and they protest against being plunged into war by the violence and having that war rendered more implacable by the preliminary cruelties of a white official  i leave entirely upon one side all questions of morality but there is still one point of expediency on which i must touch the old native government which was at least cheap failed to enforce the law and fell in consequence into the manifold troubles which have made the name of samoa famous the enforcement of the lawthat was what was required that was the salvation looked for and here we have a government at a high figure and it cannot defend its own gaol and can find no better remedy than to assassinate its prisoners what we have bought at this enormous increase of expenditure is the change from king log to king storkfrom the man who failed to punish petty theft to the man who plots the destruction of his own gaol and the death of his own prisoners  on the return of the chief justice the matter will be brought to his attention but the cure of our troubles must come from home it is from the great powers that we look for deliverance they sent us the president let them either remove the man or see that he is stringently instructedinstructed to respect public decency so we be no longer menaced with doings worthy of a revolutionary committee and instructed to respect the administration of the law so if i be fined a dollar tomorrow for fast riding in apia street i may not awake next morning to find my sentence increased to one of banishment or death by dynamitei am sir your obedient servant       robert louis stevenson   psoctober 14i little expected fresh developments before the mail left but the unresting president still mars the quiet of his neighbours even while i was writing the above lines apia was looking on in mere amazement on the continuation of his gambols a white man had written to the king and the king had answered the lettercrimes against baron senfft von pilsach and his private reading of the berlin treaty he offered to resigni was about to say accordingly for the unexpected is here the normalfrom the presidency of the municipal board and to retain his position as the kings adviser he was instructed that he must resign both or neither resigned both fell out with the consuls on details and is now as we are advised seeking to resile from his resignations such an official i never remember to have read of though i have seen the like from across the footlights and the orchestra evolving in similar figures to the strains of offenbach       rls     copies of a correspondence between certain residents of apia and baron senfft von pilsach  i        september 28 1891    baron senfft von pilsach  sirwe are requested to lay the enclosed appeal before you and to express the desire of the signatories to meet your views as to the manner of the answer  should you prefer to reply by word of mouth a deputation will be ready to wait upon you on thursday at any hour you may please to appoint  should you prefer to reply in writing we are asked only to impress upon you the extreme desire of the signatories that no time should be unnecessarily lost  should you condescend in either of the ways suggested to set at rest our anxiety we need scarce assure you that the step will be received with gratitudewe have the honour to be sir your obedient servants       robert louis stevenson      e w gurr     ii       enclosed in no i  the attention of the president of the municipal council is respectfully directed to the following rumours  1 that at his suggestion or with his authority dynamite was purchased or efforts were made to procure dynamite and the use of an electrical machine was secured or attempted to be obtained  2 that this was for the purpose of undermining or pretending to undermine the gaol in which the manono prisoners were confined  3 that notification of this design was sent to the friends of the prisoners  4 that a threat of blowing up the gaol and the prisoners in the event of an attempted rescue was made  upon all and upon each of these points severally the white residents anxiously expect and respectfully beg information  it is suggested for the presidents consideration that rumours unconnected or unexplained acquire almost the force of admitted truth  that any want of confidence between the governed and the government must be fruitful in loss to both  that the rumours in their present form tend to damage the white races in the native mind and to influence for the worse the manners of the samoans  and that the president alone is in a position to deny to explain or to correct these rumours  upon these grounds the undersigned ask to be excused for any informality in their address and they hope and humbly pray that the president will accept the occasion here presented and take early and effectual means to inform and reassure the whites and to relieve them from possible misjudgment on the part of the samoans       robert louis stevenson      ew gurr    and nine other signatures     iii        apia sept 30 1891    robert louis stevenson esq ew gurr esq  dear sirsthanking you for your kind letter dated 28th inst which i received yesterday together with the address in question i beg to inform you that i am going to answer the address in writing as soon as possiblei have the honour to be dear sirs your obedient servant       senfft     iv        apia oct 2 1891    robert louis stevenson esq  e w gurr esq  gentlemeni have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of an address without date which has been signed by you and some other foreign residents and handed to me on the 29th of september  in this address my attention is directed to some rumours specified therein concerning which i am informed that upon all and upon each of these points severally the white residents anxiously expect and respectfully beg information  generally i beg to state that with a view of successfully performing my official duties i believe it is advisable for me to pay no attention to any anonymous rumour  further i cannot forbear expressing my astonishment that in speaking to me so seriously in the name of the white residents the subscribers of the address have deemed it unnecessary to acquaint me with their authorisation for doing so this omission is by no means a mere informality there are white residents who in my presence have commented upon the rumours in question in a manner directly opposed to the meaning of the address  this fact alone will justify me in objecting to the truth of the abovequoted statement so prominently set forth and so positively affirmed in the address it will also justify me in abstaining from a reply to the further assertions of gentlemen who in apostrophising me care so little for the correctness of the facts they deal with  if in consequence according to the apprehensions laid down in the address those unexplained rumours will damage the white races in the native mind i think the signing parties will then remember that there are public authorities in samoa officially and especially charged with the protection of the white residents if they present to them their complaints and their wishes i have no doubt by so doing they will get all information they may require  i ask you gentlemen to communicate this answer to the parties having signed the address in questioni have the honour to be gentlemen your obedient servant    frhr senfft von pilsach     v        oct 9 1891  the signatories of the address are in receipt of the presidents favour under date october 2 much of his answer is occupied in dealing with a point foreign to the matter in hand and in itself surprising to the signatories their address was an appeal for information on specific points and an appeal from specific persons who correctly described themselves as white residents the undersigned and in the accompanying letter as the signatories they were so far from seeking to collect evidence in private that they applied frankly and directly to the person accused for explanation and so far from seeking to multiply signatures or promote scandal that they kept the paper strictly to themselves they see with regret that the president has failed to appreciate this delicacy they see with sorrow and surprise that in answer to a communication which they believe to have been temperately and courteously worded the president has thought fit to make an imputation on their honesty the trick of which he would seem to accuse them would have been useless and even silly if attempted and on a candid reexamination of the address and the accompanying letter the president will doubtless see fit to recall the imputation  by way of answer to the questions asked the signatories can find nothing but what seems to be a recommendation to them to apply to their consuls for protection it was not protection they asked but information it was not a sense of fear that moved them but a sense of shame it is their misfortune that they cannot address the president in his own language or they would not now require to explain that the words tend to damage the white races in the native mind quoted and misapplied by the president do not express any fear of suffering by the hands of the samoans but in their good opinion and were not the expression of any concern for the duration of peace but of a sense of shame under what they conceived to be disgraceful imputations while agreeing generally with the presidents expressed sentiment as to anonymous rumours they feel that a line has to be drawn certain rumours they would not suffer to remain uncontradicted for an hour it was natural therefore that when they heard a man of their own white race accused of conspiring to blow up the gaol and the prisoners who were there under the safeguard of his honour they should attribute to the accused a similar impatience to be justified and it is with a sense of painful surprise that they find themselves to have been mistaken    signatures as to number ii     vi        apia october 9 1891  gentlemenbeing in receipt of your communication under todays date i have the honour to inform you that i have undertaken the reexamination of your first address which you believe would induce me to recall the answer i have given on the 2nd inst  from this reexamination i have learned again that your appeal begins with the following statement  upon all and upon each of these points severally the white residents anxiously expect and respectfully beg information  i have called this statement a seriously speaking to me in the name of the white residents and i have objected to the truth of that statement  if after a candid reexamination of the matter from your part you may refute me in either or both points i shall be glad indeed in recalling my answer  at present i beg to say that i see no reason for your supposing i misunderstood your expression of damaging the white races in the native mind unless you have no other notion of protection than that applying to the body  concerning the assertion contained in the last clause of your second address that five samoan prisoners having been sentenced by a samoan judge for destroying houses were in the gaol of the samoan government under the safeguard of my honour i ask for your permission to recommend this statement also and especially to your reexaminationi have the honour to be gentlemen your obedient servant       frhr senfft von pilsach     iii  to the editor of the times        samoa april 9 1892  sira sketch of our latest difficulty in samoa will be interesting at least to lawyers  in the berlin general act there is one point on which from the earliest moment volunteer interpreters have been divided the revenue arising from the customs was held by one party to belong to the samoan government by another to the municipality and the dispute was at last decided in favour of the municipality by mr cedercrantz chief justice the decision was not given in writing but it was reported by at least one of the consuls to his government it was of public notoriety it is not denied and it was at once implicitly acted on by the parties before that decision the revenue from customs was suffered to accumulate ever since to the knowledge of the chief justice and with the daily countenance of the president it has been received administered and spent by the municipality it is the function of the chief justice to interpret the berlin act its sense was thus supposed to be established beyond cavil those who were dissatisfied with the result conceived their only recourse lay in a prayer to the powers to have the treaty altered and such a prayer was but the other day proposed supported and finally negatived in a public meeting  about a year has gone by since the decision and the state of the samoan government has been daily growing more precarious taxes have not been paid and the government has not ventured to enforce them fresh taxes have fallen due and the government has not ventured to call for them salaries were running on and that of the chief justice alone amounts to a considerable figure for these islands the coffers had fallen low at last it is believed they were quite empty no resource seemed left and bystanders waited with a smiling curiosity for the wheels to stop i should add to explain the epithet smiling that the government has proved a stillborn child and except for some spasmodic movements which i have already made the subject of remark in your columns it may be said to have done nothing but pay salaries  in this state of matters on march 28 the president of the council baron senfft von pilsach was suddenly and privately supplied by mr cedercrantz with a written judgment reversing the verbal and public decision of a year before by what powers of law was this result attained and how was the point brought again before his honour i feel i shall here strain the credulity of your readers but our authority is the president in person the suit was brought by himself in his capacity perhaps an imaginary one of kings adviser it was defended by himself in his capacity of president of the council no notice had been given the parties were not summoned they were advised neither of the trial nor the judgment so far as can be learned two persons only met and partedthe first was the plaintiff and defendant rolled in one the other was a judge who had decided black a year ago and had now intimated a modest willingness to decide white  but it is possible to follow more closely these original proceedings baron von pilsach sat down he told us in his capacity of adviser to the king and wrote to himself in his capacity of president of the council an eloquent letter of reprimand three pages long an unknown english artist clothed it for him in good language and nothing remained but to have it signed by king malietoa to whom it was attributed so long as he knows how to signa white official is said thus to have summed up with a shrug the qualifications necessary in a samoan king it was signed accordingly though whether the king knew what he was signing is matter of debate and thus regularised it was forwarded to the chief justice enclosed in a letter of adhesion from the president such as they were these letters appear to have been the pleadings on which the chief justice proceeded such as they were they seem to have been the documents in this unusual case  suppose an unfortunate error to have been made suppose a reversal of the courts finding and the years policy to have become immediately needful wisdom would indicate an extreme frankness of demeanour and our two officials preferred a policy of irritating dissimulation while the revolution was being prepared behind the curtain the president was holding night sessions of the municipal council what was the business no other than to prepare an ordinance regulating those very customs which he was secretly conspiring to withdraw from their control and it was a piece of duplicity of a similar nature which first awoke the echoes of apia by its miscarriage the council had sent up for the approval of the consular board a project of several bridges one of which that of the vaisingano was of chief importance to the town to sanction so much fresh expense at the very moment when to his secret knowledge the municipality was to be left bare of funds appeared to one of the consuls an unworthy act and the proposal was accordingly disallowed the people of apia are extremely swift to guess no sooner was the vaisingano bridge denied them than they leaped within a measurable distance of the truth it was remembered that the chief justice had but recently this time by a decision regularly obtained placed the municipal funds at the presidents mercy talk ran high of collusion between the two officials it was rumoured the safe had been already secretly drawn upon the newspaper being at this juncture suddenly and rather mysteriously sold it was rumoured it had been bought for the officials with municipal money and the apians crowded in consequence to the municipal meeting on april 1 with minds already heated  the president came on his side armed with the secret judgment and the hour being now come he unveiled his work of art to the municipal councillors on the strength of the chief justices decision to his knowledge and with the daily countenance of the president they had for twelve months received and expended the revenue from customs they learned now that this was wrong they learned not only that they were to receive no more but that they must refund what they had already spent and the total sum amounting to about 25000 and there being less than 20000 in the treasury they learned that they were bankrupt and with the next breath the president reassured them time was to be given to these miserable debtors and the king in his clemency would even advance them from their own safenow theirs no longera loan of 3000 against current expenses if the municipal council of apia be far from an ideal body at least it makes roads and builds bridges at least it does something to justify its existence and reconcile the ratepayer to the rates this was to cease all the funds husbanded for this end were to be transferred to the government at mulinuu which has never done anything to mention but pay salaries and of which men have long ceased to expect anything else but that it shall continue to pay salaries till it die of inanition let us suppose this raid on the municipal treasury to have been just and needful it is plain even if introduced in the most conciliatory manner it could never have been welcome and as it was the sting was in the mannerin the secrecy and the surprise in the dissimulation the dissonant decisions the appearance of collusion between the officials and the offer of a loan too small to help bitter words were spoken at the counciltable the public joined with shouts it was openly proposed to overpower the president and seize the treasury key baron von pilsach possesses the redeeming rudimentary virtue of courage it required courage to come at all on such an errand to those he had deceived and amidst violent voices and menacing hands he displayed a constancy worthy of a better cause the council broke tumultuously up the inhabitants crowded to a public meeting the consuls acquainted with the alarming effervescency of feeling communicated their willingness to meet the municipal councillors and arrange a compromise and the inhabitants renewed by acclamation the mandate of their representatives the same night these sat in council with the consular board and a modus vivendi was agreed upon which was rejected the next morning by the president  the representations of the consuls had however their effect and when the council met again on april 6 baron von pilsach was found to have entirely modified his attitude the bridge over the vaisingano was conceded the sum of 3000 offered to the council was increased to 9000 about onehalf of the existing funds the samoan government which was to profit by the customs now agreed to bear the expenses of collection the president while refusing to be limited to a specific figure promised an anxious parsimony in the government expenditure admitted his recent conduct had been of a nature to irritate the councillors and frankly proposed it should be brought under the notice of the powers i should not be a fair reporter if i did not praise his bearing in the midst of men whom he had grossly deceived and who had recently insulted him in return he behaved himself with tact and temper and largely in consequence his modus vivendi was accepted under protest and the matter in dispute referred without discussion to the powers  i would like to refer for one moment to my former letter the manono prisoners were solemnly sentenced to six months imprisonment and by some unexplained and secret process the sentence was increased to one of banishment the fact seems to have rather amused the governments at home it did not at all amuse us here on the spot but we sought consolation by remembering that the president was a layman and the chief justice had left the islands but the day before let mr cedercrantz return we thought and arthur would be come again well arthur is come and now we begin to think he was perhaps an approving if an absent party to the scandal for do we not find in the case of the municipal treasury the same disquieting features a decision is publicly delivered it is acted on for a year and by some secret and inexplicable process we find it suddenly reversed we are supposed to be governed by english law is this english law is it a law at all does it permit a state of society in which a citizen can live and act with confidence and when we are asked by natives to explain these peculiarities of white mans government and white mans justice in what form of words are we to answer        april 12  fresh news reaches me i have once again to admire the accuracy of rumour in apia and that which i had passed over with a reference becomes the head and front of our contention the samoa times was nominally purchased by a gentleman who whatever be his other recommendations was notoriously ill off there was paid down for it £600 in gold a huge sum of ready money for apia above all in gold and all men wondered where it came from it is this which has been discovered the wrapper of each rouleau was found to be signed by mr martin collector for the municipality as well as for the samoan government and countersigned by mr savile his assistant in other words the money had left either the municipal or the government safe  the position of the president is thus extremely exposed his accounts up to january 1 are in the hands of auditors the next term of march 31 is already past and although the natural course has been repeatedly suggested to him he has never yet permitted the verification of the balance in his safe the case would appear less strong against the chief justice yet a month has not elapsed since he placed the funds at the disposal of the president on the avowed ground that the population of apia was unfit to be intrusted with its own affairs and the very week of the purchase he reversed his own previous decision and liberated his colleague from the last remaining vestige of control beyond the extent of these judgments i doubt if this astute personage will be found to have committed himself in black and white and the more foolhardy president may thus be left in the top of the breach alone  let it be explained or apportioned as it may this additional scandal is felt to have overfilled the measure it may be argued that the president has great tact and the chief justice a fund of philosophy give us instead a judge who shall proceed according to the forms of justice and a treasurer who shall permit the verification of his balances surely there can be found among the millions of europe two frank and honest men one of whom shall be acquainted with english law and the other possess the ordinary virtues of a clerk over whose heads in the exercise of their duties six months may occasionally pass without painful disclosures and dangerous scandals who shall not weary us with their surprises and intrigues who shall not amaze us with their lack of penetration who shall not in the hour of their destitution seem to have diverted £600 of public money for the purchase of an inconsiderable sheet or at a time when eight provinces of discontented natives threaten at any moment to sweep their ineffective government into the sea to have sought safety and strength in gagging the local press of apia if it be otherwiseif we cannot be relieved if the powers are satisfied with the conduct of mr cedercrantz and baron senfft von pilsach if these were sent here with the understanding that they should secretly purchase perhaps privately edit a little sheet of two pages issued from a crazy wooden building at the mission gate if it were indeed intended that for this important end they should divert as it seems they have done public funds and affront all the forms of lawwe whites can only bow the head we are here quite helpless if we would complain of baron pilsach it can only be to mr cedercrantz if we would complain of mr cedercrantz and the powers will not hear us the circle is complete a nightly guard surrounds and protects their place of residence while the house of the king is cynically left without the pickets secure from interference one utters the voice of the law the other moves the hands of authority and now they seem to have sequestered in the course of a single week the only available funds and the only existing paper in the islands  but there is one thing they forget it is not the whites who menace the duration of their government and it is only the whites who read the newspaper mataafa sits hard by in his armed camp and sees he sees the weakness he counts the scandals of their government he sees his rival and brother sitting disconsidered at their doors like lazarus before the house of dives and if he is not very fond of his brother he is very scrupulous of native dignities he has seen his friends menaced with midnight destruction in the government gaol and deported without form of law he is not himself a talker and his thoughts are hid from us but what is said by his more hasty partisans we know on march 29 the day after the chief justice signed the secret judgment three days before it was made public and while the purchase of the newspaper was yet in treaty a native orator stood up in an assembly who asked the great powers to make laws for us to bring strangers here to rule us he cried we want no white officials to bind us in the bondage of taxation here is the changed spirit which these gentlemen have produced by a misgovernment of fifteen months here is their peril which no purchase of newspapers and no subsequent editorial suppressions can avert  it may be asked if it be still time to do anything it is indeed already late and these gentlemen arriving in a golden moment have fatally squandered opportunity and perhaps fatally damaged white prestige even the whites themselves they have not only embittered but corrupted we were pained the other day when our municipal councillors refused by a majority to make the production of invoices obligatory at the customhouse yet who shall blame them when the chief justice with a smallness of rapacity at which all men wondered refused to pay and i believe still withholds the duties on his imports he was above the law being the head of it and this was how he preached by example he refused to pay his customs the white councillors following in his wake refuse to take measures to enforce them against others and the natives following in his wake refuse to pay their taxes these taxes it may perhaps be never possible to raise again directly taxes have never been popular in samoa yet in the golden moment when this government began its course a majority of the samoans paid them every province should have seen some part of that money expended in its bounds every nerve should have been strained to interest and gratify the natives in the manner of its expenditure it has been spent instead on mulinuu to pay four white officials two of whom came in the suite of the chief justice and to build a socalled government house in which the president resides and the very name of taxes is become abhorrent what can still be done and what must be done immediately is to give us a new chief justicea lawyer a man of honour a man who will not commit himself to one side whether in politics or in private causes and who shall not have the appearance of trying to coin money at every joint of our affairs so much the better if he be a man of talent but we do not ask so much with an ordinary appreciation of law an ordinary discretion and ordinary generosity he may still in the course of time and with good fortune restore confidence and repair the breaches in the prestige of the whites as for the president there is much discussion some think the office is superfluous still more the salary to be excessive some regard the present man who is young and personally pleasing as a tool and scapegoat for another and these are tempted to suppose that with a new and firm chief justice he might yet redeem his character he would require at least to clear himself of the affair of the rouleaux or all would be against himi am sir your obedient servant       robert louis stevenson     iv  to the editor of the times        samoa june 22 1892  siri read in a new zealand paper that you published my last with misgiving the writer then goes on to remind me that i am a novelist and to bid me return to my romances and leave the affairs of samoa to subeditors in distant quarters of the world we in common with other journals have correspondents in samoa he complains and yet we have no news from them of the curious conspiracy which mr stevenson appears to have unearthed and which if it had any real existence would be known to everybody on the island as this is the only voice which has yet reached me from beyond the seas i am constrained to make some answer but it must not be supposed that though you may perhaps have been alone to publish i have been alone to write the same story is now in the hands of the three governments from their respective consuls not only so but the complaint of the municipal council drawn by two able solicitors has been likewise laid before them  this at least is public and i may say notorious the solicitors were authorised to proceed with their task at a public meeting the president for i was there and heard him approved the step though he refrained from voting but he seems to have entertained a hope of burking or at least indefinitely postponing the whole business and when the meeting was over and its proceedings had been approved as is necessary by the consular board he neglected to notify the two gentlemen appointed of that approval in a large city the trick might have succeeded for a time in a village like apia where all news leaks out and the king meets the cobbler daily it did no more than to advertise his own artfulness and the next he learned the case for the municipal council had been prepared approved by the consuls and despatched to the great powers i am accustomed to have my word doubted in this matter and must here look to have it doubted once again but the fact is certain the two solicitors messrs carruthers and cooper were actually cited to appear before the chief justice in the supreme court i have seen the summons and the summons was the first and last of this state trial the proceeding instituted in an hour of temper was in a moment of reaction allowed to drop  about the same date a final blow befell the government of mulinuu let me remind you sir of the situation the funds of the municipality had been suddenly seized on what appeared a collusive judgment by the bankrupt government of mulinuu the paper the organ of opposition was bought by a man of straw and it was found the purchasemoney had been paid in rouleaux from the government safes the government consisted of two men one the president and treasurer had a ready means to clear himself and dispose for ever of the scandalthat means apart from any scandal was his mere immediate dutyviz to have his balance verified and he has refused to do so and he still refuses but the other though he sits abstruse must not think to escape his share of blame he holds a high situation he is our chief magistrate he has heard this miserable tale of the rouleaux at which the consuls looked so black and why has he done nothing when he found that the case against himself and his colleague had gone to the three powers a little of the suddenest he could launch summonses which it seems he was afterwards glad to disavow against messrs cooper and carruthers but then when the whole island murmuredthen when a large sum which could be traced to the government treasuries was found figuring in the hands of a man of strawwhere were his thunderbolts then for more than a month the scandal has hung black about his colleague for more than a month he has sat inert and silent for more than a month in consequence the last spark of trust in him has quite died out  in was in these circumstances that the government of mulinuu approached the municipal council with a proposal to levy fresh taxes from the whites it was in these circumstances that the municipal council answered no public works have ceased the destination of public moneys is kept secret and the municipal council resolved to stop supplies  at this it seems the government awoke to a sense of their position the natives had long ceased to pay them now the whites had followed suit destitution had succeeded to embarrassment and they made haste to join with themselves another who did not share in their unpopularity this gentleman mr thomas maben government surveyor is himself deservedly popular and the office created for him that of secretary of state is one in which under happier auspices he might accomplish much he is promised a free hand he has succeeded to and is to exercise entirely those vague functions claimed by the president under his style of adviser to the king it will be well if it is found to be so in the field of practice it will be well if mr maben find any funds left for his not exorbitant salary it would doubtless have been better in this day of their destitution and in the midst of growing samoan murmurs against the high salaries of whites if the government could have fallen on some expedient which did not imply another and there is a question one would fain have answered the president claims to hold two officesthat of adviser to the king that of president of the municipal council a year ago in the time of the dynamite affair he proposed to resign the second and retain his whole emoluments as adviser to the king he has now practically resigned the first and we wish to know if he now proposes to retain his entire salary as president of the councili am etc       robert louis stevenson     v  to the editor of the times        apia july 19 1892  siri am at last in receipt of your article upon my letter it was as i supposed you had a difficulty in believing the events recorded and to my great satisfaction you suggest an inquiry you observe the marks of passion in my letter or so it seems to you but your summary shows me that i have not failed to communicate with a sufficient clearness the facts alleged passion may have seemed to burn in my words it has not at least impaired my ability to record with precision a plain tale the cold language of consular reports which you say you would prefer is doubtless to be had upon inquiry in the proper quarter i make bold to say it will be found to bear me out of the law case for the municipality i can speak with more assurance for since it was sent i have been shown a copy its language is admirably cold yet it tells it is possible in a much better dialect the same remarkable story but all these corroborations sleep in official keeping and thanks to the generosity with which you have admitted me to your columns i stand alone before the public it is my prayer that this may cease as soon as possible there is other evidence gone home let that be produced or let us have as you propose an inquiry give to the chief justice and the president an opportunity to clear their characters and to myself that liberty which i am so often requested to take of returning to my private businessi am sir your obedient servant       robert louis stevenson     vi  to the editor of the times        apia september 14 1892  sirthe peninsula of mulinuu was claimed by the german firm and in case their claim should be found good they had granted to the samoan government an option to buy at a certain figure hereon stand the houses of our officials in particular that of the chief justice it has long been a problem here whether this gentleman paid any rent and the problem is now solved the chief justice of samoa was a squatter on the ground that the government was about to purchase the peninsula he occupied a house on the ground that the germans were about to sell it he refused to pay them any rent the firm seemed to have no remedy but to summon the squatter before himself and hear over again from the official what they had heard already from the disastrous tenant but even in samoa an ingenious man inspired by annoyance may find means of selfprotection the house was no part of the land nor included in the option the firm put it up for sale and the government under pain of seeing the chief justice houseless was obliged to buy it  in the meanwhile the german claim to mulinuu was passed by the land commission and sent on to the chief justice on the 17th of may he ended by confirming the report but though his judgment bears date the 9th of august it was not made public till the 15th so far as we are aware and certainly so far as samoa has profited by his labours his honour may be said to have had nothing else to do but to attend to this one piece of business he was being paid to do so at the rate of £100 a month and it took him ninety days or about as long as it took napoleon to recapture and to lose again his empire but better late than never and the germans rejoicing in the decision summoned the government to complete the purchase or to waive their option there was again a delay in answering for the policy of all parts of this extraordinary government is on one model and when the answer came it was only to announce a fresh deception the german claim had passed the land commission and the supreme court it was good against objections but it appeared it was not yet good for registration and must still be resurveyed by a government surveyor the option thus continues to brood over the land of mulinuu the government to squat there without payment and the german firm to stand helpless and dispossessed what can they do their adversary is their only judge i hear it calculated that the present state of matters may be yet spun out for months at the end of which period there must come at last a day of reckoning and the purchasemoney will have to be found or the option to be waived and the government to flit elsewhere as for the question of arrears of rent it will be in judicious hands and his honour may be trusted to deal with it in a manner suitable to the previous history of the case  but why it will be asked spin out by these excessive methods a thread of such tenuity why go to such lengths for four months longer of fallacious solvency i expect not to be believed but i think the government still hopes a warship under a hotheaded captain might be decoyed into hostilities the taxes might begin to come in again the three powers might become otherwise engaged and the little stage of samoa escape observationindeed i know not what they hope but they hope something there lives on in their breasts a remainder coal of ambition still unquenched or it is only so that i can explain a late astonishing sally of his honours in a long and elaborate judgment he has pared the nails and indeed removed the fingers of his only rival the municipal magistrate for eighteen months he has seen the lower court crowded with affairs the while his own stood unfrequented like an obsolete churchyard he may have remarked with envy many hundred cases passing through his rivals hands cases of assault cases of larceny ranging in the last four months from 2s up to £1 12s or he may have viewed with displeasure that despatch of business which was characteristic of the magistrate mr cooper an end at least has been made of these abuses mr cooper is henceforth to draw his salary for the minimum of public service and all larcenies and assaults however trivial must go according to the nationality of those concerned before the consular or the supreme courts  to this portentous judgment there are two sidesa practical and legal and first as to the practical for every blow struck or shilling stolen the parties must now march out to mulinuu and place themselves at the mercy of a court which if hamlet had known he would have referred with more emotion to the laws delays it is feared they will not do so and that crime will go on in consequence unpunished and increase by indulgence but this is nothing the court of the municipal magistrate was a convenient commonground and clearinghouse for our manifold nationalities it has now been for all purpose of serious utility abolished and the result is distraction there was a recent trumpery case heard by mr cooper amid shouts of mirth it resolved itself if i remember rightly into three charges of assault with countercharges and three of abusive language with the same and the parties represented only two nationalitiesa small allowance for apia yet in our new world since the chief justices decision this vulgar shindy would have split up into six several suits before three different courts the charges must have been heard by one judge the countercharges by another the whole nauseous evidence six times repeated and the lawyers six times feed  remains the legal argument his honour admits the municipality to be invested with such legislative powers as generally constitute a police jurisdiction he does not deny the municipality is empowered to take steps for the protection of the person and it was argued this implied a jurisdiction in cases of assault but this argument observes his honour proves too much and consequently nothing for like reasons the municipal council should have power to provide for the punishment of all felonies against the person and i suppose the property as well and filled with a just sense that a merely police jurisdiction should be limited he limits it with a vengeance by the exclusion of all assaults and all larcenies a pity he had not looked into the berlin act he would have found it already limited there by the same power which called it into beinglimited to fines not exceeding 200 and imprisonment not extending beyond 180 days nay and i think he might have even reasoned from this discovery that he was himself somewhat in error for assaults and larcenies being excluded what kind of enormity is that which is to be visited with a fine of £40 or an imprisonment of half a year it is perhaps childish to pursue further this childish controversialist but there is one passage if he had dipped into the berlin act that well might have arrested his attention that in which he is himself empowered to deal with crimes and offences subject however to the provisions defining the jurisdiction of the municipal magistrate of apia  i trust sir this is the last time i shall have to trouble you with these twopenny concerns but until some step is taken by the three powers or until i have quite exhausted your indulgence i shall continue to report our scandals as they arise once more one thing or other either what i write is false and i should be chastised as a calumniator or else it is true and these officials are unfit for their positioni am etc       robert louis stevenson   psthe mail is already closed when i receive at last decisive confirmation of the purchase of the samoa times by the samoan government it has never been denied it is now admitted the paper which they bought so recently they are already trying to sell and have received and refused an offer of £150 for what they bought for upwards of £600 surely we may now demand the attention of the three powers     vii  to the editor of the pall mall gazette  i        september 4 1893  in june it became clear that the kings government was weary of waiting upon europe as it had been clear long before that europe would do nothing the last commentary on the berlin act was read malietoa laupepa had been put in ex auctoritate by the powers the powers would not support him even by a show of strength and there was nothing left but to fall back on an election according to the laws and customs of samoaby arbitrament of riflebullets and blackened faces instantly heaven was darkened by a brood of rumours random calumnies and idle tales as we rode late at night through the hamlet near my house we saw the fires lighted in the houses and eager talkers discussing the last report the king was sick he was dying he was perfectly well he was seen riding furiously by night in the back parts of apia and covering his face as he rode mataafa was in favour with the germans he was to be made a german king he was secure of the support of all samoa he had no following whatsoever the name of every chief and village with many that were new to the hearer came up in turn to be dubbed laupepa or mataafa or both at the same time or neither dr george brown the missionary had just completed a tour of the islands there are few men in the world with a more mature knowledge of native character and i applied to him eagerly for an estimate of the relative forces when the first shot is fired and not before said he you will know who is who the event has shown that he might have gone yet further for even after shots were fired and men slain an important province was still hesitating and trimming  mataafa lay in malie he had an armed picket at a ford some two miles from apia where they sat in a prodigious state of vigilance and glee and his whole troop although not above five hundred strong appeared animated with the most warlike spirit for himself he waited as he had waited for two years wrote eloquent letters the time to answer which was quite gone by and looked on while his enemies painfully collected their forces doubtless to the last he was assured and deceived by vain promises of help  the process of gathering a royal army in samoa is cumbrous and dilatory in the extreme there is here none of the expedition of the fiery cross and the balefire but every step is diplomatic each village with a great expense of eloquence has to be wiled with promises and spurred by threats and the greater chieftains make stipulations ere they will march tamasese son to the late german puppet and heir of his ambitions demanded the vicekingship as the price of his accession though i am assured that he demanded it in vain the various provinces returned various and unsatisfactory answers atua was off and on tuamasaga was divided tutuila recalcitrant and for long the king sat almost solitary under the windy palms of mulinuu it seemed indeed as if the war was off and the whole archipelago unanimous in the native phrase to sit still and plant taro  but at last in the first days of july atua began to come in boats arrived thirty and fifty strong a drum and a very illplayed bugle giving time to the oarsmen the whole crew uttering at intervals a savage howl and on the decked foresheets of the boat the village champion frantically capering and dancing parties were to be seen encamped in palmgroves with their rifles stacked the shops were emptied of red handkerchiefs the rallying sign or as a man might say the uniform of the royal army there was spirit shown troops of handsome lads marched in a right manly fashion with their guns on their shoulders to the music of the drum and the bugle or the tinwhistle from a hamlet close to my own doors a contingent of six men marched out their leaders kit contained one stick of tobacco four boxes of matches and the inevitable red handkerchief in his case it was of silk for he had come late to the purchasing and the commoner materials were exhausted this childish band of braves marched one afternoon to a neighbouring hill and the same night returned to their houses on the ground that it was uncomfortable in the bush an excellent old fellow who had had enough of war in many campaigns took refuge in my service from the conscription but in vain the village had decided no warrior might hang back one summoner arrived and then followed some negotiationsi have no authority to say what enough that the messenger departed and our friend remained but alas a second envoy followed and proved to be of sterner composition and with a basket full of food kava and tobacco the reluctant hero proceeded to the wars i am sure they had few handsomer soldiers if perhaps some that were more willing and he would have been better to be armed his gunbut in mr kiplings pleasant catchword that is another story  war to the samoan of mature years is often an unpleasant necessity to the young boy it is a heaven of immediate pleasures as well as an opportunity of ultimate glory women march with the troopseven the tauposa or sacred maid of the village accompanies her father in the field to carry cartridges and bring him water to drinkand their bright eyes are ready to rain influence and reward valour to what grim deeds this practice may conduct i shall have to say later on in the rally of their arms it is at least wholly pretty and i have one pleasant picture of a warparty marching out the men armed and boastful their heads bound with the red handkerchief their faces blackedand two girls marching in their midst under european parasols  on saturday july 8th by the early morning the troops began to file westward from apia and about noon found found themselves face to face with the lines of mataafa in the german plantation of vaitele the armies immediately fraternised kava was made by the ladies as who should say tea at home and partaken of by the braves with many truculent expressions one chief on the kings side revolted by the extent of these familiarities began to beat his followers with a staff but both parties were still intermingled between the lines and the chiefs on either side were conversing and even embracing at the moment when an accidental or perhaps a treacherous shot precipitated the engagement i cannot find there was any decisive difference in the numbers actually under fire but the mataafas appear to have been ill posted and ill led twice their flank was turned their line enfiladed and themselves driven with the loss of about thirty from two successive cattle walls a third wall afforded them a more effectual shelter and night closed on the field of battle without further advantage all night the royal troops hailed volleys of bullets at this obstacle with the earliest light a charge proved it to be quite deserted and from further down the coast smoke was seen rising from the houses of malie mataafa had precipitately fled destroying behind him the village which for two years he had been raising and beautifying  so much was accomplished what was to follow mataafa took refuge in manono and cast up forts his enemies far from following up this advantage held fonos and made speeches and found fault i believe the majority of the kings army had marched in a state of continuous indecision and maintaining an attitude of impartiality more to be admired in the cabinet of the philosopher than in the field of war it is certain at least that only one province has as yet fired a shot for malietoa laupepa the valour of the tuamasaga was sufficient and prevailed but atua was in the rear and has as yet done nothing as for the men of crana so far from carrying out the plan agreed upon and blocking the men of malie on the morning of the 8th they were entertaining an embassy from mataafa and they suffered his fleet of boats to escape without a shot through certain dangerous narrows of the lagoon and the chief himself to pass on foot and unmolested along the whole foreshore of their province no adequate excuse has been made for this halfheartednessor treachery it was a piece of the whole which was a specimen there are too many strings in a samoan intrigue for the merely european mind to follow and the desire to serve upon both sides and keep a door open for reconciliation was manifest almost throughout a week passed in these divided counsels savaii had refused to receive mataafait is said they now hesitated to rise for the king and demanded instead a fono or council of both sides and it seemed at least possible that the royal army might proceed no further and the unstable alliance be dissolved  on sunday the 16th her british majestys ship katoomba captain bickford cmg arrived in apia with fresh orders had she but come ten days earlier the whole of this miserable business would have been prevented for the three powers were determined to maintain malietoa laupepa by arms and had declared finally against mataafa right or wrong it was at least a decision and therefore welcome it may not be bestit was something no honest friend to samoa can pretend anything but relief that the three powers should at last break their vacillating silence it is of a piece with their whole policy in the islands that they should have hung in stays for upwards of two yearsof a piece with their almost uniform illfortune that eight days before their purpose was declared war should have marked the country with burned houses and severed heads   ii  there is another side to the medal of samoan warfare so soon as an advantage is obtained a new and to us horrible animal appears upon the scenethe head hunter again and again we have reasoned with our boys against this bestial practice but reason and upon this one point even ridicule are vain they admit it to be indefensible they allege its imperative necessity one young man who had seen his father take a head in the late war spoke of the scene with shuddering revolt and yet said he must go and do likewise himself in the war which was to come how else could a man prove he was brave and had not every country its own customs  accordingly as occasion offered these same pleasing children who had just been drinking kava with their opponents fell incontinently on the dead and dying and secured their grisly trophies it should be said in fairness that the mataafas had no opportunity to take heads but that their chief taught by the lesson of fangalii had forbidden the practice it is doubtful if he would have been obeyed and yet his power over his people was so great that the german plantation where they lay some time and were at last defeated had not to complain of the theft of a single cocoanut hateful as it must always be to mutilate and murder the disabled there were in this days affray in vaitele circumstances yet more detestable fifteen heads were brought in all to mulinuu they were carried with parade in front of the fine house which our late president built for himself before he was removed here on the verandah the king sat to receive them and utter words of course and compliment to each successful warrior they were spolia opima in the number leaupepe mataafas nephewor as samoans say his sonhad fallen by the first wall and whether from those sentiments of kindred and friendship that so often unite the combatants in civil strife or to mark by an unusual formality the importance of the conquest not only his head but his mutilated body also was brought in from the mat in which the corpse was enveloped a bloody hand protruded and struck a chill in white eyewitnesses it were to attribute to malietoa laupepa sentiments entirely foreign to his race and training if we were to suppose him otherwise than gratified  but it was not so throughout every country has its customs say native apologists and one of the most decisive customs of samoa ensures the immunity of women they go to the front as our women of yore went to a tournament bullets are blind and they must take their risk of bullets but of nothing else they serve out cartridges and water they jeer the faltering and defend the wounded even in this skirmish of vaitele they distinguished themselves on either side one dragged her skulking husband from a hole and drove him to the front another seeing her lover fall snatched up his gun kept the headhunters at bay and drew him unmutilated from the field such services they have been accustomed to pay for centuries and often in the course of centuries a bullet or a spear must have despatched one of these warlike angels often enough too the headhunter springing ghoullike on fallen bodies must have decapitated a woman for a man but the case arising there was an established etiquette so soon as the error was discovered the head was buried and the exploit forgotten there had never yet in the history of samoa occurred an instance in which a man had taken a womans head and kept it and laid it at his monarchs feet  such was the strange and horrid spectacle which must have immediately shaken the heart of laupepa and has since covered the faces of his party with confusion it is not quite certain if there were three or only two a recent attempt to reduce the number to one must be received with caution as an afterthought the admissions in the beginning were too explicit the panic of shame and fear had been too sweeping there is scarce a woman of our native friends in apia who can speak upon the subject without terror scarce any man without humiliation and the shock was increased out of measure by the fact that the heador one of the headswas recognised recognised for the niece of one of the greatest of court ladies recognised for a tauposa or sacred maid of a village from savaii it seemed incredible that shewho had been chosen for virtue and beauty who went everywhere attended by the fairest maidens and watched over by vigilant duennas whose part it was in holiday costume to receive guests to make kava and to be the leader of the revels should become the victim of a brutal rally in a cowpark and have her face exposed for a trophy to the victorious king  in all this muttering of aversion and alarm no word has been openly said no punishment no disgrace has been inflicted on the perpetrators of the outrage king consuls and mission appear to have held their peace alike i can understand a certain apathy in whites headhunting they say is a horrid practice and will not stop to investigate its finer shades but the samoan himself does not hesitate for him the act is portentous and if it go unpunished and set a fashion its consequences must be damnable this is not a breach of a christian virtue of something halflearned by rote and from foreigners in the last thirty years it is a flying in the face of their own native instinctive and traditional standard tenfold more ominous and degrading and taking the matter for all in all it seems to me that headhunting itself should be firmly and immediately suppressed how else can a man prove himself to be brave my friend asked but often enough these are but fraudulent trophies on the morrow of the fight at vaitele an atua man discovered a body lying in the bush he took the head a day or two ago a party was allowed to visit manono the kings troops on shore observing them put off from the rebel island leaped to the conclusion that this must be the wounded going to apia launched off at once two armed boats and overhauled the othersafter heads the glory of such exploits is not apparent their power for degradation strikes the eyes lieutenant ulfsparre our late swedish chief of police and commander of the forces told his men that if any of them took a head his own hand should avenge it that was talking i should like to see all in the same storyking consuls and missionariesincluded   iii  the three powers have at last taken hold here in apia but they came the day after the fair and the immediate business on hand is very delicate this morning 18th captain bickford followed by two germans sailed for manono if he shall succeed in persuading mataafa to surrender all may be well if he cannot this long train of blunders may end inwhat is so often the result of blundering in the field of politicsa horrid massacre those of us who remember the services of mataafa his unfailing generosity and moderation in the past and his bereavement in the presentas well as those who are only interested in a mass of men and women many of them our familiar friends now pent up on an island and beleaguered by three warships and a samoan armyawait the issue with dreadful expectation     viii  to the editor of the times        vailima apia april 23 1894  siri last addressed you on the misconduct of certain officials here and i was so far happy as to have had my facts confirmed in every particular with but one exception that exception the affair of the dynamite has been secretly smuggled away you shall look in vain in either bluebook or whitebook for any mention even of the charge it is gone like the conjurers orange i might have been tempted to inquire into the reason of this conspiracy of silence whether the idea was conceived in the bosoms of the three powers themselves or whether in the breasts of the three consuls because one of their number was directly implicated and i might have gone on to consider the moral effect of such suppressions and to show how very idle they were and how very undignified in the face of a small and compact population where everybody sees and hears where everybody knows and talks and laughs but only a personal question remained which i judged of no interest to the public the essential was accomplished baron senfft was gone already mr cedercrantz still lingered among us in the character i may say of a private citizen his court at last closed only his pocket open for the receipt of his salary representing the dignity of the berlin act by sitting in the wind on mulinuu point for several consecutive monthsa curious phantom or survival of a past age the new officials were not as yet because they had not been created and we fell into our old estate of government by the three consuls as it was in the beginning before the berlin act existed as it seems it will be till the end after the berlin act has been swept away  it was during the time of this triumvirate and wholly at their instigation and under their conduct that mataafa was defeated driven to manono and three warships coming opportunely to hand forced to surrender i have been called a partisan of this chiefs and i accept the term i thought him on the whole the most honest man in samoa not excepting white officials i ventured to think he had been hardly used by the treaty powers i venture to think so still it was my opinion that he should have been conjoined with malietoa as viceking and i have seen no reason to change that opinion except that the time for it is past mataafa has played and lost an exile and stripped of his titles he walks the exiguous beach of jaluit sees the german flag over his head and yearns for the land wind of upolu in the politics of samoa he is no longer a factor and it only remains to speak of the manner in which his rebellion was suppressed and punished deportation is to the samoan mind the punishment next to death and thirteen of the chiefs engaged were deported with their leader twentyseven others were cast into the gaol there they lie still the government makes almost no attempt to feed them and they must depend on the activity of their families and the charity of pitying whites in the meantime these very families are overloaded with fines the exorbitant sum of more than £6600 having been laid on the chiefs and villages that took part with mataafa  so far we can only complain that the punishments have been severe and the prison commissariat absent but we have besides to regret the repeated scandals in connection with the conduct of the war and we look in vain for any sign of punishment the consuls had to employ barbarous hands we might expect outrages we did expect them to be punished or at least disowned thus certain mataafa chiefs were landed and landed from a british manofwar to be shamefully abused beaten and struck with whips along the main street of mulinuu there was no punishment there was even no inquiry the three consuls winked only one man was found honest and bold enough to open his mouth and that was my old enemy mr cedercrantz walking in mulinuu in his character of disinterested spectator gracefully desipient he came across the throng of these rabblers and their victims he had forgotten that he was an official he remembered that he was a man it was his last public appearance in samoa to interfere it was certainly his best again the government troops in the field took the heads of girls a detestable felony even in samoan eyes they carried them in procession to mulinuu and made of them an oblation to that melancholy effigy the king who sore against his will sat on the verandah of the government building publicly to receive this affront publicly to utter the words of compliment and thanks which constitute the highest reward known to samoan bravery and crowned as heroes those who should have been hanged like dogs and again the three consuls unanimously winked there was no punishment there was even no inquiry  lastly there is the story of manono three hours were given to mataafa to accept the terms of the ultimatum and the time had almost elapsed when his boats put forth and more than elapsed before he came alongside the katoomba and surrendered formally to captain bickford in the dusk of the evening when all the ships had sailed flames were observed to rise from the island mataafa flung himself on his knees before captain bickford and implored protection for his women and children left behind and the captain put back the ship and despatched one of the consuls to inquire the katoomba had been about seventy hours in the islands captain bickford was a stranger he had to rely on the consuls implicitly at the same time he knew that the government troops had been suffered to land for the purpose of restoring order and with the understanding that no reprisals should be committed on the adherents of mataafa and he charged the emissary with his emphatic disapproval threats of punishment on the offenders and reminders that the war had now passed under the responsibility of the three powers i cannot condescend on what this consul saw during his visit i can only say what he reported on his return he reported all well and the chiefs on the government side fraternising and making ava with those on mataafas it may have been at least it is strange the burning of the island proceeded fruittrees were cut down women stripped naked a scene of brutal disorder reigned all night and left behind it over a quarter of the island ruin if they fraternised with mataafas chieftains they must have been singularly inconsistent for the next we learn of the two parties they were beating spitting upon and insulting them along the highway the next morning in apia i asked the same consul if there had not been some houses burned he told me no i repeated the question alleging the evidence of officers on board the katoomba who had seen the flames increase and multiply as they steamed away whereupon he had this remarkable replyo huts huts huts there isnt a house a frame house on the island the case to plain men stands thusthe people of manono were insulted their foodtrees cut down themselves left houseless not more than ten housesi beg the consuls pardon hutsescaped the rancour of their enemies and to this day they may be seen to dwell in shanties on the site of their former residences the pride of the samoan heart the ejaculation of the consul was thus at least prophetic and the traveller who revisits today the shores of the garden island may well exclaim in his turn huts huts huts  the same measure was served out in the mere wantonness of clan hatred to apolima a nearly inaccessible islet in the straits of the same name almost the only property saved there it is amusing to remember being a framed portrait of lady jersey which its custodian escaped with into the bush as it were the palladium and chief treasure of the inhabitants the solemn promise passed by consuls and captains in the name of the three powers was thus broken the troops employed were allowed their bellyful of barbarous outrage and again there was no punishment there was no inquiry there was no protest there was not a word said to disown the act or disengage the honour of the three powers i do not say the consuls desired to be disobeyed though the case looks black against one gentleman and even he is perhaps only to be accused of levity and divided interest it was doubtless important for him to be early in apia where he combines with his diplomatic functions the management of a thriving business as commission agent and auctioneer i do say of all of them that they took a very nonchalant view of their duty  i told myself that this was the government of the consular triumvirate when the new officials came it would cease it would pass away like a dream in the night and the solid pax romana of the berlin general act would succeed after all what was there to complain of the consuls had shown themselves no slovens and no sentimentalists they had shown themselves not very particular but in one sense very thorough rebellion was to be put down swiftly and rigorously if need were with the hand of cromwell at least it was to be put down and in these unruly islands i was prepared almost to welcome the face of rhadamanthine severity  and now it appears it was all a mistake the government by the berlin general act is no more than a mask and a very expensive one for government by the consular triumvirate samoa pays or tries to pay £2200 a year to a couple of helpers and they dare not call their souls their own they take their walks abroad with an anxious eye on the three consuls like two wellbehaved children with three nurses and the consuls smiling superior allow them to amuse themselves with the routine of business but let trouble come and the farce is suspended at the whistle of a squall these heavenborn mariners seize the tiller and the £2200 amateurs are knocked sprawling on the bilge at the first beat of the drum the treaty officials are sent below gently protesting like a pair of old ladies and behold the indomitable consuls ready to clear the wreck and make the deadly cutlass shine and their method studied under the light of a new example wears another air they are not so rhadamanthine as we thought something that we can only call a dignified panic presides over their deliberations they have one idea to lighten the ship overboard with the ballast the mainmast and the chronometer is the cry in the last war they got rid first of the honour of their respective countries and second of all idea that samoa was to be governed in a manner consistent with civilisation or government troops punished for any conceivable misconduct in the present war they have sacrificed first the prestige of the new chief justice and second the very principle for which they had contended so vigorously and so successfully in the war beforethat rebellion was a thing to be punished  about the end of last year that war a war of the tupuas under tamasese the younger which was a necessary pendant to the crushing of mataafa began to make itself heard of in obscure grumblings it was but a timid business one half of the tupua party the whole province of atua never joined the rebellion but sulked in their villages and spent the time in indecisive eloquence and barren embassies tamasese by a trick eminently samoan went in the high bush and the mountains carrying a gun like a private soldierserved in fact with his own troops incognitoand thus to samoan eyes waived his dynastic pretensions and the war which was announced in the beginning with a long catalogue of complaints against the king and a distinct and ugly threat to the white population of apia degenerated into a war of defence by the province of aána against the eminently brutal troops of savaii in which sympathy was generally and justly with the rebels savaii raging with private clan hatred and the lust of destruction was put at free quarters in the disaffected province repeated on a wider scale the outrages of manono and apolima cut down the foodtrees stripped and insulted the women robbed the children of their little possessions burned the houses killed the horses the pigs the dogs the cats along one half of the seaboard of aána and in the prosecution of these manly exploits managed to the joy of all to lose some sixty men killed wounded and drowned  government by the treaty of berlin was still erect when one fine morning in walked the three consuls totally uninvited with a proclamation prepared and signed by themselves without any mention of anybody else they had awoke to a sense of the danger of the situation and their own indispensable merits the two children knew their day was over the nurses had come for them who can blame them for their timidity the consuls have the ears of the governments they are the authors of those despatches of which in the ripeness of time bluebooks and whitebooks are made up they had dismissed with some little assistance from yourself mm cedercrantz and senfft von pilsach and they had strangled like an illegitimate child the scandal of the dynamite the chief justice and the president made haste to disappear between decks and left the ship of the state to the three volunteers there was no lack of activity the consuls went up to atua they went down to aána the oarsmen toiled the talking men pleaded they are said to have met with threats in atua and to have yielded to themat least in but a few days time they came home to us with a new treaty of pacification of course and as before the government troops were whitewashed the savaii ruffians had been stripping women and killing cats in the interests of the berlin treaty there was to be no punishment and no inquiry let them retire to savaii with their booty and their dead offensive as this cannot fail to be there is still some slight excuse for it the king is no more than one out of several chiefs of clans his strength resides in the willing obedience of the tuamasaga and a portioni have to hope a bad portionof the island of savaii to punish any of these supporters must always be to accept a risk and the golden opportunity had been allowed to slip at the moment of the mataafa war  what was more original was the treatment of the rebels they were under arms that moment against the government they had fought and sometimes vanquished they had taken heads and carried them to tamasese and the terms granted were to surrender fifty rifles to make some twenty miles of road to pay some old finesand to be forgiven the loss of fifty rifles to people destitute of any shadow of a gunsmith to repair them when they are broken and already notoriously short of ammunition is a trifle the number is easy to be made up of those that are out of commission for there is not the least stipulation as to their value any synthesis of old iron and smashed wood that can be called a gun is to be taken from its force the road as likely as not will never be made the fines have nothing to say to this war in any reasonably governed country they should never have figured in the treaty they had been inflicted before and were due before before the rebellion began the beach had rung with i know not what indiscreet bluster the natives were to be read a lesson tamasese by name was to be hanged and after what had been done to mataafa i was so innocent as to listen with awe and now the rebellion has come and this was the punishment there might well have been a doubt in the mind of any chief who should have been tempted to follow the example of mataafa but who is it that would not dare to follow tamasese  for some reasoni know not what unless it be fearthere is a strong prejudice amongst whites against any interference with the bestial practice of headhunting they say it would be impossible to identify the criminalsa thing notoriously contrary to fact a man does not take a head as he steals an apple for secret degustation the essence of the thing is its publicity after the girls heads were brought into mulinuu i pressed mr cusacksmith to take some action he proposed a paper of protest to be signed by the english residents we made rival drafts his was preferred and i have heard no more of it it has not been offered me to sign it has not been published under a paperweight in the british consulate i suppose it may yet be found meanwhile his honour mr ide the new chief justice came to samoa and took spirited action he engineered an ordinance through the house of faipule inflicting serious penalties on any who took heads and the papers at the time applauded his success the rebellion followed the troops were passing to the front and with excellent resolution mr ide harangued the chiefs reiterated the terms of the new law and promised unfailing vengeance on offenders it was boldly done and he stood committed beyond possibility of retreat to enforce this his first important edict great was the commotion great the division in the samoan mind o we have had chief justices before said a visitor to my house we know what they are i will take a head if i can get one others were more doubtful but thought none could be so bold as lay a hand on the peculiar institution of these islands yet others were convinced savaii took heads but when they sent one to mulinuu a messenger met them by the convent gates from the king he would none of it and the trophy must be ingloriously buried savaii took heads also and tamasese accepted the presentation tuamasaga on the other hand obeyed the chief justice and the occasion being thrust upon them contented themselves with taking the dead mans ears on the whole about onethird of the troops engaged and our not very firm monarch himself kept the letter of the ordinance and it was upon this scene of partial but really cheering success that the consuls returned with their general pardon the chief justice was not six months old in the islands he had succeeded to a position complicated by the failure of his predecessor personally speaking face to face with the chiefs he had put his authority in pledge that the ordinance should be enforced and he found himself either forgotten or betrayed by the three consuls these volunteers had made a liar of him they had administered to him before all samoa a triple buffet i must not wonder though i may still deplore that mr ide accepted the position thus made for him there was a deal of alarm in apia to refuse the treaty thus hastily and shamefully cobbled up would have increased it tenfold already since the declaration of war and the imminence of the results one of the papers had ratted and the white population were girding at the new ordinance it was feared besides that the native government though they had voted were secretly opposed to it it was almost certain they would try to prevent its application to the loyalist offenders of savaii the three consuls in the negotiations of the treaty had fully illustrated both their want of sympathy with the ordinance and their want of regard for the position of the chief justice in short i am to look for no support whether physical or moral asked mr ide and i could make but the one answerneither physical nor moral it was a hard choice and he elected to accept the terms of the treaty without protest and the next war if we are to continue to enjoy the benefits of the berlin act will probably show us the result in an enlarged assortment of heads and the next difficulty perhaps prove to us the diminished prestige of the chief justice mr ide announces his intention of applying the law in the case of another war but i very much fear the golden opportunity has again been lost about onethird of the troops believed him this time how many will believe him the next  it will doubtless be answered that the consuls were affected by the alarm in apia and actuated by the desire to save white lives i am far from denying that there may be danger and i believe that the way we are going is the best way to bring it on in the progressive decivilisation of these islandsevidenced by the female heads taken in the last war and the treatment of white missionaries in thisour methods of pull devil pull baker general indecision and frequent though always dignified panic are the best calculated in the world to bring on a massacre of whites a consistent dignity a consistent and independent figure of a chief justice the enforcement of the laws and above all of the laws against barbarity a consular board the same in the presence as in the absence of warships will be found our best defence  much as i have already occupied of your space i would yet ask leave to draw two conclusions  and first mataafa and tamasese both made war both wars were presumably dynastic in character though the tupua not rallying to tamasese as he had expected led him to cover his design that he carried a gun himself and himself fired will not seem to european ears a very important alleviation tamasese received heads sitting as a king under whatever name mataafa had forbidden the taking of headsof his own accord and before mr ide had taken office tamasese began with threats against the white population mataafa never ceased to reassure them and to extend an effectual protection to their property what is the difference between their cases that mataafa was an old man already famous who had served his country well had been appointed king of samoa had served in the office and had been set asidenot indeed in the text but in the protocols of the berlin act by name i do not grudge his good fortune to tamasese who is an amiable spirited and handsome young man and who made a barbarous war indeed since heads were taken after the old samoan practice but who made it without any of the savagery which we have had reason to comment upon in the camp of his adversaries i do not grudge the invidious fate that has befallen my old friend and his followers at first i believed these judgments to be the expression of a severe but equal justice i find them on further experience to be mere measures of the degree of panic in the consuls varying directly as the distance of the nearest warship the judgments under which they fell have now no sanctity they form no longer a precedent they may perfectly well be followed by a pardon or a partial pardon as the authorities shall please the crime of mataafa is to have read strictly the first article of the berlin act and not to have read at all as how should he when it has never been translated the insidious protocol which contains its significance the crime of his followers is to have practised clan fidelity and to have in consequence raised an imperium in imperio and fought against the government their punishment is to be sent to a coral atoll and detained there prisoners it does not sound much it is a great deal taken from a mountain island they must inhabit a narrow strip of reef sunk to the gunwale in the ocean sand stone and cocoanuts stone sand and pandanus make the scenery there is no grass here these men used to the cool bright mountain rivers of samoa must drink with loathing the brackish water of the coral the food upon such islands is distressing even to the omnivorous white to the samoan who has that shivering delicacy and ready disgust of the child or the rustic mountaineer it is intolerable i remember what our present king looked like what a phantom he was when he returned from captivity in the same place lastly these fourteen have been divorced from their families the daughter of mataafa somehow broke the consigne and accompanied her father but she only to this day one of them palepa the wife of faamuina is dunning the authorities in vain to be allowed to join her husbandshe a young and handsome woman he an old man and infirm i cannot speak with certainty but i believe they are allowed no communication with the prisoners nor the prisoners with them my own open experience is brief and conclusivei have not been suffered to send my friends one stick of tobacco or one pound of ava so much to show the hardships are genuine i have to ask a pardon for these unhappy victims of untranslated protocols and inconsistent justice after the case of tamasese i ask it almost as of right as for the other twentyseven in the gaol let the doors be opened at once they have showed their patience they have proved their loyalty long enough on two occasions when the guards deserted in a body and again when the aána prisoners fled they remainedone may truly sayvoluntary prisoners and at least let them be fed i have paid taxes to the samoan government for some four years and the most sensible benefit i have received in return has been to be allowed to feed their prisoners  second if the farce of the berlin act is to be gone on with it will be really necessary to moderate among our five sovereignssix if we are to count poor malietoa who represents to the life the character of the hare and many friends it is to be presumed that mr ide and herr schmidt were chosen for their qualities it is little good we are likely to get by them if at every wind of rumour the three consuls are to intervene the three consuls are paid far smaller salaries they have no right under the treaty to interfere with the government of autonomous samoa and they have contrived to make themselves all in all the king and a majority of the faipule fear them and look to them alone while the legitimate adviser occupies a second place if that the misconduct of mm cedercrantz and senfft von pilsach was so extreme that the consuls were obliged to encroach and now when these are gone the authority acquired in the contest remains with the encroachers on their side they have no rights but a tradition of victory the ear of the governments at home and the vis viva of the warships for the poor treaty officials what have they but rights very obscurely expressed and very weakly defended by their predecessors thus it comes about that people who are scarcely mentioned in the text of the treaty are to all intents and purposes our only rulers       robert louis stevenson     ix  to the editor of the times        vailima samoa may 22 1894  siri told you in my last that the consuls had tinkered up a treaty of peace with the rebels of aána a month has gone by and i would not weary readers your with a story so intricate and purposeless the consuls seem to have gone backward and forward to and fro to periods of agitated activity comparable to that of three ants about a broken nest there succeeded seasons in which they rested from their labours and ruefully considered the result i believe i am not overstating the case when i say that this treaty was at least twice rehandled and the date of submission changed in the interval and yesterday at length we beheld the firstfruits of the consular diplomacy a boat came in from aána bearing the promised fifty stand of armsin other words a talking man a young chief and some boatmen in charge of a boatload of broken ironmongery the government well advised for once had placed the embassy under an escort of german bluejackets or i think it must have gone ill with the ambassadors  so much for aána and the treaty with atua the other disaffected province we have been and are on the brink of war the woods have been patrolled the army sent to the front blood has been shed it consists with my knowledge that the loyalist troops marched against the enemy under a hallucination one and all believed a majority of them still believe that the warships were to follow and assist them who told them so if i am to credit the rumours of the natives as well as the gossip of official circles a promise had been given to this effect by the consuls or at least by one of the consuls and when i say that a promise had been given i mean that it had been sold i mean that the natives had to buy it by submissions  let me take an example of these submissions the native government increased the salary of mr gurr the natives advocate it was not a largesse it was rather an act of tardy justice by which mr gurr received at last the same emoluments as his predecessor in the office at the same time with a bankrupt treasury all fresh expenses are and must be regarded askance the president acting under a socalled treasury regulation refused to honour the kings order and a friendly suit was brought which turned on the validity of this treasury regulation this was more than doubtful the president was a treaty official hence bound by the treaty the three consuls had been acting for him in his absence using his powers and no other powers whatever under the treaty and the three consuls so acting had framed a regulation by which the powers of the president were greatly extended this was a vicious circle with a vengeance but the consuls with the ordinary partiality of parents for reformed offspring regarded the regulation as the apple of their eye they made themselves busy in its defence they held interviews it is reported they drew pleas and it seemed to all that the chief justice hesitated it is certain at least that he long delayed sentence and during this delay the consuls showed their power the native government was repeatedly called together and at last forced to rescind the order in favour of mr gurr it was not done voluntarily for the government resisted it was not done by conviction for the government had taken the first opportunity to restore it if the consuls did not appear personally in the affairand i do not know that they did notthey made use of the president as a mouthpiece and the president delayed the deliberations of the government until he should receive further instructions from the consuls ten pounds is doubtless a considerable affair to a bankrupt government but what were the consuls doing in this matter of inland administration what was their right to interfere what were the arguments with which they overcame the resistance of the government i am either very much misinformed or these gentlemen were trafficking in a merchandise which they did not possess and selling at a high price the assistance of the warships over which as now appears they have no control  remark the irony of fate this affair had no sooner been settled mr gurrs claims cut at the very root and the treasury regulation apparently set beyond cavil than the chief justice pulled himself together and taking his life in his right hand delivered sentence in the case great was the surprise because the chief justice had balked so long it was supposed he would never have taken the leap and here upon a sudden he came down with a decision flat against the consuls and their treasury regulation the government have i understand restored mr gurrs salary in consequence the chief justice after giving us all a very severe fright has reinstated himself in public opinion by this tardy boldness and the consuls find their conduct judicially condemned  it was on a personal affront that the consuls turned on mr cedercrantz here is another affront far more galling and public i suppose it is but a coincidence that i should find at the same time the clouds beginning to gather about mr ides head in a telegram dated from auckland march 30 and copyrighted by the associated press i find the whole blame of the late troubles set down to his account it is the work of a person worthy of no trust in one of his charges and in one only he is right the chief justice fined and imprisoned certain chiefs of aána under circumstances far from clear the act was to say the least of it susceptible of misconstruction and by natives will always be thought of as an act of treachery but even for this it is not possible for me to split the blame justly between mr ide and the three consuls in these early days as now the three consuls were always too eager to interfere where they had no business and the chief justice was always too patient or too timid to set them in their place for the rest of the telegram no qualification is needed the chief justice was compelled to take steps to disarm the natives he took no such steps he never spoke of disarmament except publicly and officially to disown the idea it was during the days of the consular triumvirate that the cry began the chief justice called upon malietoa to send a strong force etc the chief justice disregarded the menacing attitude assumed by the samoans etcthese are but the delusions of a fever the chief justice has played no such part he never called for forces he never disregarded menacing attitudes not even those of the consuls what we have to complain of in mr ide and mr schmidt is strangely different we complain that they have been here since november and the three consuls are still allowed when they are not invited to interfere in the least and the greatest that they have been here for upwards of six months and government under the berlin treaty is still overriddenand i may say overlaidby the government of the consular triumvirate  this is the main fountain of our present discontents this it is that we pray to be relieved from out of six sovereigns exercising incongruous rights or usurpations on this unhappy island we pray to be relieved of three the berlin treaty was not our choice but if we are to have it at all let us have it plain let us have the text and nothing but the text let the three consuls who have no position under the treaty cease from troubling cease from raising war and making peace from passing illegal regulations in the face of day and from secretly blackmailing the samoan government into renunciations of its independence afterwards when we have once seen it in operation we shall be able to judge whether government under the berlin treaty suits or does not suit our casei am sir etc       robert louis stevenson     x  from the daily chronicle march 18 1895    subjoined is the full text of the late robert louis stevensons last   letter to mr j f hogan mp apart from its pathetic interest as   one of the final compositions of the distinguished novelist its   eloquent terms of pleading for his exiled friend mataafa and the   light it sheds on samoan affairs make it a very noteworthy and   instructive documented dc        vailima oct 7 1894    j f hogan esq mp  dear sirmy attention was attracted the other day by the thoroughly pertinent questions which you put in the house of commons and which the government failed to answer it put an idea in my head that you were perhaps the man who might take up a task which i am almost ready to give up mataafa is now known to be my hobby people laugh when they see any mention of his name over my signature and the times while it still grants me hospitality begins to lead the chorus i know that nothing can be more fatal to mataafas cause than that he should be made ridiculous and i cannot help feeling that a man who makes his bread by writing fiction labours under the disadvantage of suspicion when he touches on matters of fact if i were even backed up before the world by one other voice people might continue to listen and in the end something might be done but so long as i stand quite alone telling the same story which becomes apparently not only more tedious but less credible by repetition i feel that i am doing nothing good possibly even some evil  now sir you have shown by your questions in the house not only that you remember mataafa but that you are instructed in his case and this exposes you to the trouble of reading this letter  mataafa was made the prisoner of the three powers he had been guilty of rebellion but surely rather formally than really he was the appointed king of samoa the treaty set him aside and he obeyed the three powers his successoror i should rather say his successors advisers and surroundingsfell out with him he was disgusted by the spectacle of their misgovernment in this humour he fell to the study of the berlin act and was misled by the famous passage his successor shall be duly elected according to the laws and customs of samoa it is to be noted that what i will venture to call the infamous protocola measure equally of german vanity english cowardice and american incuriahad not been and has never yet been translated into the samoan language they feared light because their works were darkness for what he did during what i can only call his candidature i must refer you to the last chapter of my book it was rebellion to the three powers to him it was not rebellion the troops of the king attacked him first the sudden arrival and sudden action of captain bickford concluded the affair in the very beginning mataafa surrendered he surrendered to captain bickford he was brought back to apia on captain bickfords ship i shall never forget the captain pointing to the british ensign and saying tell them they are safe under that and the next thing we learned mataafa and his chiefs were transferred to a german warship and carried to the marshalls  who was responsible for this who is responsible now for the care and good treatment of these political prisoners i am far from hinting that the germans actually maltreat him i know even that many of the germans regard him with respect but i can only speak of what i know here it is impossible to send him or any of his chiefs either a present or a letter i believe the mission catholic has been allowed some form of communication on the same occasion i sent down letters and presents they were refused and the officer of the deck on the german warship had so little reticence as to pass the remark o you see you like mataafa we dont in short communication is so completely sundered that for anything we can hear in samoa they may all have been hanged at the yardarm two days out  to take another instance the high chief faamoina was recently married to a young and pleasing wife she desired to follow her husband an old man in bad health and so deservedly popular that he had been given the byname of papalagi mativa or poor white man on account of his charities to our countrymen she was refused again and again she has renewed her applications to be allowed to rejoin him and without the least success  it has been decreed by some one i know not whom that faamoina must have no one to nurse him and that his wife must be left in the anomalous and dangerous position which the treaty powers have made for her i have wearied myself and i fear others by my attempts to get a passage for her or to have her letters sent every one sympathises the german ships now in port are loud in expressions of disapproval and professions of readiness to help her but to whom can we address ourselves who is responsible who is the unknown power that sent mataafa in a german ship to the marshalls instead of in an english ship to fiji that has decreed since that he shall receive not even inconsiderable gifts and open letters and that keeps separated faamoina and his wife  now dear sir these are the facts and i think that i may be excused for being angry at the same time i am well aware that an angry man is a bore i am a man with a grievance and my grievance has the misfortune to be very small and very far away it is very small for it is only the case of under a score of brownskinned men who have been dealt with in the dark by i know not whom and i want to know i want to know by whose authority mataafa was given over into german hands i want to know by whose authority and for how long a term of years he is condemned to the miserable exile of a low island and i want to know how it happens that what is sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander in samoathat the german enemy mataafa has been indefinitely exiled for what is after all scarce more than constructive rebellion and the german friend tamasese for a rebellion which has lasted long enough to threaten us with famine and was disgraced in its beginning by ominous threats against the whites has been punished by a fine of fifty rifles  true i could sympathise with the german officers in their embarrassment here was the son of the old king whom they had raised and whom they had deserted what an unenviable office was theirs when they must make war upon suppress and make a feint of punishing this man to whom they stood bound by a hereditary alliance and to whose father they had already failed so egregiously they were loyal all round they were loyal to their tamasese and got him off with his fine and shall i not be a little loyal to mataafa and will you not help me he is now an old man very piously inclined and i believe he would enter at least the lesser orders of the church if he were suffered to come back but i do not even ask so much as this though i hope it it would be enough if he were brought back to fiji back to the food and fresh water of his childhood back into the daylight from the darkness of the marshalls where some of us could see him where we could write to him and receive answers where he might pass a tolerable old age if you can help me to get this done i am sure that you will never regret it in its small way this is another case of toussaint louverture not so monstrous if you like not on so large a scale but with circumstances of small perfidy that make it almost as odious  i may tell you in conclusion that circumstances cooperating with my tedious insistence the last of the mataafa chiefs here in apia has been liberated from gaol all this time they stayed of their own free will thinking it might injure mataafa if they escaped when others did and you will see by the enclosed paper how these poor fellows spent the first hours of their liberty12 you will see also that i am not the firebrand that i am sometimes painted and that in helping me if you shall decide to do so you will be doing nothing against the peace and prosperity of samoa  with many excuses for having occupied so much of your valuable time i remain yours truly       robert louis stevenson   pson revisal i observe some points in the first place i do not believe captain bickford was to blame i suspect him to have been a victim i have been told but it seems incredible that he underwent an examination about mataafas daughter having been allowed to accompany him certainly he liked his job little and some of his colleagues less       r l s        oct 9  latest intelligence we have received at last a letter from mataafa he is well treated and has good food only complains of not hearing from samoa this has very much relieved our minds but why were they previously left in the dark       r l s   footnote    12 ie in building a section of a new road to mr stevensons     house the paper referred to is a copy of the samoa times     containing a report of the dinner given by mr stevenson at vailima     to inaugurate this new road     letters to young people  i  to miss b        vailima plantation spring 1892  dear friend13please salute your pupils in my name and tell them that a long lean elderly man who lives right through on the underside of the world so that down in your cellar you are nearer him than the people in the street desires his compliments  this man lives on an island which is not very long and is extremely narrow the sea beats round it very hard so that it is difficult to get to shore there is only one harbour where ships come and even that is very wild and dangerous four ships of war were broken there a little while ago and one of them is still lying on its side on a rock clean above water where the sea threw it as you might throw your fiddlebow upon the table all round the harbour the town is strung out it is nothing but wooden houses only there are some churches built of stone they are not very large but the people have never seen such fine buildings almost all the houses are of one story away at one end of the village lives the king of the whole country his palace has a thatched roof which rests upon posts there are no walls but when it blows and rains they have venetian blinds which they let down between the posts making all very snug there is no furniture and the king and the queen and the courtiers sit and eat on the floor which is of gravel the lamp stands there too and every now and then it is upset  these good folk wear nothing but a kilt about their waists unless to go to church or for a dance on the new year or some great occasion the children play marbles all along the street and though they are generally very jolly yet they get awfully cross over their marbles and cry and fight just as boys and girls do at home another amusement in country places is to shoot fish with a little bow and arrow all round the beach there is bright shallow water where the fishes can be seen darting or lying in shoals the child trots round the shore and whenever he sees a fish lets fly an arrow and misses and then wades in after his arrow it is great fun i have tried it for the child and i never heard of it doing any harm to the fishes so what could be more jolly  the road to this lean mans house is uphill all the way and through forests the trees are not so much unlike those at home only here and there some very queer ones are mixed with themcocoanut palms and great trees that are covered with bloom like red hawthorn but not near so bright and from them all thick creepers hang down like ropes and uglylooking weeds that they call orchids grow in the forks of the branches and on the ground many prickly things are dotted which they call pineapples i suppose every one has eaten pineapple drops  on the way up to the lean mans house you pass a little village all of houses like the kings house so that as you ride by you can see everybody sitting at dinner or if it is night lying in their beds by lamplight because all the people are terribly afraid of ghosts and would not lie in the dark for anything after the village there is only one more house and that is the lean mans for the people are not very many and live all by the sea and the whole inside of the island is desert woods and mountains when the lean man goes into the forest he is very much ashamed to own it but he is always in a terrible fright the wood is so great and empty and hot and it is always filled with curious noises birds cry like children and bark like dogs and he can hear people laughing and felling trees and the other day when he was far in the woods he heard a sound like the biggest millwheel possible going with a kind of dotandcarryone movement like a dance that was the noise of an earthquake away down below him in the bowels of the earth and that is the same thing as to say away up toward you in your cellar in kilburn all these noises make him feel lonely and scared and he doesnt quite know what he is scared of once when he was just about to cross a river a blow struck him on the top of his head and knocked him headforemost down the bank and splash into the water it was a nut i fancy that had fallen from a tree by which accident people are sometimes killed but at the time he thought it was a black boy  aha say you and what is a black boy well there are here a lot of poor people who are brought to samoa from distant islands to labour for the germans they are not at all like the king and his people who are brown and very pretty for these are black as negroes and as ugly as sin poor souls and in their own land they live all the time at war and cook and eat mens flesh the germans make them work and every now and then some run away into the bush as the forest is called and build little sheds of leaves and eat nuts and roots and fruits and dwell there by themselves sometimes they are bad and wild and people whisper to each other that some of them have gone back to their horrid old habits and catch men and women in order to eat them but it is very likely not true and the most of them are poor halfstarved pitiful creatures like frightened dogs their life is all very well when the sun shines as it does eight or nine months in the year but it is very different the rest of the time the wind rages then most violently the great trees thrash about like whips the air is filled with leaves and branches flying like birds and the sound of the trees falling shakes the earth it rains too as it never rains at home you can hear a shower while it is yet half a mile away hissing like a showerbath in the forest and when it comes to you the water blinds your eyes and the cold drenching takes your breath away as though some one had struck you in that kind of weather it must be dreadful indeed to live in the woods one man alone by himself and you must know that if the lean man feels afraid to be in the forest the people of the island and the black boys are much more afraid than he for they believe the woods to be quite filled with spirits some like pigs and some like flying things but others and these are thought the most dangerous in the shape of beautiful young women and young men beautifully dressed in the island manner with fine kilts and fine necklaces and crosses of scarlet seeds and flowers woe betide him or her who gets to speak with one of these they will be charmed out of their wits and come home again quite silly and go mad and die so that the poor runaway black boy must be always trembling and looking about for the coming of the demons  sometimes the womendemons go down out of the woods into the villages and here is a tale the lean man heard last year one of the islanders was sitting in his house and he had cooked fish there came along the road two beautiful young women dressed as i told you who came into his house and asked for some of his fish it is the fashion in the islands always to give what is asked and never to ask folks names so the man gave them fish and talked to them in the island jesting way presently he asked one of the women for her red necklace which is good manners and their way he had given the fish and he had a right to ask for something back i will give it you by and by said the woman and she and her companion went away but he thought they were gone very suddenly and the truth is they had vanished the night was nearly come when the man heard the voice of the woman crying that he should come to her and she would give the necklace he looked out and behold she was standing calling him from the top of the sea on which she stood as you might stand on the table at that fear came on the man he fell on his knees and prayed and the woman disappeared  it was said afterward that this was once a woman indeed but she should have died a thousand years ago and has lived all that while as an evil spirit in the woods beside the spring of a river saumaiafe14 is her name in case you want to write to her  ever your friend for whom i thank the stars       tusitala talewriter     ii  to miss b        vailima plantation 14 aug 1892   the lean man is exceedingly ashamed of himself and offers his apologies to the little girls in the cellar just above if they will be so good as to knock three times upon the floor he will hear it on the other side of his floor and will understand that he is forgiven  i left you and the children still on the road to the lean mans house where a great part of the forest has now been cleared away it comes back again pretty quick though not quite so high but everywhere except where the weeders have been kept busy young trees have sprouted up and the cattle and the horses cannot be seen as they feed in this clearing there are two or three houses scattered about and between the two biggest i think the little girls in the cellar would first notice a sort of thing like a gridiron on legs made of logs of wood sometimes it has a flag flying on it made of rags of old clothes it is a fort as i am told built by the person here who would be much the most interesting to the girls in the cellar this is a young gentleman of eleven years of age answering to the name of austin it was after reading a book about the red indians that he thought it more prudent to create this place of strength as the red indians are in north america and this fort seems to me a very useless kind of building i anxiously hope that the two may never be brought together when austin is not engaged in building forts nor on his lessons which are just as annoying to him as other childrens lessons are to them he walks sometimes in the bush and if anybody is with him talks all the time when he is alone i dont think he says anything and i dare say he feels very lonely and frightened just as the samoan does at the queer noises and the endless lines of the trees  he finds the strangest kinds of seeds some of them brightcoloured like lollipops or really like precious stones some of them in odd cases like tobaccopouches he finds and collects all kinds of little shells with which the whole ground is scattered and that though they are the shells of land creatures like our snails are of nearly as many shapes and colours as the shells on our seabeaches in the streams that come running down out of our mountains all as clear and bright as mirrorglass he sees eels and little bright fish that sometimes jump together out of the surface of the brook in a spray of silver and freshwater prawns which lie close under the stones looking up at him through the water with eyes the colour of a jewel he sees all kinds of beautiful birds some of them blue and white and some of them coloured like our pigeons at home and these last the little girls in the cellar may like to know live almost entirely on wild nutmegs as they fall ripe off the trees another little bird he may sometimes see as the lean man saw him only this morning a little fellow not so big as a mans hand exquisitely neat of a pretty bronzy black like ladies shoes who sticks up behind him much as a peacock does his little tail shaped and fluted like a scallopshell  here there are a lot of curious and interesting things that austin sees all round him every day and when i was a child at home in the old country i used to play and pretend to myself that i saw things of the same kindthat the rooms were full of orange and nutmeg trees and the cold town gardens outside the windows were alive with parrots and with lions what do the little girls in the cellar think that austin does he makes believe just the other way he pretends that the strange great trees with their broad leaves and slabsided roots are european oaks and the places on the road up where you and i and the little girls in the cellar have already gone he calls oldfashioned faraway european names just as if you were to call the cellarstairs and the corner of the next streetif you could only manage to pronounce their namesupolu and savaii and so it is with all of us with austin and the lean man and the little girls in the cellar wherever we are it is but a stage on the way to somewhere else and whatever we do however well we do it it is only a preparation to do something else that shall be different  but you must not suppose that austin does nothing but build forts and walk among the woods and swim in the rivers on the contrary he is sometimes a very busy and useful fellow and i think the little girls in the cellar would have admired him very nearly as much as he admired himself if they had seen him setting off on horseback with his hand on his hip and his pocket full of letters and orders at the head of quite a procession of huge white carthorses with packsaddles and big brown native men with nothing on but gaudy kilts mighty well he managed all his commissions and those who saw him ordering and eating his singlehanded luncheon in the queer little chinese restaurant on the beach declare he looked as if the place and the town and the whole archipelago belonged to him  but i am not going to let you suppose that this great gentleman at the head of all his horses and his men like the king of france in the old rhyme would be thought much of a dandy on the streets of london on the contrary if he could be seen with his dirty white cap and his faded purple shirt and his little brown breeks that do not reach his knees and the bare shanks below and the bare feet stuck in the stirrupleathersfor he is not quite long enough to reach the ironsi am afraid the little girls and boys in your part of the town might be very much inclined to give him a penny in charity so you see that a very big man in one place might seem very small potatoes in another just as the kings palace here of which i told you in my last would be thought rather a poor place of residence by a surrey gipsy and if you come to that even the lean man himself who is no end of an important person if he were picked up from the chair where he is now sitting and slung down feet foremost in the neighbourhood of charing cross would probably have to escape into the nearest shop or take the risk of being mobbed and the ladies of his family who are very pretty ladies and think themselves uncommon welldressed for samoa would if the same thing were to be done to them be extremely glad to get into a cab       tusitala     iii  under cover to miss b        vailima 4th sept 1892  dear children in the cellari told you before something of the black boys who come here to work on the plantations and some of whom run away and live a wild life in the forests of the island15 now i want to tell you of one who lived in the house of the lean man like the rest of them here he is a little fellow and when he goes about in old battered cheap european clothes looks very small and shabby when first he came he was as lean as a tobaccopipe and his smile like that of almost all the others was the sort that half makes you wish to smile yourself and half wish to cry however the boys in the kitchen took him in hand and fed him up they would set him down alone to table and wait upon him till he had his fill which was a good long time to wait the first thing we noticed was that his little stomach began to stick out like a pigeons breast and then the food got a little wider spread and he started little calves to his legs and last of all he began to get quite saucy and impudent he is really what you ought to call a young man though i suppose nobody in the whole wide world has any idea of his age and as far as his behaviour goes you can only think of him as a big little child with a good deal of sense  when austin built his fort against the indians arick for that is the black boys name liked nothing so much as to help him and this is very funny when you think that of all the dangerous savages in this island arick is one of the most dangerous the other day besides he made austin a musical instrument of the sort they use in his own countrya harp with only one string he took a stick about three feet long and perhaps four inches round the under side he hollowed out in a deep trench to serve as soundingbox the two ends of the upper side he made to curve upward like the ends of a canoe and between these he stretched the single string he plays upon it with a match or a little piece of stick and sings to it songs of his own country of which no person here can understand a single word and which are very likely all about fighting with his enemies in battle and killing them and i am sorry to say cooking them in a groundoven and eating them for supper when the fight is over  for arick is really what you call a savage though a savage is a very different sort of a person and very much nicer than he is made to appear in little books he is the kind of person that everybody smiles to or makes faces at or gives a smack as he goes by the sort of person that all the girls on the plantation give the best seat to and help first and love to decorate with flowers and ribbons and yet all the while are laughing at him the sort of person who likes best to play with austin and whom austin perhaps when he is allowed likes best to play with he is all grins and giggles and little steps out of dances and little droll ways to attract peoples attention and set them laughing and yet when you come to look at him closely you will find that his body is all covered with scars this happened when he was a child there was war as is the way in these wild islands between his village and the next much as if there were war in london between one street and another and all the children ran about playing in the middle of the trouble and i dare say took no more notice of the war than you children in london do of a general election but sometimes at general elections english children may get run over by processions in the street and it chanced that as little arick was running about in the bush and very busy about his playing he ran into the midst of the warriors on the other side these speared him with a poisoned spear and his own people when they had found him in order to cure him of the poison scored him with knives that were probably made of fishbone  this is a very savage piece of childlife and arick for all his good nature is still a very savage person i have told you how the black boys sometimes run away from the plantations and live alone in the forest building little sheds to protect them from the rain and sometimes planting little gardens for food but for the most part living the best they can upon the nuts of the trees and the yams that they dig with their hands out of the earth i do not think there can be anywhere in the world people more wretched than these runaways they cannot return for they would only return to be punished they can never hope to see again their own peopleindeed i do not know what they can hope but just to find enough yams every day to keep them from starvation and in the wet season of the year which is our summer and your winter when the rain falls day after day far harder and louder than the loudest thunderplump that ever fell in england and the room is so dark that the lean man is sometimes glad to light his lamp to write by i can think of nothing so dreary as the state of these poor runaways in the houseless bush you are to remember besides that the people of the island hate and fear them because they are cannibals sit and tell tales of them about their lamps at night in their own comfortable houses and are sometimes afraid to lie down to sleep if they think there is a lurking black boy in the neighbourhood well now arick is of their own race and language only he is a little more lucky because he has not run away and how do you think that he proposed to help them he asked if he might not have a gun what do you want with a gun arick was asked he answered quite simply and with his nice goodnatured smile that if he had a gun he would go up into the high bush and shoot black boys as men shoot pigeons he said nothing about eating them nor do i think he really meant to i think all he wanted was to clear the plantation of vermin as gamekeepers at home kill weasels or rats  the other day he was sent on an errand to the german company where many of the black boys live it was very late when he came home he had a white bandage round his head his eyes shone and he could scarcely speak for excitement it seems some of the black boys who were his enemies at home had attacked him one with a knife by his own account he had fought very well but the odds were heavy the man with the knife had cut him both in the head and back he had been struck down and if some black boys of his own side had not come to the rescue he must certainly have been killed i am sure no christmasbox could make any of you children so happy as this fight made arick a great part of the next day he neglected his work to play upon the onestringed harp and sing songs about his great victory today when he is gone upon his holiday he has announced that he is going back to the german firm to have another battle and another triumph i do not think he will go all the same or i should be uneasy for i do not want to have my arick killed and there is no doubt that if he begins this fight again he will be likely to go on with it very far for i have seen him once when he saw or thought he saw an enemy  it was one of those dreadful days of rain the sound of it like a great waterfall or like a tempest of wind blowing in the forest and there came to our door two runaway black boys seeking refuge in such weather as that my enemys dog as shakespeare says should have had a right to shelter but when arick saw the two poor rogues coming with their empty stomachs and drenched clothes one of them with a stolen cutlass in his hand through that world of falling water he had no thought of any pity in his heart crouching behind one of the pillars of the verandah to which he clung with his two hands his mouth drew back into a strange sort of smile his eyes grew bigger and bigger and his whole face was just like the one word murder in big capitals  but i have told you a great deal too much about poor aricks savage nature and now i must tell you of a great amusement he had the other day there came an english ship of war into the harbour and the officers goodnaturedly gave an entertainment of songs and dances and a magic lantern to which arick and austin were allowed to go at the door of the hall there were crowds of black boys waiting and trying to peep in as children at home lie about and peep under the tent of a circus and you may be sure arick was a very proud person when he passed them all by and entered the hall with his ticket  i wish i knew what he thought of the whole performance but a friend of the lean man who sat just in front of arick tells me what seemed to startle him most the first thing was when two of the officers came out with blackened faces like minstrels and began to dance arick was sure that they were really black and his own people and he was wonderfully surprised to see them dance in this new european style  but the great affair was the magic lantern the hall was made quite dark which was very little to aricks taste he sat there behind my friend nothing to be seen of him but eyes and teeth and his heart was beating finely in his little scarred breast and presently there came out of the white sheet that great big eye of light that i am sure all you children must have often seen it was quite new to arick he had no idea what would happen next and in his fear and excitement he laid hold with his little slim black fingers like a birds claw on the neck of the friend in front of him all through the rest of the show as one picture followed another on the white sheet he sat there grasping and clutching and goodness knows whether he were more pleased or frightened  doubtless it was a very fine thing to see all those bright pictures coming out and dying away again one after another but doubtless it was rather alarming also for how was it done at last when there appeared upon the screen the head of a black woman as it might be his own mother or sister and this black woman of a sudden began to roll her eyes the fear or the excitement whichever it was rung out of him a loud shuddering sob i think we all ought to admire his courage when after an evening spent in looking at such wonderful miracles he and austin set out alone through the forest to the lean mans house it was late at night and pitch dark when some of the party overtook the little white boy and the big black boy marching among the trees with their lantern i have told you this wood has an ill name and all the people of the island believe it to be full of evil spirits it is a pretty dreadful place to walk in by the moving light of a lantern with nothing about you but a curious whirl of shadows and the black night above and beyond but arick kept his courage up and i dare say austins too with a perpetual chatter so that the people coming after heard his voice long before they saw the shining of the lantern       tusitala     iv  to austin strong        vailima november 2 1892  my dear austinfirst and foremost i think you will be sorry to hear that our poor friend arick has gone back to the german firm he had not been working very well and we had talked of sending him off before but remembering how thin he was when he came here and seeing what fat little legs and what a comfortable little stomach he had laid on in the meanwhile we found we had not the heart the other day however he set up chat to henry the samoan overseer asking him who he was and where he came from and refusing to obey his orders i was in bed in the workmens house having a fever uncle lloyd came over to me told me of it and i had arick sent up i told him i would give him another chance he was taken out and asked to apologise to henry but he would do no such thing he preferred to go back to the german firm so we hired a couple of samoans who were up here on a visit to the boys and packed him off in their charge to the firm where he arrived safely and a receipt was given for him like a parcel16  sunday last the alameda returned your mother was off bright and early with palema for it is a very curious thing but is certainly the case that she was very impatient to get news of a young person by the name of austin mr gurr lent a horse for the captainit was a pretty big horse but our handsome captain as you know is a very big captain indeed now do you remember misifoloa tall thin hovea boy that came shortly before you left he had been riding up this same horse of gurrs just the day before and the horse threw him off at motootua corner and cut his hip so misifolo called out to the captain as he rode by that that was a very bad horse that it ran away and threw people off and that he had best be careful and the funny thing is that the captain did not like it at all the foal might as well have tried to run away with vailima as that horse with captain morse which is poetry as you see into the bargain but the captain was not at all in that way of thinking and was never really happy until he had got his foot on ground again it was just then that the horse began to be happy too so they parted in one mind but the horse is still wondering what kind of piece of artillery he had brought up to vailima last sunday morning so far it was all right the captain was got safe off the wicked horse but how was he to get back again to apia and the alameda  happy thoughtthere was donald the big packhorse the last time donald was ridden he had upon him a hairpin and a peaby which i meanonce again to drop into poetry you and me now he was to have a rider more suited to his size he was brought up to the doorhe looked a mountain a stepladder was put alongside of him the captain approached the stepladder and he looked an alp i wasnt as much afraid for the horse as i was for the stepladder but it bore the strain and with a kind of sickening smash that you might have heard at monterey the captain descended to the saddle now dont think that i am exaggerating but at the moment when that enormous captain settled down upon donald the horses hindlegs gave visibly under the strain what the couple looked like one on top of tother no words can tell you and your mother must here draw a picture    your respected uncle      o tusitala     v  to austin strong        vailima november 15 1892  my dear austinthe new house is begun it stands out nearly half way over towards pineapple cottagethe lower floor is laid and the uprights of the wall are set up so that the big lower room wants nothing but a roof over its head when it rains as it does mostly all the time you never saw anything look so sorry for itself as that room left outside beyond the house there is a workshed roofed with sheets of iron and in front over about half the lawn the lumber for the house lies piled it is about the bringing up of this lumber that i want to tell you  for about a fortnight there were at work upon the job two german overseers about a hundred black boys and from twelve to twentyfour draughtoxen it rained about half the time and the road was like lather for shaving the black boys seemed to have had a new rigout they had almost all shirts of scarlet flannel and lavalavas the samoan kilt either of scarlet or light blue as the day got warm they took off the shirts and it was a very curious thing as you went down to apia on a bright day to come upon one tree after another in the empty forest with these shirts stuck among the branches like vermilion birds  i observed that many of the boys had a very queer substitute for a pocket this was nothing more than a string which some of them tied about their upper arms and some about their necks and in which they stuck their clay pipes and as i dont suppose they had anything else to carry it did very well some had feathers in their hair and some long stalks of grass through the holes in their noses i suppose this was intended to make them look pretty poor dears but you know what a black boy looks like and these black boys for all their blue and their scarlet and their grass looked just as shabby and small and sad and sorry for themselves and like sick monkeys as any of the rest  as you went down the road you came upon them first working in squads of two each squad shouldered a couple of planks and carried them up about two hundred feet gave them to two others and walked back emptyhanded to the places they had started from it wasnt very hard work and they didnt go about it at all lively but of course when it rained and the mud was deep the poor fellows were unhappy enough this was in the upper part about troods below all the way down to tanugamanono you met the bullockcarts coming and going each with ten or twenty men to attend upon it and often enough with one of the overseers near quite a far way off through the forest you could hear the noise of one of these carts approaching the road was like a bog and though a good deal wider than it was when you knew it so narrow that the bullocks reached quite across it with the span of their big horns to pass by it was necessary to get into the bush on one side or the other the bullocks seemed to take no interest in their business they looked angry and stupid and sullen beyond belief and when it came to a heavy bit of the road as often as not they would stop  as long as they were going the black boys walked in the margin of the bush on each side pushing the cartwheels with hands and shoulders and raising the most extraordinary outcry it was strangely like some very big kind of bird perhaps the great flying creatures that lived upon the earth long before man came if we could have come near one of their meetingplaces would have given us just such a concert  when one of the bullamacows17 stopped altogether the fun was highest the bullamacow stood on the road his head fixed fast in the yoke chewing a little breathing very hard and showing in his red eye that if he could get rid of the yoke he would show them what a circus was all the black boys tailed on to the wheels and the back of the cart stood there getting their spirits up and then of a sudden set to shooing and singing out it was these outbursts of shrill cries that it was so curious to hear in the distance one such stuck cart i came up to and asked what was the worry old fool bullamacow stop same place was the reply i never saw any of the overseers near any of the stuck carts you were a very much better overseer than either of these  while this was going on i had to go down to apia five or six different times and each time there were a hundred black boys to say goodmorning to this was rather a tedious business and as very few of them answered at all and those who did only with a grunt like a pigs it was several times in my mind to give up this piece of politeness the last time i went down i was almost decided but when i came to the first pair of black boys and saw them looking so comic and so melancholy i began the business over again this time i thought more of them seemed to answer and when i got down to the tailend where the carts were running i received a very pleasant surprise for one of the boys who was pushing at the back of a cart lifted up his head and called out to me in wonderfully good english you good manalways say goodmorning it was sad to think that these poor creatures should think so much of so small a piece of civility and strange that thinking so they should be so dull as not to return it       uncle louis     vi  to austin strong        june 18 1893  respected hopkins18this is to inform you that the jersey cow had an elegant little cowcalf sunday last there was a great deal of rejoicing of course but i dont know whether or not you remember the jersey cow whatever else she is the jersey cow is not goodnatured and dines who was up here on some other business went down to the paddock to get a hood and to milk her the hood is a little wooden board with two holes in it by which it is hung from her horns i dont know how he got it on and i dont believe he does anyway in the middle of the operation in came bull bazett with his head down and roaring like the last trumpet dines and all his merry men hid behind trees in the paddock and skipped dines then got upon a horse plied his spurs and cleared for apia the next time he is asked to meddle with our cows he will probably want to know the reason why meanwhile there was the cow with the board over her eyes left tied by a pretty long rope to a small tree in the paddock and who was to milk her she roaredi was going to say like a bull but it was bazett who did that walking up and down switching his tail and the noise of the pair of them was perfectly dreadful  palema went up to the bush to call lloyd and lloyd came down in one of his knowallaboutit moods it was perfectly simple he said the cow was hooded anybody could milk her all you had to do was to draw her up to the tree and get a hitch about it so he untied the cow and drew her up close to the tree and got a hitch about it right enough and then the cow brought her intellect to bear on the subject and proceeded to walk round the tree to get the hitch off  illustration  now this is geometry which youll have to learn some day the tree is the centre of two circles the cow had a radius of about two feet and went leisurely round a small circle the man had a radius of about thirty feet and either he must let the cow get the hitch unwound or else he must take up his two feet to about the height of his eyes and race round a big circle this was racing and chasing  the cow walked quietly round and round the tree to unwind herself and first lloyd and then palema and then lloyd again scampered round the big circle and fell and got up again and bounded like a deer to keep her hitched  it was funny to see but we couldnt laugh with a good heart for every now and then when the man who was running tumbled down the cow would get a bit ahead and i promise you there was then no sound of any laughter but we rather edged away toward the gate looking to see the crazy beast loose and charging us to add to her attractions the board had fallen partly off and only covered one eye giving her the look of a crazy old woman in a sydney slum meanwhile the calf stood looking on a little perplexed and seemed to be saying well now is this life it doesnt seem as if it was all it was cracked up to be and this is my mamma what a very impulsive lady  all the time from the lower paddock we could hear bazett roaring like the deep seas and if we cast our eye that way we could see him switching his tail as a very angry gentleman may sometimes switch his cane and the jersey would every now and then put up her head and low like the pu19 for dinner and take it for all in all it was a very striking scene poor uncle lloyd had plenty of time to regret having been in such a hurry so had poor palema who was let into the business and ran until he was nearly dead afterward palema went and sat on a gate where your mother sketched him and she is going to send you the sketch and the end of it well we got her tied again i really dont know how and came stringing back to the house with our tails between our legs that night at dinner the tamaitai20 bid us tell the boys to be very careful not to frighten the cow it was too much the cow had frightened us in such fine style that we all broke down and laughed like mad  general hoskyns there is no further news your excellency that i am aware of but it may interest you to know that mr christian held his twentyfifth birthday yesterdaya quarter of a living century old think of it drink of it innocent youthand asked down lloyd and daplyn to a feast at one oclock and daplyn went at seven and got nothing to eat at all whether they had anything to drink i know notno not i but its to be hoped so also your uncle lloyd has stopped smoking and he doesnt like it much also that your mother is most beautifully gotten up today in a pink gown with a topaz stone in front of it and is really looking like an angel only that she isnt like an angel at allonly like your mother herself  also that the tamaitai has been waxing the floor of the big room so that it shines in the most ravishing manner and then we insisted on coming in and she wouldnt let us and we came anyway and have made the vilest mess of itbut still it shines  also that i am your excellencys obedient servant       uncle louis     vii  to austin strong   my dear hutchinsonthis is not going to be much of a letter so dont expect what cant be had uncle lloyd and palema made a malanga21 to go over the island to siumu and talolo was anxious to go also but how could we get along without him well misifolo the maypole set off on saturday and walked all that day down the island to beyond faleasiu with a letter for iopu and iopu and tali and misifolo rose very early on the sunday morning and walked all that day up the island and came by seven at nightall pretty tired and misifolo most of allto tanugamanono22 we at vailima knew nothing at all about the marchings of the saturday and sunday but uncle lloyd got his boys and things together and went to bed  a little after five in the morning i awoke and took the lantern and went out of the front door and round the verandahs there was never a spark of dawn in the east only the stars looked a little pale and i expected to find them all asleep in the workhouse but no the stove was roaring and talolo and fono who was to lead the party were standing together talking by the stove and one of fonos young men was lying asleep on the sofa in the smokingroom wrapped in his lavalava i had my breakfast at halfpast five that morning and the bell rang before six when it was just the grey of dawn but by seven the feast was spreadthere was lopu coming up with tali at his heels and misifolo bringing up the rearand talolo could go the malanga  off they set with two guns and three porters and fono and lloyd and palema and talolo himself with best sundaygotomeeting lavalava rolled up under his arm and a very sore foot but much he caredhe was smiling from ear to ear and would have gone to siumu over redhot coals off they set round the corner of the cookhouse and into the bush beside the chickenhouse and so goodbye to them  but you should see how iopu has taken possession never saw a place in such a state is written on his face in my time says he we didnt let things go ragging along like this and im going to show you fellows the first thing he did was to apply for a bar of soap and then he set to work washing everything that had all been washed last friday in the regular course then he had the grass cut all round the cookhouse and i tell you but he found scraps and odds and ends and grew more angry and indignant at each fresh discovery  if a white chief came up here and smelt this how would you feel he asked your mother it is enough to breed a sickness  and i dare say you remember this was just what your mother had often said to himself and did say the day she went out and cried on the kitchen steps in order to make talolo ashamed but iopu gave it all out as little new discoveries of his own the last thing was the cows and i tell you he was solemn about the cows they were all destroyed he said nobody knew how to milk except himselfwhere he is about right then came dinner and a delightful little surprise perhaps you remember that long ago i used not to eat mashed potatoes but had always two or three boiled in a plate this has not been done for months because talolo makes such admirable mashed potatoes that i have caved in but here came dinner mashed potatoes for your mother and the tamaitai and then boiled potatoes in a plate for me  and there is the end of the tale of the return of iopu up to date what more there may be is in the lap of the gods and sir i am yours considerably       uncle louis     viii  to austin strong   my dear hoskynsi am kept away in a cupboard because everybody has the influenza i never see anybody at all and never do anything whatever except to put ink on paper up here in my room so what can i find to write to youyou who are going to school and getting up in the morning to go bathing and having it seems to me rather a fine time of it in general  you ask if we have seen arick yes your mother saw him at the head of a gang of boys and looking fat and sleek and welltodo i have an idea that he misbehaved here because he was homesick for the other black boys and didnt know how else to get back to them well he has got them now and i hope he likes it better than i should  i read the other day something that i thought would interest so great a seabather as yourself you know that the fishes that we see and catch go only a certain way down into the sea below a certain depth there is no life at all the water is as empty as the air is above a certain height even the shells of dead fishes that come down there are crushed into nothing by the huge weight of the water lower still in the places where the sea is profoundly deep it appears that life begins again people fish up in dredgingbuckets loose rags and tatters of creatures that hang together all right down there with the great weight holding them in one but come all to pieces as they are hauled up just what they look like just what they do or feed upon we shall never find out only that we have some flimsy fellowcreatures down in the very bottom of the deep seas and cannot get them up except in tatters it must be pretty dark where they live and there are no plants or weeds and no fish come down there or drowned sailors either from the upper parts because these are all mashed to pieces by the great weight long before they get so far or else come to a place where perhaps they float but i dare say a cannon sometimes comes careering solemnly down and circling about like a dead leaf or thistledown and then the ragged fellows go and play about the cannon and tell themselves all kinds of stories about the fish higher up and their iron houses and perhaps go inside and sleep and perhaps dream of it all like their betters  of course you know a cannon down there would be quite light even in shallow water where men go down with a divingdress they grow so light that they have to hang weights about their necks and have their boots loaded with twenty pounds of leadas i know to my sorrow and with all this and the helmet which is heavy enough of itself to any one up here in the thin air they are carried about like gossamers and have to take every kind of care not to be upset and stood upon their heads i went down once in the dress and speak from experience but if we could get down for a moment near where the fishes are we should be in a tight place suppose the water not to crush us which it would we should pitch about in every kind of direction every step we took would carry us as far as if we had sevenleague boots and we should keep flying head over heels and top over bottom like the liveliest clowns in the world  well sir here is a great deal of words put down upon a piece of paper and if you think that makes a letter why very well and if you dont i cant help it for i have nothing under heaven to tell you  so with kindest wishes to yourself and louie and aunt nellie believe me your affectionate       uncle louis   now here is something more worth telling you this morning at six oclock i saw all the horses together in the front paddock and in a terrible ado about something presently i saw a man with two buckets on the march and knew where the trouble wasthe cow the whole lot cleared to the gate but twodonald the big white horse and my jack they stood solitary one here one there i began to get interested for i thought jack was off his feed in came the man with the bucket and all the ruck of curious horses at his tail right round he went to where donald stood d and poured out a feed and the majestic donald ate it and the ruck of common horses followed the man on he went to the second station jacks j in the plan and poured out a feed and the fools of horses went in with him to the next place a in the plan and behold as the train swung round the last of them came curiously too near jack and jack left his feed and rushed upon this fool with a kind of outcry and the fool fled and jack returned to his feed and he and donald ate theirs with glory while the others were still circling round for fresh feeds  illustration  glory be to the name of donald and to the name of jack for they had found out where the foods were poured and each took his station and waited there donald at the first of the course for his jack at the second station while all the impotent fools ran round and round after the man with his buckets       r l s     ix  to austin strong        vailima  my dear austinnow when the overseer is away23 i think it my duty to report to him anything serious that goes on on the plantation  early the other afternoon we heard that sinas foot was very bad and soon after that we could have heard her cries as far away as the front balcony i think sina rather enjoys being ill and makes as much of it as she possibly can but all the same it was painful to hear the cries and there is no doubt she was at least very uncomfortable i went up twice to the little room behind the stable and found her lying on the floor with tali and faauma and talolo all holding on different bits of her i gave her an opiate but whenever she was about to go to sleep one of these silly people would be shaking her or talking in her ear and then she would begin to kick about again and scream  palema and aunt maggie took horse and went down to apia after the doctor right on their heels off went mitaele on musu to fetch tauilo talolos mother so here was all the island in a bustle over sinas foot no doctor came but he told us what to put on when i went up at night to the little room i found tauilo there and the whole plantation boxed into the place like little birds in a nest they were sitting on the bed they were sitting on the table the floor was full of them and the place as close as the engineroom of a steamer in the middle lay sina about three parts asleep with opium two ablebodied workboys were pulling at her arms and whenever she closed her eyes calling her by name and talking in her ear i really didnt know what would become of the girl before morning whether or not she had been very ill before this was the way to make her so and when one of the workboys woke her up again i spoke to him very sharply and told tauilo she must put a stop to it  now i suppose this was what put it into tauilos head to do what she did next you remember tauilo and what a fine tall strong madame lafarge sort of person she is and you know how much afraid the natives are of the evil spirits in the wood and how they think all sickness comes from them up stood tauilo and addressed the spirit in sinas foot and scolded it and the spirit answered and promised to be a good boy and go away i do not feel so much afraid of the demons after this it was faauma told me about it i was going out into the pantry after sodawater and found her with a lantern drawing water from the tank bad spirit he go away she told me  thats firstrate said i do you know what the name of that spirit was his name was tautala talking  o no she said his name is tu  you might have knocked me down with a straw how on earth do you know that i asked  heerd him tell tauilo she said  as soon as i heard that i began to suspect mrs tauilo was a little bit of a ventriloquist and imitating as well as i could the sort of voice they make asked her if the bad spirit did not talk like that faauma was very much surprised and told me that was just his voice  well that was a very good business for the evening the people all went away because the demon was gone away and the circus was over and sina was allowed to sleep but the trouble came after there had been an evil spirit in that room and his name was tu no one could say when he might come back again they all voted it was tu much and now talolo and sina have had to be lodged in the soldier room24 as for the little room by the stable there it stands empty it is too small to play soldiers in and i do not see what we can do with it except to have a nice brass nameplate engraved in sydney or in frisco and stuck upon the door of itmr tu  so you see that ventriloquism has its bad side as well as its good sides and i dont know that i want any more ventriloquists on this plantation we shall have tu in the cookhouse next and then tu in lafaeles and tu in the workmans cottage and the end of it all will be that we shall have to take the tamaitais room for the kitchen and my room for the boys sleepinghouse and we shall all have to go out and camp under umbrellas  well where you are there may be schoolmasters but there is no such thing as mr tu  now its all very well that these big people should be frightened out of their wits by an old wife talking with her mouth shut that is one of the things we happen to know about all the old women in the world might talk with their mouths shut and not frighten you or me but there are plenty of other things that frighten us badly and if we only knew about them perhaps we should find them no more worthy to be feared than an old woman talking with her mouth shut and the names of some of these things are death and pain and sorrow       uncle louis     x  to austin strong        jan 27 1893  dear general hoskynsi have the honour to report as usual your giddy mother having gone planting a flowergarden i am obliged to write with my own hand and of course nobody will be able to read it this has been a very mean kind of a month aunt maggie left with the influenza we have heard of her from sydney and she is all right again but we have inherited her influenza and it made a poor place of vailima we had talolo mitaele sosimo iopu sina misifolo and myself all sick in bed at the same time and was not that a pretty dish to set before the king the big hall of the new house having no furniture the sick pitched their tents in iti mean their mosquitonetslike a military camp the tamaitai and your mother went about looking after them and managed to get us something to eat henry the good boy though he was getting it himself did housework and went round at night from one mosquitonet to another praying with the sick sina too was as good as gold and helped us greatly we shall always like her better all the timei do not know how they managedyour mother found the time to come and write for me and for three days as i had my old trouble on and had to play dumb man i dictated a novel in the deafanddumb alphabet but now we are all recovered and getting to feel quite fit a new paddock has been made the wires come right up to the top of the hill pass within twenty yards of the big clump of flowers if you remember that and by the end of the pineapple patch the tamaitai and your mother and i all sleep in the upper story of the new house uncle lloyd is alone in the workmans cottage and there is nobody at all at night in the old house but ants and cats and mosquitoes the whole inside of the new house is varnished it is a beautiful goldenbrown by day and in lamplight all black and sparkle in the corner of the hall the new safe is built in and looks as if it had millions of pounds in it but i do not think there is much more than twenty dollars and a spoon or two so the man that opens it will have a great deal of trouble for nothing our great fear is lest we should forget how to open it but it will look just as well if we cant poor misifoloyou remember the thin boy do you nothad a desperate attack of influenza and he was in a great taking you would not like to be very sick in some savage place in the islands and have only the savages to doctor you well that was just the way he felt it is all very well he thought to let these childish white people doctor a sore foot or a toothache but this is seriousi might die of this for goodness sake let me get away into a draughty native house where i can lie in cold gravel eat green bananas and have a real grownup tattooed man to raise spirits and say charms over me a day or two we kept him quiet and got him much better then he said he must go he had had his back broken in his own islands he said it had come broken again and he must go away to a native house and have it mended confound your back said we lie down in your bed at last one day his fever was quite gone and he could give his mind to the broken back entirely he lay in the hall i was in the room alone all morning and noon i heard him roaring like a bull calf so that the floor shook with it it was plainly humbug it had the humbugging sound of a bad child crying and about two of the afternoon we were worn out and told him he might go off he set he was in some kind of a white wrapping with a great white turban on his head as pale as clay and walked leaning on a stick but o he was a glad boy to get away from these foolish savage childish white people and get his broken back put right by somebody with some sense he nearly died that night and little wonder but he has now got better again and long may it last all the others were quite good trusted us wholly and stayed to be cured where they were but then he was quite right if you look at it from his point of view for though we may be very clever we do not set up to cure broken backs if a man has his back broken we white people can do nothing at all but bury him and was he not wise since that was his complaint to go to folks who could do more  best love to yourself and louie and aunt nellie and apologies for so dull a letter from your respectful and affectionate       uncle louis   footnotes    13 the lady to whom the first three of these letters are addressed     used to hear writes mr lloyd osbourne so frequently of the     boys in vailima that she wrote and asked mr stevenson for news of     them as it would so much interest her little girls in the tropics     for some reason or other that it is impossible to understand     servants and workpeople are always called boys though the years     of methuselah may have whitened their heads and greatgrandchildren     prattle about their knees mr stevenson was amused to think that his     boys who ranged from eighteen years of age to threescore and ten     should be mistaken for little youngsters but he was touched to hear     of the sick children his friend tried so hard to entertain and     gladly wrote a few letters to them he would have written more but     for the fact that his friend left the home being transferred     elsewhere    14 comeathousand    15 the german company from which we got our black boy arick owns     and cultivates many thousands of acres in samoa and keeps at least a     thousand black people to work on its plantations two schooners are     always busy in bringing fresh batches to samoa and in taking home to     their own islands the men who have worked out their three years term     of labour this traffic in human beings is called the labour trade     and is the lifes blood not only of the great german company but of     all the planters in fiji queensland new caledonia german new     guinea the solomon islands and the new hebrides the difference     between the labour trade as it is now carried on under government     supervision and the slave trade is a great one but not great enough     to please sensitive people in samoa the missionaries are not allowed     by the company to teach these poor savages religion or to do     anything to civilise them and raise them from their monkeylike     ignorance but in other respects the company is not a bad master and     treats its people pretty well the system however is one that     cannot be defended and must sooner or later be suppressedlo    16 when arick left us and went back to the german company he had     grown so fat and strong and intelligent that they deemed he was made     for better things than for cottonpicking or plantation work and     handed him over to their surveyor who needed a man to help him i     used often to meet him after this tripping at his masters heels     with the theodolite or scampering about with tapes and chains like a     kitten with a spool of thread he did not look then as though he were     destined to die of a broken heart though that was his end not so     many months afterward the plantation manager told me that arick and     a new ireland boy went crazy with homesickness and died in the     hospital togetherlo    17 bullamacow is a word that always amuses the visitor to samoa     when the first pair of cattle was brought to the islands and the     natives asked the missionaries what they must call these strange     creatures they were told that the english name was a bull and a     cow but the samoans thought that a bull and a cow was the name of     each of the animals and they soon corrupted the english words into     bullamacow which has remained the name for beef or cattle ever     sincelo    18 in the letters that were sent to austin strong you will be     surprised to see his name change from austin to hoskyns and from     hopkins to hutchinson it was the penalty master austin had to pay     for being the particular and bosom friend of each of the one hundred     and eighty bluejackets that made up the crew of the
