88248552	the holy war     to the reader    tis strange to me that they that love to tell things done of old yea and that do excel their equals in historiology speak not of mansouls wars but let them lie dead like old fables or such worthless things that to the reader no advantage brings when men let them make what they will their own till they know this are to themselves unknown of stories i well know theres divers sorts some foreign some domestic and reports are thereof made as fancy leads the writers by books a man may guess at the inditers some will again of that which never was nor will be feign and that without a cause such matter raise such mountains tell such things of men of laws of countries and of kings and in their story seem to be so sage and with such gravity clothe every page that though their frontispiece says all is vain yet to their way disciples they obtain but readers i have somewhat else to do than with vain stories thus to trouble you what here i say some men do know so well they can with tears and joy the story tell the town of mansoul is well known to many nor are her troubles doubted of by any that are acquainted with those histories that mansoul and her wars anatomize then lend thine ear to what i do relate touching the town of mansoul and her state how she was lost took captive made a slave and how against him set that should her save yea how by hostile ways she did oppose her lord and with his enemy did close for they are true  he that will them deny must needs the best of records vilify for my part i myself was in the town both when twas set up and when pulling down i saw diabolus in his possession and mansoul also under his oppression yea i was there when she ownd him for lord and to him did submit with one accord when mansoul trampled upon things divine and wallowed in filth as doth a swine when she betook herself unto her arms fought her emmanuel despisd his charms then i was there and did rejoice to see diabolus and mansoul so agree let no men then count me a fablemaker nor make my name or credit a partaker of their derision  what is here in view of mine own knowledge i dare say is true i saw the princes armed men come down by troops by thousands to besiege the town i saw the captains heard the trumpets sound and how his forces covered all the ground yea how they set themselves in battleray i shall remember to my dying day i saw the colours waving in the wind and they within to mischief how combind to ruin mansoul and to make away her primum mobile without delay i saw the mounts cast up against the town and how the slings were placed to beat it down i heard the stones fly whizzing by mine ears what longer kept in mind than got in fears i heard them fall and saw what work they made and how old mors did cover with his shade the face of mansoul and i heard her cry woe worth the day in dying i shall die i saw the batteringrams and how they playd to beat open eargate and i was afraid not only eargate but the very town would by those batteringrams be beaten down i saw the fights and heard the captains shout and in each battle saw who faced about i saw who wounded were and who were slain and who when dead would come to life again i heard the cries of those that wounded were while others fought like men bereft of fear and while the cry kill kill was in mine ears the gutters ran not so with blood as tears indeed the captains did not always fight but then they would molest us day and night their cry up fall on let us take the town kept us from sleeping or from lying down i was there when the gates were broken ope and saw how mansoul then was strippd of hope i saw the captains march into the town how there they fought and did their foes cut down i heard the prince bid boanerges go up to the castle and there seize his foe and saw him and his fellows bring him down in chains of great contempt quite through the town i saw emmanuel when he possessd his town of mansoul and how greatly blest a town his gallant town of mansoul was when she received his pardon loved his laws when the diabolonians were caught when tried and when to execution brought then i was there yea i was standing by when mansoul did the rebels crucify i also saw mansoul clad all in white i heard her prince call her his hearts delight i saw him put upon her chains of gold and rings and bracelets goodly to behold what shall i say  i heard the peoples cries and saw the prince wipe tears from mansouls eyes and heard the groans and saw the joy of many tell you of all i neither will nor can i but by what here i say you well may see that mansouls matchless wars no fables be mansoul the desire of both princes was one keep his gain would tother gain his loss diabolus would cry the town is mine emmanuel would plead a right divine unto his mansoul  then to blows they go and mansoul cries these wars will me undo mansoul her wars seemed endless in her eyes shes lost by one becomes anothers prize and he again that lost her last would swear have her i will or her in pieces tear mansoul it was the very seat of war wherefore her troubles greater were by far than only where the noise of war is heard or where the shaking of a sword is feard or only where small skirmishes are fought or where the fancy fighteth with a thought she saw the swords of fighting men made red and heard the cries of those with them wounded must not her frights then be much more by far than theirs that to such doings strangers are or theirs that hear the beating of a drum but not made fly for fear from house and home mansoul not only heard the trumpets sound but saw her gallants gasping on the ground wherefore we must not think that she could rest with them whose greatest earnest is but jest or where the blustring threatning of great wars do end in parlies or in wording jars mansoul her mighty wars they did portend her weal or woe and that world without end wherefore she must be more concernd than they whose fears begin and end the selfsame day or where none other harm doth come to him that is engaged but loss of life or limb as all must needs confess that now do dwell in universe and can this story tell

thee the letters makenu hony in a b  john bunyan    a relation of the holy war    in my travels as i walked through many regions and countries it was my chance to happen into that famous continent of universe  a very large and spacious country it is  it lieth between the two poles and just amidst the four points of the heavens  it is a place well watered and richly adorned with hills and valleys bravely situate and for the most part at least where i was very fruitful also well peopled and a very sweet air  the people are not all of one complexion nor yet of one language mode or way of religion but differ as much as it is said do the planets themselves  some are right and some are wrong even as it happeneth to be in lesser regions  in this country as i said it was my lot to travel and there travel i did and that so long even till i learned much of their mother tongue together with the customs and manners of them among whom i was  and to speak truth i was much delighted to see and hear many things which i saw and heard among them yea i had to be sure even lived and died a native among them so was i taken with them and their doings had not my master sent for me home to his house there to do business for him and to oversee business done  now there is in this gallant country of universe a fair and delicate town a corporation called mansoul a town for its building so curious for its situation so commodious for its privileges so advantageous i mean with reference to its origin that i may say of it as was said before of the continent in which it is placed there is not its equal under the whole heaven  as to the situation of this town it lieth just between the two worlds and the first founder and builder of it so far as by the best and most authentic records i can gather was one shaddai and he built it for his own delight  he made it the mirror and glory of all that he made even the toppiece beyond anything else that he did in that country  yea so goodly a town was mansoul when first built that it is said by some the gods at the setting up thereof came down to see it and sang for joy  and as he made it goodly to behold so also mighty to have dominion over all the country round about  yea all were commanded to acknowledge mansoul for their metropolitan all were enjoined to do homage to it  aye the town itself had positive commission and power from her king to demand service of all and also to subdue any that anyways denied to do it  there was reared up in the midst of this town a most famous and stately palace for strength it might be called a castle for pleasantness a paradise for largeness a place so copious as to contain all the world  this place the king shaddai intended but for himself alone and not another with him partly because of his own delights and partly because he would not that the terror of strangers should be upon the town  this place shaddai made also a garrison of but committed the keeping of it only to the men of the town  the walls of the town were well built yea so fast and firm were they knit and compact together that had it not been for the townsmen themselves they could not have been shaken or broken for ever  for here lay the excellent wisdom of him that builded mansoul that the walls could never be broken down nor hurt by the most mighty adverse potentate unless the townsmen gave consent thereto  this famous town of mansoul had five gates in at which to come out at which to go and these were made likewise answerable to the walls to wit impregnable and such as could never be opened nor forced but by the will and leave of those within  the names of the gates were these  eargate eyegate mouthgate nosegate and feelgate  other things there were that belonged to the town of mansoul which if you adjoin to these will yet give farther demonstration to all of the glory and strength of the place  it had always a sufficiency of provision within its walls it had the best most wholesome and excellent law that then was extant in the world there was not a rascal rogue or traitorous person then within its walls they were all true men and fast joined together and this you know is a great matter  and to all these it had always so long as it had the goodness to keep true to shaddai the king his countenance his protection and it was his delight etc  well upon a time there was one diabolus a mighty giant made an assault upon this famous town of mansoul to take it and make it his own habitation  this giant was king of the blacks and a most raving prince he was  we will if you please first discourse of the origin of this diabolus and then of his taking of this famous town of mansoul  this diabolus is indeed a great and mighty prince and yet both poor and beggarly  as to his origin he was at first one of the servants of king shaddai made and taken and put by him into most high and mighty place yea was put into such principalities as belonged to the best of his territories and dominions  this diabolus was made son of the morning and a brave place he had of it  it brought him much glory and gave him much brightness an income that might have contented his luciferian heart had it not been insatiable and enlarged as hell itself  well he seeing himself thus exalted to greatness and honour and raging in his mind for higher state and degree what doth he but begins to think with himself how he might be set up as lord over all and have the sole power under shaddai  now that did the king reserve for his son yea and had already bestowed it upon him wherefore he first consults with himself what had best to be done and then breaks his mind to some other of his companions to the which they also agreed  so in fine they came to this issue that they should make an attempt upon the kings son to destroy him that the inheritance might be theirs  well to be short the treason as i said was concluded the time appointed the word given the rebels rendezvoused and the assault attempted  now the king and his son being all and always eye could not but discern all passages in his dominions and he having always love for his son as for himself could not at what he saw but be greatly provoked and offended  wherefore what does he but takes them in the very nick and first trip that they made towards their design convicts them of the treason horrid rebellion and conspiracy that they had devised and now attempted to put into practice and casts them altogether out of all place of trust benefit honour and preferment  this done he banishes them the court turns them down into the horrible pits as fast bound in chains never more to expect the least favour from his hands but to abide the judgment that he had appointed and that for ever  now they being thus cast out of all place of trust profit and honour and also knowing that they had lost their princes favour for ever being banished his court and cast down to the horrible pits you may he sure they would now add to their former pride what malice and rage against shaddai and against his son they could  wherefore roving and ranging in much fury from place to place if perhaps they might find something that was the kings by spoiling of that to revenge themselves on him at last they happened into this spacious country of universe and steer their course towards the town of mansoul and considering that that town was one of the chief works and delights of king shaddai what do they but after counsel taken make an assault upon that  i say they knew that mansoul belonged unto shaddai for they were there when he built it and beautified it for himself  so when they had found the place they shouted horribly for joy and roared on it as a lion upon the prey saying now we have found the prize and how to be revenged on king shaddai for what he hath done to us  so they sat down and called a council of war and considered with themselves what ways and methods they had best to engage in for the winning to themselves this famous town of mansoul and these four things were then propounded to be considered of  first  whether they had best all of them to show themselves in this design to the town of mansoul  secondly  whether they had best to go and sit down against mansoul in their now ragged and beggarly guise  thirdly  whether they had best show to mansoul their intentions and what design they came about or whether to assault it with words and ways of deceit  fourthly  whether they had not best to some of their companions to give out private orders to take the advantage if they see one or more of the principal townsmen to shoot them if thereby they shall judge their cause and design will the better be promoted  1 it was answered to the first of these proposals in the negative to wit that it would not be best that all should show themselves before the town because the appearance of many of them might alarm and frighten the town whereas a few or but one of them was not so likely to do it  and to enforce this advice to take place it was added further that if mansoul was frighted or did take the alarm it is impossible said diabolus for he spake now that we should take the town  for that none can enter into it without its own consent  let therefore but few or but one assault mansoul and in mine opinion said diabolus let me be he  wherefore to this they all agreed  2 and then to the second proposal they came namely whether they had best go and sit down before mansoul in their now ragged and beggarly guise  to which it was answered also in the negative by no means and that because though the town of mansoul had been made to know and to have to do before now with things that are invisible they did never as yet see any of their fellowcreatures in so sad and rascally condition as they and this was the advice of that fierce alecto  then said apollyon the advice is pertinent for even one of us appearing to them as we are now must needs both beget and multiply such thoughts in them as will both put them into a consternation of spirit and necessitate them to put themselves upon their guard  and if so said he then as my lord diabolus said but now it is in vain for us to think of taking the town  then said that mighty giant beelzebub the advice that already is given is safe for though the men of mansoul have seen such things as we once were yet hitherto they did never behold such things as we now are and it is best in mine opinion to come upon them in such a guise as is common to and most familiar among them  to this when they had consented the next thing to be considered was in what shape hue or guise diabolus had best to show himself when he went about to make mansoul his own  then one said one thing and another the contrary  at last lucifer answered that in his opinion it was best that his lordship should assume the body of some of those creatures that they of the town had dominion over for quoth he these are not only familiar to them but being under them they will never imagine that an attempt should by them be made upon the town and to blind all let him assume the body of one of those beasts that mansoul deems to be wiser than any of the rest  this advice was applauded of all  so it was determined that the giant diabolus should assume the dragon for that he was in those days as familiar with the town of mansoul as now is the bird with the boy for nothing that was in its primitive state was at all amazing to them  then they proceeded to the third thing which was  3 whether they had best to show their intentions or the design of his coming to mansoul or no  this also was answered in the negative because of the weight that was in the former reasons to wit for that mansoul were a strong people a strong people in a strong town whose wall and gates were impregnable to say nothing of their castle nor can they by any means be won but by their own consent  besides said legion for he gave answer to this a discovery of our intentions may make them send to their king for aid and if that be done i know quickly what time of day it will be with us  therefore let us assault them in all pretended fairness covering our intentions with all manner of lies flatteries delusive words feigning things that never will be and promising that to them that they shall never find  this is the way to win mansoul and to make them of themselves open their gates to us yea and to desire us too to come in to them  and the reason why i think that this project will do is because the people of mansoul now are every one simple and innocent all honest and true nor do they as yet know what it is to be assaulted with fraud guile and hypocrisy  they are strangers to lying and dissembling lips wherefore we cannot if thus we be disguised by them at all be discerned our lies shall go for true sayings and our dissimulations for upright dealings  what we promise them they will in that believe us especially if in all our lies and feigned words we pretend great love to them and that our design is only their advantage and honour  now there was not one bit of a reply against this this went as current down as doth the water down a steep descent  wherefore they go to consider of the last proposal which was  4 whether they had not best to give out orders to some of their company to shoot some one or more of the principal of the townsmen if they judge that their cause may be promoted thereby  this was carried in the affirmative and the man that was designed by this stratagem to be destroyed was one mr resistance otherwise called captain resistance  and a great man in mansoul this captain resistance was and a man that the giant diabolus and his band more feared than they feared the whole town of mansoul besides  now who should be the actor to do the murder  that was the next and they appointed one tisiphone a fury of the lake to do it  they thus having ended their council of war rose up and essayed to do as they had determined they marched towards mansoul but all in a manner invisible save one only one nor did he approach the town in his own likeness but under the shade and in the body of the dragon  so they drew up and sat down before eargate for that was the place of hearing for all without the town as eyegate was the place of perspection  so as i said he came up with his train to the gate and laid his ambuscado for captain resistance within bow shot of the town  this done the giant ascended up close to the gate and called to the town of mansoul for audience  nor took he any with him but one illpause who was his orator in all difficult matters  now as i said he being come up to the gate as the manner of those times was sounded his trumpet for audience at which the chief of the town of mansoul such as my lord innocent my lord willbewill my lord mayor mr recorder and captain resistance came down to the wall to see who was there and what was the matter  and my lord willbewill when he had looked over and saw who stood at the gate demanded what he was wherefore he was come and why he roused the town of mansoul with so unusual a sound  diabolus then as if he had been a lamb began his oration and said  gentlemen of the famous town of mansoul i am as you may perceive no far dweller from you but near and one that is bound by the king to do you my homage and what service i can wherefore that i may be faithful to myself and to you i have somewhat of concern to impart unto you  wherefore grant me your audience and hear me patiently  and first i will assure you it is not myself but younot mine but your advantage that i seek by what i now do as will full well be made manifest by that i have opened my mind unto you  for gentlemen i am to tell you the truth come to show you how you may obtain great and ample deliverance from a bondage that unawares to yourselves you are captivated and enslaved under  at this the town of mansoul began to prick up its ears  and what is it  pray what is it thought they  and he said i have somewhat to say to you concerning your king concerning his law and also touching yourselves  touching your king i know he is great and potent but yet all that he hath said to you is neither true nor yet for your advantage  1 it is not true for that wherewith he hath hitherto awed you shall not come to pass nor be fulfilled though you do the thing that he hath forbidden  but if there was danger what a slavery is it to live always in fear of the greatest of punishments for doing so small and trivial a thing as eating of a little fruit is  2 touching his laws this i say further they are both unreasonable intricate and intolerable  unreasonable as was hinted before for that the punishment is not proportioned to the offence  there is great difference and disproportion between the life and an apple yet the one must go for the other by the law of your shaddai  but it is also intricate in that he saith first you may eat of all and yet after forbids the eating of one  and then in the last place it must needs be intolerable forasmuch as that fruit which you are forbidden to eat of if you are forbidden any is that and that alone which is able by your eating to minister to you a good as yet unknown by you  this is manifest by the very name of the tree it is called the tree of knowledge of good and evil and have you that knowledge as yet no no nor can you conceive how good how pleasant and how much to be desired to make one wise it is so long as you stand by your kings commandment why should you be holden in ignorance and blindness  why should you not be enlarged in knowledge and understanding  and now o ye inhabitants of the famous town of mansoul to speak more particularly to yourselves you are not a free people  you are kept both in bondage and slavery and that by a grievous threat no reason being annexed but so i will have it so it shall be  and is it not grievous to think on that that very thing which you are forbidden to do might you but do it would yield you both wisdom and honour for then your eyes will be opened and you shall be as gods  now since this is thus quoth he can you be kept by any prince in more slavery and in greater bondage than you are under this day  you are made underlings and are wrapped up in inconveniences as i have well made appear  for what bondage greater than to be kept in blindness  will not reason tell you that it is better to have eyes than to be without them and so to be at liberty to be better than to be shut up in a dark and stinking cave  and just now while diabolus was speaking these words to mansoul tisiphone shot at captain resistance where he stood on the gate and mortally wounded him in the head so that he to the amazement of the townsmen and the encouragement of diabolus fell down dead quite over the wall  now when captain resistance was dead and he was the only man of war in the town poor mansoul was wholly left naked of courage nor had she now any heart to resist  but this was as the devil would have it  then stood forth he mr ill pause that diabolus brought with him who was his orator and he addressed himself to speak to the town of mansoul the tenour of whose speech here follows  gentlemen quoth he it is my masters happiness that he has this day a quiet and teachable auditory and it is hoped by us that we shall prevail with you not to cast off good advice  my master has a very great love for you and although as he very well knows that he runs the hazard of the anger of king shaddai yet love to you will make him do more than that  nor doth there need that a word more should be spoken to confirm for truth what he hath said there is not a word but carries with it selfevidence in its bowels the very name of the tree may put an end to all controversy in this matter  i therefore at this time shall only add this advice to you under and by the leave of my lord and with that he made diabolus a very low congee consider his words look on the tree and the promising fruit thereof remember also that yet you know but little and that this is the way to know more  and if your reasons be not conquered to accept of such good counsel you are not the men that i took you to be  but when the townsfolk saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eye and a tree to be desired to make one wise they did as old illpause advised they took and did eat thereof  now this i should have told you before that even then when this illpause was making his speech to the townsmen my lord innocency whether by a shot from the camp of the giant or from some sinking qualm that suddenly took him or whether by the stinking breath of that treacherous villain old illpause for so i am most apt to think sunk down in the place where he stood nor could be brought to life again  thus these two brave men died brave men i call them for they were the beauty and glory of mansoul so long as they lived therein nor did there now remain any more a noble spirit in mansoul they all fell down and yielded obedience to diabolus and became his slaves and vassals as you shall hear  now these being dead what do the rest of the townsfolk but as men that had found a fools paradise they presently as afore was hinted fall to prove the truth of the giants words  and first they did as illpause had taught them they looked they considered they were taken with the forbidden fruit they took thereof and did eat and having eaten they became immediately drunken therewith  so they open the gate both eargate and eyegate and let in diabolus with all his bands quite forgetting their good shaddai his law and the judgment that he had annexed with solemn threatening to the breach thereof   diabolus having now obtained entrance in at the gates of the town marches up to the middle thereof to make his conquest as sure as he could and finding by this time the affections of the people warmly inclining to him he as thinking it was best striking while the iron is hot made this further deceivable speech unto them saying alas my poor mansoul  i have done thee indeed this service as to promote thee to honour and to greaten thy liberty but alas alas poor mansoul thou wantest now one to defend thee for assure thyself that when shaddai shall hear what is done he will come for sorry will he be that thou hast broken his bonds and cast his cords away from thee  what wilt thou do wilt thou after enlargement suffer thy privileges to be invaded and taken away or what wilt resolve with thyself  then they all with one consent said to this bramble do thou reign over us  so he accepted the motion and became the king of the town of mansoul  this being done the next thing was to give him possession of the castle and so of the whole strength of the town wherefore into the castle he goes it was that which shaddai built in mansoul for his own delight and pleasure this now was become a den and hold for the giant diabolus  now having got possession of this stately palace or castle what doth he but makes it a garrison for himself and strengthens and fortifies it with all sorts of provision against the king shaddai or those that should endeavour the regaining of it to him and his obedience again  this done but not thinking himself yet secure enough in the next place he bethinks himself of new modelling the town and so he does setting up one and putting down another at pleasure wherefore my lord mayor whose name was my lord understanding and mr recorder whose name was mr conscience these he put out of place and power  as for my lord mayor though he was an understanding man and one too that had complied with the rest of the town of mansoul in admitting the giant into the town yet diabolus thought not fit to let him abide in his former lustre and glory because he was a seeing man  wherefore he darkened him not only by taking from him his office and power but by building a high and strong tower just between the suns reflections and the windows of my lords palace by which means his house and all and the whole of his habitation were made as dark as darkness itself  and thus being alienated from the light he became as one that was born blind  to this his house my lord was confined as to a prison nor might he upon his parole go farther than within his own bounds  and now had he had a heart to do for mansoul what could he do for it or wherein could he be profitable to her  so then so long as mansoul was under the power and government of diabolus and so long it was under him as it was obedient to him which was even until by a war it was rescued out of his hand so long my lord mayor was rather an impediment in than an advantage to the famous town of mansoul  as for mr recorder before the town was taken he was a man well read in the laws of his king and also a man of courage and faithfulness to speak truth at every occasion and he had a tongue as bravely hung as he had a head filled with judgment  now this man diabolus could by no means abide because though he gave his consent to his coming into the town yet he could not by all the wiles trials stratagems and devices that he could use make him wholly his own  true he was much degenerated from his former king and also much pleased with many of the giants laws and service but all this would not do forasmuch as he was not wholly his  he would now and then think upon shaddai and have dread of his law upon him and then he would speak against diabolus with a voice as great as when a lion roareth  yea and would also at certain times when his fits were upon him for you must know that sometimes he had terrible fits make the whole town of mansoul shake with his voice  and therefore the now king of mansoul could not abide him  diabolus therefore feared the recorder more than any that was left alive in the town of mansoul because as i said his words did shake the whole town they were like the rattling thunder and also like thunderclaps  since therefore the giant could not make him wholly his own what doth he do but studies all that he could to debauch the old gentleman and by debauchery to stupefy his mind and more harden his heart in the ways of vanity  and as he attempted so he accomplished his design  he debauched the man and by little and little so drew him into sin and wickedness that at last he was not only debauched as at first and so by consequence defiled but was almost at last i say past all conscience of sin  and this was the farthest diabolus could go wherefore he bethinks him of another project and that was to persuade the men of the town that mr recorder was mad and so not to be regarded  and for this he urged his fits and said if he be himself why doth he not do thus always  but quoth he as all mad folks have their fits and in them their raving language so hath this old and doating gentleman  thus by one means or another he quickly got mansoul to slight neglect and despise whatever mr recorder could say  for besides what already you have heard diabolus had a way to make the old gentleman when he was merry unsay and deny what he in his fits had affirmed  and indeed this was the next way to make himself ridiculous and to cause that no man should regard him  also now he never spake freely for king shaddai but also by force and constraint  besides he would at one time be hot against that at which at another he would hold his peace so uneven was he now in his doings  sometimes he would be as if fast asleep and again sometimes as dead even then when the whole town of mansoul was in her career after vanity and in her dance after the giants pipe  wherefore sometimes when mansoul did use to be frighted with the thundering voice of the recorder that was and when they did tell diabolus of it he would answer that what the old gentleman said was neither of love to him nor pity to them but of a foolish fondness that he had to be prating and so would hush still and put all to quiet again  and that he might leave no argument unurged that might tend to make them secure he said and said it often o mansoul consider that notwithstanding the old gentlemans rage and the rattle of his high and thundering words you hear nothing of shaddai himself when liar and deceiver that he was every outcry of mr recorder against the sin of mansoul was the voice of god in him to them  but he goes on and says you see that he values not the loss nor rebellion of the town of mansoul nor will he trouble himself with calling his town to a reckoning for their giving themselves to me  he knows that though you were his now you are lawfully mine so leaving us one to another he now hath shaken his hands of us  moreover o mansoul quoth he consider how i have served you even to the uttermost of my power and that with the best that i have could get or procure for you in all the world  besides i dare say that the laws and customs that you now are under and by which you do homage to me do yield you more solace and content than did the paradise that at first you possessed  your liberty also as yourselves do very well know has been greatly widened and enlarged by me whereas i found you a pennedup people  i have not laid any restraint upon you you have no law statute or judgment of mine to fright you i call none of you to account for your doings except the madmanyou know who i mean i have granted you to live each man like a prince in his own even with as little control from me as i myself have from you  and thus would diabolus hush up and quiet the town of mansoul when the recorder that was did at times molest them  yea and with such cursed orations as these would set the whole town in a rage and fury against the old gentleman  yea the rascal crew at some times would be for destroying him  they have often wished in my hearing that he had lived a thousand miles off from them  his company his words yea the sight of him and specially when they remembered how in old times he did use to threaten and condemn them for all he was now so debauched did terrify and afflict them sore  but all wishes were vain for i do not know how unless by the power of shaddai and his wisdom he was preserved in being amongst them  besides his house was as strong as a castle and stood hard by a stronghold of the town  moreover if at any time any of the crew or rabble attempted to make him away he could pull up the sluices and let in such floods as would drown all round about him  but to leave mr recorder and to come to my lord willbewill another of the gentry of the famous town of mansoul  this willbewill was as highborn as any man in mansoul and was as much if not more a freeholder than many of them were besides if i remember my tale aright he had some privileges peculiar to himself in the famous town of mansoul  now together with these he was a man of great strength resolution and courage nor in his occasion could any turn him away  but i say whether he was proud of his estate privileges strength or what but sure it was through pride of something he scorns now to be a slave in mansoul and therefore resolves to bear office under diabolus that he might such an one as he was be a petty ruler and governor in mansoul and headstrong man that he was thus he began betimes for this man when diabolus did make his oration at eargate was one of the first that was for consenting to his words and for accepting his counsel at wholesome and that was for the opening of the gate and for letting him into the town wherefore diabolus had a kindness for him and therefore he designed for him a place  and perceiving the valour and stoutness of the man he coveted to have him for one of his great ones to act and do in matters of the highest concern  so he sent for him and talked with him of that secret matter that lay in his breast but there needed not much persuasion in the case  for as at first he was willing that diabolus should be let into the town so now he was as willing to serve him there  when the tyrant therefore perceived the willingness of my lord to serve him and that his mind stood bending that way he forthwith made him the captain of the castle governor of the wall and keeper of the gates of mansoul  yea there was a clause in his commission that nothing without him should be done in all the town of mansoul  so that now next to diabolus himself who but my lord willbewill in all the town of mansoul nor could anything now be done but at his will and pleasure throughout the town of mansoul he had also one mr mind for his clerk a man to speak on every way like his master  for he and his lord were in principle one and in practice not far asunder  and now was mansoul brought under to purpose and made to fulfil the lusts of the will and of the mind  but it will not out of my thoughts what a desperate one this willbewill was when power was put into his hand  first he flatly denied that he owed any suit or service to his former prince and liege lord  this done in the next place he took an oath and swore fidelity to his great master diabolus and then being stated and settled in his places offices advancements and preferments oh you cannot think unless you had seen it the strange work that this workman made in the town of mansoul  first he maligned mr recorder to death he would neither endure to see him nor hear the words of his mouth he would shut his eyes when he saw him and stop his ears when he heard him speak  also he could not endure that so much as a fragment of the law of shaddai should be anywhere seen in the town  for example his clerk mr mind had some old rent and torn parchments of the law of shaddai in his house but when willbewill saw them he cast them behind his back  true mr recorder had some of the laws in his study but my lord could by no means come at them  he also thought and said that the windows of my old lord mayors house were always too light for the profit of the town of mansoul  the light of a candle he could not endure  now nothing at all pleased willbewill but what pleased diabolus his lord  there was none like him to trumpet about the streets the brave nature the wise conduct and great glory of the king diabolus  he would range and rove throughout all the streets of mansoul to cry up his illustrious lord and would make himself even as an abject among the base and rascal crew to cry up his valiant prince  and i say when and wheresoever he found these vassals he would even make himself as one of them  in all ill courses he would act without bidding and do mischief without commandment  the lord willbewill also had a deputy under him and his name was mr affection one that was also greatly debauched in his principles and answerable thereto in his life  he was wholly given to the flesh and therefore they called him vileaffection now there was he and one carnallust the daughter of mr mind like to like that fell in love and made a match and were married and as i take it they had several children as impudent blackmouth and hatereproof  these three were black boys  and besides these they had three daughters as scorntruth and slight god and the name of the youngest was revenge  these were all married in the town and also begot and yielded many bad brats too many to be here inserted  but to pass by this  when the giant had thus engarrisoned himself in the town of mansoul and had put down and set up whom he thought good he betakes himself to defacing  now there was in the marketplace in mansoul and also upon the gates of the castle an image of the blessed king shaddai  this image was so exactly engraven and it was engraven in gold that it did the most resemble shaddai himself of anything that then was extant in the world  this he basely commanded to be defaced and it was as basely done by the hand of mr notruth  now you must know that as diabolus had commanded and that by the hand of mr notruth the image of shaddai was defaced he likewise gave order that the same mr no truth should set up in its stead the horrid and formidable image of diabolus to the great contempt of the former king and debasing of his town of mansoul  moreover diabolus made havoc of all remains of the laws and statutes of shaddai that could be found in the town of mansoul to wit such as contained either the doctrines of morals with all civil and natural documents  also relative severities he sought to extinguish  to be short there was nothing of the remains of good in mansoul which he and willbewill sought not to destroy for their design was to turn mansoul into a brute and to make it like to the sensual sow by the hand of mr notruth  when he had destroyed what law and good orders he could then further to effect his design namely to alienate mansoul from shaddai her king he commands and they set up his own vain edicts statutes and commandments in all places of resort or concourse in mansoul to wit such as gave liberty to the lusts of the flesh the lusts of the eyes and the pride of life which are not of shaddai but of the world  he encouraged countenanced and promoted lasciviousness and all ungodliness there  yea much more did diabolus to encourage wickedness in the town of mansoul he promised them peace content joy and bliss in doing his commands and that they should never be called to an account for their not doing the contrary  and let this serve to give a taste to them that love to hear tell of what is done beyond their knowledge afar off in other countries  now mansoul being wholly at his beck and brought wholly to his bow nothing was heard or seen therein but that which tended to set up him  but now he having disabled the lord mayor and mr recorder from bearing of office in mansoul and seeing that the town before he came to it was the most ancient of corporations in the world and fearing if he did not maintain greatness they at any time should object that he had done them an injury therefore i say that they might see that he did not intend to lessen their grandeur or to take from them any of their advantageous things he did choose for them a lord mayor and a recorder himself and such as contented them at the heart and such also as pleased him wondrous well  the name of the mayor that was of diabolus making was the lord lustings a man that had neither eyes nor ears  all that he did whether as a man or an officer he did it naturally as doth the beast  and that which made him yet the more ignoble though not to mansoul yet to them that beheld and were grieved for its ruin was that he never could favour good but evil  the recorder was one whose name was forgetgood and a very sorry fellow he was  he could remember nothing but mischief and to do it with delight  he was naturally prone to do things that were hurtful even hurtful to the town of mansoul and to all the dwellers there  these two therefore by their power and practice examples and smiles upon evil did much more grammar and settle the common people in hurtful ways  for who doth not perceive that when those that sit aloft are vile and corrupt themselves they corrupt the whole region and country where they are  besides these diabolus made several burgesses and aldermen in mansoul such as out of whom the town when it needed might choose them officers governors and magistrates  and these are the names of the chief of them  mr incredulity mr haughty mr swearing mr whoring mr hardheart mr pitiless mr fury mr notruth mr standtolies mr falsepeace mr drunkenness mr cheating mr atheismthirteen in all  mr incredulity is the eldest and mr atheism the youngest of the company  there was also an election of common councilmen and others as bailiffs sergeants constables and others but all of them like to those aforenamed being either fathers brothers cousins or nephews to them whose names for brevitys sake i omit to mention  when the giant had thus far proceeded in his work in the next place he betook him to build some strongholds in the town and he built three that seemed to be impregnable  the first he called the hold of defiance because it was made to command the whole town and to keep it from the knowledge of its ancient king  the second he called midnight hold because it was built on purpose to keep mansoul from the true knowledge of itself  the third was called sweetsin hold because by that he fortified mansoul against all desires of good  the first of these holds stood close by eyegate that as much might be light might be darkened there the second was built hard by the old castle to the end that that might be made more blind if possible and the third stood in the market place  he that diabolus made governor over the first of these was one spitegod a most blasphemous wretch  he came with the whole rabble of them that came against mansoul at first and was himself one of themselves  he that was made the governor of midnight hold was one lovenolight he was also of them that came first against the town  and he that was made the governor of the hold called sweetsin hold was one whose name was loveflesh  he was also a very lewd fellow but not of that country where the other are bound  this fellow could find more sweetness when he stood sucking of a lust than he did in all the paradise of god  and now diabolus thought himself safe  he had taken mansoul he had engarrisoned himself therein he had put down the old officers and had set up new ones he had defaced the image of shaddai and had set up his own he had spoiled the old law books and had promoted his own vain lies he had made him new magistrates and set up new aldermen he had builded him new holds and had manned them for himself  and all this he did to make himself secure in case the good shaddai or his son should come to make an incursion upon him  now you may well think that long before this time word by some one or other could not but be carried to the good king shaddai how his mansoul in the continent of universe was lost and that the runagate giant diabolus once one of his majestys servants had in rebellion against the king made sure thereof for himself yea tidings were carried and brought to the king thereof and that to a very circumstance  at first how diabolus came upon mansoul they being a simple people and innocent with craft subtlety lies and guile  item that he had treacherously slain the right noble and valiant captain their captain resistance as he stood upon the gate with the rest of the townsmen  item how my brave lord innocent fell down dead with grief some say or with being poisoned with the stinking breath of one illpause as say others at the hearing of his just lord and rightful prince shaddai so abused by the mouth of so filthy a diabolian as that varlet illpause was  the messenger further told that after this illpause had made a short oration to the townsmen in behalf of diabolus his master the simple town believing that what was said was true with one consent did open eargate the chief gate of the corporation and did let him with his crew into a possession of the famous town of mansoul  he further showed how diabolus had served the lord mayor and mr recorder to wit that he had put them from all place of power and trust  item he showed also that my lord willbewill was turned a very rebel and runagate and that so was one mr mind his clerk and that they two did range and revel it all the town over and teach the wicked ones their ways  he said moreover that this willbewill was put into great trust and particularly that diabolus had put into willbewills hand all the strong places in mansoul and that mr affection was made my lord willbewills deputy in his most rebellious affairs  yea said the messenger this monster lord willbewill has openly disavowed his king shaddai and hath horribly given his faith and plighted his troth to diabolus  also said the messenger besides all this the new king or rather rebellious tyrant over the once famous but now perishing town of mansoul has set up a lord mayor and a recorder of his own for mayor he has set up one mr lustings and for recorder mr forgetgood two of the vilest of all the town of mansoul  this faithful messenger also proceeded and told what a sort of new burgesses diabolus had made also that he had built several strong forts towers and strongholds in mansoul  he told too the which i had almost forgot how diabolus had put the town of mansoul into arms the better to capacitate them on his behalf to make resistance against shaddai their king should he come to reduce them to their former obedience  now this tidingsteller did not deliver his relation of things in private but in open court the king and his son high lords chief captains and nobles being all there present to hear  but by that they had heard the whole of the story it would have amazed one to have seen had he been there to behold it what sorrow and grief and compunction of spirit there was among all sorts to think that famous mansoul was now taken  only the king and his son foresaw all this long before yea and sufficiently provided for the relief of mansoul though they told not everybody thereof  yet because they also would have a share in condoling of the misery of mansoul therefore they also did and that at a rate of the highest degree bewail the losing of mansoul  the king said plainly that it grieved him at the heart and you may be sure that his son was not a whit behind him  thus gave they conviction to all about them that they had love and compassion for the famous town of mansoul well when the king and his son were retired into the privy chamber there they again consulted about what they had designed before to wit that as mansoul should in time be suffered to be lost so as certainly it should be recovered again recovered i say in such a way as that both the king and his son would get themselves eternal fame and glory thereby  wherefore after this consult the son of shaddai a sweet and comely person and one that had always great affection for those that were in affliction but one that had mortal enmity in his heart against diabolus because he was designed for it and because he sought his crown and dignitythis son of shaddai i say having stricken hands with his father and promised that he would be his servant to recover his mansoul again stood by his resolution nor would he repent of the same  the purport of which agreement was this  to wit that at a certain time prefixed by both the kings son should take a journey into the country of universe and there in a way of justice and equity by making amends for the follies of mansoul he should lay a foundation of perfect deliverance from diabolus and from his tyranny  moreover emmanuel resolved to make at a time convenient a war upon the giant diabolus even while he was possessed of the town of mansoul and that he would fairly by strength of hand drive him out of his hold his nest and take it to himself to be his habitation  this now being resolved upon order was given to the lord chief secretary to draw up a fair record of what was determined and to cause that it should be published in all the corners of the kingdom of universe  a short breviate of the contents thereof you may if you please take here as follows  let all men know who are concerned that the son of shaddai the great king is engaged by covenant to his father to bring his mansoul to him again yea and to put mansoul too through the power of his matchless love into a far better and more happy condition than it was in before it was taken by diabolus  these papers therefore were published in several places to the no little molestation of the tyrant diabolus for now thought he i shall be molested and my habitation will be taken from me  but when this matter i mean this purpose of the king and his son did at first take air at court who can tell how the high lords chief captains and noble princes that were there were taken with the business  first they whispered it one to another and after that it began to ring out through the kings palace all wondering at the glorious design that between the king and his son was on foot for the miserable town of mansoul  yea the courtiers could scarce do anything either for the king or kingdom but they would mix with the doing thereof a noise of the love of the king and his son that they had for the town of mansoul  nor could these lords high captains and princes be content to keep this news at court yea before the records thereof were perfected themselves came down and told it in universe  at last it came to the ears as i said of diabolus to his no little discontent for you must think it would perplex him to hear of such a design against him  well but after a few casts in his mind he concluded upon these four things  first that this news these good tidings if possible should be kept from the ears of the town of mansoul for said he if they should once come to the knowledge that shaddai their former king and emmanuel his son are contriving good for the town of mansoul what can be expected by me but that mansoul will make a revolt from under my hand and government and return again to him  now to accomplish this his design he renews his flattery with my lord willbewill and also gives him strict charge and command that he should keep watch by day and by night at all the gates of the town especially eargate and eyegate for i hear of a design quoth he a design to make us all traitors and that mansoul must be reduced to its first bondage again  i hope they are but flying stories quoth he however let no such news by any means be let into mansoul lest the people be dejected thereat  i think my lord it can be no welcome news to you i am sure it is none to me and i think that at this time it should be all our wisdom and care to nip the head of all such rumours as shall tend to trouble our people  wherefore i desire my lord that you will in this matter do as i say  let there be strong guards daily kept at every gate of the town  stop also and examine from whence such come that you perceive do from far come hither to trade nor let them by any means be admitted into mansoul unless you shall plainly perceive that they are favourers of our excellent government  i command moreover said diabolus that there be spies continually walking up and down the town of mansoul and let them have power to suppress and destroy any that they shall perceive to be plotting against us or that shall prate of what by shaddai and emmanuel is intended  this therefore was accordingly done my lord willbewill hearkened to his lord and master went willingly after the commandment and with all the diligence he could kept any that would from going out abroad or that sought to bring these tidings to mansoul from coming into the town  secondly this done in the next place diabolus that he might make mansoul as sure as he could frames and imposes a new oath and horrible covenant upon the townsfolk to wit that they should never desert him nor his government nor yet betray him nor seek to alter his laws but that they should own confess stand by and acknowledge him for their rightful king in defiance to any that do or hereafter shall by any pretence law or title whatever lay claim to the town of mansoul thinking belike that shaddai had not power to absolve them from this covenant with death and agreement with hell  nor did the silly mansoul stick or boggle at all at this most monstrous engagement but as if it had been a sprat in the mouth of a whale they swallowed it without any chewing  were they troubled at all  nay they rather bragged and boasted of their so brave fidelity to the tyrant their pretended king swearing that they would never be changelings nor forsake their old lord for a new  thus did diabolus tie poor mansoul fast  thirdly  but jealousy that never thinks itself strong enough put him in the next place upon another exploit which was yet more if possible to debauch this town of mansoul  wherefore he caused by the hand of one mr filth an odious nasty lascivious piece of beastliness to be drawn up in writing and to be set upon the castle gates whereby he granted and gave license to all his true and trusty sons in mansoul to do whatsoever their lustful appetites prompted them to do and that no man was to let hinder or control them upon pain of incurring the displeasure of their prince  now this he did for these reasons  1 that the town of mansoul might be yet made weaker and weaker and so more unable should tidings come that their redemption was designed to believe hope or consent to the truth thereof for reason says the bigger the sinner the less grounds of hopes of mercy  2 the second reason was if perhaps emmanuel the son of shaddai their king by seeing the horrible and profane doings of the town of mansoul might repent though entered into a covenant of redeeming them of pursuing that covenant of their redemption for he knew that shaddai was holy and that his son emmanuel was holy yea he knew it by woeful experience for for his iniquity and sin was diabolus cast from the highest orbs  wherefore what more rational than for him to conclude that thus for sin it might fare with mansoul  but fearing also lest this knot should break he bethinks himself of another to wit  fourthly  to endeavour to possess all hearts in the town of mansoul that shaddai was raising an army to come to overthrow and utterly to destroy this town of mansoul  and this he did to forestall any tidings that might come to their ears of their deliverance  for thought he if i first bruit this the tidings that shall come after will all be swallowed up of this for what else will mansoul say when they shall hear that they must be delivered but that the true meaning is shaddai intends to destroy them  wherefore he summons the whole town into the marketplace and there with deceitful tongue thus he addressed himself unto them  gentlemen and my very good friends you are all as you know my legal subjects and men of the famous town of mansoul  you know how from the first day that i have been with you until now i have behaved myself among you and what liberty and great privileges you have enjoyed under my government i hope to your honour and mine and also to your content and delight  now my famous mansoul a noise of trouble there is abroad of trouble to the town of mansoul sorry i am thereof for your sakes  for i received but now by the post from my lord lucifer and he useth to have good intelligence that your old king shaddai is raising an army to come against you to destroy you root and branch and this o mansoul is now the cause that at this time i have called you together namely to advise what in this juncture is best to be done  for my part i am but one and can with ease shift for myself did i list to seek my own case and to leave my mansoul in all the danger but my heart is so firmly united to you and so unwilling am i to leave you that i am willing to stand and fall with you to the utmost hazard that shall befall me  what say you o my mansoul  will you now desert your old friend or do you think of standing by me  then as one man with one mouth they cried out together let him die the death that will not  then said diabolus again it is in vain for us to hope for quarter for this king knows not how to show it  true perhaps he at his first sitting down before us will talk of and pretend to mercy that thereby with the more ease and less trouble he may again make himself the master of mansoul  whatever therefore he shall say believe not one syllable or tittle of it for all such language is but to overcome us and to make us while we wallow in our blood the trophies of his merciless victory  my mind is therefore that we resolve to the last man to resist him and not to believe him upon any terms for in at that door will come our danger  but shall we be flattered out of our lives  i hope you know more of the rudiments of politics than to suffer yourselves so pitifully to be served  but suppose he should if he get us to yield save some of our lives or the lives of some of them that are underlings in mansoul what help will that be to you that are the chief of the town especially you whom i have set up and whose greatness has been procured by you through your faithful sticking to me  and suppose again that he should give quarter to every one of you be sure he will bring you into that bondage under which you were captivated before or a worse and then what good will your lives do you shall you with him live in pleasure as you do now  no no you must be bound by laws that will pinch you and be made to do that which at present is hateful to you  i am for you if you are for me and it is better to die valiantly than to live like pitiful slaves  but i say the life of a slave will be counted a life too good for mansoul now  blood blood nothing but blood is in every blast of shaddais trumpet against poor mansoul now  pray be concerned i hear he is coming  up and stand to your arms that now while you have any leisure i may learn you some feats of war armour for you i have and by me it is yea and it is sufficient for mansoul from top to toe nor can you be hurt by what his force can do if you shall keep it well girt and fastened about you come therefore to my castle and welcome and harness yourselves for the war  there is helmet breastplate sword and shield and what not that will make you fight like men  1 my helmet otherwise called an headpiece is in hope of doing well at last what lives soever you live  this is that which they had who said that they should have peace though they walked in the wickedness of their heart to add drunkenness to thirst  a piece of approved armour this is and whoever has it and can hold it so long no arrow dart sword or shield can hurt him  this therefore keep on and thou wilt keep off many a blow my mansoul  2 my breastplate is a breastplate of iron  i had it forged in mine own country and all my soldiers are armed therewith  in plain language it is a hard heart a heart as hard as iron and as much past feeling as a stone the which if you get and keep neither mercy shall win you nor judgment fright you  this therefore is a piece of armour most necessary for all to put on that hate shaddai and that would fight against him under my banner  3 my sword is a tongue that is set on fire of hell and that can bend itself to speak evil of shaddai his son his ways and people  use this it has been tried a thousand times twice told whoever hath it keeps it and makes that use of it as i would have him can never be conquered by mine enemy  4 my shield is unbelief or calling into question the truth of the word or all the sayings that speak of the judgment that shaddai has appointed for wicked men  use this shield many attempts he has made upon it and sometimes it is true it has been bruised but they that have writ of the wars of emmanuel against my servants have testified that he could do no mighty work there because of their unbelief  now to handle this weapon of mine aright it is not to believe things because they are true of what sort or by whomsoever asserted  if he speaks of judgment care not for it if he speaks of mercy care not for it if he promises if he swears that he would do to mansoul if it turns no hurt but good regard not what is said question the truth of all for it is to wield the shield of unbelief aright and as my servants ought and do and he that doth otherwise loves me not nor do i count him but an enemy to me  5 another part or piece said diabolus of mine excellent armour is a dumb and prayerless spirit a spirit that scorns to cry for mercy  wherefore be you my mansoul sure that you make use of this  what cry for quarter  never do that if you would be mine i know you are stout men and am sure that i have clad you with that which is armour of proof  wherefore to cry to shaddai for mercy let that be far from you  besides all this i have a maul firebrands arrows and death all good handweapons and such as will do execution  after he had thus furnished his men with armour and arms he addressed himself to them in such like words as these  remember quoth he that i am your rightful king and that you have taken an oath and entered into covenant to be true to me and my cause  i say remember this and show yourselves stout and valiant men of mansoul  remember also the kindness that i have always showed to you and that without your petition i have granted to you external things wherefore the privileges grants immunities profits and honours wherewith i have endowed you do call for at your hands returns of loyalty my lionlike men of mansoul  and when so fit a time to show it as when another shall seek to take my dominion over you into his own hands  one word more and i have done  can we but stand and overcome this one shock or brunt i doubt not but in little time all the world will be ours and when that day comes my true hearts i will make you kings princes and captains and what brave days shall we have then  diabolus having thus armed and forearmed his servants and vassals in mansoul against their good and lawful king shaddai in the next place he doubleth his guards at the gates of the town and he takes himself to the castle which was his stronghold  his vassals also to show their wills and supposed but ignoble gallantry exercise themselves in their arms every day and teach one another feats of war they also defied their enemies and sang up the praises of their tyrant they threatened also what men they would be if ever things should rise so high as a war between shaddai and their king  now all this time the good king the king shaddai was preparing to send an army to recover the town of mansoul again from under the tyranny of their pretended king diabolus but he thought good at first not to send them by the hand and conduct of brave emmanuel his son but under the hand of some of his servants to see first by them the temper of mansoul and whether by them they would be won to the obedience of their king  the army consisted of above forty thousand all true men for they came from the kings own court and were those of his own choosing  they came up to mansoul under the conduct of four stout generals each man being a captain of ten thousand men and these are their names and their ensigns  the name of the first was boanerges the name of the second was captain conviction the name of the third was captain judgment and the name of the fourth was captain execution  these were the captains that shaddai sent to regain mansoul  these four captains as was said the king thought fit in the first place to send to mansoul to make an attempt upon it for indeed generally in all his wars he did use to send these four captains in the van for they were very stout and roughhewn men men that were fit to break the ice and to make their way by dint of sword and their men were like themselves  to each of these captains the king gave a banner that it might be displayed because of the goodness of his cause and because of the right that he had to mansoul  first to captain boanerges for he was the chief to him i say were given ten thousand men  his ensign was mr thunder he bare the black colours and his scutcheon was the three burning thunderbolts  the second captain was captain conviction to him also were given ten thousand men  his ensigns name was mr sorrow he did bear the pale colours and his scutcheon was the book of the law wide open from whence issued a flame of fire  the third captain was captain judgment to him were given ten thousand men  his ensigns name was mr terror he bare the red colours and his scutcheon was a burning fiery furnace  the fourth captain was captain execution to him were given ten thousand men  his ensign was one mr justice he also bare the red colours and his scutcheon was a fruitless tree with an axe lying at the root thereof  these four captains as i said had every one of them under his command ten thousand men all of good fidelity to the king and stout at their military actions  well the captains and their forces their men and under officers being had upon a day by shaddai into the field and there called all over by their names were then and there put into such harness as became their degree and that service which now they were going about for their king  now when the king had mustered his forces for it is he that mustereth the host to the battle he gave unto the captains their several commissions with charge and commandment in the audience of all the soldiers that they should take heed faithfully and courageously to do and execute the same  their commissions were for the substance of them the same in form though as to name title place and degree of the captains there might be some but very small variation  and here let me give you an account of the matter and sum contained in their commission   a commission from the great shaddai king of mansoul to his trusty and noble captain the captain boanerges for his making war upon the town of mansoul   o thou boanerges one of my stout and thundering captains over one ten thousand of my valiant and faithful servants go thou in my name with this thy force to the miserable town of mansoul and when thou comest thither offer them first conditions of peace and command them that casting off the yoke and tyranny of the wicked diabolus they return to me their rightful prince and lord command them also that they cleanse themselves from all that is his in the town of mansoul and look to thyself that thou hast good satisfaction touching the truth of their obedience  thus when thou hast commanded them if they in truth submit thereto then do thou to the uttermost of thy power what in thee lies to set up for me a garrison in the famous town of mansoul nor do thou hurt the least native that moveth or breatheth therein if they will submit themselves to me but treat thou such as if they were thy friend or brother for all such i love and they shall be dear unto me and tell them that i will take a time to come unto them and to let them know that i am merciful  but if they shall notwithstanding thy summons and the producing of thy authority resist stand out against thee and rebel then do i command thee to make use of all thy cunning power might and force to bring them under by strength of hand  farewell   thus you see the sum of their commissions for as i said before for the substance of them they were the same that the rest of the noble captains had  wherefore they having received each commander his authority at the hand of their king the day being appointed and the place of their rendezvous prefixed each commander appeared in such gallantry as became his cause and calling  so after a new entertainment from shaddai with flying colours they set forward to march towards the famous town of mansoul  captain boanerges led the van captain conviction and captain judgment made up the main body and captain execution brought up the rear  they then having a great way to go for the town of mansoul was far off from the court of shaddai marched through the regions and countries of many people not hurting or abusing any but blessing wherever they came  they also lived upon the kings cost in all the way they went  having travelled thus for many days at last they came within sight of mansoul the which when they saw the captains could for their hearts do no less than for a while bewail the condition of the town for they quickly saw how that it was prostrate to the will of diabolus and to his ways and designs  well to be short the captains came up before the town march up to eargate sit down there for that was the place of hearing so when they had pitched their tents and entrenched themselves they addressed themselves to make their assault  now the townsfolk at first beholding so gallant a company so bravely accoutred and so excellently disciplined having on their glittering armour and displaying of their flying colours could not but come out of their houses and gaze  but the cunning fox diabolus fearing that the people after this sight should on a sudden summons open the gates to the captains came down with all haste from the castle and made them retire into the body of the town who when he had them there made this lying and deceivable speech unto them  gentlemen quoth he although you are my trusty and wellbeloved friends yet i cannot but a little chide you for your late uncircumspect action in going out to gaze on that great and mighty force that but yesterday sat down before and have now entrenched themselves in order to the maintaining of a siege against the famous town of mansoul  do you know who they are whence they come and what is their purpose in sitting down before the town of mansoul  they are they of whom i have told you long ago that they would come to destroy this town and against whom i have been at the cost to arm you with capapie for your body besides great fortifications for your mind  wherefore then did you not rather even at the first appearance of them cry out fire the beacons and give the whole town an alarm concerning them that we might all have been in a posture of defence and been ready to have received them with the highest acts of defiance  then had you showed yourselves men to my liking whereas by what you have done you have made me half afraidi say half afraidthat when they and we shall come to push a pike i shall find you want courage to stand it out any longer  wherefore have i commanded a watch and that you should double your guards at the gates  wherefore have i endeavoured to make you as hard as iron and your hearts as a piece of the nether millstone  was it think you that you might show yourselves women and that you might go out like a company of innocents to gaze on your mortal foes  fie fie put yourselves into a posture of defence beat up the drum gather together in warlike manner that our foes may know that before they shall conquer this corporation there are valiant men in the town of mansoul  i will leave off now to chide and will not further rebuke you but i charge you that henceforwards you let me see no more such actions  let not henceforward a man of you without order first obtained from me so much as show his head over the wall of the town of mansoul  you have now heard me do as i have commanded and you shall cause me that i dwell securely with you and that i take care as for myself so for your safety and honour also farewell  now were the townsmen strangely altered they were as men stricken with a panic fear they ran to and fro through the streets of the town of mansoul crying out help help the men that turn the world upside down are come hither also  nor could any of them be quiet after but still as men bereft of wit they cried out the destroyers of our peace and people are come  this went down with diabolus  ah quoth he to himself this i like well  now it is as i would have it now you show your obedience to your prince hold you but here and then let them take the town if they can  well before the kings forces had sat before mansoul three days captain boanerges commanded his trumpeter to go down to eargate and there in the name of the great shaddai to summon mansoul to give audience to the message that he in his masters name was to them commanded to deliver  so the trumpeter whose name was take heedwhatyouhear went up as he was commanded to eargate and there sounded his trumpet for a hearing but there was none that appeared that gave answer or regard for so had diabolus commanded so the trumpeter returned to his captain and told him what he had done and also how he had sped whereat the captain was grieved but bid the trumpeter go to his tent  again captain boanerges sendeth his trumpeter to eargate to sound as before for a hearing but they again kept close came not out nor would they give him an answer so observant were they of the command of diabolus their king  then the captains and other field officers called a council of war to consider what further was to be done for the gaining of the town of mansoul and after some close and thorough debate upon the contents of their commissions they concluded yet to give to the town by the hand of the forenamed trumpeter another summons to hear but if that shall be refused said they and that the town shall stand it out still then they determined and bid the trumpeter tell them so that they would endeavour by what means they could to compel them by force to the obedience of their king  so captain boanerges commanded his trumpeter to go up to eargate again and in the name of the great king shaddai to give it a very loud summons to come down without delay to eargate there to give audience to the kings most noble captains  so the trumpeter went and did as he was commanded  he went up to eargate and sounded his trumpet and gave a third summons to mansoul  he said moreover that if this they should still refuse to do the captains of his prince would with might come down upon them and endeavour to reduce them to their obedience by force  then stood up my lord willbewill who was the governor of the town this willbewill was that apostate of whom mention was made before and the keeper of the gates of mansoul  he therefore with big and ruffling words demanded of the trumpeter who he was whence he came and what was the cause of his making so hideous a noise at the gate and speaking such insufferable words against the town of mansoul  the trumpeter answered i am servant to the most noble captain captain boanerges general of the forces of the great king shaddai against whom both thyself with the whole town of mansoul have rebelled and lift up the heel and my master the captain hath a special message to this town and to thee as a member thereof the which if you of mansoul shall peaceably hear so and if not you must take what follows  then said the lord willbewill i will carry thy words to my lord and will know what he will say  but the trumpeter soon replied saying  our message is not to the giant diabolus but to the miserable town of mansoul nor shall we at all regard what answer by him is made nor yet by any for him we are sent to this town to recover it from under his cruel tyranny and to persuade it to submit as in former times it did to the most excellent king shaddai  then said the lord willbewill i will do your errand to the town  the trumpeter then replied sir do not deceive us lest in so doing you deceive yourselves much more  he added moreover for we are resolved if in peaceable manner you do not submit yourselves then to make a war upon you and to bring you under by force  and of the truth of what i now say this shall be a sign unto youyou shall see the black flag with its hot burning thunderbolts set upon the mount tomorrow as a token of defiance against your prince and of our resolutions to reduce you to your lord and rightful king  so the said lord willbewill returned from off the wall and the trumpeter came into the camp  when the trumpeter was come into the camp the captains and officers of the mighty king shaddai came together to know if he had obtained a hearing and what was the effect of his errand  so the trumpeter told saying when i had sounded my trumpet and had called aloud to the town for a hearing my lord willbewill the governor of the town and he that hath charge of the gates came up when he heard me sound and looking over the wall he asked me what i was whence i came and what was the cause of my making this noise  so i told him my errand and by whose authority i brought it  then said he i will tell it to the governor and to mansoul and then i returned to my lords  then said the brave boanerges let us yet for a while lie still in our trenches and see what these rebels will do  now when the time drew nigh that audience by mansoul must be given to the brave boanerges and his companions it was commanded that all the men of war throughout the whole camp of shaddai should as one man stand to their arms and make themselves ready if the town of mansoul shall hear to receive it forthwith to mercy but if not to force a subjection  so the day being come the trumpeters sounded and that throughout the whole camp that the men of war might be in a readiness for that which then should be the work of the day  but when they that were in the town of mansoul heard the sound of the trumpets throughout the camp of shaddai and thinking no other but that it must be in order to storm the corporation they at first were put to great consternation of spirit but after they a little were settled again they also made what preparation they could for a war if they did storm else to secure themselves  well when the utmost time was come boanerges was resolved to hear their answer wherefore he sent out his trumpeter again to summon mansoul to a hearing of the message that they had brought from shaddai  so he went and sounded and the townsmen came up but made eargate as sure as they could  now when they were come up to the top of the wall captain boanerges desired to see the lord mayor but my lord incredulity was then lord mayor for he came in the room of my lord lustings  so incredulity came up and showed himself over the wall but when the captain boanerges had set his eyes upon him he cried out aloud this is not he  where is my lord understanding the ancient lord mayor of the town of mansoul for to him i would deliver my message  then said the giant for diabolus was also come down to the captain mr  captain you have by your boldness given to mansoul at least four summonses to subject herself to your king by whose authority i know not nor will i dispute that now  i ask therefore what is the reason of all this ado or what would you be at if you knew yourselves  then captain boanerges whose were the black colours and whose scutcheon was the three burning thunderbolts taking no notice of the giant or of his speech thus addressed himself to the town of mansoul  be it known unto you o unhappy and rebellious mansoul that the most gracious king the great king shaddai my master hath sent me unto you with commission and so he showed to the town his broad seal to reduce you to his obedience and he hath commanded me in case you yield upon my summons to carry it to you as if you were my friends or brethren but he also hath bid that if after summons to submit you still stand out and rebel we should endeavour to take you by force  then stood forth captain conviction and said his were the pale colours and for a scutcheon he had the book of the law wide open etc hear o mansoul  thou o mansoul wast once famous for innocency but now thou art degenerated into lies and deceit  thou hast heard what my brother the captain boanerges hath said and it is your wisdom and will be your happiness to stoop to and accept of conditions of peace and mercy when offered specially when offered by one against whom thou hast rebelled and one who is of power to tear thee in pieces for so is shaddai our king nor when he is angry can anything stand before him  if you say you have not sinned or acted rebellion against our king the whole of your doings since the day that you cast off his service and there was the beginning of your sin will sufficiently testify against you  what else means your hearkening to the tyrant and your receiving him for your king  what means else your rejecting of the laws of shaddai and your obeying of diabolus  yea what means this your taking up of arms against and the shutting of your gates upon us the faithful servants of your king  be ruled then and accept of my brothers invitation and overstand not the time of mercy but agree with thine adversary quickly  ah mansoul suffer not thyself to be kept from mercy and to be run into a thousand miseries by the flattering wiles of diabolus  perhaps that piece of deceit may attempt to make you believe that we seek our own profit in this our service but know it is obedience to our king and love to your happiness that is the cause of this undertaking of ours  again i say to thee o mansoul consider if it be not amazing grace that shaddai should so humble himself as he doth  now he by us reasons with you in a way of entreaty and sweet persuasions that you would subject yourselves to him  has he that need of you that we are sure you have of him  no no but he is merciful and will not that mansoul should die but turn to him and live  then stood forth captain judgment whose were the red colours and for a scutcheon he had the burning fiery furnace and he said o ye the inhabitants of the town of mansoul that have lived so long in rebellion and acts of treason against the king shaddai know that we come not today to this place in this manner with our message of our own minds or to revenge our own quarrel it is the king my master that hath sent us to reduce you to your obedience to him the which if you refuse in a peaceable way to yield we have commission to compel you thereto  and never think of yourselves nor yet suffer the tyrant diabolus to persuade you to think that our king by his power is not able to bring you down and to lay you under his feet for he is the former of all things and if he touches the mountains they smoke  nor will the gate of the kings clemency stand always open for the day that shall burn like an oven is before him yea it hasteth greatly it slumbereth not  o mansoul is it little in thine eyes that our king doth offer thee mercy and that after so many provocations  yea he still holdeth out his golden sceptre to thee and will not yet suffer his gate to be shut against thee  wilt thou provoke him to do it  if so consider of what i say to thee it is opened no more for ever if thou sayest thou shalt not see him yet judgment is before him therefore trust thou in him  yea because there is wrath beware lest he take thee away with his stroke then a great ransom cannot deliver thee  will he esteem thy riches  no not gold nor all the forces of strength  he hath prepared his throne for judgment for he will come with fire and with his chariots like a whirlwind to render his anger with fury and his rebukes with flames of fire therefore o mansoul take heed lest after thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked justice and judgment should take hold of thee  now while the captain judgment was making this oration to the town of mansoul it was observed by some that diabolus trembled but he proceeded in his parable and said o thou woful town of mansoul wilt thou not yet set open thy gate to receive us the deputies of thy king and those that would rejoice to see thee live  can thine heart endure or can thy hands be strong in the day that he shall deal in judgment with thee  i say canst thou endure to be forced to drink as one would drink sweet wine the sea of wrath that our king has prepared for diabolus and his angels  consider betimes consider  then stood forth the fourth captain the noble captain execution and said o town of mansoul once famous but now like the fruitless bough once the delight of the high ones but now a den for diabolus hearken also to me and to the words that i shall speak to thee in the name of the great shaddai  behold the axe is laid to the root of the trees  every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire  thou o town of mansoul hast hitherto been this fruitless tree thou bearest nought but thorns and briars  thy evil fruit bespeaks thee not to be a good tree thy grapes are grapes of gall thy clusters are bitter  thou hast rebelled against thy king and lo we the power and force of shaddai are the axe that is laid to thy root  what sayest thou  wilt thou turn  i say again tell me before the first blow is given wilt thou turn  our axe must first be laid to thy root before it be laid at thy root it must first be laid to thy root in a way of threatening before it is laid at thy root by way of execution and between these two is required thy repentance and this is all the time that thou hast  what wilt thou do  wilt thou turn or shall i smite  if i fetch my blow mansoul down you go for i have commission to lay my axe at as well as to thy roots nor will anything but yielding to our king prevent doing of execution  what art thou fit for o mansoul if mercy preventeth not but to be hewn down and cast into the fire and burned  o mansoul patience and forbearance do not act for ever  a year or two or three they may but if thou provoke by a three years rebellion and thou hast already done more than this then what follows but cut it down nay after that thou shalt cut it down  and dost thou think that these are but threatenings or that our king has not power to execute his words  o mansoul thou wilt find that in the words of our king when they are by sinners made little or light of there is not only threatening but burning coals of fire  thou hast been a cumberground long already and wilt thou continue so still  thy sin has brought this army to thy walls and shall it bring it in judgment to do execution into thy town  thou hast heard what the captains have said but as yet thou shuttest thy gates  speak out mansoul wilt thou do so still or wilt thou accept of conditions of peace  these brave speeches of these four noble captains the town of mansoul refused to hear yet a sound thereof did beat against ear gate though the force thereof could not break it open  in fine the town desired a time to prepare their answer to these demands the captains then told them that if they would throw out to them one illpause that was in the town that they might reward him according to his works then they would give them time to consider but if they would not cast him to them over the wall of mansoul then they would give them none for said they we know that so long as illpause draws breath in mansoul all good consideration will be confounded and nothing but mischief will come thereon  then diabolus who was there present being loath to lose his ill pause because he was his orator and yet be sure he had could the captains have laid their fingers on him was resolved at this instant to give them answer by himself but then changing his mind he commanded the then lord mayor the lord incredulity to do it saying my lord do you give these runagates an answer and speak out that mansoul may hear and understand you  so incredulity at diabolus command began and said gentlemen you have here as we do behold to the disturbance of our prince and the molestation of the town of mansoul camped against it  but from whence you come we will not know and what you are we will not believe  indeed you tell us in your terrible speech that you have this authority from shaddai but by what right he commands you to do it of that we shall yet be ignorant  you have also by the authority aforesaid summoned this town to desert her lord and for protection to yield up herself to the great shaddai your king flatteringly telling her that if she will do it he will pass by and not charge her with her past offences  further you have also to the terror of the town of mansoul threatened with great and sore destructions to punish this corporation if she consents not to do as your wills would have her  now captains from whencesoever you come and though your designs be ever so right yet know ye that neither my lord diabolus nor i his servant incredulity nor yet our brave mansoul doth regard either your persons message or the king that you say hath sent you  his power his greatness his vengeance we fear not nor will we yield at all to your summons  as for the war that you threaten to make upon us we must therein defend ourselves as well as we can and know ye that we are not without wherewithal to bid defiance to you and in short for i will not be tedious i tell you that we take you to be some vagabond runagate crew that having shaken off all obedience to your king have gotten together in tumultuous manner and are ranging from place to place to see if through the flatteries you are skilled to make on the one side and threats wherewith you think to fright on the other to make some silly town city or country desert their place and leave it to you but mansoul is none of them  to conclude  we dread you not we fear you not nor will we obey your summons  our gates we will shut upon you our place we will keep you out of  nor will we long thus suffer you to sit down before us  our people must live in quiet  your appearance doth disturb them  wherefore arise with bag and baggage and begone or we will let fly from the walls against you  this oration made by old incredulity was seconded by desperate willbewill in words to this effect  gentlemen we have heard your demands and the noise of your threats and have heard the sound of your summons but we fear not your force we regard not your threats but will still abide as you found us  and we command you that in three days time you cease to appear in these parts or you shall know what it is once to dare offer to rouse the lion diabolus when asleep in his town of mansoul  the recorder whose name was forgetgood he also added as followeth  gentlemen my lords as you see have with mild and gentle words answered your rough and angry speeches  they have moreover in my hearing given you leave quietly to depart as you came wherefore take their kindness and be gone  we might have come out with force upon you and have caused you to feel the dint of our swords but as we love ease and quiet ourselves so we love not to hurt or molest others  then did the town of mansoul shout for joy as if by diabolus and his crew some great advantage had been gotten of the captains they also rang the bells and made merry and danced upon the walls  diabolus also returned to the castle and the lord mayor and recorder to their place but the lord willbewill took special care that the gates should be secured with double guards double bolts and double locks and bars and that eargate especially might the better be looked to for that was the gate in at which the kings forces sought most to enter  the lord willbewill made one old mr prejudice an angry and illconditioned fellow captain of the ward at that gate and put under his power sixty men called deaf men men advantageous for that service forasmuch as they mattered no words of the captains nor of the soldiers  now when the captains saw the answer of the great ones and that they could not get a hearing from the old natives of the town and that mansoul was resolved to give the kings army battle they prepared themselves to receive them and to try it out by the power of the arm  and first they made their force more formidable against eargate for they knew that unless they could penetrate that no good could be done upon the town  this done they put the rest of their men in their places after which they gave out the word which was ye must be born again  then they sounded the trumpet then they in the town made them answer with shout against shout charge against charge and so the battle began  now they in the town had planted upon the tower over eargate two great guns the one called highmind and the other heady  unto these two guns they trusted much they were cast in the castle by diabolus founder whose name was mr puffup and mischievous pieces they were  but so vigilant and watchful when the captains saw them were they that though sometimes their shot would go by their ears with a whiz yet they did them no harm  by these two guns the townsfolk made no question but greatly to annoy the camp of shaddai and well enough to secure the gate but they had not much cause to boast of what execution they did as by what follows will be gathered  the famous mansoul had also some other small pieces in it of the which they made use against the camp of shaddai  they from the camp also did as stoutly and with as much of that as may in truth be called valour let fly as fast at the town and at eargate for they saw that unless they could break open eargate it would be but in vain to batter the wall  now the kings captains had brought with them several slings and two or three batteringrams with their slings therefore they battered the houses and people of the town and with their rams they sought to break eargate open  the camp and the town had several skirmishes and brisk encounters while the captains with their engines made many brave attempts to break open or beat down the tower that was over eargate and at the said gate to make their entrance but mansoul stood it out so lustily through the rage of diabolus the valour of the lord willbewill and the conduct of old incredulity the mayor and mr forgetgood the recorder that the charge and expense of that summers wars on the kings side seemed to be almost quite lost and the advantage to return to mansoul  but when the captains saw how it was they made a fair retreat and entrenched themselves in their winter quarters  now in this war you must needs think there was much loss on both sides of which be pleased to accept of this brief account following  the kings captains when they marched from the court to come up against mansoul to war as they came crossing over the country they happened to light upon three young fellows that had a mind to go for soldiers  proper men they were and men of courage and skill to appearance  their names were mr tradition mr human wisdom and mr mansinvention  so they came up to the captains and proffered their service to shaddai  the captains then told them of their design and bid them not to be rash in their offers but the young men told them they had considered the thing before and that hearing they were upon their march for such a design came hither on purpose to meet them that they might be listed under their excellencies  then captain boanerges for that they were men of courage listed them into his company and so away they went to the war  now when the war was begun in one of the briskest skirmishes so it was that a company of the lord willbewills men sallied out at the sallyport or postern of the town and fell in upon the rear of captain boanerges men where these three fellows happened to be so they took them prisoners and away they carried them into the town where they had not lain long in durance but it began to be noised about the streets of the town what three notable prisoners the lord willbewills men had taken and brought in prisoners out of the camp of shaddai  at length tidings thereof were carried to diabolus to the castle to wit what my lord willbewills men had done and whom they had taken prisoners  then diabolus called for willbewill to know the certainty of this matter  so he asked him and he told him  then did the giant send for the prisoners and when they were come demanded of them who they were whence they came and what they did in the camp of shaddai and they told him  then he sent them to ward again  not many days after he sent for them to him again and then asked them if they would be willing to serve him against their former captains  they then told him that they did not so much live by religion as by the fates of fortune and that since his lordship was willing to entertain them they should be willing to serve him now while things were thus in hand there was one captain anything a great doer in the town of mansoul and to this captain anything did diabolus send these men and a note under his hand to receive them into his company the contents of which letter were thus  anything my darlingthe three men that are the bearers of this letter have a desire to serve me in the war nor know i better to whose conduct to commit them than to thine  receive them therefore in my name and as need shall require make use of them against shaddai and his men  farewell  so they came and he received them and he made of two of them sergeants but he made mr mansinvention his ancientbearer  but thus much for this and now to return to the camp  they of the camp did also some execution upon the town for they did beat down the roof of the lord mayors house and so laid him more open than he was before  they had almost with a sling slain my lord willbewill outright but he made a shift to recover again but they made a notable slaughter among the aldermen for with one only shot they cut off six of them to wit mr swearing mr whoring mr fury mr standtolies mr drunkenness and mr cheating  they also dismounted the two guns that stood upon the tower over eargate and laid them flat in the dirt  i told you before that the kings noble captains had drawn off to their winter quarters and had there entrenched themselves and their carriages so as with the best advantage to their king and the greatest annoyance to the enemy they might give seasonable and warm alarms to the town of mansoul  and this design of them did so hit that i may say they did almost what they would to the molestation of the corporation for now could not mansoul sleep securely as before nor could they now go to their debaucheries with that quietness as in times past for they had from the camp of shaddai such frequent warm and terrifying alarms yea alarms upon alarms first at one gate and then at another and again at all the gates at once that they were broken as to former peace  yea they had their alarms so frequently and that when the nights were at longest the weather coldest and so consequently the season most unseasonable that that winter was to the town of mansoul a winter by itself sometimes the trumpets would sound and sometimes the slings would whirl the stones into the town  sometimes ten thousand of the kings soldiers would be running round the walls of mansoul at midnight shouting and lifting up the voice for the battle sometimes again some of them in the town would be wounded and their cry and lamentable voice would be heard to the great molestation of the now languishing town of mansoul  yea so distressed with those that laid siege against them were they that i dare say diabolus their king had in these days his rest much broken  in these days as i was informed new thoughts and thoughts that began to run counter one to another began to possess the minds of the men of the town of mansoul  some would say there is no living thus  others would then reply this will be over shortly  then would a third stand up and answer let us turn to the king shaddai and so put an end to these troubles  and a fourth would come in with a fear saying i doubt he will not receive us  the old gentleman too the recorder that was so before diabolus took mansoul he also began to talk aloud and his words were now to the town of mansoul as if they were great claps of thunder  no noise now so terrible to mansoul as was his with the noise of the soldiers and shoutings of the captains  also things began to grow scarce in mansoul now the things that her soul lusted after were departing from her  upon all her pleasant things there was a blast and burning instead of beauty wrinkles now and some shows of the shadow of death were upon the inhabitants of mansoul  and now o how glad would mansoul have been to have enjoyed quietness and satisfaction of mind though joined with the meanest condition in the world  the captains also in the deep of this winter did send by the mouth of boanerges trumpeter a summons to mansoul to yield up herself to the king the great king shaddai  they sent it once and twice and thrice not knowing but that at some times there might be in mansoul some willingness to surrender up themselves unto them might they but have the colour of an invitation to do it under  yea so far as i could gather the town had been surrendered up to them before now had it not been for the opposition of old incredulity and the fickleness of the thoughts of my lord willbewill  diabolus also began to rave wherefore mansoul as to yielding was not yet all of one mind therefore they still lay distressed under these perplexing fears  i told you but now that they of the kings army had this winter sent three times to mansoul to submit herself  the first time the trumpeter went he went with words of peace telling them that the captains the noble captains of shaddai did pity and bewail the misery of the now perishing town of mansoul and were troubled to see them so much to stand in the way of their own deliverance  he said moreover that the captains bid him tell them that if now poor mansoul would humble herself and turn her former rebellions and most notorious treasons should by their merciful king be forgiven them yea and forgotten too  and having bid them beware that they stood not in their own way that they opposed not themselves nor made themselves their own losers he returned again into the camp  the second time the trumpeter went he did treat them a little more roughly for after sound of trumpet he told them that their continuing in their rebellion did but chafe and heat the spirit of the captains and that they were resolved to make a conquest of mansoul or to lay their bones before the town walls  he went again the third time and dealt with them yet more roughly telling them that now since they had been so horribly profane he did not know not certainly know whether the captains were inclining to mercy or judgment  only said he they commanded me to give you a summons to open the gates unto them  so he returned and went into the camp  these three summonses and especially the last two did so distress the town that they presently call a consultation the result of which was thisthat my lord willbewill should go up to eargate and there with sound of trumpet call to the captains of the camp for a parley  well the lord willbewill sounded upon the wall so the captains came up in their harness with their ten thousands at their feet  the townsmen then told the captains that they had heard and considered their summons and would come to an agreement with them and with their king shaddai upon such certain terms articles and propositions as with and by the order of their prince they to them were appointed to propound to wit they would agree upon these grounds to be one people with them  1 if that those of their own company as the now lord mayor and their mr forgetgood with then brave lord willbewill might under shaddai be still the governors of the town castle and gates of mansoul  2 provided that no man that now serveth under their great giant diabolus be by shaddai cast out of house harbour or the freedom that he hath hitherto enjoyed in the famous town of mansoul  3 that it shall be granted them that they of the town of mansoul shall enjoy certain of their rights and privileges to wit such as have formerly been granted them and that they have long lived in the enjoyment of under the reign of their king diabolus that now is and long has been their only lord and great defender  4 that no new law officer or executioner of law or office shall have any power over them without their own choice and consent  these be our propositions or conditions of peace and upon these terms said they we will submit to your king  but when the captains had heard this weak and feeble offer of the town of mansoul and their high and bold demands they made to them again by their noble captain the captain boanerges this speech following  o ye inhabitants of the town of mansoul when i heard your trumpet sound for a parley with us i can truly say i was glad but when you said you were willing to submit yourselves to our king and lord then i was yet more glad but when by your silly provisos and foolish cavils you laid the stumblingblock of your iniquity before your own faces then was my gladness turned into sorrows and my hopeful beginnings of your return into languishing fainting fears  i count that old illpause the ancient enemy of mansoul did draw up those proposals that now you present us with as terms of an agreement but they deserve not to be admitted to sound in the ear of any man that pretends to have service for shaddai  we do therefore jointly and that with the highest disdain refuse and reject such things as the greatest of iniquities  but o mansoul if you will give yourselves into our hands or rather into the hands of our king and will trust him to make such terms with and for you as shall seem good in his eyes and i dare say they shall be such as you shall find to be most profitable to you then we will receive you and be at peace with you but if you like not to trust yourselves in the arms of shaddai our king then things are but where they were before and we know also what we have to do  then cried out old incredulity the lord mayor and said and who being out of the hands of their enemies as ye see we are now will be so foolish as to put the staff out of their own hands into the hands of they know not who  i for my part will never yield to so unlimited a proposition  do we know the manner and temper of their king  it is said by some that he will be angry with his subjects if but the breadth of an hair they chance to step out of the way and by others that he requireth of them much more than they can perform  wherefore it seems o mansoul to be thy wisdom to take good heed what thou dost in this matter for if you once yield you give up yourselves to another and so you are no more your own wherefore to give up yourselves to an unlimited power is the greatest folly in the world for now you indeed may repent but can never justly complain  but do you indeed know when you are his which of you he will kill and which of you he will save alive or whether he will not cut off every one of us and send out of his own country another new people and cause them to inhabit this town  this speech of the lord mayor undid all and threw flat to the ground their hopes of an accord  wherefore the captains returned to their trenches to their tents and to their men as they were and the mayor to the castle and to his king  now diabolus had waited for his return for he had heard that they had been at their points  so when he was come into the chamber of state diabolus saluted him withwelcome my lord  how went matters betwixt you today  so the lord incredulity with a low congee told him the whole of the matter saying thus and thus said the captains of shaddai and thus and thus said i  the which when it was told to diabolus he was very glad to hear it and said my lord mayor my faithful incredulity i have proved thy fidelity above ten times already but never yet found thee false i do promise thee if we rub over this brunt to prefer thee to a place of honour a place far better than to be lord mayor of mansoul  i will make thee my universal deputy and thou shalt next to me have all nations under thy hand yea and thou shalt lay bands upon them that they may not resist thee nor shall any of our vassals walk more at liberty but those that shall be content to walk in thy fetters  now came the lord mayor out from diabolus as if he had obtained a favour indeed  wherefore to his habitation he goes in great state and thinks to feed himself well enough with hopes until the time came that his greatness should be enlarged  but now though the lord mayor and diabolus did thus well agree yet this repulse to the brave captains put mansoul into a mutiny for while old incredulity went into the castle to congratulate his lord with what had passed the old lord mayor that was so before diabolus came to the town to wit my lord understanding and the old recorder mr conscience getting intelligence of what had passed at eargate for you must know that they might not be suffered to be at that debate lest they should then have mutinied for the captains but i say they got intelligence of what had passed there and were much concerned therewith wherefore they getting some of the town together began to possess them with the reasonableness of the noble captains demands and with the bad consequences that would follow upon the speech of old incredulity the lord mayor to wit how little reverence he showed therein either to the captains or to their king also how he implicitly charged them with unfaithfulness and treachery  for what less quoth they could be made of his words when he said he would not yield to their proposition and added moreover a supposition that he would destroy us when before he had sent us word that he would show us mercy  the multitude being now possessed with the conviction of the evil that old incredulity had done began to run together by companies in all places and in every corner of the streets of mansoul and first they began to mutter then to talk openly and after that they run to and fro and cried as they run oh the brave captains of shaddai would we were under the government of the captains and of shaddai their king  when the lord mayor had intelligence that mansoul was in an uproar down he comes to appease the people and thought to have quashed their heat with the bigness and the show of his countenance but when they saw him they came running upon him and had doubtless done him a mischief had he not betaken himself to house  however they strongly assaulted the house where he was to have pulled it down about his ears but the place was too strong so they failed of that  so he taking some courage addressed himself out at a window to the people in this manner  gentlemen what is the reason that there is here such an uproar today  then answered my lord understanding it is even because that thou and thy master have carried it not rightly and as you should to the captains of shaddai for in three things you are faulty first in that you would not let mr conscience and myself be at the hearing of your discourse  secondly in that you propounded such terms of peace to the captains that by no means could be granted unless they had intended that their shaddai should have been only a titular prince and that mansoul should still have had power by law to have lived in all lewdness and vanity before him and so by consequence diabolus should still here be king in power and the other only king in name  thirdly for that thou didst thyself after the captains had showed us upon what conditions they would have received us to mercy even undo all again with thy unsavoury unseasonable and ungodly speech  when old incredulity had heard this speech he cried out treason treason  to your arms to your arms  o ye the trusty friends of diabolus in mansoul  undsir you may put upon my words what meaning you please but i am sure that the captains of such an high lord as theirs is deserved a better treatment at your hands  then said old incredulity this is but little better  but sir quoth he what i spake i spake for my prince for his government and the quieting of the people whom by your unlawful actions you have this day set to mutiny against us  then replied the old recorder whose name was mr conscience and said sir you ought not thus to retort upon what my lord understanding hath said  it is evident enough that he hath spoken the truth and that you are an enemy to mansoul  be convinced then of the evil of your saucy and malapert language and of the grief that you have put the captains to yea and of the damages that you have done to mansoul thereby  had you accepted of the conditions the sound of the trumpet and the alarm of war had now ceased about the town of mansoul but that dreadful sound abides and your want of wisdom in your speech has been the cause of it  then said old incredulity sir if i live i will do your errand to diabolus and there you shall have an answer to your words meanwhile we will seek the good of the town and not ask counsel of you  undsir your prince and you are both foreigners to mansoul and not the natives thereof and who can tell but that when you have brought us into greater straits when you also shall see that yourselves can be safe by no other means than by flight you may leave us and shift for yourselves or set us on fire and go away in the smoke or by the light of our burning and so leave us in our ruins  incredsir you forget that you are under a governor and that you ought to demean yourself like a subject and know ye when my lord the king shall hear of this days work he will give you but little thanks for your labour  now while these gentlemen were thus in their chiding words down come from the walls and gates of the town the lord willbewill mr prejudice old illpause and several of the newmade aldermen and burgesses and they asked the reason of the hubbub and tumult and with that every man began to tell his own tale so that nothing could be heard distinctly  then was a silence commanded and the old fox incredulity began to speak  my lord quoth he here are a couple of peevish gentlemen that have as a fruit of their bad dispositions and as i fear through the advice of one mr discontent tumultuously gathered this company against me this day and also attempted to run the town into acts of rebellion against our prince  then stood up all the diabolonians that were present and affirmed these things to be true  now when they that took part with my lord understanding and with mr conscience perceived that they were like to come to the worst for that force and power was on the other side they came in for their help and relief so a great company was on both sides  then they on incredulitys side would have had the two old gentlemen presently away to prison but they on the other side said they should not  then they began to cry up parties again  the diabolonians cried up old incredulity forgetgood the new aldermen and their great one diabolus and the other party they as fast cried up shaddai the captains his laws their mercifulness and applauded their conditions and ways  thus the bickerment went awhile at last they passed from words to blows and now there were knocks on both sides  the good old gentleman mr conscience was knocked down twice by one of the diabolonians whose name was mr benumbing and my lord understanding had like to have been slain with an arquebuse but that he that shot did not take his aim aright  nor did the other side wholly escape for there was one mr rashhead a diabolonian that had his brains beaten out by mr mind the lord willbewills servant and it made me laugh to see how old mr prejudice was kicked and tumbled about in the dirt for though a while since he was made captain of a company of the diabolonians to the hurt and damage of the town yet now they had got him under their feet and ill assure you he had by some of the lord understandings party his crown cracked to boot  mr anything also he became a brisk man in the broil but both sides were against him because he was true to none  yet he had for his malapertness one of his legs broken and he that did it wished it had been his neck  much more harm was done on both sides but this must not be forgotten it was now a wonder to see my lord willbewill so indifferent as he was  he did not seem to take one side more than another only it was perceived that he smiled to see how old prejudice was tumbled up and down in the dirt  also when captain anything came halting up before him he seemed to take but little notice of him  now when the uproar was over diabolus sends for my lord understanding and mr conscience and claps them both up in prison as the ringleaders and managers of this most heavy riotous rout in mansoul  so now the town began to be quiet again and the prisoners were used hardly yea he thought to have made them away but that the present juncture did not serve for that purpose for that war was in all their gates  but let us return again to our story  the captains when they were gone back from the gate and were come into the camp again called a council of war to consult what was further for them to do  now some said let us go up presently and fall upon the town but the greatest part thought rather better it would be to give them another summons to yield and the reason why they thought this to be best was because that so far as could be perceived the town of mansoul now was more inclinable than heretofore  and if said they while some of them are in a way of inclination we should by ruggedness give them distaste we may set them further from closing with our summons than we would be willing they should  wherefore to this advice they agreed and called a trumpeter put words into his mouth set him his time and bid him god speed  well many hours were not expired before the trumpeter addressed himself to his journey  wherefore coming up to the wall of the town he steereth his course to eargate and there sounded as he was commanded  they then that were within came out to see what was the matter and the trumpeter made them this speech following  o hardhearted and deplorable town of mansoul how long wilt thou love thy sinful sinful simplicity and ye fools delight in your scorning  as yet despise you the offers of peace and deliverance as yet will ye refuse the golden offers of shaddai and trust to the lies and falsehoods of diabolus  think you when shaddai shall have conquered you that the remembrance of these your carriages towards him will yield you peace and comfort or that by ruffling language you can make him afraid as a grasshopper  doth he entreat you for fear of you  do you think that you are stronger than he look to the heavens and behold and consider the stars how high are they  can you stop the sun from running his course and hinder the moon from giving her light  can you count the number of the stars or stay the bottles of heaven  can you call for the waters of the sea and cause them to cover the face of the ground  can you behold every one that is proud and abase him and bind their faces in secret  yet these are some of the works of our king in whose name this day we come up unto you that you may be brought under his authority  in his name therefore i summon you again to yield up yourselves to his captains  at this summons the mansoulians seemed to be at a stand and knew not what answer to make  wherefore diabolus forthwith appeared and took upon him to do it himself and thus he begins but turns his speech to them of mansoul  gentlemen quoth he and my faithful subjects if it is true that this summoner hath said concerning the greatness of their king by his terror you will always be kept in bondage and so be made to sneak  yea how can you now though he is at a distance endure to think of such a mighty one  and if not to think of him while at a distance how can you endure to be in his presence  i your prince am familiar with you and you may play with me as you would with a grasshopper  consider therefore what is for your profit and remember the immunities that i have granted you  farther if all be true that this man hath said how comes it to pass that the subjects of shaddai are so enslaved in all places where they come  none in the universe so unhappy as they none so trampled upon as they  consider my mansoul  would thou wert as loath to leave me as i am loath to leave thee  but consider i say the ball is yet at thy foot liberty you have if you know how to use it yea a king you have too if you can tell how to love and obey him  upon this speech the town of mansoul did again harden their hearts yet more against the captains of shaddai  the thoughts of his greatness did quite quash them and the thoughts of his holiness sunk them in despair  wherefore after a short consult they of the diabolonian party they were sent back this word by the trumpeter that for their parts they were resolved to stick to their king but never to yield to shaddai so it was but in vain to give them any further summons for they had rather die upon the place than yield  and now things seemed to be gone quite back and mansoul to be out of reach or call yet the captains who knew what their lord could do would not yet be beat out of heart they therefore sent them another summons more sharp and severe than the last but the oftener they were sent to to reconcile to shaddai the further off they were  as they called them so they went from themyea though they called them to the most high  so they ceased that way to deal with them any more and inclined to think of another way  the captains therefore did gather themselves together to have free conference among themselves to know what was yet to be done to gain the town and to deliver it from the tyranny of diabolus and one said after this manner and another after that  then stood up the right noble the captain conviction and said my brethren mine opinion is this  first that we continually play our slings into the town and keep it in a continual alarm molesting them day and night  by thus doing we shall stop the growth of their rampant spirit for a lion may be tamed by continual molestation  secondly this done i advise that in the next place we with one consent draw up a petition to our lord shaddai by which after we have showed our king the condition of mansoul and of affairs here and have begged his pardon for our no better success we will earnestly implore his majestys help and that he will please to send us more force and power and some gallant and wellspoken commander to head them that so his majesty may not lose the benefit of these his good beginnings but may complete his conquest upon the town of mansoul  to this speech of the noble captain conviction they as one man consented and agreed that a petition should forthwith be drawn up and sent by a fit man away to shaddai with speed  the contents of the petition were thus  most gracious and glorious king the lord of the best world and the builder of the town of mansoul we have dread sovereign at thy commandment put our lives in jeopardy and at thy bidding made a war upon the famous town of mansoul  when we went up against it we did according to our commission first offer conditions of peace unto it  but they great king set light by our counsel and would none of our reproof  they were for shutting their gates and for keeping us out of the town  they also mounted their guns they sallied out upon us and have done us what damage they could but we pursued them with alarm upon alarm requiting them with such retribution as was meet and have done some execution upon the town  diabolus incredulity and willbewill are the great doers against us  now we are in our winter quarters but so as that we do yet with an high hand molest and distress the town  once as we think had we had but one substantial friend in the town such as would but have seconded the sound of our summons as they ought the people might have yielded themselves but there were none but enemies there nor any to speak in behalf of our lord to the town  wherefore though we have done as we could yet mansoul abides in a state of rebellion against thee  now king of kings let it please thee to pardon the unsuccessfulness of thy servants who have been no more advantageous in so desirable a work as the conquering of mansoul is  and send lord as we now desire more forces to mansoul that it may be subdued and a man to head them that the town may both love and fear  we do not thus speak because we are willing to relinquish the wars for we are for laying of our bones against the place but that the town of mansoul may be won for thy majesty  we also pray thy majesty for expedition in this matter that after their conquest we may be at liberty to be sent about other thy gracious designs  amen  the petition thus drawn up was sent away with haste to the king by the hand of that good man mr lovetomansoul  when this petition was come to the palace of the king who should it be delivered to but to the kings son  so he took it and read it and because the contents of it pleased him well he mended and also in some things added to the petition himself  so after he had made such amendments and additions as he thought convenient with his own hand he carried it in to the king to whom when he had with obeisance delivered it he put on authority and spake to it himself  now the king at the sight of the petition was glad but how much more think you when it was seconded by his son  it pleased him also to hear that his servants who camped against mansoul were so hearty in the work and so steadfast in their resolves and that they had already got some ground upon the famous town of mansoul  wherefore the king called to him emmanuel his son who said here am i my father  then said the king thou knowest as i do myself the condition of the town of mansoul and what we have purposed and what thou hast done to redeem it  come now therefore my son and prepare thyself for the war for thou shalt go to my camp at mansoul  thou shalt also there prosper and prevail and conquer the town of mansoul  then said the kings son thy law is within my heart  i delight to do thy will  this is the day that i have longed for and the work that i have waited for all this while  grant me therefore what force thou shalt in thy wisdom think meet and i will go and will deliver from diabolus and from his power thy perishing town of mansoul  my heart has been often pained within me for the miserable town of mansoul but now it is rejoiced but now it is glad  and with that he leaped over the mountains for joy saying i have not in my heart thought anything too dear for mansoul  the day of vengeance is in mine heart for thee my mansoul  and glad am i that thou my father hast made me the captain of their salvation and i will now begin to plague all those that have been a plague to my town of mansoul and will deliver it from their hand  when the kings son had said thus to his father it presently flew like lightning round about at court yea it there became the only talk what emmanuel was to go to do for the famous town of mansoul but you cannot think how the courtiers too were taken with this design of the prince yea so affected were they with this work and with the justness of the war that the highest lord and greatest peer of the kingdom did covet to have commissions under emmanuel to go to help to recover again to shaddai the miserable town of mansoul  then was it concluded that some should go and carry tidings to the camp that emmanuel was to come to recover mansoul and that he would bring along with him so mighty so impregnable a force that he could not be resisted  but oh how ready were the high ones at court to run like lackeys to carry these tidings to the camp that was at mansoul  now when the captains perceived that the king would send emmanuel his son and that it also delighted the son to be sent on this errand by the great shaddai his father they also to show how they were pleased at the thoughts of his coming gave a shout that made the earth rend at the sound thereof  yea the mountains did answer again by echo and diabolus himself did totter and shake  for you must know that though the town of mansoul itself was not much if at all concerned with the project for alas for them they were wofully besotted for they chiefly regarded their pleasure and their lusts yet diabolus their governor was for he had his spies continually abroad who brought him intelligence of all things and they told him what was doing at court against him and that emmanuel would shortly certainly come with a power to invade him  nor was there any man at court nor peer of the kingdom that diabolus so feared as he feared this prince for if you remember i showed you before that diabolus had felt the weight of his hand already so that since it was he that was to come this made him the more afraid  well you see how i have told you that the kings son was engaged to come from the court to save mansoul and that his father had made him the captain of the forces  the time therefore of his setting forth being now expired he addressed himself for his march and taketh with him for his power five noble captains and their forces  1 the first was that famous captain the noble captain credence his were the red colours and mr promise bare them and for a scutcheon he had the holy lamb and golden shield and he had ten thousand men at his feet  2 the second was that famous captain the captain goodhope  his were the blue colours his standardbearer was mr expectation and for his scutcheon he had the three golden anchors and he had ten thousand men at his feet  3 the third was that valiant captain the captain charity  his standardbearer was mr pitiful  his were the green colours and for his scutcheon he had three naked orphans embraced in the bosom and he had ten thousand men at his feet  4 the fourth was that gallant commander the captain innocent his standardbearer was mr harmless  his were the white colours and for his scutcheon he had the three golden doves  5 the fifth was the truly loyal and wellbeloved captain the captain patience  his standardbearer was mr sufferlong  his were the black colours and for a scutcheon he had three arrows through the golden heart  these were emmanuels captains these their standardbearers their colours and their scutcheons and these the men under their command  so as was said the brave prince took his march to go to the town of mansoul  captain credence led the van and captain patience brought up the rear so the other three with their men made up the main body the prince himself riding in his chariot at the head of them  but when they set out for their march oh how the trumpets sounded their armour glittered and how the colours waved in the wind  the princes armour was all of gold and it shone like the sun in the firmament the captains armour was of proof and was in appearance like the glittering stars  there were also some from the court that rode reformades for the love that they had to the king shaddai and for the happy deliverance of the town of mansoul  emmanuel also when he had thus set forwards to go to recover the town of mansoul took with him at the commandment of his father fiftyfour batteringrams and twelve slings to whirl stones withal  every one of these was made of pure gold and these they carried with them in the heart and body of their army all along as they went to mansoul  so they marched till they came within less than a league of the town there they lay till the first four captains came thither to acquaint them with matters  then they took their journey to go to the town of mansoul and unto mansoul they came but when the old soldiers that were in the camp saw that they had new forces to join with they again gave such a shout before the walls of the town of mansoul that it put diabolus into another fright  so they sat down before the town not now as the other four captains did to wit against the gates of mansoul only but they environed it round on every side and beset it behind and before so that now let mansoul look which way it will it saw force and power lie in siege against it  besides there were mounts cast up against it  the mount gracious was on the one side and mount justice was on the other  further there were several small banks and advance grounds as plaintruth hill and nosin banks where many of the slings were placed against the town  upon mount gracious were planted four and upon mount justice were placed as many and the rest were conveniently placed in several parts round about the town  five of the best batteringrams that is of the biggest of them were placed upon mount hearken a mount cast up hard by ear gate with intent to break that open  now when the men of the town saw the multitude of the soldiers that were come up against the place and the rams and slings and the mounts on which they were planted together with the glittering of the armour and the waving of their colours they were forced to shift and shift and again to shift their thoughts but they hardly changed for thoughts more stout but rather for thoughts more faint for though before they thought themselves sufficiently guarded yet now they began to think that no man knew what would be their hap or lot  when the good prince emmanuel had thus beleaguered mansoul in the first place he hangs out the white flag which he caused to be set up among the golden slings that were planted upon mount gracious and this he did for two reasons  1 to give notice to mansoul that he could and would yet be gracious if they turned to him  2 and that he might leave them the more without excuse should he destroy them they continuing in their rebellion  so the white flag with the three golden doves in it was hung out for two days together to give them time and space to consider but they as was hinted before as if they were unconcerned made no reply to the favourable signal of the prince  then he commanded and they set the red flag upon that mount called mount justice  it was the red flag of captain judgment whose scutcheon was the burning fiery furnace and this also stood waving before them in the wind for several days together  but look how they carried it under the white flag when that was hung out so did they also when the red one was and yet he took no advantage of them  then he commanded again that his servants should hang out the black flag of defiance against them whose scutcheon was the three burning thunderbolts but as unconcerned was mansoul at this as at those that went before  but when the prince saw that neither mercy nor judgment nor execution of judgment would or could come near the heart of mansoul he was touched with much compunction and said surely this strange carriage of the town of mansoul doth rather arise from ignorance of the manner and feats of war than from a secret defiance of us and abhorrence of their own lives or if they know the manner of the war of their own yet not the rites and ceremonies of the wars in which we are concerned when i make wars upon mine enemy diabolus  therefore he sent to the town of mansoul to let them know what he meant by those signs and ceremonies of the flag and also to know of them which of the things they would choose whether grace and mercy or judgment and the execution of judgment  all this while they kept their gates shut with locks bolts and bars as fast as they could  their guards also were doubled and their watch made as strong as they could  diabolus also did pluck up what heart he could to encourage the town to make resistance  the townsmen also made answer to the princes messenger in substance according to that which follows  great siras to what by your messenger you have signified to us whether we will accept of your mercy or fall by your justice we are bound by the law and custom of this place and can give you no positive answer for it is against the law government and the prerogative royal of our king to make either peace or war without him  but this we will dowe will petition that our prince will come down to the wall and there give you such treatment as he shall think fit and profitable for us  when the good prince emmanuel heard this answer and saw the slavery and bondage of the people and how much content they were to abide in the chains of the tyrant diabolus it grieved him at the heart and indeed when at any time he perceived that any were contented under the slavery of the giant he would be affected with it  but to return again to our purpose  after the town had carried this news to diabolus and had told him moreover that the prince that lay in the leaguer without the wall waited upon them for an answer he refused and huffed as well as he could but in heart he was afraid  then said he i will go down to the gates myself and give him such an answer as i think fit  so he went down to mouthgate and there addressed himself to speak to emmanuel but in such language as the town understood not the contents whereof were as follows  o thou great emmanuel lord of all the world i know thee that thou art the son of the great shaddai  wherefore art thou come to torment me and to cast me out of my possession  this town of mansoul as thou very well knowest is mine and that by a twofold right 1 it is mine by right of conquest i won it in the open field and shall the prey be taken from the mighty or the lawful captive be delivered  2 this town of mansoul is mine also by their subjection  they have opened the gates of their town unto me they have sworn fidelity to me and have openly chosen me to be their king they have also given their castle into my hands yea they have put the whole strength of mansoul under me  moreover this town of mansoul hath disavowed thee yea they have cast thy law thy name thy image and all that is thine behind their back and have accepted and set up in their room my law my name my image and all that ever is mine  ask else thy captains and they will tell thee that mansoul hath in answer to all their summonses shown love and loyalty to me but always disdain despite contempt and scorn to thee and thine  now thou art the just one and the holy and shouldest do no iniquity  depart then i pray thee therefore from me and leave me to my just inheritance peaceably  this oration was made in the language of diabolus himself for although he can to every man speak in their own language else he could not tempt them all as he does yet he has a language proper to himself and it is the language of the infernal cave or black pit  wherefore the town of mansoul poor hearts understood him not nor did they see how he crouched and cringed while he stood before emmanuel their prince  yea they all this while took him to be one of that power and force that by no means could be resisted  wherefore while he was thus entreating that he might have yet his residence there and that emmanuel would not take it from him by force the inhabitants boasted even of his valour saying who is able to make war with him  well when this pretended king had made an end of what he would say emmanuel the golden prince stood up and spake the contents of whose words follow  thou deceiving one said he i have in my fathers name in mine own name and on the behalf and for the good of this wretched town of mansoul somewhat to say unto thee  thou pretendest a right a lawful right to the deplorable town of mansoul when it is most apparent to all my fathers court that the entrance which thou hast obtained in at the gates of mansoul was through thy lie and falsehood thou beliedst my father thou beliedst his law and so deceivedst the people of mansoul  thou pretendest that the people have accepted thee for their king their captain and right liege lord but that also was by the exercise of deceit and guile now if lying wiliness sinful craft and all manner of horrible hypocrisy will go in my fathers court in which court thou must be tried for equity and right then will i confess unto thee that thou hast made a lawful conquest  but alas what thief what tyrant what devil is there that may not conquer after this sort but i can make it appear o diabolus that thou in all thy pretences to a conquest of mansoul hast nothing of truth to say thinkest thou this to be right that that didst put the lie upon my father and madest him to mansoul the greatest deluder in the world  and what sayest thou to thy perverting knowingly the right purport and intent of the law  was it good also that thou madest a prey of the innocency and simplicity of the now miserable town of mansoul  yea thou didst overcome mansoul by promising to them happiness in their transgressions against my fathers law when thou knewest and couldest not but know hadst thou consulted nothing but thine own experience that that was the way to undo them  thou hast also thyself o thou master of enmity of spite defaced my fathers image in mansoul and set up thy own in its place to the great contempt of my father the heightening of thy sin and to the intolerable damage of the perishing town of mansoul  thou hast moreover as if all these were but little things with thee not only deluded and undone this place but by thy lies and fradulent carriage hast set them against their own deliverance how hast thou stirred them up against my fathers captains and made them to fight against those that were sent of him to deliver them from their bondage  all these things and very many more thou hast done against thy light and in contempt of my father and of his law yea and with design to bring under his displeasure for ever the miserable town of mansoul  i am therefore come to avenge the wrong that thou hast done to my father and to deal with thee for the blasphemies wherewith thou hast made poor mansoul blaspheme his name  yea upon thy head thou prince of the infernal cave will i requite it  as for myself o diabolus i am come against thee by lawful power and to take by strength of hand this town of mansoul out of thy burning fingers for this town of mansoul is mine o diabolus and that by undoubted right as all shall see that will diligently search the most ancient and most authentic records and i will plead my title to it to the confusion of thy face  first for the town of mansoul my father built and did fashion it with his hand  the palace also that is in the midst of that town he built it for his own delight  this town of mansoul therefore is my fathers and that by the best of titles and he that gainsays the truth of this must lie against his soul  secondly o thou master of the lie this town of mansoul is mine  1 for that i am my fathers heir his firstborn and the only delight of his heart  i am therefore come up against thee in mine own right even to recover mine own inheritance out of thine hand  2 but further as i have a right and title to mansoul by being my fathers heir so i have also by my fathers donation  his it was and he gave it me nor have i at any time offended my father that he should take it from me and give it to thee  nor have i been forced by playing the bankrupt to sell or set to sale to thee my beloved town of mansoul  mansoul is my desire my delight and the joy of my heart  but  3 mansoul is mine by right of purchase  i have bought it o diabolus i have bought it to myself  now since it was my fathers and mine as i was his heir and since also i have made it mine by virtue of a great purchase it followeth that by all lawful right the town of mansoul is mine and that thou art an usurper a tyrant and traitor in thy holding possession thereof now the cause of my purchasing of it was this  mansoul had trespassed against my father now my father had said that in the day that they broke his law they should die  now it is more possible for heaven and earth to pass away than for my father to break his word  wherefore when mansoul had sinned indeed by hearkening to thy lie i put in and became a surety to my father body for body and soul for soul that i would make amends for mansouls transgressions and my father did accept thereof  so when the time appointed was come i gave body for body soul for soul life for life blood for blood and so redeemed my beloved mansoul  4 nor did i do this by halves  my fathers law and justice that were both concerned in the threatening upon transgression are both now satisfied and very well content that mansoul should be delivered  5 nor am i come out this day against thee but by commandment of my father it was he that said unto me go down and deliver mansoul  wherefore be it known unto thee o thou fountain of deceit and be it also known to the foolish town of mansoul that i am not come against thee this day without my father  and now said the goldenheaded prince i have a word to the town of mansoul  but so soon as mention was made that he had a word to speak to the besotted town of mansoul the gates were doubleguarded and all men commanded not to give him audience  so he proceeded and said o unhappy town of mansoul i cannot but be touched with pity and compassion for thee  thou hast accepted of diabolus for thy king and art become a nurse and minister of diabolonians against thy sovereign lord  thy gates thou hast opened to him but hast shut them fast against me thou hast given him an hearing but hast stopped thine ears at my cry  he brought to thee thy destruction and thou didst receive both him and it  i am come to thee bringing salvation but thou regardest me not besides thou hast as with sacrilegious hands taken thyself with all that was mine in thee and hast given all to my foe and to the greatest enemy my father has  you have bowed and subjected yourselves to him you have vowed and sworn yourselves to be his poor mansoul what shall i do unto thee  shall i save theeshall i destroy thee  what shall i do unto thee  shall i fall upon thee and grind thee to powder or make thee a monument of the richest grace  what shall i do unto thee  hearken therefore thou town of mansoul hearken to my word and thou shalt live  i am merciful mansoul and thou shalt find me so  shut me not out of thy gates  o mansoul neither is my commission nor inclination at all to do thee hurt  why fliest thou so fast from thy friend and stickest so close to thine enemy  indeed i would have thee because it becomes thee to be sorry for thy sin but do not despair of life this great force is not to hurt thee but to deliver thee from thy bondage and to reduce thee to thy obedience  my commission indeed is to make a war upon diabolus thy king and upon all diabolonians with him for he is the strong man armed that keeps the house and i will have him out  his spoils i must divide his armour i must take from him his hold i must cast him out of and must make it a habitation for myself  and this o mansoul shall diabolus know when he shall be made to follow me in chains and when mansoul shall rejoice to see it so   i could would i now put forth my might cause that forthwith he should leave you and depart but i have it in my heart so to deal with him as that the justice of the war that i shall make upon him may be seen and acknowledged by all  he hath taken mansoul by fraud and keeps it by violence and deceit and i will make him bare and naked in the eyes of all observers  all my words are true  i am mighty to save and will deliver my mansoul out of his hand  this speech was intended chiefly for mansoul but mansoul would not have the hearing of it  they shut up eargate they barricaded it up they kept it locked and bolted they set a guard thereat and commanded that no mansoulonian should go out to him nor that any from the camp should be admitted into the town  all this they did so horribly had diabolus enchanted them to do and seek to do for him against their rightful lord and prince wherefore no man nor voice nor sound of man that belonged to the glorious host was to come into the town  so when emmanuel saw that mansoul was thus involved in sin he calls his army together since now also his words were despised and gave out a commandment throughout all his host to be ready against the time appointed  now forasmuch as there was no way lawfully to take the town of mansoul but to get in by the gates and at eargate as the chief therefore he commanded his captains and commanders to bring their rams their slings and their men and place them at eyegate and eargate in order to his taking the town  when emmanuel had put all things in a readiness to give diabolus battle he sent again to know of the town of mansoul if in peaceable manner they would yield themselves or whether they were yet resolved to put him to try the utmost extremity  they then together with diabolus their king called a council of war and resolved upon certain propositions that should be offered to emmanuel if he will accept thereof so they agreed and then the next was who should be sent on this errand  now there was in the town of mansoul an old man a diabolonian and his name was mr lothtostoop a stiff man in his way and a great doer for diabolus him therefore they sent and put into his mouth what he should say  so he went and came to the camp to emmanuel and when he was come a time was appointed to give him audience  so at the time he came and after a diabolonian ceremony or two he thus began and said great sir that it may be known unto all men how goodnatured a prince my master is he has sent me to tell your lordship that he is very willing rather than go to war to deliver up into your hands one half of the town of mansoul  i am therefore to know if your mightiness will accept of this proposition  then said emmanuel the whole is mine by gift and purchase wherefore i will never lose one half  then said mr lothtostoop sir my master hath said that he will be content that you shall be the nominal and titular lord of all if he may possess but a part  then emmanuel answered the whole is mine really not in name and word only wherefore i will be the sole lord and possessor of all or of none at all of mansoul  then mr lothtostoop said again sir behold the condescension of my master  he says that he will be content if he may but have assigned to him some place in mansoul as a place to live privately in and you shall be lord of all the rest  then said the golden prince all that the father giveth me shall come to me and of all that he giveth me i will lose nothingno not a hoof nor a hair  i will not therefore grant him no not the least corner of mansoul to dwell in i will have all to myself  then lothtostoop said again but sir suppose that my lord should resign the whole town to you only with this proviso that he sometimes when he comes into this country may for old acquaintance sake be entertained as a wayfaring man for two days or ten days or a month or so  may not this small matter be granted  then said emmanuel no  he came as a wayfaring man to david nor did he stay long with him and yet it had like to have cost david his soul  i will not consent that he ever should have any harbour more there  then said mr lothtostoop sir you seem to be very hard suppose my master should yield to all that your lordship hath said provided that his friends and kindred in mansoul may have liberty to trade in the town and to enjoy their present dwellings  may not that be granted sir  then said emmanuel no that is contrary to my fathers will for all and all manner of diabolonians that now are or that at any time shall be found in mansoul shall not only lose their lands and liberties but also their lives  then said mr lothtostoop again but sir may not my master and great lord by letters by passengers by accidental opportunities and the like maintain if he shall deliver up all unto thee some kind of old friendship with mansoul  emmanuel answered no by no means forasmuch as any such fellowship friendship intimacy or acquaintance in what way sort or mode soever maintained will tend to the corrupting of mansoul the alienating of their affections from me and the endangering of their peace with my father  mr lothtostoop yet added further saying but great sir since my master hath many friends and those that are dear to him in mansoul may he not if he shall depart from them even of his bounty and goodnature bestow upon them as he sees fit some tokens of his love and kindness that he had for them to the end that mansoul when he is gone may look upon such tokens of kindness once received from their old friend and remember him who was once their king and the merry times that they sometimes enjoyed one with another while he and they lived in peace together  then said emmanuel no for if mansoul come to be mine i shall not admit of nor consent that there should be the least scrap shred or dust of diabolus left behind as tokens of gifts bestowed upon any in mansoul thereby to call to remembrance the horrible communion that was betwixt them and him  well sir said mr lothtostoop i have one thing more to propound and then i am got to the end of my commission  suppose that when my master is gone from mansoul any that shall yet live in the town should have such business of high concerns to do that if they be neglected the party shall be undone and suppose sir that nobody can help in that case so well as my master and lord may not now my master be sent for upon so urgent an occasion as this  or if he may not be admitted into the town may not he and the person concerned meet in some of the villages near mansoul and there lay their heads together and there consult of matters  this was the last of those ensnaring propositions that mr lothto stoop had to propound to emmanuel on behalf of his master diabolus but emmanuel would not grant it for he said there can be no case or thing or matter fall out in mansoul when thy master shall be gone that may not be solved by my father besides it will be a great disparagement to my fathers wisdom and skill to admit any from mansoul to go out to diabolus for advice when they are bid before in everything by prayer and supplication to let their requests be made known to my father  further this should it be granted would be to grant that a door should be set open for diabolus and the diabolonians in mansoul to hatch and plot and bring to pass treasonable designs to the grief of my father and me and to the utter destruction of mansoul  when mr lothtostoop had heard this answer he took his leave of emmanuel and departed saying that he would carry word to his master concerning this whole affair  so he departed and came to diabolus to mansoul and told him the whole of the matter and how emmanuel would not admit no not by any means that he when he was once gone out should for ever have anything more to do either in or with any that are of the town of mansoul  when mansoul and diabolus had heard this relation of things they with one consent concluded to use their best endeavour to keep emmanuel out of mansoul and sent old illpause of whom you have heard before to tell the prince and his captains so  so the old gentleman came up to the top of eargate and called to the camp for a hearing who when they gave audience he said i have in commandment from my high lord to bid you tell it to your prince emmanuel that mansoul and their king are resolved to stand and fall together and that it is in vain for your prince to think of ever having mansoul in his hand unless he can take it by force  so some went and told to emmanuel what old illpause a diabolonian in mansoul had said then said the prince i must try the power of my sword for i will not for all the rebellions and repulses that mansoul has made against me raise my siege and depart but will assuredly take my mansoul and deliver it from the hand of her enemy  and with that he gave out a commandment that captain boanerges captain conviction captain judgment and captain execution should forthwith march up to eargate with trumpets sounding colours flying and with shouting for the battle  also he would that captain credence should join himself with them  emmanuel moreover gave order that captain goodhope and captain charity should draw themselves up before eyegate  he bid also that the rest of his captains and their men should place themselves for the best of their advantage against the enemy round about the town and all was done as he had commanded  then he bid that the word should be given forth and the word was at that time emmanuel  then was an alarm sounded and the batteringrams were played and the slings did whirl stones into the town amain and thus the battle began  now diabolus himself did manage the townsmen in the war and that at every gate wherefore their resistance was the more forcible hellish and offensive to emmanuel  thus was the good prince engaged and entertained by diabolus and mansoul for several days together and a sight worth seeing it was to behold how the captains of shaddai behaved themselves in this war  and first for captain boanerges not to undervalue the rest he made three most fierce assaults one after another upon eargate to the shaking of the posts thereof  captain conviction he also made up as fast with boanerges as possibly he could and both discerning that the gate began to yield they commanded that the rams should still be played against it  now captain conviction going up very near to the gate was with great force driven back and received three wounds in the mouth  and those that rode reformades they went about to encourage the captains  for the valour of the two captains made mention of before the prince sent for them to his pavilion and commanded that a while they should rest themselves and that with somewhat they should be refreshed  care also was taken for captain conviction that he should be healed of his wounds  the prince also gave to each of them a chain of gold and bid them yet be of good courage  nor did captain goodhope nor captain charity come behind in this most desperate fight for they so well did behave themselves at eyegate that they had almost broken it quite open  these also had a reward from their prince as also had the rest of the captains because they did valiantly round about the town  in this engagement several of the officers of diabolus were slain and some of the townsmen wounded  for the officers there was one captain boasting slain  this boasting thought that nobody could have shaken the posts of eargate nor have shaken the heart of diabolus  next to him there was one captain secure slain  this secure used to say that the blind and lame in mansoul were able to keep the gates of the town against emmanuels army  this captain secure did captain conviction cleave down the head with a two handed sword when he received himself three wounds in his mouth  besides these there was one captain bragman a very desperate fellow and he was captain over a band of those that threw firebrands arrows and death  he also received by the hand of captain goodhope at eyegate a mortal wound in the breast  there was moreover one mr feeling but he was no captain but a great stickler to encourage mansoul to rebellion  he received a wound in the eye by the hand of one of boanerges soldiers and had by the captain himself been slain but that he made a sudden retreat  but i never saw willbewill so daunted in all my life he was not able to do as he was wont and some say that he also received a wound in the leg and that some of the men in the princes army have certainly seen him limp as he afterwards walked on the wall  i shall not give you a particular account of the names of the soldiers that were slain in the town for many were maimed and wounded and slain for when they saw that the posts of eargate did shake and eyegate was wellnigh broken quite open and also that their captains were slain this took away the hearts of many of the diabolonians they fell also by the force of the shot that were sent by the golden slings into the midst of the town of mansoul  of the townsmen there was one lovenogood he was a townsman but a diabolonian he also received his mortal wound in mansoul but he died not very soon  mr illpause also who was the man that came along with diabolus when at first he attempted the taking of mansoul he also received a grievous wound in the head some say that his brainpan was cracked  this i have taken notice of that he was never after this able to do that mischief to mansoul as he had done in times past also old prejudice and mr anything fled  now when the battle was over the prince commanded that yet once more the white flag should be set upon mount gracious in sight of the town of mansoul to show that yet emmanuel had grace for the wretched town of mansoul  when diabolus saw the white flag hung out again and knowing that it was not for him but mansoul he cast in his mind to play another prank to wit to see if emmanuel would raise his siege and begone upon promise of reformation  so he comes down to the gate one evening a good while after the sun was gone down and calls to speak with emmanuel who presently came down to the gate and diabolus saith unto him  forasmuch as thou makest it appear by thy white flag that thou art wholly given to peace and quiet i thought meet to acquaint thee that we are ready to accept thereof upon terms which thou mayest admit  i know that thou art given to devotion and that holiness pleaseth thee yea that thy great end in making a war upon mansoul is that it may be a holy habitation  well draw off thy forces from the town and i will bend mansoul to thy bow  first i will lay down all acts of hostility against thee and will be willing to become thy deputy and will as i have formerly been against thee now serve thee in the town of mansoul  and more particularly  1 i will persuade mansoul to receive thee for their lord and i know that they will do it the sooner when they shall understand that i am thy deputy  2 i will show them wherein they have erred and that transgression stands in the way to life  3 i will show them the holy law unto which they must conform even that which they have broken  4 i will press upon them the necessity of a reformation according to thy law  5 and moreover that none of these things may fail i myself at my own proper cost and charge will set up and maintain a sufficient ministry besides lectures in mansoul  6 thou shalt receive as a token of our subjection to thee year by year what thou shalt think fit to lay and levy upon us in token of our subjection to thee  then said emmanuel to him o full of deceit how movable are thy ways  how often hast thou changed and rechanged if so be thou mightest still keep possession of my mansoul though as has been plainly declared before i am the right heir thereof  often hast thou made thy proposals already nor is this last a whit better than they  and failing to deceive when thou showedst thyself in thy black thou hast now transformed thyself into an angel of light and wouldst to deceive be now as a minister of righteousness  but know thou o diabolus that nothing must be regarded that thou canst propound for nothing is done by thee but to deceive  thou neither hast conscience to god nor love to the town of mansoul whence then should these thy sayings arise but from sinful craft and deceit  he that can of list and will propound what he pleases and that wherewith he may destroy them that believe him is to be abandoned with all that he shall say  but if righteousness be such a beautyspot in thine eyes now how is it that wickedness was so closely stuck to by thee before  but this is bythebye  thou talkest now of a reformation in mansoul and that thou thyself if i will please wilt be at the head of that reformation all the while knowing that the greatest proficiency that man can make in the law and the righteousness thereof will amount to no more for the taking away of the curse from mansoul than just nothing at all for a law being broken by mansoul that had before upon a supposition of the breach thereof a curse pronounced against him for it of god can never by his obeying of the law deliver himself therefrom to say nothing of what a reformation is like to be set up in mansoul when the devil is become corrector of vice  thou knowest that all that thou hast now said in this matter is nothing but guile and deceit and is as it was the first so is it the last card that thou hast to play  many there be that do soon discern thee when thou showest them thy cloven foot but in thy white thy light and in thy transformation thou art seen but of a few  but thou shalt not do thus with my mansoul o diabolus for i do still love my mansoul  besides i am not come to put mansoul upon works to live thereby should i do so i should be like unto thee  but i am come that by me and by what i have and shall do for mansoul they may to my father be reconciled though by their sin they have provoked him to anger and though by the law they cannot obtain mercy  thou talkest of subjecting of this town to good when none desireth it at thy hands  i am sent by my father to possess it myself and to guide it by the skilfulness of my hands into such a conformity to him as shall be pleasing in his sight  i will therefore possess it myself i will dispossess and cast thee out i will set up mine own standard in the midst of them i will also govern them by new laws new officers new motives and new ways yea i will pull down this town and build it again and it shall be as though it had not been and it shall then be the glory of the whole universe  when diabolus heard this and perceived that he was discovered in all his deceits he was confounded and utterly put to a nonplus but having in himself the fountain of iniquity rage and malice against both shaddai and his son and the beloved town of mansoul what doth he but strengthen himself what he could to give fresh battle to the noble prince emmanuel  so then now we must have another fight before the town of mansoul is taken  come up then to the mountains you that love to see military actions and behold by both sides how the fatal blow is given while one seeks to hold and the other seeks to make himself master of the famous town of mansoul  diabolus therefore having withdrawn himself from the wall to his force that was in the heart of the town of mansoul emmanuel also returned to the camp and both of them after their divers ways put themselves into a posture fit to give battle one to another  diabolus as filled with despair of retaining in his hands the famous town of mansoul resolved to do what mischief he could if indeed he could do any to the army of the prince and to the famous town of mansoul for alas it was not the happiness of the silly town of mansoul that was designed by diabolus but the utter ruin and overthrow thereof as now is enough in view  wherefore he commands his officers that they should then when they see that they could hold the town no longer do it what harm and mischief they could rendering and tearing men women and children  for said he we had better quite demolish the place and leave it like a ruinous heap than so leave it that it may be an habitation for emmanuel  emmanuel again knowing that the next battle would issue in his being made master of the place gave out a royal commandment to all his officers high captains and men of war to be sure to show themselves men of war against diabolus and all diabolonians but favourable merciful and meek to the old inhabitants of mansoul bend therefore said the noble prince the hottest front of the battle against diabolus and his men  so the day being come the command was given and the princes men did bravely stand to their arms and did as before bend their main force against eargate and eyegate  the word was then mansoul is won so they made their assault upon the town diabolus also as fast as he could with the main of his power made resistance from within and his high lords and chief captains for a time fought very cruelly against the princes army  but after three or four notable charges by the prince and his noble captains eargate was broken open and the bars and bolts wherewith it was used to be fast shut up against the prince were broken into a thousand pieces  then did the princes trumpets sound the captains shout the town shake and diabolus retreat to his hold  well when the princes forces had broken open the gate himself came up and did set his throne in it also he set his standard thereby upon a mount that before by his men was cast up to place the mighty slings thereon  the mount was called mount hearwell  there therefore the prince abode to wit hard by the going in at the gate  he commanded also that the golden slings should yet be played upon the town especially against the castle because for shelter thither was diabolus retreated  now from ear gate the street was straight even to the house of mr recorder that so was before diabolus took the town and hard by his house stood the castle which diabolus for a long time had made his irksome den  the captains therefore did quickly clear that street by the use of their slings so that way was made up to the heart of the town  then did the prince command that captain boanerges captain conviction and captain judgment should forthwith march up the town to the old gentlemans gate  then did the captains in the most warlike manner enter into the town of mansoul and marching in with flying colours they came up to the recorders house and that was almost as strong as was the castle  batteringrams they took also with them to plant against the castle gates  when they were come to the house of mr conscience they knocked and demanded entrance  now the old gentleman not knowing as yet fully their design kept his gates shut all the time of this fight  wherefore boanerges demanded entrance at his gates and no man making answer he gave it one stroke with the head of a ram and this made the old gentleman shake and his house to tremble and totter  then came mr recorder down to the gates and as he could with quivering lips he asked who was there  boanerges answered we are the captains and commanders of the great shaddai and of the blessed emmanuel his son and we demand possession of your house for the use of our noble prince  and with that the batteringram gave the gate another shake  this made the old gentleman tremble the more yet durst he not but open the gate  then the kings forces marched in namely the three brave captains mentioned before  now the recorders house was a place of much convenience for emmanuel not only because it was near to the castle and strong but also because it was large and fronted the castle the den where now diabolus was for he was now afraid to come out of his hold  as for mr recorder the captains carried it very reservedly to him as yet he knew nothing of the great designs of emmanuel so that he did not know what judgment to make nor what would be the end of such thundering beginnings  it was also presently noised in the town how the recorders house was possessed his rooms taken up and his palace made the seat of the war and no sooner was it noised abroad but they took the alarm as warmly and gave it out to others of his friends and you know as a snowball loses nothing by rolling so in little time the whole town was possessed that they must expect nothing from the prince but destruction and the ground of the business was this the recorder was afraid the recorder trembled and the captains carried it strangely to the recorder so many came to see but when they with their own eyes did behold the captains in the palace and their batteringrams ever playing at the castle gates to beat them down they were riveted in their fears and it made them all in amaze  and as i said the man of the house would increase all this for whoever came to him or discoursed with him nothing would he talk of tell them or hear but that death and destruction now attended mansoul  for quoth the old gentleman you are all of you sensible that we all have been traitors to that once despised but now famously victorious and glorious prince emmanuel for he now as you see doth not only lie in close siege about us but hath forced his entrance in at our gates  moreover diabolus flees before him and he hath as you behold made of my house a garrison against the castle where he is  i for my part have transgressed greatly and he that is clean it is well for him  but i say i have transgressed greatly in keeping silence when i should have spoken and in perverting justice when i should have executed the same true i have suffered something at the hand of diabolus for taking part with the laws of king shaddai but that alas what will that do will that make compensation for the rebellions and treasons that i have done and have suffered without gainsaying to be committed in the town of mansoul oh i tremble to think what will be the end of this so dreadful and so ireful a beginning  now while these brave captains were thus busy in the house of the old recorder captain execution was as busy in other parts of the town in securing the back streets and the walls  he also hunted the lord willbewill sorely he suffered him not to rest in any corner he pursued him so hard that he drove his men from him and made him glad to thrust his head into a hole  also this mighty warrior did cut three of the lord willbewills officers down to the ground  one was old mr prejudice he that had his crown cracked in the mutiny  this man was made by lord willbewill keeper of the eargate and fell by the hand of captain execution  there was also one mr backwardtoallbutnaught and he also was one of lord willbewills officers and was the captain of the two guns that once were mounted on the top of eargate he also was cut down to the ground by the hands of captain execution  besides these two there was another a third and his name was captain treacherous a vile man this was but one that willbewill did put a great deal of confidence in but him also did this captain execution cut down to the ground with the rest  he also made a very great slaughter among my lord willbewills soldiers killing many that were stout and sturdy and wounding many that for diabolus were nimble and active  but all these were diabolonians there was not a man a native of mansoul hurt  other feats of war were also likewise performed by other of the captains as at eyegate where captain goodhope and captain charity had a charge was great execution done for the captain goodhope with his own hands slew one captain blindfold the keeper of that gate  this blindfold was captain of a thousand men and they were they that fought with mauls he also pursued his men slew many and wounded more and made the rest hide their heads in corners  there was also at that gate mr illpause of whom you have heard before  he was an old man and had a beard that reached down to his girdle  the same was he that was orator to diabolus  he did much mischief in the town of mansoul and fell by the hand of captain goodhope  what shall i say  the diabolonians in these days lay dead in every corner though too many yet were alive in mansoul  now the old recorder and my lord understanding with some others of the chief of the town to wit such as knew they must stand and fall with the famous town of mansoul came together upon a day and after consultation had did jointly agree to draw up a petition and to send it to emmanuel now while he sat in the gate of mansoul  so they drew up their petition to emmanuel the contents whereof were these  that they the old inhabitants of the now deplorable town of mansoul confessed their sin and were sorry that they had offended his princely majesty and prayed that he would spare their lives  unto this petition he gave no answer at all and that did trouble them yet so much the more  now all this while the captains that were in the recorders house were playing with the batteringrams at the gates of the castle to beat them down  so after some time labour and travail the gate of the castle that was called impregnable was beaten open and broken into several splinters and so a way made to go up to the hold in which diabolus had hid himself  then were tidings sent down to eargate for emmanuel still abode there to let him know that a way was made in at the gates of the castle of mansoul  but oh how the trumpets at the tidings sounded throughout the princes camp for that now the war was so near an end and mansoul itself of being set free  then the prince arose from the place where he was and took with him such of his men of war as were fittest for that expedition and marched up the street of mansoul to the old recorders house  now the prince himself was clad all in armour of gold and so he marched up the town with his standard borne before him but he kept his countenance much reserved all the way as he went so that the people could not tell how to gather to themselves love or hatred by his looks  now as he marched up the street the townsfolk came out at every door to see and could not but be taken with his person and the glory thereof but wondered at the reservedness of his countenance for as yet he spake more to them by his actions and works than he did by words or smiles  but also poor mansoul as in such cases all are apt to do they interpreted the carriage of emmanuel to them as did josephs brethren his to them even all the quite contrary way  for thought they if emmanuel loved us he would show it to us by word of carriage but none of these he doth therefore emmanuel hates us  now if emmanuel hates us then mansoul shall be slain then mansoul shall become a dunghill they knew that they had transgressed his fathers law and that against him they had been in with diabolus his enemy  they also knew that the prince emmanuel knew all this for they were convinced that he was an angel of god to know all things that are done in the earth and this made them think that their condition was miserable and that the good prince would make them desolate  and thought they what time so fit to do this in as now when he has the bridle of mansoul in his hand  and this i took special notice of that the inhabitants notwithstanding all this could notno they could not when they see him march through the town but cringe bow bend and were ready to lick the dust of his feet they also wished a thousand times over that he would become their prince and captain and would become their protection  they would also one to another talk of the comeliness of his person and how much for glory and valour he outstripped the great ones of the world  but poor hearts as to themselves their thoughts would chance and go upon all manner of extremes  yea through the working of them backward and forward mansoul became as a ball tossed and as a rolling thing before the whirlwind  now when he was come to the castle gates he commanded diabolus to appear and to surrender himself into his hands  but oh how loath was the beast to appear how he stuck at it how he shrank how he cringed yet out he came to the prince  then emmanuel commanded and they took diabolus and bound him fast in chains the better to reserve him to the judgment that he had appointed for him  but diabolus stood up to entreat for himself that emmanuel would not send him into the deep but suffer him to depart out of mansoul in peace  when emmanuel had taken him and bound him in chains he led him into the marketplace and there before mansoul stripped him of his armour in which he boasted so much before  this now was one of the acts of triumph of emmanuel over his enemy and all the while that the giant was stripping the trumpets of the golden prince did sound amain the captains also shouted and the soldiers did sing for joy  then was mansoul called upon to behold the beginning of emmanuels triumph over him in whom they so much had trusted and of whom they so much had boasted in the days when he flattered them  thus having made diabolus naked in the eyes of mansoul and before the commanders of the prince in the next place he commands that diabolus should be bound with chains to his chariot wheels  then leaving some of his forces to wit captain boanerges and captain conviction as a guard for the castlegates that resistance might be made on his behalf if any that heretofore followed diabolus should make an attempt to possess it he did ride in triumph over him quite through the town of mansoul and so out at and before the gate called eyegate to the plain where his camp did lie  but you cannot think unless you had been there as i was what a shout there was in emmanuels camp when they saw the tyrant bound by the hand of their noble prince and tied to his chariot wheels  and they said he hath led captivity captive he hath spoiled principalities and powers  diabolus is subjected to the power of his sword and made the object of all derision  those also that rode reformades and that came down to see the battle they shouted with that greatness of voice and sung with such melodious notes that they caused them that dwell in the highest orbs to open their windows put out their heads and look to see the cause of that glory  the townsmen also so many of them as saw this sight were as it were while they looked betwixt the earth and the heavens  true they could not tell what would be the issue of things as to them but all things were done in such excellent methods and i cannot tell how but things in the management of them seemed to cast a smile towards the town so that their eyes their heads their hearts and their minds and all that they had were taken and held while they observed emmanuels order  so when the brave prince had finished this part of his triumph over diabolus his foe he turned him up in the midst of his contempt and shame having given him a charge no more to be a possessor of mansoul  then went he from emmanuel and out of the midst of his camp to inherit the parched places in a salt land seeking rest but finding none  now captain boanerges and captain conviction were both of them men of very great majesty their faces were like the faces of lions and their words like the roaring of the sea and they still quartered in mr consciences house of whom mention was made before  when therefore the high and mighty prince had thus far finished his triumph over diabolus the townsmen had more leisure to view and to behold the actions of these noble captains  but the captains carried it with that terror and dread in all that they did and you may be sure that they had private instructions so to do that they kept the town under continual heartaching and caused in their apprehension the wellbeing of mansoul for the future to hang in doubt before them so that for some considerable time they neither knew what rest or ease or peace or hope meant  nor did the prince himself as yet abide in the town of mansoul but in his royal pavilion in the camp and in the midst of his fathers forces  so at a time convenient he sent special orders to captain boanerges to summons mansoul the whole of the townsmen into the castleyard and then and there before their faces to take my lord understanding mr conscience and that notable one the lord willbewill and put them all three in ward and that they should set a strong guard upon them there until his pleasure concerning them was further known  the which orders when the captains had put them in execution made no small addition to the fears of the town of mansoul for now to their thinking were their former fears of the ruin of mansoul confirmed  now what death they should die and how long they should be in dying was that which most perplexed their heads and hearts yea they were afraid that emmanuel would command them all into the deep the place that the prince diabolus was afraid of for they knew that they had deserved it  also to die by the sword in the face of the town and in the open way of disgrace from the hand of so good and so holy a prince that too troubled them sore  the town was also greatly troubled for the men that were committed to ward for that they were their stay and their guide and for that they believed that if those men were cut off their execution would be but the beginning of the ruin of the town of mansoul  wherefore what do they but together with the men in prison draw up a petition to the prince and sent it to emmanuel by the hand of mr wouldlive so he went and came to the princes quarters and presented the petition the sum of which was this  great and wonderful potentate victor over diabolus and conqueror of the town of mansoul we the miserable inhabitants of that most woful corporation do humbly beg that we may find favour in thy sight and remember not against us former transgressions nor yet the sins of the chief of our town  but spare us according to the greatness of thy mercy and let us not die but live in thy sight so shall we be willing to be thy servants and if thou shalt think fit to gather our meat under thy table  amen  so the petitioner went as was said with his petition to the prince and the prince took it at his hand but sent him away with silence  this still afflicted the town of mansoul but yet considering that now they must either petition or die for now they could not do anything else therefore they consulted again and sent another petition and this petition was much after the form and method of the former  but when the petition was drawn up by whom should they send it was the next question for they would not send this by him by whom they sent the first for they thought that the prince had taken some offence at the manner of his deportment before him  so they attempted to make captain conviction their messenger with it but he said that he neither durst nor would petition emmanuel for traitors nor be to the prince an advocate for rebels  yet withal said he our prince is good and you may adventure to send it by the hand of one of your town provided he went with a rope about his head and pleaded nothing but mercy  well they made through fear their delays as long as they could and longer than delays were good but fearing at last the dangerousness of them they thought but with many a fainting in their minds to send their petition by mr desiresawake so they sent for mr desiresawake  now he dwelt in a very mean cottage in mansoul and he came at his neighbours request  so they told him what they had done and what they would do concerning petitioning and that they did desire of him that he would go therewith to the prince  then said mr desiresawake why should not i do the best i can to save so famous a town as mansoul from deserved destruction  they therefore delivered the petition to him and told him how he must address himself to the prince and wished him ten thousand good speeds  so he comes to the princes pavilion as the first and asked to speak with his majesty  so word was carried to emmanuel and the prince came out to the man  when mr desiresawake saw the prince he fell flat with his face to the ground and cried out oh that mansoul might live before thee and with that he presented the petition the which when the prince had read he turned away for a while and wept but refraining himself he turned again to the man who all this while lay crying at his feet as at the first and said to him go thy way to thy place and i will consider of thy requests  now you may think that they of mansoul that had sent him what with guilt and what with fear lest their petition should be rejected could not but look with many a long look and that too with strange workings of heart to see what would become of their petition  at last they saw their messenger coming back  so when he was come they asked him how he fared what emmanuel said and what was become of the petition  but he told them that he would be silent till he came to the prison to my lord mayor my lord willbewill and mr recorder  so he went forwards towards the prisonhouse where the men of mansoul lay bound  but oh what a multitude flocked after to hear what the messenger said  so when he was come and had shown himself at the gate of the prison my lord mayor himself looked as white as a clout the recorder also did quake  but they asked and said come good sir what did the great prince say to you  then said mr desiresawake when i came to my lords pavilion i called and he came forth  so i fell prostrate at his feet and delivered to him my petition for the greatness of his person and the glory of his countenance would not suffer me to stand upon my legs  now as he received the petition i cried oh that mansoul might live before thee  so when for a while he had looked thereon he turned him about and said to his servant go thy way to thy place again and i will consider of thy requests  the messenger added moreover and said the prince to whom you sent me is such a one for beauty and glory that whoso sees him must both love and fear him  i for my part can do no less but i know not what will be the end of these things  at this answer they were all at a stand both they in prison and they that followed the messenger thither to hear the news nor knew they what or what manner of interpretation to put upon what the prince had said  now when the prison was cleared of the throng the prisoners among themselves began to comment upon emmanuels words  my lord mayor said that the answer did not look with a rugged face but willbewill said that it betokened evil and the recorder that it was a messenger of death  now they that were left and that stood behind and so could not so well hear what the prisoners said some of them catched hold of one piece of a sentence and some on a bit of another some took hold of what the messenger said and some of the prisoners judgment thereon so none had the right understanding of things  but you cannot imagine what work these people made and what a confusion there was in mansoul now  for presently they that had heard what was said flew about the town one crying one thing and another the quite contrary and both were sure enough they told true for they did hear they said with their ears what was said and therefore could not be deceived one would say we must all be killed another would say we must all be saved and a third would say that the prince would not be concerned with mansoul and a fourth that the prisoners must be suddenly put to death  and as i said every one stood to it that he told his tale the rightest and that all others but he were out wherefore mansoul had now molestation upon molestation nor could any man know on what to rest the sole of his foot for one would go by now and as he went if he heard his neighbour tell his tale to be sure he would tell the quite contrary and both would stand in it that he told the truth  nay some of them had got this story by the end that the prince did intend to put mansoul to the sword and now it began to be dark wherefore poor mansoul was in sad perplexity all that night until the morning  but so far as i could gather by the best information that i could get all this hubbub came through the words that the recorder said when he told them that in his judgment the princes answer was a messenger of death  it was this that fired the town and that began the fright in mansoul for mansoul in former times did use to count that mr recorder was a seer and that his sentence was equal to the best of orators and thus was mansoul a terror to itself  and now did they begin to feel what were the effects of stubborn rebellion and unlawful resistance against their prince  i say they now began to feel the effects thereof by guilt and fear that now had swallowed them up and who more involved in the one but they that were most in the other to wit the chief of the town of mansoul  to be brief  when the fame of the fright was out of the town and the prisoners had a little recovered themselves they take to themselves some heart and think to petition the prince for life again  so they did draw up a third petition the contents whereof were these  prince emmanuel the great lord of all worlds and master of mercy we thy poor wretched miserable dying town of mansoul do confess unto thy great and glorious majesty that we have sinned against thy father and thee and are no more worthy to be called thy mansoul but rather to be cast into the pit  if thou wilt slay us we have deserved it  if thou wilt condemn us to the deep we cannot but say thou art righteous  we cannot complain whatever thou dost or however thou carriest it towards us  but oh let mercy reign and let it be extended to us  oh let mercy take hold upon us and free us from our transgressions and we will sing of thy mercy and of thy judgment  amen  this petition when drawn up was designed to be sent to the prince as the first  but who should carry itthat was the question some said let him do it that went with the first but others thought not good to do that and that because he sped no better now there was an old man in the town and his name was mr good deed a man that bare only the name but had nothing of the nature of the thing  now some were for sending him but the recorder was by no means for that  for said he we now stand in need of and are pleading for mercy  wherefore to send our petition by a man of this name will seem to cross the petition itself  should we make mr gooddeed our messenger when our petition cries for mercy  besides quoth the old gentleman should the prince now as he receives the petition ask him and say what is thy name as nobody knows but he will and he should say old gooddeed what think you would emmanuel say but this  ay is old gooddeed yet alive in mansoul then let old gooddeed save you from your distresses  and if he says so i am sure we are lost nor can a thousand of old gooddeeds save mansoul  after the recorder had given in his reasons why old gooddeed should not go with this petition to emmanuel the rest of the prisoners and chief of mansoul opposed it also and so old good deed was laid aside and they agreed to send mr desiresawake again  so they sent for him and desired him that he would a second time go with their petition to the prince and he readily told them he would  but they bid him that in anywise he should take heed that in no word or carriage he gave offence to the prince for by doing so for ought we can tell you may bring mansoul into utter destruction said they  now mr desiresawake when he saw that he must go on this errand besought that they would grant that mr weteyes might go with him now this mr weteyes was a near neighbour of mr desires a poor man a man of a broken spirit yet one that could speak well to a petition so they granted that he should go with him  wherefore they address themselves to their business  mr desires put a rope upon his head and mr weteyes went with his hands wringing together  thus they went to the princes pavilion  now when they went to petition this third time they were not without thoughts that by often coming they might be a burden to the prince  wherefore when they were come to the door of his pavilion they first made their apology for themselves and for their coming to trouble emmanuel so often and they said that they came not hither today for that they delighted in being troublesome or for that they delighted to hear themselves talk but for that necessity caused them to come to his majesty  they could they said have no rest day nor night because of their transgressions against shaddai and against emmanuel his son  they also thought that some misbehaviour of mr desiresawake the last time might give distaste to his highness and so cause that he returned from so merciful a prince empty and without countenance so when they had made this apology mr desiresawake cast himself prostrate upon the ground as at the first at the feet of the mighty prince saying oh that mansoul might live before thee and so he delivered his petition  the prince then having read the petition turned aside awhile as before and coming again to the place where the petitioner lay on the ground he demanded what his name was and of what esteem in the account of mansoul for that he above all the multitude in mansoul should be sent to him upon such an errand  then said the man to the prince oh let not my lord be angry and why inquirest thou after the name of such a dead doas i am  pass by i pray thee and take not notice of who i am because there is as thou very well knowest so great a disproportion between me and thee  why the townsmen chose to send me on this errand to my lord is best known to themselves but it could not be for that they thought that i had favour with my lord for my part i am out of charity with myself who then should be in love with me  yet live i would and so would i that my townsmen should and because both they and myself are guilty of great transgressions therefore they have sent me and i am come in their names to beg of my lord for mercy  let it please thee therefore to incline to mercy but ask not what thy servants are  then said the prince and what is he that is become thy companion in this so weighty a matter  so mr desires told emmanuel that he was a poor neighbour of his and one of his most intimate associates  and his name said he may it please your most excellent majesty is weteyes of the town of mansoul i know that there are many of that name that are naught but i hope it will be no offence to my lord that i have brought my poor neighbour with me  then mr weteyes fell on his face to the ground and made this apology for his coming with his neighbour to his lord  o my lord quoth he what i am i know not myself nor whether my name be feigned or true especially when i begin to think what some have said namely that this name was given me because mr repentance was my father  good men have bad children and the sincere do oftentimes beget hypocrites  my mother also called me by this name from the cradle but whether because of the moistness of my brain or because of the softness of my heart i cannot tell i see dirt in mine own tears and filthiness in the bottom of my prayers  but i pray thee and all this while the gentleman wept that thou wouldest not remember against us our transgressions nor take offence at the unqualifiedness of thy servants but mercifully pass by the sin of mansoul and refrain from the glorifying of thy grace no longer  so at his bidding they arose and both stood trembling before him and he spake to them to this purpose  the town of mansoul hath grievously rebelled against my father in that they have rejected him from being their king and did choose to themselves for their captain a liar a murderer and a runagate slave  for this diabolus your pretended prince though once so highly accounted of by you made rebellion against my father and me even in our palace and highest court there thinking to become a prince and king  but being there timely discovered and apprehended and for his wickedness bound in chains and separated to the pit with those that were his companions he offered himself to you and you have received him  now this is and for a long time hath been a high affront to my father wherefore my father sent to you a powerful army to reduce you to your obedience  but you know how these men their captains and their counsels were esteemed of you and what they received at your hand  you rebelled against them you shut your gates upon them you bid them battle you fought them and fought for diabolus against them  so they sent to my father for more power and i with my men are come to subdue you  but as you treated the servants so you treated their lord  you stood up in hostile manner against me you shut up your gates against me you turned the deaf ear to me and resisted as long as you could but now i have made a conquest of you  did you cry me mercy so long as you had hopes that you might prevail against me  but now i have taken the town you cry but why did you not cry before when the white flag of my mercy the red flag of justice and the black flag that threatened execution were set up to cite you to it  now i have conquered your diabolus you come to me for favour but why did you not help me against the mighty  yet i will consider your petition and will answer it so as will be for my glory  go bid captain boanerges and captain conviction bring the prisoners out to me into the camp tomorrow and say you to captain judgment and captain execution stay you in the castle and take good heed to yourselves that you keep all quiet in mansoul until you shall hear further from me  and with that he turned himself from them and went into his royal pavilion again  so the petitioners having received this answer from the prince returned as at the first to go to their companions again  but they had not gone far but thoughts began to work in their minds that no mercy as yet was intended by the prince to mansoul  so they went to the place where the prisoners lay bound but these workings of mind about what would become of mansoul had such strong power over them that by that they were come unto them that sent them they were scarce able to deliver their message  but they came at length to the gates of the town now the townsmen with earnestness were waiting for their return where many met them to know what answer was made to the petition  then they cried out to those that were sent what news from the prince and what hath emmanuel said  but they said that they must as afore go up to the prison and there deliver their message  so away they went to the prison with a multitude at their heels  now when they were come to the gates of the prison they told the first part of emmanuels speech to the prisoners to wit how he reflected upon their disloyalty to his father and himself and how they had chosen and closed with diabolus had fought for him hearkened to him and been ruled by him but had despised him and his men  this made the prisoners look pale but the messengers proceeded and said he the prince said moreover that yet he would consider your petition and give such answer thereto as would stand with his glory  and as these words were spoken mr weteyes gave a great sigh  at this they were all of them struck into their dumps and could not tell what to say  fear also possessed them in a marvellous manner and death seemed to sit upon some of their eyebrows  now there was in the company a notable sharpwitted fellow a mean man of estate and his name was old inquisitive this man asked the petitioners if they had told out every whit of what emmanuel said and they answered verily no  then said inquisitive i thought so indeed  pray what was it more that he said unto you  then they paused awhile but at last they brought out all saying the prince bade us bid captain boanerges and captain conviction bring the prisoners down to him tomorrow and that captain judgment and captain execution should take charge of the castle and town till they should hear further from him  they said also that when the prince had commanded them thus to do he immediately turned his back upon them and went into his royal pavilion  but oh how this return and specially this last clause of it that the prisoners must go out to the prince into the camp brake all their loins in pieces  wherefore with one voice they set up a cry that reached up to the heavens  this done each of the three prepared himself to die and the recorder said unto them this was the thing that i feared for they concluded that tomorrow by that the sun went down they should be tumbled out of the world the whole town also counted of no other but that in their time and order they must all drink of the same cup  wherefore the town of mansoul spent that night in mourning and sackcloth and ashes the prisoners also when the time was come for them to go down before the prince dressed themselves in mourning attire with ropes upon their heads  the whole town of mansoul also showed themselves upon the wall all clad in mourning weeds if perhaps the prince with the sight thereof might be moved with compassion but oh how the busybodies that were in the town of mansoul did now concern themselves  they did run here and there through the streets of the town by companies crying out as they ran in tumultuous wise one after one manner and another the quite contrary to the almost utter distraction of mansoul  well the time is come that the prisoners must go down to the camp and appear before the prince  and thus was the manner of their going down  captain boanerges went with a guard before them and captain conviction came behind and the prisoners went down bound in chains in the midst  so i say the prisoners went in the midst and the guard went with flying colours behind and before but the prisoners went with drooping spirits  or more particularly thus  the prisoners went down all in mourning  they put ropes upon themselves they went on smiting themselves on the breasts but durst not lift up their eyes to heaven  thus they went out at the gate of mansoul till they came into the midst of the princes army the sight and glory of which did greatly heighten their affliction  nor could they now longer forbear but cry out aloud o unhappy men  o wretched men of mansoul  their chains still mixing their dolorous notes with the cries of the prisoners made the noise more lamentable  so when they were come to the door of the princes pavilion they cast themselves prostrate upon the place then one went in and told his lord that the prisoners were come down  the prince then ascended a throne of state and sent for the prisoners in who when they came did tremble before him also they covered their faces with shame  now as they drew near to the place where he sat they threw themselves down before him  then said the prince to the captain boanerges bid the prisoners stand upon their feet  then they stood trembling before him and he said are you the men that heretofore were the servants of shaddai  and they said yes lord yes  then said the prince again are you the men that did suffer yourselves to be corrupted and defiled by that abominable one diabolus  and they said we did more than suffer it lord for we chose it of our own mind  the prince asked further saying could you have been content that your slavery should have continued under his tyranny as long as you had lived then said the prisoners yes lord yes for his ways were pleasing to our flesh and we were grown aliens to a better stateand did you said he when i came up against this town of mansoul heartily wish that i might not have the victory over youyes lord yes said they  then said the prince and what punishment is it think you that you deserve at my hand for these and other your high and mighty sinsand they said both death and the deep lord for we have deserved no less  he asked again if they had aught to say for themselves why the sentence that they confessed that they had deserved should not be passed upon them  and they said we can say nothing lord  thou art just for we have sinned  then said the prince and for what are those ropes on your heads  the prisoners answered these ropes are to bind us withal to the place of execution if mercy be not pleasing in thy sight  so he further asked if all the men in the town of mansoul were in this confession as they  and they answered all the natives lord but for the diabolonians that came into our town when the tyrant got possession of us we can say nothing for them  then the prince commanded that a herald should be called and that he should in the midst and throughout the camp of emmanuel proclaim and that with sound of trumpet that the prince the son of shaddai had in his fathers name and for his fathers glory gotten a perfect conquest and victory over mansoul and that the prisoners should follow him and say amen  so this was done as he had commanded  and presently the music that was in the upper region sounded melodiously the captains that were in the camp shouted and the soldiers did sing songs of triumph to the prince the colours waved in the wind and great joy was everywhere only it was wanting as yet in the hearts of the men of mansoul  then the prince called for the prisoners to come and to stand again before him and they came and stood trembling  and he said unto them the sins trespasses iniquities that you with the whole town of mansoul have from time to time committed against my father and me i have power and commandment from my father to forgive to the town of mansoul and do forgive you accordingly  and having so said he gave them written in parchment and sealed with seven seals a large and general pardon commanding my lord mayor my lord willbewill and mr recorder to proclaim and cause it to be proclaimed tomorrow by that the sun is up throughout the whole town of mansoul  moreover the prince stripped the prisoners of their mourning weeds and gave them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness  then he gave to each of the three jewels of gold and precious stones and took away their ropes and put chains of gold about their necks and earrings in their ears  now the prisoners when they did hear the gracious words of prince emmanuel and had beheld all that was done unto them fainted almost quite away for the grace the benefit the pardon was sudden glorious and so big that they were not able without staggering to stand up under it yea my lord willbewill swooned outright but the prince stepped to him put his everlasting arms under him embraced him kissed him and bid him be of good cheer for all should be performed according to his word  he also did kiss and embrace and smile upon the other two that were willbewills companions saying take these as further tokens of my love favour and compassions to you and i charge you that you mr recorder tell in the town of mansoul what you have heard and seen  then were their fetters broken to pieces before their faces and cast into the air and their steps were enlarged under them  then they fell down at the feet of the prince and kissed his feet and wetted them with tears  also they cried out with a mighty strong voice saying blessed be the glory of the lord from this place so they were bid rise up and go to the town and tell to mansoul what the prince had done  he commanded also that one with a pipe and tabor should go and play before them all the way into the town of mansoul  then was fulfilled what they never looked for and they were made to possess that which they never dreamed of  the prince also called for the noble captain credence and commanded that he and some of his officers should march before the noble men of mansoul with flying colours into the town  he gave also unto captain credence a charge that about that time that the recorder did read the general pardon in the town of mansoul that at that very time he should with flying colours march in at eye gate with his ten thousands at his feet and that he should so go until he came by the high street of the town up to the castle gates and that himself should take possession thereof against his lord came thither  he commanded moreover that he should bid captain judgment and captain execution to leave the stronghold to him and to withdraw from mansoul and to return into the camp with speed unto the prince  and now was the town of mansoul also delivered from the terror of the first four captains and their men  well i told you before how the prisoners were entertained by the noble prince emmanuel and how they behaved themselves before him and how he sent them away to their home with pipe and tabor going before them  and now you must think that those of the town that had all this while waited to hear of their death could not but be exercised with sadness of mind and with thoughts that pricked like thorns  nor could their thoughts be kept to any one point the wind blew with them all this while at great uncertainties yea their hearts were like a balance that had been disquieted with a shaking hand  but at last as they with many a long look looked over the wall of mansoul they thought that they saw some returning to the town and thought again who should they be too  who should they be  at last they discerned that they were the prisoners  but can you imagine how their hearts were surprised with wonder specially when they perceived also in what equipage and with what honour they were sent home  they went down to the camp in black but they came back to the town in white they went down to the camp in ropes they came back in chains of gold they went down to the camp with their feet in fetters but came back with their steps enlarged under them they went also to the camp looking for death but they came back from thence with assurance of life they went down to the camp with heavy hearts but came back again with pipe and tabor playing before them  so as soon as they were come to eyegate the poor and tottering town of mansoul adventured to give a shout and they gave such a shout as made the captains in the princes army leap at the sound thereof  alas for them poor hearts who could blame them since their dead friends were come to life again for it was to them as life from the dead to see the ancients of the town of mansoul shine in such splendour they looked for nothing but the axe and the block but behold joy and gladness comfort and consolation and such melodious notes attending them that was sufficient to make a sick man well  so when they came up they saluted each other with welcome welcome and blessed be he that has spared you  they added also we see it is well with you but how must it go with the town of mansoul  and will it go well with the town of mansoul said they then answered them the recorder and my lord mayor oh tidings glad tidings good tidings of good and of great joy to poor mansoul  then they gave another shout that made the earth to ring again  after this they inquired yet more particularly how things went in the camp and what message they had from emmanuel to the town  so they told them all passages that had happened to them at the camp and everything that the prince did to them  this made mansoul wonder at the wisdom and grace of the prince emmanuel then they told them what they had received at his hands for the whole town of mansoul and the recorder delivered it in these words   pardon pardon pardon for mansoul and this shall mansoul know tomorrow  then he commanded and they went and summoned mansoul to meet together in the marketplace tomorrow then to hear their general pardon read  but who can think what a turn what a change what an alteration this hint of things did make in the countenance of the town of mansoul  no man of mansoul could sleep that night for joy in every house there was joy and music singing and making merry telling and hearing of mansouls happiness was then all that mansoul had to do and this was the burden of all their song  oh more of this at the rising of the sun more of this tomorrow who thought yesterday would one say that this day would have been such a day to us  and who thought that saw our prisoners go down in irons that they would have returned in chains of gold yea they that judged themselves as they went to be judged of their judge were by his mouth acquitted not for that they were innocent but of the princes mercy and sent home with pipe and tabor  but is this the common custom of princes do they use to show such kind of favours to traitors  no this is only peculiar to shaddai and unto emmanuel his son  now morning drew on apace wherefore the lord mayor the lord willbewill and mr recorder came down to the marketplace at the time that the prince had appointed where the townsfolk were waiting for them  and when they came they came in that attire and in that glory that the prince had put them into the day before and the street was lightened with their glory  so the mayor recorder and my lord willbewill drew down to mouthgate which was at the lower end of the marketplace because that of old time was the place where they used to read public matters  thither therefore they came in their robes and their tabrets went before them  now the eagerness of the people to know the full of the matter was great  then the recorder stood up upon his feet and first beckoning with his hand for silence he read out with a loud voice the pardon but when he came to these words  the lord the lord god merciful and gracious pardoning iniquity transgressions and sins and to them all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven etc they could not forbear leaping for joy  for this you must know that there was conjoined herewith every mans name in mansoul also the seals of the pardon made a brave show  when the recorder had made an end of reading the pardon the townsmen ran up upon the walls of the town and leaped and skipped thereon for joy and bowed themselves seven times with their faces toward emmanuels pavilion and shouted out aloud for joy and said let emmanuel live for ever  then order was given to the young men in mansoul that they should ring the bells for joy  so the bells did ring and the people sing and the music go in every house in mansoul  when the prince had sent home the three prisoners of mansoul with joy and pipe and tabor he commanded his captains with all the field officers and soldiers throughout his army to be ready in that morning that the recorder should read the pardon in mansoul to do his further pleasure  so the morning as i have showed being come just as the recorder had made an end of reading the pardon emmanuel commanded that all the trumpets in the camp should sound that the colours should be displayed half of them upon mount gracious and half of them upon mount justice  he commanded also that all the captains should show themselves in all their harness and that the soldiers should shout for joy  nor was captain credence though in the castle silent in such a day but he from the top of the hold showed himself with sound of trumpet to mansoul and to the princes camp  thus have i showed you the manner and way that emmanuel took to recover the town of mansoul from under the hand and power of the tyrant diabolus  now when the prince had completed these the outward ceremonies of his joy he again commanded that his captains and soldiers should show unto mansoul some feats of war  so they presently addressed themselves to this work  but oh with what agility nimbleness dexterity and bravery did these military men discover their skill in feats of war to the now gazing town of mansoul  they marched they countermarched they opened to the right and left they divided and subdivided they closed they wheeled made good their front and rear with their right and left wings and twenty things more with that aptness and then were all as the were again that they tookyea ravished the hearts that were in mansoul to behold it  but add to this the handling of their arms the managing of their weapons of war were marvellously taking to mansoul and me  when this action was over the whole town of mansoul came out as one man to the prince in the camp to thank him and praise him for his abundant favour and to beg that it would please his grace to come unto mansoul with his men and there to take up their quarters for ever  and this they did in most humble manner bowing themselves seven times to the ground before him  then said he all peace be to you so the town came nigh and touched with the hand the top of his golden sceptre and they said oh that the prince emmanuel with his captains and men of war would dwell in mansoul for ever and that his batteringrams and slings might be lodged in her for the use and service of the prince and for the help and strength of mansoul  for said they we have room for thee we have room for thy men we have also room for thy weapons of war and a place to make a magazine for thy carriages  do it emmanuel and thou shalt be king and captain in mansoul for ever yea govern thou also according to all the desire of thy soul and make thou governors and princes under thee of thy captains and men of war and we will become thy servants and thy laws shall be our direction  they added moreover and prayed his majesty to consider thereof for said they if now after all this grace bestowed upon us thy miserable town of mansoul thou shouldest withdraw thou and thy captains from us the town of mansoul will die  yea said they our blessed emmanuel if thou shouldest depart from us now now thou hast done so much good for us and showed so much mercy unto us what will follow but that our joy will be as if it had not been and our enemies will a second time come upon us with more rage than at the first  wherefore we beseech thee o thou the desire of our eyes and the strength and life of our poor town accept of this motion that now we have made unto our lord and come and dwell in the midst of us and let us be thy people  besides lord we do not know but that to this day many diabolonians may be yet lurking in the town of mansoul and they will betray us when thou shalt leave us into the hand of diabolus again and who knows what designs plots or contrivances have passed betwixt them about these things already  loath we are to fall again into his horrible hands  wherefore let it please thee to accept of our palace for thy place of residence and of the houses of the best men in our town for the reception of thy soldiers and their furniture  then said the prince if i come to your town will you suffer me further to prosecute that which is in mine heart against mine enemies and yoursyea will you help me in such undertakings  they answered we know not what we shall do we did not think once that we should have been such traitors to shaddai as we have proved to be  what then shall we say to our lord  let him put no trust in his saints let the prince dwell in our castle and make of our town a garrison let him set his noble captains and his warlike soldiers over us yea let him conquer us with his love and overcome us with his grace and then surely shall he be but with us and help us as he was and did that morning that our pardon was read unto us  we shall comply with this our lord and with his ways and fall in with his word against the mighty  one word more and thy servants have done and in this will trouble our lord no more  we know not the depth of the wisdom of thee our prince  who could have thought that had been ruled by his reason that so much sweet as we do now enjoy should have come out of those bitter trials wherewith we were tried at the first but lord let light go before and let love come after  yea take us by the hand and lead us by thy counsels and let this always abide upon us that all things shall be the best for thy servants and come to our mansoul and do as it pleaseth thee  or lord come to our mansoul do what thou wilt so thou keepest us from sinning and makest us serviceable to thy majesty  then said the prince to the town of mansoul again go return to your houses in peace  i will willingly in this comply with your desires i will remove my royal pavilion i will draw up my forces before eyegate tomorrow and so will march forwards into the town of mansoul  i will possess myself of your castle of mansoul and will set my soldiers over you  yea i will yet do things in mansoul that cannot be paralleled in any nation country or kingdom under heaven  then did the men of mansoul give a shout and returned unto their houses in peace they also told to their kindred and friends the good that emmanuel had promised to mansoul and tomorrow said they he will march into our town and take up his dwelling he and his men in mansoul  then went out the inhabitants of the town of mansoul with haste to the green trees and to the meadows to gather boughs and flowers therewith to strew the streets against their prince the son of shaddai should come they also made garlands and other fine works to betoken how joyful they were and should be to receive their emmanuel into mansoul yea they strewed the street quite from eye gate to the castlegate the place where the prince should be they also prepared for his coming what music the town of mansoul would afford that they might play before him to the palace his habitation  so at the time appointed he makes his approach to mansoul and the gates were set open for him there also the ancients and elders of mansoul met him to salute him with a thousand welcomes  then he arose and entered mansoul he and all his servants  the elders of mansoul did also go dancing before him till he came to the castle gates  and this was the manner of his going up thither he was clad in his golden armour he rode in his royal chariot the trumpets sounded about him the colours were displayed his ten thousands went up at his feet and the elders of mansoul danced before him  and now were the walls of the famous town of mansoul filled with the tramplings of the inhabitants thereof who went up thither to view the approach of the blessed prince and his royal army  also the casements windows balconies and tops of the houses were all now filled with persons of all sorts to behold how their town was to be filled with good  now when he was come so far into the town as to the recorders house he commanded that one should go to captain credence to know whether the castle of mansoul was prepared to entertain his royal presence for the preparation of that was left to that captain and word was brought that it was  then was captain credence commanded also to come forth with his power to meet the prince the which was as he had commanded done and he conducted him into the castle  this done the prince that night did lodge in the castle with his mighty captains and men of war to the joy of the town of mansoul  now the next care of the townsfolk was how the captains and soldiers of the princes army should be quartered among them and the care was not how they should shut their hands of them but how they should fill their houses with them for every man in mansoul now had that esteem of emmanuel and his men that nothing grieved them more than because they were not enlarged enough every one of them to receive the whole army of the prince yea they counted it their glory to be waiting upon them and would in those days run at their bidding like lackeys  at last they came to this result  1 that captain innocency should quarter at mr reasons  2 that captain patience should quarter at mr minds  this mr mind was formerly the lord willbewills clerk in time of the late rebellion  3 it was ordered that captain charity should quarter at mr affections house  4 that captain goodhope should quarter at my lord mayors  now for the house of the recorder himself desired because his house was next to the castle and because from him it was ordered by the prince that if need be the alarm should be given to mansoulit was i say desired by him that captain boanerges and captain conviction should take up their quarters with him even they and all their men  5 as for captain judgment and captain execution my lord willbewill took them and their men to him because he was to rule under the prince for the good of the town of mansoul now as he had before under the tyrant diabolus for the hurt and damage thereof  6 and throughout the rest of the town were quartered emmanuels forces but captain credence with his men abode still in the castle  so the prince his captains and his soldiers were lodged in the town of mansoul  now the ancients and elders of the town of mansoul thought that they never should have enough of the prince emmanuel his person his actions his words and behaviour were so pleasing so taking so desirable to them  wherefore they prayed him that though the castle of mansoul was his place of residence and they desired that he might dwell there for ever yet that he would often visit the streets houses and people of mansoul  for said they dread sovereign thy presence thy looks thy smiles thy words are the life and strength and sinews of the town of mansoul  besides this they craved that they might have without difficulty or interruption continual access unto him so for that very purpose he commanded that the gates should stand open that they might there see the manner of his doings the fortifications of the place and the royal mansionhouse of the prince  when he spake they all stopped their mouths and gave audience and when he walked it was their delight to imitate him in his goings  now upon a time emmanuel made a feast for the town of mansoul and upon the feastingday the townsfolk were come to the castle to partake of his banquet and he feasted them with all manner of outlandish foodfood that grew not in the fields of mansoul nor in all the whole kingdom of universe it was food that came from his fathers court  and so there was dish after dish set before them and they were commanded freely to eat  but still when a fresh dish was set before them they would whisperingly say to each other what is it for they wist not what to call it  they drank also of the water that was made wine and were very merry with him there was music also all the while at the table and man did eat angels food and had honey given him out of the rock  so mansoul did eat the food that was peculiar to the court yea they had now thereof to the full  i must not forget to tell you that as at this table there were musicians so they were not those of the country nor yet of the town of mansoul but they were the masters of the songs that were sung at the court of shaddai  now after the feast was over emmanuel was for entertaining the town of mansoul with some curious riddles of secrets drawn up by his fathers secretary by the skill and wisdom of shaddai the like to these there is not in any kingdom  these riddles were made upon the king shaddai himself and upon emmanuel his son and upon his wars and doings with mansoul  emmanuel also expounded unto them some of those riddles himself but oh how they were lightened  they saw what they never saw they could not have thought that such rarities could have been couched in so few and such ordinary words  i told you before whom these riddles did concern and as they were opened the people did evidently see it was so  yea they did gather that the things themselves were a kind of a portraiture and that of emmanuel himself for when they read in the scheme where the riddles were writ and looked in the face of the prince things looked so like the one to the other that mansoul could not forbear but say this is the lamb this is the sacrifice this is the rock this is the red cow this is the door and this is the way with a great many other things more  and thus he dismissed the town of mansoul  but can you imagine how the people of the corporation were taken with this entertainment oh they were transported with joy they were drowned with wonderment while they saw and understood and considered what their emmanuel entertained them withal and what mysteries he opened to them  and when they were at home in their houses and in their most retired places they could not but sing of him and of his actions  yea so taken were the townsmen now with their prince that they would sing of him in their sleep  now it was in the heart of the prince emmanuel to newmodel the town of mansoul and to put it into such a condition as might be most pleasing to him and that might best stand with the profit and security of the now flourishing town of mansoul  he provided also against insurrections at home and invasions from abroad such love had he for the famous town of mansoul  wherefore he first of all commanded that the great slings that were brought from his fathers court when he came to the war of mansoul should be mounted some upon the battlements of the castle some upon the towers for there were towers in the town of mansoul towers newbuilt by emmanuel since he came hither  there was also an instrument invented by emmanuel that was to throw stones from the castle of mansoul out at mouthgate an instrument that could not be resisted nor that would miss of execution wherefore for the wonderful exploits that it did when used it went without a name and it was committed to the care of and to be managed by the brave captain the captain credence in case of war  this done emmanuel called the lord willbewill to him and gave him in commandment to take care of the gates the wall and towers in mansoul also the prince gave him the militia into his hand and a special charge to withstand all insurrections and tumults that might be made in mansoul against the peace of our lord the king and the peace and tranquillity of the town of mansoul  he also gave him in commission that if he found any of the diabolonians lurking in any corner of the famous town of mansoul he should forthwith apprehend them and stay them or commit them to safe custody that they may be proceeded against according to law  then he called unto him the lord understanding who was the old lord mayor he that was put out of place when diabolus took the town and put him into his former office again and it became his place for his lifetime  he bid him also that he should build him a palace near eyegate and that he should build it in fashion like a tower for defence  he bid him also that he should read in the revelation of mysteries all the days of his life that he might know how to perform his office aright  he also made mr knowledge the recorder not of contempt to old mr conscience who had been recorder before but for that it was in his princely mind to confer upon mr conscience another employ of which he told the old gentleman he should know more hereafter  then he commanded that the image of diabolus should be taken down from the place where it was set up and that they should destroy it utterly beating it into powder and casting it into the wind without the town wall and that the image of shaddai his father should be set up again with his own upon the castle gates and that it should be more fairly drawn than ever forasmuch as both his father and himself were come to mansoul in more grace and mercy than heretofore  he would also that his name should be fairly engraven upon the front of the town and that it should be done in the best of gold for the honour of the town of mansoul  after this was done emmanuel gave out a commandment that those three great diabolonians should be apprehended namely the two late lord mayors to wit mr incredulity mr lustings and mr forgetgood the recorder  besides these there were some of them that diabolus made burgesses and aldermen in mansoul that were committed to ward by the hand of the now valiant and now right noble the brave lord willbewill  and these were their names  alderman atheism alderman hardheart and alderman falsepeace  the burgesses were mr notruth mr pitiless mr haughty with the like  these were committed to close custody and the gaolers name was mr trueman  this true man was one of those that emmanuel brought with him from his fathers court when at the first he made a war upon diabolus in the town or mansoul  after this the prince gave a charge that the three strongholds that at the command of diabolus the diabolonians built in mansoul should be demolished and utterly pulled down of which holds and their names with their captains and governors you read a little before  but this was long in doing because of the largeness of the places and because the stones the timber the iron and all rubbish was to be carried without the town  when this was done the prince gave order that the lord mayor and aldermen of mansoul should call a court of judicature for the trial and execution of the diabolonians in the corporation now under the charge of mr trueman the gaoler  now when the time was come and the court set commandment was sent to mr trueman the gaoler to bring the prisoners down to the bar  then were the prisoners brought down pinioned and chained together as the custom of the town of mansoul was  so when they were presented before the lord mayor the recorder and the rest of the honourable bench first the jury was empannelled and then the witnesses sworn  the names of the jury were these mr belief mr trueheart mr upright mr hatebad mr love god mr seetruth mr heavenlymind mr moderate mr thankful mr goodwork mr zealforgod and mr humble  the names of the witnesses weremr knowall mr telltrue mr hatelies with my lord willbewill and his man if need were  so the prisoners were set to the bar  then said mr doright for he was the townclerk set atheism to the bar gaoler  so he was set to the bar  then said the clerk atheism hold up thy hand  thou art here indicted by the name of atheism an intruder upon the town of mansoul for that thou hast perniciously and doltishly taught and maintained that there is no god and so no heed to be taken to religion  this thou hast done against the being honour and glory of the king and against the peace and safety of the town of mansoul  what sayest thou  art thou guilty of this indictment or not  atheism  not guilty  crier  call mr knowall mr telltrue and mr hatelies into the court  so they were called and they appeared  then said the clerk you the witnesses for the king look upon the prisoner at the bar do you know him  then said mr knowall yes my lord we know him his name is atheism he has been a very pestilent fellow for many years in the miserable town of mansoul  clerk  you are sure you know him  know  know him  yes my lord i have heretofore too often been in his company to be at this time ignorant of him  he is a diabolonian the son of a diabolonian  i knew his grandfather and his father  clerk  well said  he standeth here indicted by the name of atheism etc and is charged that he hath maintained and taught that there is no god and so no heed need be taken to any religion what say you the kings witnesses to this  is he guilty or not  know  my lord i and he were once in villains lane together and he at that time did briskly talk of divers opinions and then and there i heard him say that for his part he did believe that there was no god  but said he i can profess one and be as religious too if the company i am in and the circumstances of other things said he shall put me upon it  clerk  you are sure you heard him say thus  know  upon mine oath i heard him say thus  then said the clerk mr telltrue what say you to the kings judges touching the prisoner at the bar  tell  my lord i formerly was a great companion of his for the which i now repent me and i have often heard him say and that with very great stomachfulness that he believed there was neither god angel nor spirit  clerk  where did you hear him say so  tell  in blackmouth lane and in blasphemers row and in many other places besides  clerk  have you much knowledge of him  tell  i know him to be a diabolonian the son of a diabolonian and a horrible man to deny a deity  his fathers name was never begood and he had more children than this atheism  i have no more to say  clerk  mr hatelies look upon the prisoner at the bar do you know him  hate  my lord this atheism is one of the vilest wretches that ever i came near or had to do with in my life  i have heard him say that there is no god i have heard him say that there is no world to come no sin nor punishment hereafter and moreover i have heard him say that it was as good to go to a whorehouse as to go to hear a sermon  clerk  where did you hear him say these things  hate  in drunkards row just at rascallanes end at a house in which mr impiety lived  clerk  set him by gaoler and set mr lustings to the bar  mr lustings thou art here indicted by the name of lustings an intruder upon the town of mansoul for that thou hast devilishly and traitorously taught by practice and filthy words that it is lawful and profitable to man to give way to his carnal desires and that thou for thy part hast not nor never wilt deny thyself of any sinful delight as long as thy name is lustings  how sayest thou  art thou guilty of this indictment or not  then said mr lustings my lord i am a man of high birth and have been used to pleasures and pastimes of greatness  i have not been wont to be snubbed for my doings but have been left to follow my will as if it were law  and it seems strange to me that i should this day be called into question for that that not only i but almost all men do either secretly or openly countenance love and approve of  clerk  sir we concern not ourselves with your greatness though the higher the better you should have been but we are concerned and so are you now about an indictment preferred against you  how say you  are you guilty of it or not  lust  not guilty  clerk  crier call upon the witnesses to stand forth and give their evidence  crier  gentlemen you the witnesses for the king come in and give in your evidence for our lord the king against the prisoner at the bar  clerk  come mr knowall look upon the prisoner at the bar do you know him  know  yes my lord i know him  clerk  what is his name  know  his name is lustings he was the son of one beastly and his mother bare him in flesh street  she was one evilconcupiscences daughter  i knew all the generation of them  clerk  well said  you have heard his indictment what say you to it  is he guilty of the things charged against him or not  know  my lord he has as he saith been a great man indeed and greater in wickedness than by pedigree more than a thousandfold  clerk  but what do you know of his particular actions and especially with reference to his indictment  know  i know him to be a swearer a liar a sabbathbreaker i know him to be a fornicator and an unclean person i know him to be guilty of abundance of evils  he has been to my knowledge a very filthy man  clerk  but where did he use to commit his wickedness in some private corners or more open and shamelessly  know  all the town over my lord  clerk  come mr telltrue what have you to say for our lord the king against the prisoner at the bar  tell  my lord all that the first witness has said i know to be true and a great deal more besides  clerk  mr lustings do you hear what these gentlemen say  lust  i was ever of opinion that the happiest life that a man could live on earth was to keep himself back from nothing that he desired in the world nor have i been false at any time to this opinion of mine but have lived in the love of my notions all my days  nor was i ever so churlish having found such sweetness in them myself as to keep the commendations of them from others  then said the court there hath proceeded enough from his own mouth to lay him open to condemnation wherefore set him by gaoler and set mr incredulity to the bar  incredulity set to the bar  clerk  mr incredulity thou art here indicted by the name of incredulity an intruder upon the town of mansoul for that thou hast feloniously and wickedly and that when thou wert an officer in the town of mansoul made head against the captains of the great king shaddai when they came and demanded possession of mansoul yea thou didst bid defiance to the name forces and cause of the king and didst also as did diabolus thy captain stir up and encourage the town of mansoul to make head against and resist the said force of the king  what sayest thou to this indictment  art thou guilty of it or not  then said incredulity i know not shaddai i love my old prince i thought it my duty to be true to my trust and to do what i could to possess the minds of the men of mansoul to do their utmost to resist strangers and foreigners and with might to fight against them  nor have i nor shall i change mine opinion for fear of trouble though you at present are possessed of place and power  then said the court the man as you see is incorrigible he is for maintaining his villainies by stoutness of words and his rebellion with impudent confidence and therefore set him by gaoler and set mr forgetgood to the bar  forgetgood set to the bar  clerk  mr forgetgood thou art here indicted by the name of forgetgood an intruder upon the town of mansoul for that thou when the whole affairs of the town of mansoul were in thy hand didst utterly forget to serve them in what was good and didst fall in with the tyrant diabolus against shaddai the king against his captains and all his host to the dishonour of shaddai the breach of his law and the endangering of the destruction of the famous town of mansoul  what sayest thou to this indictment  art thou guilty or not guilty  then said forgetgood  gentlemen and at this time my judges as to the indictment by which i stand of several crimes accused before you pray attribute my forgetfulness to mine age and not to my wilfulness to the craziness of my brain and not to the carelessness of my mind and then i hope i may be by your charity excused from great punishment though i be guilty  then said the court forgetgood forgetgood thy forgetfulness of good was not simply of frailty but of purpose and for that thou didst loathe to keep virtuous things in thy mind  what was bad thou couldst retain but what was good thou couldst not abide to think of thy age therefore and thy pretended craziness thou makest use of to blind the court withal and as a cloak to cover thy knavery  but let us hear what the witnesses have to say for the king against the prisoner at the bar  is he guilty of this indictment or not  hate  my lord i have heard this forgetgood say that he could never abide to think of goodness no not for a quarter of an hour  clerk  where did you hear him say so  hate  in allbase lane at a house next door to the sign of the conscience seared with a hot iron  clerk  mr knowall what can you say for our lord the king against the prisoner at the bar  know  my lord i know this man well  he is a diabolonian the son of a diabolonian  his fathers name was lovenaught and for him i have often heard him say that he counted the very thoughts of goodness the most burdensome thing in the world  clerk  where have you heard him say these words  know  in flesh lane right opposite to the church  then said the clerk come mr telltrue give in your evidence concerning the prisoner at the bar about that for which he stands here as you see indicted by this honourable court  tell  my lord i have heard him often say he had rather think of the vilest thing than of what is contained in the holy scriptures  clerk  where did you hear him say such grievous words  tell  wherein a great many places particularly in nauseous street in the house of one shameless and in filth lane at the sign of the reprobate next door to the descent into the pit  court  gentlemen you have heard the indictment his plea and the testimony of the witnesses  gaoler set mr hardheart to the bar  he is set to the bar  clerk  mr hardheart thou art here indicted by the name of hard heart an intruder upon the town of mansoul for that thou didst most desperately and wickedly possess the town of mansoul with impenitency and obdurateness and didst keep them from remorse and sorrow for their evils all the time of their apostacy from and rebellion against the blessed king shaddai  what sayest thou to this indictment  art thou guilty or not guilty  hard  my lord i never knew what remorse or sorrow meant in all my life  i am impenetrable  i care for no man nor can i be pierced with mens griefs their groans will not enter into my heart whomsoever i mischief whomsoever i wrong to me it is music when to others mourning  court  you see the man is a right diabolonian and has convicted himself  set him by gaoler and set mr falsepeace to the bar  falsepeace set to the bar  mr falsepeace thou art here indicted by the name of false peace an intruder upon the town of mansoul for that thou didst most wickedly and satanically bring hold and keep the town of mansoul both in her apostacy and in her hellish rebellion in a false groundless and dangerous peace and damnable security to the dishonour of the king the transgression of his law and the great damage of the town of mansoul  what sayest thou  art thou guilty of this indictment or not  then said mr falsepeace  gentlemen and you now appointed to be my judges i acknowledge that my name is mr peace but that my name is falsepeace i utterly deny  if your honours shall please to send for any that do intimately know me or for the midwife that laid my mother of me or for the gossips that were at my christening they will any or all of them prove that my name is not falsepeace but peace  wherefore i cannot plead to this indictment forasmuch as my name is not inserted therein and as is my true name so are also my conditions  i was always a man that loved to live at quiet and what i loved myself that i thought others might love also  wherefore when i saw any of my neighbours to labour under a disquieted mind i endeavoured to help them what i could and instances of this good temper of mine many i could give as  1 when at the beginning our town of mansoul did decline the ways of shaddai they some of them afterwards began to have disquieting reflections upon themselves for what they had done but i as one troubled to see them disquieted presently sought out means to get them quiet again  2 when the ways of the old world and of sodom were in fashion if anything happened to molest those that were for the customs of the present times i laboured to make them quiet again and to cause them to act without molestation  3 to come nearer home  when the wars fell out between shaddai and diabolus if at any time i saw any of the town of mansoul afraid of destruction i often used by some way device invention or other to labour to bring them to peace again wherefore since i have been always a man of so virtuous a temper as some say a peacemaker is and if a peacemaker be so deserving a man as some have been bold to attest he is then let me gentlemen be accounted by you who have a great name for justice and equity in mansoul for a man that deserveth not this inhuman way of treatment but liberty and also a license to seek damage of those that have been my accusers  then said the clerk crier make a proclamation  crier  oyes  forasmuch as the prisoner at the bar hath denied his name to be that which is mentioned in the indictment the court requireth that if there be any in this place that can give information to the court of the original and right name of the prisoner they would come forth and give in their evidence for the prisoner stands upon his own innocency  then came two into the court and desired that they might have leave to speak what they knew concerning the prisoner at the bar the name of the one was searchtruth and the name of the other vouchtruth  so the court demanded of these men if they knew the prisoner and what they could say concerning him for he stands said they upon his own vindication  then said mr searchtruth my lord i  court  hold give him his oath  then they sware him  so he proceeded  search  my lord i know and have known this man from a child and can attest that his name is falsepeace  i know his father his name was mr flatter  and his mother before she was married was called by the name of mrs soothup  and these two when they came together lived not long without this son and when he was born they called his name falsepeace  i was his playfellow only i was somewhat older than he and when his mother did use to call him home from his play she used to say falsepeace falsepeace come home quick or ill fetch you  yea i knew him when he sucked and though i was then but little yet i can remember that when his mother did use to sit at the door with him or did play with him in her arms she would call him twenty times together my little falsepeace my pretty falsepeace and oh my sweet rogue falsepeace and again oh my little bird falsepeace and how do i love my child  the gossips also know it is thus though he has had the face to deny it in open court  then mr vouchtruth was called upon to speak what he knew of him so they sware him  then said mr vouchtruth my lord all that the former witness hath said is true  his name is falsepeace the son of mr flatter and of mrs soothup his mother  and i have in former times seen him angry with those that have called him anything else but falsepeace for he would say that all such did mock and nickname him but this was in the time when mr falsepeace was a great man and when the diabolonians were the brave men in mansoul  court  gentlemen you have heard what these two men have sworn against the prisoner at the bar  and now mr falsepeace to you you have denied your name to be falsepeace yet you see that these honest men have sworn that that is your name  as to your plea in that you are quite besides the matter of your indictment you are not by it charged for evildoing because you are a man of peace or a peacemaker among your neighbours but for that you did wickedly and satanically bring keep and hold the town of mansoul both under its apostasy from and in its rebellion against its king in a false lying and damnable peace contrary to the law of shaddai and to the hazard of the destruction of the then miserable town of mansoul  all that you have pleaded for yourself is that you have denied your name etc but here you see we have witnesses to prove that you are the man  for the peace that you so much boast of making among your neighbours know that peace that is not a companion of truth and holiness but that which is without this foundation is grounded upon a lie and is both deceitful and damnable as also the great shaddai hath said  thy plea therefore has not delivered thee from what by the indictment thou art charged with but rather it doth fasten all upon thee  but thou shalt have very fair play  let us call the witnesses that are to testify as to matter of fact and see what they have to say for our lord the king against the prisoner at the bar  clerk  mr knowall what say you for our lord the king against the prisoner at the bar  know  my lord this man hath of a long time made it to my knowledge his business to keep the town of mansoul in a sinful quietness in the midst of all her lewdness filthiness and turmoils and hath said and that in my hearing come come let us fly from all trouble on what ground soever it comes and let us be for a quiet and peaceable life though it wanteth a good foundation  clerk  come mr hatelies what have you to say  hate  my lord i have heard him say that peace though in a way of unrighteousness is better than trouble with truth  clerk  where did you hear him say this  hate  i heard him say it in follyyard at the house of one mr simple next door to the sign of the selfdeceiver  yea he hath said this to my knowledge twenty times in that place  clerk  we may spare further witness this evidence is plain and full  set him by gaoler and set mr notruth to the bar  mr notruth thou art here indicted by the name of notruth an intruder upon the town of mansoul for that thou hast always to the dishonour of shaddai and the endangering of the utter ruin of the famous town of mansoul set thyself to deface and utterly to spoil all the remainders of the law and image of shaddai that have been found in mansoul after her deep apostasy from her king to diabolus the envious tyrant  what sayest thou art thou guilty of this indictment or not  no  not guilty my lord  then the witnesses were called and mr knowall did first give in his evidence against him  know  my lord this man was at the pulling down of the image of shaddai yea this is he that did it with his own hands  i myself stood by and saw him do it and he did it at the commandment of diabolus  yea this mr notruth did more than this he did also set up the horned image of the beast diabolus in the same place this also is he that at the bidding of diabolus did rend and tear and cause to be consumed all that he could of the remainders of the law of the king even whatever he could lay his hands on in mansoul  clerk  who saw him do this besides yourself  hate  i did my lord and so did many more besides for this was not done by stealth or in a corner but in the open view of all yea he chose himself to do it publicly for he delighted in the doing of it  clerk  mr notruth how could you have the face to plead not guilty when you were so manifestly the doer of all this wickedness  no  sir i thought i must say something and as my name is so i speak  i have been advantaged thereby before now and did not know but by speaking no truth i might have reaped the same benefit now  clerk  set him by gaoler and set mr pitiless to the bar  mr pitiless thou art here indicted by the name of pitiless an intruder upon the town of mansoul for that thou didst most traitorously and wickedly shut up all bowels of compassion and wouldest not suffer poor mansoul to condole her own misery when she had apostatised from her rightful king but didst evade and at all times turn her mind awry from those thoughts that had in them a tendency to lead her to repentance  what sayest thou to this indictment  guilty or not guilty  not guilty of pitilessness  all i did was to cheer up according to my name for my name is not pitiless but cheerup and i could not abide to see mansoul inclined to melancholy  clerk  how do you deny your name and say it is not pitiless but cheerup call for the witnesses  what say you the witnesses to this plea  know  my lord his name is pitiless so he hath written himself in all papers of concern wherein he has had to do  but these diabolonians love to counterfeit their names  mr covetousness covers himself with the name of goodhusbandry or the like mr pride can when need is call himself mr neat mr handsome or the like and so of all the rest of them  clerk  mr telltrue what say you  tell  his name is pitiless my lord  i have known him from a child and he hath done all that wickedness whereof he stands charged in the indictment but there is a company of them that are not acquainted with the danger of damning therefore they call all those melancholy that have serious thoughts how that state should be shunned by them  clerk  set mr haughty to the bar gaoler  mr haughty thou art here indicted by the name of haughty an intruder upon the town of mansoul for that thou didst most traitorously and devilishly teach the town of mansoul to carry it loftily and stoutly against the summons that was given them by the captains of the king shaddai  thou didst also teach the town of mansoul to speak contemptuously and vilifyingly of their great king shaddai and didst moreover encourage both by words and examples mansoul to take up arms both against the king and his son emmanuel  how sayest thou art thou guilty of this indictment or not  haughty  gentlemen i have always been a man of courage and valour and have not used when under the greatest clouds to sneak or hang down the head like a bulrush nor did it at all at any time please me to see men veil their bonnets to those that have opposed them yea though their adversaries seemed to have ten times the advantage of them  i did not use to consider who was my foe nor what the cause was in which i was engaged  it was enough to me if i carried it bravely fought like a man and came off a victor  court  mr haughty you are not here indicted for that you have been a valiant man nor for your courage and stoutness in times of distress but for that you have made use of this your pretended valour to draw the town of mansoul into acts of rebellion both against the great king and emmanuel his son  this is the crime and the thing wherewith thou art charged in and by the indictment  but he made no answer to that  now when the court had thus far proceeded against the prisoners at the bar then they put them over to the verdict of their jury to whom they did apply themselves after this manner  gentlemen of the jury you have been here and have seen these men you have heard their indictments their pleas and what the witnesses have testified against them  now what remains is that you do forthwith withdraw yourselves to some place where without confusion you may consider of what verdict in a way of truth and righteousness you ought to bring in for the king against them and so bring it in accordingly  then the jury to wit mr belief mr trueheart mr upright mr hatebad mr lovegod mr seetruth mr heavenlymind mr moderate mr thankful mr humble mr goodwork and mr zeal forgod withdrew themselves in order to their work  now when they were shut up by themselves they fell to discourse among themselves in order to the drawing up of their verdict  and thus mr belief for he was the foreman began  gentlemen quoth he for the men the prisoners at the bar for my part i believe that they all deserve death  very right said mr true heart i am wholly of your opinion  oh what a mercy is it said mr hatebad that such villains as these are apprehended ay ay said mr lovegod this is one of the joyfullest days that ever i saw in my life  then said mr seetruth i know that if we judge them to death our verdict shall stand before shaddai himself  nor do i at all question it said mr heavenlymind he said moreover when all such beasts as these are cast out of mansoul what a goodly town will it be then  then said mr moderate it is not my manner to pass my judgment with rashness but for these their crimes are so notorious and the witness so palpable that that man must be wilfully blind who saith the prisoners ought not to die  blessed be god said mr thankful that the traitors are in safe custody  and i join with you in this upon my bare knees said mr humble  i am glad also said mr goodwork  then said the warm man and truehearted mr zeal forgod cut them off they have been the plague and have sought the destruction of mansoul  thus therefore being all agreed in their verdict they come instantly into the court  clerk  gentlemen of the jury answer all to your names  mr belief one mr trueheart two mr upright three mr hatebad four mr lovegod five mr seetruth six mr heavenlymind seven mr moderate eight mr thankful nine mr humble ten mr goodwork eleven and mr zealforgod twelve  good men and true stand together in your verdict  are you all agreed  jury  yes my lord  clerk  who shall speak for you  jury  our foreman  clerk  you the gentlemen of the jury being empannelled for our lord the king to serve here in a matter of life and death have heard the trials of each of these men the prisoners at the bar what say you are they guilty of that and those crimes for which they stand here indicted or are they not guilty  foreman  guilty my lord  clerk  look to your prisoners gaoler  this was done in the morning and in the afternoon they received the sentence of death according to the law  the gaoler therefore having received such a charge put them all in the inward prison to preserve them there till the day of execution which was to be the next day in the morning  but now to see how it happened one of the prisoners incredulity by name in the interim betwixt the sentence and the time of execution brake prison and made his escape and gets him away quite out of the town of mansoul and lay lurking in such places and holes as he might until he should again have opportunity to do the town of mansoul a mischief for their thus handling of him as they did  now when mr trueman the gaoler perceived that he had lost his prisoner he was in a heavy taking because that prisoner was to speak on the very worst of all the gang  wherefore first he goes and acquaints my lord mayor mr recorder and my lord willbewill with the matter and to get of them an order to make search for him throughout the town of mansoul  so an order he got and search was made but no such man could now be found in all the town of mansoul  all that could be gathered was that he had lurked a while about the outside of the town and that here and there one or other had a glimpse of him as he did make his escape out of mansoul one or two also did affirm that they saw him without the town going apace quite over the plain  now when he was quite gone it was affirmed by one mr didsee that he ranged all over dry places till he met with diabolus his friend and where should they meet one another but just upon hellgate hill  but oh what a lamentable story did the old gentleman tell to diabolus concerning what sad alteration emmanuel had made in mansoul  as first how mansoul had after some delays received a general pardon at the hands of emmanuel and that they had invited him into the town and that they had given him the castle for his possession  he said moreover that they had called his soldiers into the town coveted who should quarter the most of them they also entertained him with the timbrel song and dance  but that said incredulity which is the sorest vexation to me is that he hath pulled down o father thy image and set up his own pulled down thy officers and set up his own  yea and willbewill that rebel who one would have thought should never have turned from us he is now in as great favour with emmanuel as ever he was with thee  but besides all this this willbewill has received a special commission from his master to search for to apprehend and to put to death all and all manner of diabolonians that he shall find in mansoul  yea and this willbewill has taken and committed to prison already eight of my lords most trusty friends in mansoul  nay further my lord with grief i speak it they have been all arraigned condemned and i doubt before this executed in mansoul  i told my lord of eight and myself was the ninth who should assuredly have drunk of the same cup but that through craft i as thou seest have made mine escape from them  when diabolus had heard this lamentable story he yelled and snuffed up the wind like a dragon and made the sky to look dark with his roaring he also sware that he would try to be revenged on mansoul for this  so they both he and his old friend incredulity concluded to enter into great consultation how they might get the town of mansoul again  now before this time the day was come in which the prisoners in mansoul were to be executed  so they were brought to the cross and that by mansoul in most solemn manner for the prince said that this should be done by the hand of the town of mansoul that i may see said he the forwardness of my now redeemed mansoul to keep my word and to do my commandments and that i may bless mansoul in doing this deed  proof of sincerity pleases me well let mansoul therefore first lay their hands upon these diabolonians to destroy them  so the town of mansoul slew them according to the word of their prince but when the prisoners were brought to the cross to die you can hardly believe what troublesome work mansoul had of it to put the diabolonians to death for the men knowing that they must die and every of them having implacable enmity in their hearts to mansoul what did they but took courage at the cross and there resisted the men of the town of mansoul  wherefore the men of mansoul were forced to cry out for help to the captains and men of war  now the great shaddai had a secretary in the town and he was a great lover of the men of mansoul and he was at the place of execution also so he hearing the men of mansoul cry out against the strugglings and unruliness of the prisoners rose up from his place and came and put his hands upon the hands of the men of mansoul  so they crucified the diabolonians that had been a plague a grief and an offence to the town of mansoul  now when this good work was done the prince came down to see to visit and to speak comfortably to the men of mansoul and to strengthen their hands in such work  and he said to them that by this act of theirs he had proved them and found them to be lovers of his person observers of his laws and such as had also respect to his honour  he said moreover to show them that they by this should not be losers nor their town weakened by the loss of them that he would make them another captain and that of one of themselves  and that this captain should be the ruler of a thousand for the good and benefit of the now flourishing town of mansoul  so he called one to him whose name was waiting and bid him go quickly up to the castle gate and inquire there for one mr experience that waiteth upon that noble captain the captain credence and bid him come hither to me  so the messenger that waited upon the good prince emmanuel went and said as he was commanded  now the young gentleman was waiting to see the captain train and muster his men in the castle yard  then said mr waiting to him sir the prince would that you should come down to his highness forthwith  so he brought him down to emmanuel and he came and made obeisance before him  now the men of the town knew mr experience well for he was born and bred in mansoul they also knew him to be a man of conduct of valour and a person prudent in matters he was also a comely person wellspoken and very successful in his undertakings  wherefore the hearts of the townsmen were transported with joy when they saw that the prince himself was so taken with mr experience that he would needs make him a captain over a band of men  so with one consent they bowed the knee before emmanuel and with a shout said let emmanuel live for ever  then said the prince to the young gentleman whose name was mr experience i have thought good to confer upon thee a place of trust and honour in this my town of mansoul  then the young man bowed his head and worshipped  it is said emmanuel that thou shouldest be a captain a captain over a thousand men in my beloved town of mansoul  then said the captain let the king live  so the prince gave out orders forthwith to the kings secretary that he should draw up for mr experience a commission to make him a captain over a thousand men  and let it be brought to me said he that i may set to my seal  so it was done as it was commanded  the commission was drawn up brought to emmanuel and he set his seal thereto  then by the hand of mr waiting he sent it away to the captain  now as soon as the captain had received his commission he sounded his trumpet for volunteers and young men came to him apace yea the greatest and chief men in the town sent their sons to be listed under his command  thus captain experience came under command to emmanuel for the good of the town of mansoul  he had for his lieutenant one mr skilful and for his cornet one mr memory  his under officers i need not name  his colours were the white colours for the town of mansoul and his scutcheon was the dead lion and dead bear  so the prince returned to his royal palace again  now when he was returned thither the elders of the town of mansoul to wit the lord mayor the recorder and the lord willbewill went to congratulate him and in special way to thank him for his love care and the tender compassion which he showed to his everobliged town of mansoul  so after a while and some sweet communion between them the townsmen having solemnly ended their ceremony returned to their place again  emmanuel also at this time appointed them a day wherein he would renew their charter yea wherein he would renew and enlarge it mending several faults therein that mansouls yoke might be yet more easy  and this he did without any desire of theirs even of his own frankness and noble mind  so when he had sent for and seen their old one he laid it by and said now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away  he said moreover the town of mansoul shall have another a better a new one more steady and firm by far  an epitome hereof take as follows  emmanuel prince of peace and a great lover of the town of mansoul i do in the name of my father and of mine own clemency give grant and bequeath to my beloved town of mansoul  first  free full and everlasting forgiveness of all wrongs injuries and offences done by them against my father me their neighbour or themselves  second  i do give them the holy law and my testament with all that therein is contained for their everlasting comfort and consolation  third  i do also give them a portion of the selfsame grace and goodness that dwells in my fathers heart and mine  fourth  i do give grant and bestow upon them freely the world and what is therein for their good and they shall have that power over them as shall stand with the honour of my father my glory and their comfort  yea i grant them the benefits of life and death and of things present and things to come  this privilege no other city town or corporation shall have but my mansoul only  fifth  i do give and grant them leave and free access to me in my palace at all seasonsto my palace above or belowthere to make known their wants to me and i give them moreover a promise that i will hear and redress all their grievances  sixth  i do give grant to and invest the town of mansoul with full power and authority to seek out take enslave and destroy all and all manner of diabolonians that at any time from whencesoever shall be found straggling in or about the town of mansoul  seventh  i do further grant to my beloved town of mansoul that they shall have authority not to suffer any foreigner or stranger or their seed to be free in and of the blessed town of mansoul nor to share in the excellent privileges thereof  but that all the grants privileges and immunities that i bestow upon the famous town of mansoul shall be for those the old natives and true inhabitants thereof to them i say and to their right seed after them  but all diabolonians of what sort birth country or kingdom soever shall be debarred a share therein  so when the town of mansoul had received at the hand of emmanuel their gracious charter which in itself is infinitely more large than by this lean epitome is set before you they carried it to audience that is to the market place and there mr recorder read it in the presence of all the people  this being done it was had back to the castle gates and there fairly engraven upon the doors thereof and laid in letters of gold to the end that the town of mansoul with all the people thereof might have it always in their view or might go where they might see what a blessed freedom their prince had bestowed upon them that their joy might be increased in themselves and their love renewed to their great and good emmanuel  but what joy what comfort what consolation think you did now possess the hearts of the men of mansoul  the bells rung the minstrels played the people danced the captains shouted the colours waved in the wind and the silver trumpets sounded and the diabolonians now were glad to hide their heads for they looked like them that had been long dead  when this was over the prince sent again for the elders of the town of mansoul and communed with them about a ministry that he intended to establish among them such a ministry that might open unto them and that might instruct them in the things that did concern their present and future state  for said he you of yourselves unless you have teachers and guides will not be able to know and if not to know to be sure not to do the will of my father  at this news when the elders of mansoul brought it to the people the whole town came running together for it pleased them well as whatever the prince now did pleased the people and all with one consent implored his majesty that he would forthwith establish such a ministry among them as might teach them both law and judgment statute and commandment that they might be documented in all good and wholesome things  so he told them that he would grant them their requests and would establish two among them one that was of his fathers court and one that was a native of mansoul  he that is from the court said he is a person of no less quality and dignity than my father and i and he is the lord chief secretary of my fathers house  for he is and always has been the chief dictator of all my fathers laws a person altogether well skilled in all mysteries and knowledge of mysteries as is my father or as myself is  indeed he is one with us in nature and also as to loving of and being faithful to and in the eternal concerns of the town of mansoul  and this is he said the prince that must be your chief teacher for it is he and he only that can teach you clearly in all high and supernatural things  he and he only it is that knows the ways and methods of my father at court nor can any like him show how the heart of my father is at all times in all things upon all occasions towards mansoul for as no man knows the things of a man but that spirit of a man which is in him so the things of my father knows no man but this his high and mighty secretary  nor can any as he tell mansoul how and what they shall do to keep themselves in the love of my father  he also it is that can bring lost things to your remembrance and that can tell you things to come  this teacher therefore must of necessity have the pre eminence both in your affections and judgment before your other teacher his personal dignity the excellency of his teaching also the great dexterity that he hath to help you to make and draw up petitions to my father for your help and to his pleasing must lay obligations upon you to love him fear him and to take heed that you grieve him not  this person can put life and vigour into all he says yea and can also put it into your heart  this person can make seers of you and can make you tell what shall be hereafter  by this person you must frame all your petitions to my father and me and without his advice and counsel first obtained let nothing enter into the town or castle of mansoul for that may disgust and grieve this noble person  take heed i say that you do not grieve this minister for if you do he may fight against you and should he once be moved by you to set himself against you in battle array that will distress you more than if twelve legions should from my fathers court be sent to make war upon you  but as i said if you shall hearken unto him and shall love him if you shall devote yourselves to his teaching and shall seek to have converse and to maintain communion with him you shall find him ten times better than is the whole world to any yea he will shed abroad the love of my father in your hearts and mansoul will be the wisest and most blessed of all people  then did the prince call unto him the old gentleman who before had been the recorder of mansoul mr conscience by name and told him that forasmuch as he was well skilled in the law and government of the town of mansoul and was also wellspoken and could pertinently deliver to them his masters will in all terrene and domestic matters therefore he would also make him a minister for in and to the goodly town of mansoul in all the laws statutes and judgments of the famous town of mansoul  and thou must said the prince confine thyself to the teaching of moral virtues to civil and natural duties but thou must not attempt to presume to be a revealer of those high and supernatural mysteries that are kept close in the bosom of shaddai my father  for those things knows no man nor can any reveal them but my fathers secretary only  thou art a native of the town of mansoul but the lord secretary is a native with my father wherefore as thou hast knowledge of the laws and customs of the corporation so he of the things and will of my father  wherefore o mr conscience although i have made thee a minister and a preacher to the town of mansoul yet as to the things which the lord secretary knoweth and shall teach to this people there thou must be his scholar and a learner even as the rest of mansoul are  thou must therefore in all high and supernatural things go to him for information and knowledge for though there be a spirit in man this persons inspiration must give him understanding wherefore o thou mr recorder keep low and be humble and remember that the diabolonians that kept not their first charge but left their own standing are now made prisoners in the pit  be therefore content with thy station  i have made thee my fathers vicegerent on earth in such things of which i have made mention before  and thou take thou power to teach them to mansoul yea and to impose them with whips and chastisements if they shall not willingly hearken to do thy commandments  and mr recorder because thou art old and through many abuses made feeble therefore i give thee leave and license to go when thou wilt to my fountain my conduit and there to drink freely of the blood of my grape for my conduit doth always run wine  thus doing thou shalt drive from thine heart and stomach all foul gross and hurtful humours  it will also lighten thine eyes and will strengthen thy memory for the reception and keeping of all that the kings most noble secretary teacheth  when the prince had thus put mr recorder that once so was into the place and office of a minister to mansoul and the man had thankfully accepted thereof then did emmanuel address himself in a particular speech to the townsmen themselves  behold said the prince to mansoul my love and care towards you i have added to all that is past this mercy to appoint you preachers the most noble secretary to teach you in all high and sublime mysteries and this gentleman pointing to mr conscience is to teach you in all things human and domestic for therein lieth his work  he is not by what i have said debarred of telling to mansoul anything that he hath heard and received at the mouth of the lord high secretary only he shall not attempt to presume to pretend to be a revealer of those high mysteries himself for the breaking of them up and the discovery of them to mansoul lieth only in the power authority and skill of the lord high secretary himself  talk of them he may and so may the rest of the town of mansoul yea and may as occasion gives them opportunity press them upon each other for the benefit of the whole  these things therefore i would have you observe and do for it is for your life and the lengthening of your days  and one thing more to my beloved mr recorder and to all the town of mansoul  you must not dwell in nor stay upon anything of that which he hath in commission to teach you as to your trust and expectation of the next world of the next world i say for i purpose to give another to mansoul when this with them is worn out but for that you must wholly and solely have recourse to and make stay upon his doctrine that is your teacher after the first order  yea mr recorder himself must not look for life from that which he himself revealeth his dependence for that must be founded in the doctrine of the other preacher  let mr recorder also take heed that he receive not any doctrine or point of doctrine that is not communicated to him by his superior teacher nor yet within the precincts of his own formal knowledge  now after the prince had thus settled things in the famous town of mansoul he proceeded to give to the elders of the corporation a necessary caution to wit how they should carry it to the high and noble captains that he had from his fathers court sent or brought with him to the famous town of mansoul  these captains said he do love the town of mansoul and they are picked men picked out of abundance as men that best suit and that will most faithfully serve in the wars of shaddai against the diabolonians for the preservation of the town of mansoul  i charge you therefore said he o ye inhabitants of the now flourishing town of mansoul that you carry it not ruggedly or untowardly to my captains or their men since as i said they are picked and choice menmen chosen out of many for the good of the town of mansoul  i say i charge you that you carry it not untowardly to them  for though they have the hearts and faces of lions when at any time they shall be called forth to engage and fight with the kings foes and the enemies of the town of mansoul yet a little discountenance cast upon them from the town of mansoul will deject and cast down their faces will weaken and take away their courage  do not therefore o my beloved carry it unkindly to my valiant captains and courageous men of war but love them nourish them succour them and lay them in your bosoms and they will not only fight for you but cause to fly from you all those the diabolonians that seek and will if possible be your utter destruction  if therefore any of them should at any time be sick or weak and so not able to perform that office of love which with all their hearts they are willing to do and will do also when well and in health slight them not nor despise them but rather strengthen them and encourage them though weak and ready to die for they are your fence and your guard your wall your gates your locks and your bars  and although when they are weak they can do but little but rather need to be helped by you than that you should then expect great things from them yet when well you know what exploits what feats and warlike achievements they are able to do and will perform for you  besides if they be weak the town of mansoul cannot be strong if they be strong then mansoul cannot be weak your safety therefore doth lie in their health and in your countenancing them  remember also that if they be sick they catch that disease of the town of mansoul itself  these things i have said unto you because i love your welfare and your honour  observe therefore o my mansoul to be punctual in all things that i have given in charge unto you and that not only as a town corporate and so to your officers and guard and guides in chief but to you as you are a people whose wellbeing as single persons depends on the observation of the orders and commandments of their lord  next o my mansoul i do warn you of that of which notwithstanding that reformation that at present is wrought among you you have need to be warned about  wherefore hearken diligently unto me  i am now sure and you will know hereafter that there are yet of the diabolonians remaining in the town of mansoul diabolonians that are sturdy and implacable and that do already while i am with you and that will yet more when i am from you study plot contrive invent and jointly attempt to bring you to desolation and so to a state far worse than that of the egyptian bondage they are the avowed friends of diabolus therefore look about you  they used heretofore to lodge with their prince in the castle when incredulity was the lord mayor of this town but since my coming hither they lie more in the outsides and walls and have made themselves dens and caves and holes and strongholds therein  wherefore o mansoul thy work as to this will be so much the more difficult and hard that is to take mortify and put them to death according to the will of my father nor can you utterly rid yourselves of them unless you should pull down the walls of your town the which i am by no means willing you should  do you ask me what shall we do then  why be you diligent and quit you like men observe their holes find out their haunts assault them and make no peace with them  wherever they haunt lurk or abide and what terms of peace soever they offer you abhor and all shall be well betwixt you and me  and that you may the better know them from those that are the natives of mansoul i will give you this brief schedule of the names of the chief of them and they are these that follow the lord fornication the lord adultery the lord murder the lord anger the lord lasciviousness the lord deceit the lord evileye mr drunkenness mr revelling mr idolatry mr witchcraft mr variance mr emulation mr wrath mr strife mr sedition and mr heresy  these are some of the chief o mansoul of those that will seek to overthrow thee for ever  these i say are the skulkers in mansoul but look thou well into the law of thy king and there thou shalt find their physiognomy and such other characteristical notes of them by which they certainly may be known  these o my mansoul and i would gladly that you should certainly know it if they be suffered to run and range about the town as they would will quickly like vipers eat out your bowels yea poison your captains cut the sinews of your soldiers break the bars and bolts of your gates and turn your now most flourishing mansoul into a barren and desolate wilderness and ruinous heap wherefore that you may take courage to yourselves to apprehend these villains wherever you find them i give to you my lord mayor my lord willbewill and mr recorder with all the inhabitants of the town of mansoul full power and commission to seek out to take and to cause to be put to death by the cross all and all manner of diabolonians when and wherever you shall find them to lurk within or to range without the walls of the town of mansoul  i told you before that i had placed a standing ministry among you not that you have but these with you for my first four captains who came against the master and lord of the diabolonians that was in mansoul they can and if need be and if they be required will not only privately inform but publicly preach to the corporation both good and wholesome doctrine and such as shall lead you in the way  yea they will set up a weekly yea if need be a daily lecture in thee o mansoul and will instruct thee in such profitable lessons that if heeded will do thee good at the end and take good heed that you spare not the men that you have a commission to take and crucify  now as i have set before your eyes the vagrants and runagates by name so i will tell you that among yourselves some of them shall creep in to beguile you even such as would seem and that in appearance are very rife and hot for religion  and they if you watch not will do you a mischief such an one as at present you cannot think of  these as i said will show themselves to you in another hue than those under description before  wherefore mansoul watch and be sober and suffer not thyself to be betrayed  when the prince had thus far new modelled the town of mansoul and had instructed them in such matters as were profitable for them to know then he appointed another day in which he intended when the townsfolk came together to bestow a further badge of honour upon the town of mansoula badge that should distinguish them from all the people kindreds and tongues that dwell in the kingdom of universe  now it was not long before the day appointed was come and the prince and his people met in the kings palace where first emmanuel made a short speech unto them and then did for them as he had said and unto them as he had promised  my mansoul said he that which i now am about to do is to make you known to the world to be mine and to distinguish you also in your own eyes from all false traitors that may creep in among you  then he commanded that those that waited upon him should go and bring forth out of his treasury those white and glistening robes that i said he have provided and laid up in store for my mansoul  so the white garments were fetched out of his treasury and laid forth to the eyes of the people  moreover it was granted to them that they should take them and put them on according said he to your size and stature  so the people were put into white into fine linen white and clean  then said the prince unto them this o mansoul is my livery and the badge by which mine are known from the servants of others yea it is that which i grant to all that are mine and without which no man is permitted to see my face  wear them therefore for my sake who gave them unto you and also if you would be known by the world to be mine  but now can you think how mansoul shone  it was fair as the sun clear as the moon and terrible as an army with banners  the prince added further and said no prince potentate or mighty one of universe giveth this livery but myself  behold therefore as i said before you shall be known by it to be mine  and now said he i have given you my livery let me give you also in commandment concerning them and be sure that you take good heed to my words  first  wear them daily day by day lest you should at sometimes appear to others as if you were none of mine  second  keep them always white for if they be soiled it is dishonour to me  third  wherefore gird them up from the ground and let them not lag with dust and dirt  fourth  take heed that you lose them not lest you walk naked and they see your shame  fifth  but if you should sully them if you should defile them the which i am greatly unwilling you should and the prince diabolus will be glad if you would then speed you to do that which is written in my law that yet you may stand and befall before me and before my throne  also this is the way to cause that i may not leave you nor forsake you while here but may dwell in this town of mansoul for ever  and now was mansoul and the inhabitants of it as the signet upon emmanuels right hand  where was there now a town a city a corporation that could compare with mansoul a town redeemed from the hand and from the power of diabolus a town that the king shaddai loved and that he sent emmanuel to regain from the prince of the infernal cave yea a town that emmanuel loved to dwell in and that he chose for his royal habitation a town that he fortified for himself and made strong by the force of his army what shall i say mansoul has now a most excellent prince golden captains and men of war weapons proved and garments as white as snow  nor are these benefits to be counted little but great can the town of mansoul esteem them so and improve them to that end and purpose for which they are bestowed upon them  when the prince had thus completed the modelling of the town to show that he had great delight in the work of his hands and took pleasure in the good that he had wrought for the famous and flourishing mansoul he commanded and they set his standard upon the battlements of the castle  and then  first  he gave them frequent visits not a day now but the elders of mansoul must come to him or he to them into his palace  now they must walk and talk together of all the great things that he had done and yet further promised to do for the town of mansoul thus would he often do with the lord mayor my lord willbewill and the honest subordinate preacher mr conscience and mr recorder but oh how graciously how lovingly how courteously and tenderly did this blessed prince now carry it towards the town of mansoul in all the streets gardens orchards and other places where he came to be sure the poor should have his blessing and benediction yea he would kiss them and if they were ill he would lay hands on them and make them well  the captains also he would daily yea sometimes hourly encourage with his presence and goodly words for you must know that a smile from him upon them would put more vigour more life and stoutness into them than would anything else under heaven  the prince would now also feast them and be with them continually hardly a week would pass but a banquet must be had betwixt him and them  you may remember that some pages before we make mention of one feast that they had together but now to feast them was a thing more common  every day with mansoul was a feastday now  nor did he when they returned to their places send them empty away either they must have a ring a gold chain a bracelet a white stone or something so dear was mansoul to him now so lovely was mansoul in his eyes  second  when the elders and townsmen did not come to him he would send in much plenty of provision unto them meat that came from court wine and bread that were prepared for his fathers table yea such delicates would he send unto them and therewith would so cover their table that whoever saw it confessed that the like could not be seen in any kingdom  third  if mansoul did not frequently visit him as he desired they should he would walk out to them knock at their doors and desire entrance that amity might be maintained betwixt them and him if they did hear and open to him as commonly they would if they were at home then would he renew his former love and confirm it too with some new tokens and signs of continued favour  and was it not now amazing to behold that in that very place where sometimes diabolus had his abode and entertained his diabolonians to the almost utter destruction of mansoul the prince of princes should sit eating and drinking with them while all his mighty captains men of war trumpeters with the singingmen and singing women of his father stood round about to wait upon them  now did mansouls cup run over now did her conduits run sweet wine now did she eat the finest of the wheat and drink milk and honey out of the rock  now she said how great is his goodness for since i found favour in his eyes how honourable have i been  the blessed prince did also ordain a new officer in the town and a goodly person he was his name was mr godspeace  this man was set over my lord willbewill my lord mayor mr recorder the subordinate preacher mr mind and over all the natives of the town of mansoul  himself was not a native of it but came with the prince emmanuel from the court  he was a great acquaintance of captain credence and captain goodhope some say they were kin and i am of that opinion too  this man as i said was made governor of the town in general especially over the castle and captain credence was to help him there  and i made great observation of it that so long as all things went in mansoul as this sweet natured gentleman would the town was in most happy condition  now there were no jars no chiding no interferings no unfaithful doings in all the town of mansoul every man in mansoul kept close to his own employment  the gentry the officers the soldiers and all in place observed their order  and as for the women and children of the town they followed their business joyfully they would work and sing work and sing from morning till night  so that quite through the town of mansoul now nothing was to be found but harmony quietness joy and health  and this lasted all that summer  but there was a man in the town of mansoul and his name was mr carnalsecurity this man did after all this mercy bestowed on this corporation bring the town of mansoul into great and grievous slavery and bondage  a brief account of him and of his doings take as followeth  when diabolus at first took possession of the town of mansoul he brought thither with himself a great number of diabolonians men of his own conditions  now among these there was one whose name was mr selfconceit and a notable brisk man he was as any that in those days did possess the town of mansoul  diabolus then perceiving this man to be active and bold sent him upon many desperate designs the which he managed better and more to the pleasing of his lord than most that came with him from the dens could do  wherefore finding him so fit for his purpose he preferred him and made him next to the great lord willbewill of whom we have written so much before  now the lord willbewill being in those days very well pleased with him and with his achievements gave him his daughter the lady fearnothing to wife  now of my lady fearnothing did this mr selfconceit beget this gentleman mr carnalsecurity  wherefore there being then in mansoul those strange kinds of mixtures it was hard for them in some cases to find out who were natives who not for mr carnalsecurity sprang from my lord willbewill by mothers side though he had for his father a diabolonian by nature  well this carnalsecurity took much after his father and mother he was selfconceited he feared nothing he was also a very busy man  nothing of news nothing of doctrine nothing of alteration or talk of alteration could at any time be on foot in mansoul but be sure mr carnalsecurity would be at the head or tail of it but to be sure he would decline those that he deemed the weakest and stood always with them in his way of standing that he supposed was the strongest side  now when shaddai the mighty and emmanuel his son made war upon mansoul to take it this mr carnalsecurity was then in town and was a great doer among the people encouraging them in their rebellion putting them upon hardening themselves in their resisting the kings forces  but when he saw that the town of mansoul was taken and converted to the use of the glorious prince emmanuel and when he also saw what was become of diabolus and how he was unroosted and made to quit the castle in the greatest contempt and scorn and that the town of mansoul was well lined with captains engines of war and men and also provision what doth he but slyly wheel about also and as he had served diabolus against the good prince so he feigned that he would serve the prince against his foes  and having got some little smattering of emmanuels things by the end being bold he ventures himself into the company of the townsmen any attempts also to chat among them  now he knew that the power and strength of the town of mansoul was great and that it could not but be pleasing to the people if he cried up their might and their glory  wherefore he beginneth his tale with the power and strength of mansoul and affirmed that it was impregnable now magnifying their captains and their slings and their rams then crying up their fortifications and strongholds and lastly the assurances that they had from their prince that mansoul should be happy for ever  but when he saw that some of the men of the town were tickled and taken with his discourse he makes it his business and walking from street to street house to house and man to man he at last brought mansoul to dance after his pipe and to grow almost as carnally secure as himself so from talking they went to feasting and from feasting to sporting and so to some other matters  now emmanuel was yet in the town of mansoul and he wisely observed their doings  my lord mayor my lord willbewill and mr recorder were also all taken with the words of this tattling diabolonian gentleman forgetting that their prince had given them warning before to take heed that they were not beguiled with any diabolonian sleight he had further told them that the security of the now flourishing town of mansoul did not so much lie in her present fortifications and force as in her so using of what she had as might oblige her emmanuel to abide within her castle  for the right doctrine of emmanuel was that the town of mansoul should take heed that they forgot not his fathers love and his also that they should so demean themselves as to continue to keep themselves therein  now this was not the way to do it namely to fall in love with one of the diabolonians and with such an one too as mr carnalsecurity was and to be led up and down by the nose by him they should have heard their prince feared their prince loved their prince and have stoned this naughty pack to death and took care to have walked in the ways of their princes prescribing  for then should their peace have been as a river when their righteousness had been like the waves of the sea  now when emmanuel perceived that through the policy of mr carnal security the hearts of the men of mansoul were chilled and abated in their practical love to him  first  he bemoans them and condoles their state with the secretary saying oh that my people had hearkened unto me and that mansoul had walked in my ways  i would have fed them with the finest of the wheat and with honey out of the rock would i have sustained them  this done he said in his heart i will return to the court and go to my place till mansoul shall consider and acknowledge their offence  and he did so and the cause and manner of his going away from them was that mansoul declined him as is manifest in these particulars  1 they left off their former way of visiting him they came not to his royal palace as afore  2 they did not regard nor yet take notice that he came or came not to visit them  3 the lovefeasts that had wont to be between their prince and them though he made them still and called them to them yet they neglected to come to them or to be delighted with them  4 they waited not for his counsels but began to be headstrong and confident in themselves concluding that now they were strong and invincible and that mansoul was secure and beyond all reach of the foe and that her state must needs be unalterable for ever  now as was said emmanuel perceiving that by the craft of mr carnalsecurity the town of mansoul was taken off from their dependence upon him and upon his father by him and set upon what by them was bestowed upon it he first as i said bemoaned their state then he used means to make them understand that the way that they went on in was dangerous  for he sent my lord high secretary to them to forbid them such ways but twice when he came to them he found them at dinner in mr carnalsecuritys parlour and perceiving also that they were not willing to reason about matters concerning their good he took grief and went his way the which when he had told to the prince emmanuel he took offence and was grieved also and so made provision to return to his fathers court  now the methods of his withdrawing as i was saying before were thus  1 even while he was yet with them in mansoul he kept himself close and more retired than formerly  2 his speech was not now if he came in their company so pleasant and familiar as formerly  3 nor did he as in times past send to mansoul from his table those dainty bits which he was wont to do  4 nor when they came to visit him as now and then they would would he be so easily spoken with as they found him to be in times past  they might now knock once yea twice but he would seem not at all to regard them whereas formerly at the sound of their feet he would up and run and meet them halfway and take them too and lay them in his bosom  but thus emmanuel carried it now and by this his carriage he sought to make them bethink themselves and return to him  but alas they did not consider they did not know his ways they regarded not they were not touched with these nor with the true remembrance of former favours  wherefore what does he but in private manner withdraw himself first from his palace then to the gate of the town and so away from mansoul he goes till they should acknowledge their offence and more earnestly seek his face mr godspeace also laid down his commission and would for the present act no longer in the town of mansoul  thus they walked contrary to him and he again by way of retaliation walked contrary to them  but alas by this time they were so hardened in their way and had so drunk in the doctrine of mr carnalsecurity that the departing of their prince touched them not nor was he remembered by them when gone and so of consequence his absence not condoled by them  now there was a day wherein this old gentleman mr carnal security did again make a feast for the town of mansoul and there was at that time in the town one mr godlyfear one now but little set by though formerly one of great request  this man old carnalsecurity had a mind if possible to gull and debauch and abuse as he did the rest and therefore he now bids him to the feast with his neighbours  so the day being come they prepare and he goes and appears with the rest of the guests and being all set at the table they did eat and drink and were merry even all but this one man  for mr godlyfear sat like a stranger and did neither eat nor was merry  the which when mr carnalsecurity perceived he presently addressed himself in a speech thus to him  mr godlyfear are you not well  you seem to be ill of body or mind or both  i have a cordial of mr forgetgoods making the which sir if you will take a dram of i hope it may make you bonny and blithe and so make you more fit for us feasting companions  unto whom the good old gentleman discreetly replied sir i thank you for all things courteous and civil but for your cordial i have no list thereto  but a word to the natives of mansoul  you the elders and chief of mansoul to me it is strange to see you so jocund and merry when the town of mansoul is in such woeful case  then said mr carnalsecurity you want sleep good air i doubt if you please lie down and take a nap and we meanwhile will be merry  then said the good man as follows  sir if you were not destitute of an honest heart you could not do as you have done and do  then said mr carnalsecurity why  godly  nay pray interrupt me not  it is true the town of mansoul was strong and with a proviso impregnable but you the townsmen have weakened it and it now lies obnoxious to its foes nor is it a time to flatter or be silent it is you mr carnal security that have wilily stripped mansoul and driven her glory from her you have pulled down her towers you have broken down her gates you have spoiled her locks and bars  and now to explain myself  from that time that my lords of mansoul and you sir grew so great from that time the strength of mansoul has been offended and now he is arisen and is gone  if any shall question the truth of my words i will answer him by this and suchlike questions  where is the prince emmanuel  when did a man or woman in mansoul see him  when did you hear from him or taste any of his dainty bits  you are now a feasting with this diabolonian monster but he is not your prince  i say therefore though enemies from without had you taken heed could not have made a prey of you yet since you have sinned against your prince your enemies within have been too hard for you  then said mr carnalsecurity fie fie  mr godlyfear fie will you never shake off your timorousness  are you afraid of being sparrowblasted  who hath hurt you  behold i am on your side only you are for doubting and i am for being confident besides is this a time to be sad in  a feast is made for mirth why then do you now to your shame and our trouble break out into such passionate melancholy language when you should eat and drink and be merry  then said mr godlyfear again i may well be sad for emmanuel is gone from mansoul  i say again he is gone and you sir are the man that has driven him away yea he is gone without so much as acquainting the nobles of mansoul with his going and if that is not a sign of his anger i am not acquainted with the methods of godliness  and now my lords and gentlemen for my speech is still to you your gradual declining from him did provoke him gradually to depart from you the which he did for some time if perhaps you would have been made sensible thereby and have been renewed by humbling yourselves but when he saw that none would regard nor lay these fearful beginnings of his anger and judgment to heart he went away from this place and this i saw with mine eye  wherefore now while you boast your strength is gone you are like the man that had lost his locks that before did wave about his shoulders  you may with this lord of your feast shake yourselves and conclude to do as at other times but since without him you can do nothing and he is departed from you turn your feast into a sigh and your mirth into lamentation  then the subordinate preacher old mr conscience by name he that of old was recorder of mansoul being startled at what was said began to second it thus  indeed my brethren quoth he i fear that mr godlyfear tells us true  i for my part have not seen my prince a long season  i cannot remember the day for my part nor can i answer mr godly fears question  i doubt i am afraid that all is nought with mansoul  godly  nay i know that you shall not find him in mansoul for he is departed and gone yea and gone for the faults of the elders and for that they rewarded his grace with unsufferable unkindness  then did the subordinate preacher look as if he would fall down dead at the table also all there present except the man of the house began to look pale and wan  but having a little recovered themselves and jointly agreeing to believe mr godlyfear and his sayings they began to consult what was best to be done now mr carnalsecurity was gone into his withdrawingroom for he liked not such dumpish doings both to the man of the house for drawing them into evil and also to recover emmanuels love  and with that that saying of their prince came very hot into their minds which he had bidden them do to such as were false prophets that should arise to delude the town of mansoul  so they took mr carnalsecurity concluding that he must be he and burned his house upon him with fire for he also was a diabolonian by nature  so when this was passed and over they bespeed themselves to look for emmanuel their prince and they sought him but they found him not  then were they more confirmed in the truth of mr godly fears sayings and began also severely to reflect upon themselves for their so vile and ungodly doings for they concluded now that it was through them that their prince had left them  then they agreed and went to my lord secretary him whom before they refused to hearhim whom they had grieved with their doings to know of him for he was a seer and could tell where emmanuel was and how they might direct a petition to him  but the lord secretary would not admit them to a conference about this matter nor would admit them to his royal place of abode nor come out to them to show them his face or intelligence  and now was it a day gloomy and dark a day of clouds and of thick darkness with mansoul  now they saw that they had been foolish and began to perceive what the company and prattle of mr carnal security had done and what desperate damage his swaggering words had brought poor mansoul into  but what further it was likely to cost them they were ignorant of  now mr godlyfear began again to be in repute with the men of the town yea they were ready to look upon him as a prophet  well when the sabbath day was come they went to hear their subordinate preacher but oh how he did thunder and lighten this day  his text was that in the prophet jonah  they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy  but there was then such power and authority in that sermon and such a dejection seen in the countenances of the people that day that the like hath seldom been heard or seen  the people when sermon was done were scarce able to go to their homes or to betake themselves to their employs the week after they were so sermonsmitten and also so sermon sick by being smitten that they knew not what to do  he did not only show to mansoul their sin but did tremble before them under the sense of his own still crying out of himself as he preached to them unhappy man that i am that i should do so wicked a thing  that i a preacher whom the prince did set up to teach to mansoul his law should myself live senseless and sottishly here and be one of the first found in transgression this transgression also fell within my precincts i should have cried out against the wickedness but i let mansoul lie wallowing in it until it had driven emmanuel from its borders  with these things he also charged all the lords and gentry of mansoul to the almost distracting of them  about this time also there was a great sickness in the town of mansoul and most of the inhabitants were greatly afflicted  yea the captains also and men of war were brought thereby to a languishing condition and that for a long time together so that in case of an invasion nothing could to purpose now have been done either by the townsmen or field officers  oh how many pale faces weak hands feeble knees and staggering men were now seen to walk the streets of mansoul  here were groans there pants and yonder lay those that were ready to faint  the garments too which emmanuel had given them were but in a sorry case some were rent some were torn and all in a nasty condition some also did hang so loosely upon them that the next bush they came at was ready to pluck them off  after some time spent in this sad and desolate condition the subordinate preacher called for a day of fasting and to humble themselves for being so wicked against the great shaddai and his son  and he desired that captain boanerges would preach  so he consented to do it and the day being come and his text was this cut it down why cumbereth it the ground  and a very smart sermon he made upon the place  first he showed what was the occasion of the words namely because the figtree was barren then he showed what was contained in the sentence namely repentance or utter desolation  he then showed also by whose authority this sentence was pronounced and that was by shaddai himself  and lastly he showed the reasons of the point and then concluded his sermon  but he was very pertinent in the application insomuch that he made poor mansoul tremble  for this sermon as well as the former wrought much upon the hearts of the men of mansoul yea it greatly helped to keep awake those that were roused by the preaching that went before  so that now throughout the whole town there was little or nothing to be heard or seen but sorrow and mourning and woe  now after sermon they got together and consulted what was best to be done  but said the subordinate preacher i will do nothing of mine own head without advising with my neighbour mr godly fear  for if he had aforehand understood more of the mind of our prince than we i do not know but he also may have it now even now we are turning again to virtue  so they called and sent for mr godlyfear and he forthwith appeared  then they desired that he would further show his opinion about what they had best to do then said the old gentleman as followeth  it is my opinion that this town of mansoul should in this day of her distress draw up and send an humble petition to their offended prince emmanuel that he in his favour and grace will turn again unto you and not keep anger for ever  when the townsmen had heard this speech they did with one consent agree to his advice so they did presently draw up their request and the next was but who shall carry it  at last they did all agree to send it by my lord mayor  so he accepted of the service and addressed himself to his journey and went and came to the court of shaddai whither emmanuel the prince of mansoul was gone  but the gate was shut and a strict watch kept thereat so that the petitioner was forced to stand without for a great while together  then he desired that some would go into the prince and tell him who stood at the gate and what his business was  so one went and told to shaddai and to emmanuel his son that the lord mayor of the town of mansoul stood without at the gate of the kings court desiring to be admitted into the presence of the prince the kings son  he also told what was the lord mayors errand both to the king and his son emmanuel  but the prince would not come down nor admit that the gate should be opened to him but sent him an answer to this effect  they have turned their back unto me and not their face but now in the time of their trouble they say to me arise and save us  but can they not now go to mr carnalsecurity to whom they went when they turned from me and make him their leader their lord and their protection now in their trouble why now in their trouble do they visit me since in their prosperity they went astray  the answer made my lord mayor look black in the face it troubled it perplexed it rent him sore  and now he began again to see what it was to be familiar with diabolonians such as mr carnal security was  when he saw that at court as yet there was little help to be expected either for himself or friends in mansoul he smote upon his breast and returned weeping and all the way bewailing the lamentable state of mansoul  well when he was come within sight of the town the elders and chief of the people of mansoul went out at the gate to meet him and to salute him and to know how he sped at court  but he told them his tale in so doleful a manner that they all cried out and mourned and wept  wherefore they threw ashes and dust upon their heads and put sackcloth upon their loins and went crying out through the town of mansoul the which when the rest of the townsfolk saw they all mourned and wept  this therefore was a day of rebuke and trouble and of anguish to the town of mansoul and also of great distress  after some time when they had somewhat refrained themselves they came together to consult again what by them was yet to be done and they asked advice as they did before of that reverend mr godly fear who told them that there was no way better than to do as they had done nor would he that they should be discouraged at all with that they had met with at court yea though several of their petitions should be answered with nought but silence or rebuke for said he it is the way of the wise shaddai to make men wait and to exercise patience and it should be the way of them in want to be willing to stay his leisure  then they took courage and sent again and again and again and again for there was not now one day nor an hour that went over mansouls head wherein a man might not have met upon the road one or other riding post sounding the horn from mansoul to the court of the king shaddai and all with letters petitionary in behalf of and for the princes return to mansoul  the road i say was now full of messengers going and returning and meeting one another some from the court and some from mansoul and this was the work of the miserable town of mansoul all that long that sharp that cold and tedious winter  now if you have not forgot you may yet remember that i told you before that after emmanuel had taken mansoul yea and after that he had new modelled the town there remained in several lurking places of the corporation many of the old diabolonians that either came with the tyrant when he invaded and took the town or that had there by reason of unlawful mixtures their birth and breeding and bringing up  and their holes dens and lurking places were in under or about the wall of the town  some of their names are the lord fornication the lord adultery the lord murder the lord anger the lord lasciviousness the lord deceit the lord evileye the lord blasphemy and that horrible villain the old and dangerous lord covetousness  these as i told you with many more had yet their abode in the town of mansoul and that after that emmanuel had driven their prince diabolus out of the castle  against these the good prince did grant a commission to the lord willbewill and others yea to the whole town of mansoul to seek take secure and destroy any or all that they could lay hands of for that they were diabolonians by nature enemies to the prince and those that sought to ruin the blessed town of mansoul  but the town of mansoul did not pursue this warrant but neglected to look after to apprehend to secure and to destroy these diabolonians wherefore what do these villains but by degrees take courage to put forth their heads and to show themselves to the inhabitants of the town  yea and as i was told some of the men of mansoul grew too familiar with some of them to the sorrow of the corporation as you yet will hear more of in time and place  well when the diabolonian lords that were left perceived that mansoul had through sinning offended emmanuel their prince and that he had withdrawn himself and was gone what do they but plot the ruin of the town of mansoul  so upon a time they met together at the hold of one mr mischief who was also a diabolonian and there consulted how they might deliver up mansoul into the hands of diabolus again  now some advised one way and some another every man according to his own liking  at last my lord lasciviousness propounded whether it might not be best in the first place for some of those that were diabolonians in mansoul to adventure to offer themselves for servants to some of the natives of the town for said he if they so do and mansoul shall accept of them they may for us and for diabolus our lord make the taking of the town of mansoul more easy than otherwise it will be  but then stood up the lord murder and said this may not be done at this time for mansoul is now in a kind of a rage because by our friend mr carnalsecurity she hath been once ensnared already and made to offend against her prince and how shall she reconcile herself unto her lord again but by the heads of these men besides we know that they have in commission to take and slay us wherever they shall find us let us therefore be wise as foxes when we are dead we can do them no hurt but while we live we may  thus when they had tossed the matter to and fro they jointly agreed that a letter should forthwith be sent away to diabolus in their name by which the state of the town of mansoul should be showed him and how much it is under the frowns of their prince  we may also said some let him know our intentions and ask of him his advice in the case  so a letter was presently framed the contents of which were these  to our great lord the prince diabolus dwelling below in the infernal cave  o great father and mighty prince diabolus we the true diabolonians yet remaining in the rebellious town of mansoul having received our beings from thee and our nourishment at thy hands cannot with content and quiet endure to behold as we do this day how thou art dispraised disgraced and reproached among the inhabitants of this town nor is thy long absence at all delightful to us because greatly to our detriment  the reason of this our writing unto our lord is for that we are not altogether without hope that this town may become thy habitation again for it is greatly declined from its prince emmanuel and he is uprisen and is departed from them  yea and though they send and send and send and send after him to return to them yet can they not prevail nor get good words from him  there has been also of late and is yet remaining a very great sickness and fainting among them and that not only upon the poorer sort of the town but upon the lords captains and chief gentry of the place we only who are of the diabolonians by nature remain well lively and strong so that through their great transgression on the one hand and their dangerous sickness on the other we judge they lie open to thy hand and power  if therefore it shall stand with thy horrible cunning and with the cunning of the rest of the princes with thee to come and make an attempt to take mansoul again send us word and we shall to our utmost power be ready to deliver it into thy hand  or if what we have said shall not by thy fatherhood be thought best and most meet to be done send us thy mind in a few words and we are all ready to follow thy counsel to the hazarding of our lives and what else we have  given under our hands the day and date abovewritten after a close consultation at the house of mr mischief who yet is alive and hath his place in our desirable town of mansoul  when mr profane for he was the carrier was come with his letter to hellgate hill he knocked at the brazen gates for entrance then did cerberus the porter for he is the keeper of that gate open to mr profane to whom he delivered his letter which he had brought from the diabolonians in mansoul  so he carried it in and presented it to diabolus his lord and said tidings my lord from mansoul from our trusty friends in mansoul  then came together from all places of the den beelzebub lucifer apollyon with the rest of the rabblement there to hear what news from mansoul  so the letter was broken up and read and cerberus he stood by  when the letter was openly read and the contents thereof spread into all the corners of the den command was given that without let or stop deadmans bell should be rung for joy so the bell was rung and the princes rejoiced that mansoul was likely to come to ruin  now the clapper of the bell went the town of mansoul is coming to dwell with us  make room for the town of mansoul  this bell therefore they did ring because they did hope that they should have mansoul again  now when they had performed this their horrible ceremony they got together again to consult what answer to send to their friends in mansoul and some advised one thing and some another  but at length because the business required haste they left the whole business to the prince diabolus judging him the most proper lord of the place  so he drew up a letter as he thought fit in answer to what mr profane had brought and sent it to the diabolonians that did dwell in mansoul by the same hand that had brought theirs to him and these were the contents thereof  to our offspring the high and mighty diabolonians that yet dwell in the town of mansoul diabolus the great prince of mansoul wisheth a prosperous issue and conclusion of those many brave enterprises conspiracies and designs that you of your love and respect to our honour have in your hearts to attempt to do against mansoul  beloved children and disciples my lord fornication adultery and the rest we have here in our desolate den received to our highest joy and content your welcome letter by the hand of our trusty mr profane and to show how acceptable your tidings were we rang out our bell for gladness for we rejoiced as much as we could when we perceived that yet we had friends in mansoul and such as sought our honour and revenge in the ruin of the town of mansoul  we also rejoiced to hear that they are in a degenerated condition and that they have offended their prince and that he is gone  their sickness also pleaseth us as does also your health might and strength  glad also would we be right horribly beloved could we get this town into our clutches again nor will we be sparing of spending our wit our cunning our craft and hellish inventions to bring to a wished conclusion this your brave beginning in order thereto  and take this for your comfort our birth and our offspring that shall we again surprise it and take it we will attempt to put all your foes to the sword and will make you the great lords and captains of the place  nor need you fear if ever we get it again that we after that shall be cast out any more for we will come with more strength and so lay far more fast hold than at the first we did  besides it is the law of that prince that now they own that if we get them a second time they shall be ours for ever  do you therefore our trusty diabolonians yet more pry into and endeavour to spy out the weakness of the town of mansoul  we also would that you yourselves do attempt to weaken them more and more send us word also by what means you think we had best to attempt the regaining thereof  namely whether by persuasion to a vain and loose life or whether by tempting them to doubt and despair or whether by blowing up of the town by the gunpowder of pride and selfconceit  do you also o ye brave diabolonians and true sons of the pit be always in a readiness to make a most hideous assault within when we shall be ready to storm it without  now speed you in your project and we in our desires to the utmost power of our gates which is the wish of your great diabolus mansouls enemy and him that trembles when he thinks of judgment to come  all the blessings of the pit be upon you and so we close up our letter  given at the pits mouth by the joint consent of all the princes of darkness to be sent to the force and power that we have yet remaining in mansoul by the hand of mr profane by me diabolus  this letter as was said was sent to mansoul to the diabolonians that yet remained there and that yet inhabited the wall from the dark dungeon of diabolus by the hand of mr profane by whom they also in mansoul sent theirs to the pit  now when this mr profane had made his return and was come to mansoul again he went and came as he was wont to the house of mr mischief for there was the conclave and the place where the contrivers were met  now when they saw that their messenger was returned safe and sound they were greatly gladded thereat  then he presented them with his letter which he had brought from diabolus for them the which when they had read and considered did much augment their gladness they asked him after the welfare of their friends as how their lord diabolus lucifer and beelzebub did with the rest of those of the den  to which this profane made answer well well my lords they are well even as well as can be in their place  they also said he did ring for joy at the reading of your letter as you well perceived by this when you read it  now as was said when they had read their letter and perceived that it encouraged them in their work they fell to their way of contriving again namely how they might complete their diabolonian design upon mansoul  and the first thing that they agreed upon was to keep all things from mansoul as close as they could  let it not be known let not mansoul be acquainted with what we design against it  the next thing was how or by what means they should try to bring to pass the ruin and overthrow of mansoul and one said after this manner and another said after that  then stood up mr deceit and said my right diabolonian friends our lords and the high ones of the deep dungeon do propound unto us these three ways  1 whether we had best to seek its ruin by making mansoul loose and vain  2 or whether by driving them to doubt and despair  3 or whether by endeavouring to blow them up by the gunpowder of pride and selfconceit  now i think if we shall tempt them to pride that may do something and if we tempt them to wantonness that may help  but in my mind if we could drive them into desperation that would knock the nail on the head for then we should have them in the first place question the truth of the love of the heart of their prince towards them and that will disgust him much  this if it works well will make them leave off quickly their way of sending petitions to him then farewell earnest solicitations for help and supply for then this conclusion lies naturally before them as good do nothing as do to no purpose  so to mr deceit they unanimously did consent  then the next question was but how shall we do to bring this our project to pass and it was answered by the same gentlemanthat this might be the best way to do it  even let quoth he so many of our friends as are willing to venture themselves for the promoting of their princes cause disguise themselves with apparel change their names and go into the market like far countrymen and proffer to let themselves for servants to the famous town of mansoul and let them pretend to do for their masters as beneficially as may be for by so doing they may if mansoul shall hire them in little time so corrupt and defile the corporation that her now prince shall be not only further offended with them but in conclusion shall spue them out of his mouth  and when this is done our prince diabolus shall prey upon them with ease  yea of themselves they shall fall into the mouth of the cater  this project was no sooner propounded but was as highly accepted and forward were all diabolonians now to engage in so delicate an enterprise  but it was not thought fit that all should do thus wherefore they pitched upon two or three namely the lord covetousness the lord lasciviousness and the lord anger  the lord covetousness called himself by the name of prudentthrifty the lord lasciviousness called himself by the name of harmless mirth and the lord anger called himself by the name of goodzeal  so upon a marketday they came into the marketplace three lusty fellows they were to look on and they were clothed in sheeps russet which was also now in a manner as white as were the white robes of the men of mansoul  now the men could speak the language of mansoul well  so when they were come into the marketplace and had offered to let themselves to the townsmen they were presently taken up for they asked but little wages and promised to do their masters great service  mr mind hired prudentthrifty and mr godlyfear hired goodzeal true this fellow harmlessmirth did hang a little in hand and could not so soon get him a master as the others did because the town of mansoul was now in lent but after a while because lent was almost out the lord willbewill hired harmlessmirth to be both his waiting man and his lackey  and thus they got them masters   these villains now being got thus far into the houses of the men of mansoul quickly began to do great mischief therein for being filthy arch and sly they quickly corrupted the families where they were yea they tainted their masters much especially this prudentthrifty and him they call harmlessmirth  true he that went under the visor of goodzeal was not so well liked of his master for he quickly found that he was but a counterfeit rascal the which when the fellow perceived with speed he made his escape from the house or i doubt not but his master had hanged him  well when these vagabonds had thus far carried on their design and had corrupted the town as much as they could in the next place they considered with themselves at what time their prince diabolus without and themselves within the town should make an attempt to seize upon mansoul and they all agreed upon this that a market day would be best for that work for why  then will the townsfolk be busy in their ways  and always take this for a rule when people are most busy in the world they least fear a surprise  we also then said they shall be able with less suspicion to gather ourselves together for the work of our friends and lords yea and in such a day if we shall attempt our work and miss it we may when they shall give us the rout the better hide ourselves in the crowd and escape  these things being thus far agreed upon by them they wrote another letter to diabolus and sent it by the hand to mr profane the contents of which were these  the lords of looseness send to the great and high diabolus from our dens caves holes and strongholds in and about the wall of the town of mansoul greeting  our great lord and the nourisher of our lives diabolushow glad we were when we heard of your fatherhoods readiness to comply with us and help forward our design in our attempts to ruin mansoul none can tell but those who as we do set themselves against all appearance of good when and wheresoever we find it  touching the encouragement that your greatness is pleased to give us to continue to devise contrive and study the utter desolation of mansoul that we are not solicitous about  for we know right well that it cannot but be pleasing and profitable to us to see our enemies and them that seek our lives die at our feet or fly before us  we therefore are still contriving and that to the best of our cunning to make this work most facile and easy to your lordships and to us  first we considered of that most hellishly cunning compacted threefold project that by you was propounded to us in your last and have concluded that though to blow them up with the gunpowder of pride would do well and to do it by tempting them to be loose and vain will help on yet to contrive to bring them into the gulf of desperation we think will do best of all  now we who are at your beck have thought or two ways to do this  first we for our parts will make them as vile as we can and then you with us at a time appointed shall be ready to fall upon them with the utmost force  and of all the nations that are at your whistle we think that an army of doubters may be the most likely to attack and overcome the town of mansoul  thus shall we overcome these enemies else the pit shall open her mouth upon them and desperation shall thrust them down into it  we have also to effect this so much by us desired design sent already three of our trusty diabolonians among them they are disguised in garb they have changed their names and are now accepted of them namely covetousness lasciviousness and anger  the name of covetousness is changed to prudentthrifty and him mr mind has hired and is almost become as bad as our friend  lasciviousness has changed his name to harmlessmirth and he is got to be the lord willbewills lackey but he has made his master very wanton  anger changed his name into goodzeal and was entertained by mr godlyfear but the peevish old gentleman took pepper in the nose and turned our companion out of his house  nay he has informed us since that he ran away from him or else his old master had hanged him up for his labour  now these have much helped forward our work and design upon mansoul for notwithstanding the spite and quarrelsome temper of the old gentleman last mentioned the other two ply their business well and are likely to ripen the work apace  our next project is that it be concluded that you come upon the town upon a marketday and that when they are upon the heat of their business for then to be sure they will be most secure and least think that an assault will be made upon them  they will also at such a time be less able to defend themselves and to offend you in the prosecution of our design  and we your trusty and we are sure your beloved ones shall when you shall make your furious assault without be ready to second the business within  so shall we in all likelihood be able to put mansoul to utter confusion and to swallow them up before they can come to themselves  if your serpentine heads most subtile dragons and our highly esteemed lords can find out a better way than this let us quickly know your minds  to the monsters of the infernal cave from the house of mr mischief in mansoul by the hand of mr profane  now all the while that the raging runagates and hellish diabolonians were thus contriving the ruin of the town of mansoul they namely the poor town itself was in a sad and woeful case partly because they had so grievously offended shaddai and his son and partly because that the enemies thereby got strength within them afresh and also because though they had by many petitions made suit to the prince emmanuel and to his father shaddai by him for their pardon and favour yet hitherto obtained they not one smile but contrariwise through the craft and subtilty of the domestic diabolonians their cloud was made to grow blacker and blacker and their emmanuel to stand at further distance  the sickness also did still greatly rage in mansoul both among the captains and the inhabitants of the town and their enemies only were now lively and strong and likely to become the head whilst mansoul was made the tail  by this time the letter last mentioned that was written by the diabolonians that yet lurked in the town of mansoul was conveyed to diabolus in the black den by the hand of mr profane  he carried the letter by hellgate hill as afore and conveyed it by cerberus to his lord  but when cerberus and mr profane did meet they were presently as great as beggars and thus they fell into discourse about mansoul and about the project against her  ah old friend quoth cerberus art thou come to hellgate hill again  by st mary i am glad to see thee  prof  yes my lord i am come again about the concerns of the town of mansoul  cerb  prithee tell me what condition is that town of mansoul in at present  prof  in a brave condition my lord for us and for my lords the lords of this place i trow for they are greatly decayed as to godliness and that is as well as our heart can wish their lord is greatly out with them and that doth also please us well  we have already also a foot in their dish for our diabolonian friends are laid in their bosoms and what do we lack but to be masters of the place  besides our trusty friends in mansoul are daily plotting to betray it to the lords of this town also the sickness rages bitterly among them and that which makes up all we hope at last to prevail  then said the dog of hellgate no time like this to assault them i wish that the enterprise be followed close and that the success desired may be soon effected  yea i wish it for the poor diabolonians sakes that live in the continual fear of their lives in that traitorous town of mansoul  prof  the contrivance is almost finished the lords in mansoul that are diabolonians are at it day and night and the other are like silly doves they want heart to be concerned with their state and to consider that ruin is at hand  besides you may yea must think when you put all things together that there are many reasons that prevail with diabolus to make what haste he can  cerb  thou hast said as it is i am glad things are at this pass go in my brave profane to my lords they will give thee for thy welcome as good a coranto as the whole of this kingdom will afford i have sent thy letter in already  then mr profane went into the den and his lord diabolus met him and saluted him with welcome my trusty servant  i have been made glad with thy letter  the rest of the lords of the pit gave him also their salutations  then profane after obeisance made to them all said let mansoul be given to my lord diabolus and let him be her king for ever  and with that the hollow belly and yawning gorge of hell gave so loud and hideous a groan for that is the music of that place that it made the mountains about it totter as if they would fall in pieces  now after they had read and considered the letter they consulted what answer to return and the first that did speak to it was lucifer  then said he the first project of the diabolonians in mansoul is likely to be lucky and to take namely that they will by all the ways and means they can make mansoul yet more vile and filthy  no way to destroy a soul like this  our old friend balaam went this way and prospered many years ago let this therefore stand with us for a maxim and be to diabolonians for a general rule in all ages for nothing can make this to fail but grace in which i would hope that this town has no share  but whether to fall upon them on a marketday because of their cumber in business that i would should be under debate  and there is more reason why this head should be debated than why some other should because upon this will turn the whole of what we shall attempt  if we time not our business well our whole project may fail  our friends the diabolonians say that a marketday is best for then will mansoul be most busy and have fewest thoughts of a surprise  but what if also they should double their guards on those days and methinks nature and reason should teach them to do it and what if they should keep such a watch on those days as the necessity of their present case doth require yea what if their men should be always in arms on those days then you may my lords be disappointed in your attempts and may bring our friends in the town to utter danger of unavoidable ruin  then said the great beelzebub there is something in what my lord hath said but his conjecture may or may not fall out  nor hath my lord laid it down as that which must not be receded from for i know that he said it only to provoke to a warm debate thereabout therefore we must understand if we can whether the town of mansoul has such sense and knowledge of her decayed state and of the design that we have on foot against her as doth provoke her to set watch and ward at her gates and to double them on marketdays but if after inquiry made it shall be found that they are asleep then any day will do but a marketday is best and this is my judgment in this case  then quoth diabolus how should we know this and it was answered inquire about it at the mouth of mr profane  so profane was called in and asked the question and he made his answer as follows  prof  my lords so far as i can gather this is at present the condition of the town of mansoul  they are decayed in their faith and love emmanuel their prince has given them the back they send often by petition to fetch him again but he maketh not haste to answer their request nor is there much reformation among them  diab  i am glad that they are backward in a reformation but yet i am afraid of their petitioning  however their looseness of life is a sign that there is not much heart in what they do and without the heart things are little worth  but go on my masters i will divert you my lords no longer  beel  if the case be so with mansoul as mr profane has described it to be it will be no great matter what day we assault it not their prayers nor their power will do them much service  when beelzebub had ended his oration then apollyon did begin  my opinion said he concerning this matter is that we go on fair and softly not doing things in a hurry  let our friends in mansoul go on still to pollute and defile it by seeking to draw it yet more into sin for there is nothing like sin to devour mansoul  if this be done and it takes effect mansoul of itself will leave off to watch to petition or anything else that should tend to her security and safety for she will forget her emmanuel she will not desire his company and can she be gotten thus to live her prince will not come to her in haste  our trusty friend mr carnalsecurity with one of his tricks did drive him out of the town and why may not my lord covetousness and my lord lasciviousness by what they may do keep him out of the town  and this i will tell you not because you know it not that two or three diabolonians if entertained and countenanced by the town of mansoul will do more to the keeping of emmanuel from them and towards making the town of mansoul your own than can an army of a legion that should be sent out from us to withstand him  let therefore this first project that our friends in mansoul have set on foot be strongly and diligently carried on with all cunning and craft imaginable and let them send continually under one guise or another more and other of their men to play with the people of mansoul and then perhaps we shall not need to be at the charge of making a war upon them or if that must of necessity be done yet the more sinful they are the more unable to be sure they will be to resist us and then the more easily we shall overcome them  and besides suppose and that is the worst that can be supposed that emmanuel should come to them again why may not the same means or the like drive him from them once more yea why may he not by their lapse into that sin again be driven from them for ever for the sake of which he was at the first driven from them for a season  and if this should happen then away go with him his rams his slings his captains his soldiers and he leaveth mansoul naked and bare  yea will not this town when she sees herself utterly forsaken of her prince of her own accord open her gates again unto you and make of you as in the days of old  but this must be done by time a few days will not effect so great a work as this  so soon as apollyon had made an end of speaking diabolus began to blow out his own malice and to plead his own cause and he said my lords and powers of the cave my true and trusty friends i have with much impatience as becomes me given ear to your long and tedious orations  but my furious gorge and empty paunch so lusteth after a repossession of my famous town of mansoul that whatever comes out i can wait no longer to see the events of lingering projects  i must and that without further delay seek by all means i can to fill my insatiable gulf with the soul and body of the town of mansoul  therefore lend me your heads your hearts and your help now i am going to recover my town of mansoul  when the lords and princes of the pit saw the flaming desire that was in diabolus to devour the miserable town of mansoul they left off to raise any more objections but consented to lend him what strength they could though had apollyons advice been taken they had far more fearfully distressed the town of mansoul  but i say they were willing to lend him what strength they could not knowing what need they might have of him when they should engage for themselves as he  wherefore they fell to advising about the next thing propounded namely what soldiers they were and also how many with whom diabolus should go against the town of mansoul to take it and after some debate it was concluded according as in the letter the diabolonians had suggested that none were more fit for that expedition than an army of terrible doubters  they therefore concluded to send against mansoul an army of sturdy doubters  the number thought fit to be employed in that service was between twenty and thirty thousand  so then the result of that great council of those high and mighty lords wasthat diabolus should even now out of hand beat up his drum for men in the land of doubting which land lieth upon the confines of the place called hellgate hill for men that might be employed by him against the miserable town of mansoul  it was also concluded that these lords themselves should help him in the war and that they would to that end head and manage his men  so they drew up a letter and sent back to the diabolonians that lurked in mansoul and that waited for the backcoming of mr profane to signify to them into what method and forwardness they at present had put their design  the contents whereof now follow  from the dark and horrible dungeon of hell diabolus with all the society of the princes of darkness sends to our trusty ones in and about the walls of the town of mansoul now impatiently waiting for our most devilish answer to their venomous and most poisonous design against the town of mansoul  our native ones in whom from day to day we boast and in whose actions all the year long we do greatly delight ourselves we received your welcome because highly esteemed letter at the hand of our trusty and greatly beloved the old gentleman mr profane and do give you to understand that when we had broken it up and had read the contents thereof to your amazing memory be it spoken our yawning hollowbellied place where we are made so hideous and yelling a noise for joy that the mountains that stand round about hellgate hill had like to have been shaken to pieces at the sound thereof  we could also do no less than admire your faithfulness to us with the greatness of that subtilty that now hath showed itself to be in your heads to serve us against the town of mansoul  for you have invented for us so excellent a method for our proceeding against that rebellious people a more effectual cannot be thought of by all the wits of hell  the proposals therefore which now at last you have sent us since we saw them we have done little else but highly approved and admired them  nay we shall to encourage you in the profundity of your craft let you know that at a full assembly and conclave of our princes and principalities of this place your project was discoursed and tossed from one side of our cave to the other by their mightinesses but a better and as was by themselves judged a more fit and proper way by all their wits could not be invented to surprise take and make our own the rebellious town of mansoul  wherefore in fine all that was said that varied from what you had in your letter propounded fell of itself to the ground and yours only was stuck to by diabolus the prince yea his gaping gorge and yawning paunch was on fire to put your invention into execution  we therefore give you to understand that our stout furious and unmerciful diabolus is raising for your relief and the ruin of the rebellious town of mansoul more than twenty thousand doubters to come against that people  they are all stout and sturdy men and men that of old have been accustomed to war and that can therefore well endure the drum  i say he is doing this work of his with all the possible speed he can for his heart and spirit is engaged in it  we desire therefore that as you have hitherto stuck to us and given us both advice and encouragement thus far you still will prosecute our design nor shall you lose but be gainers thereby yea we intend to make you the lords of mansoul  one thing may not by any means be omitted that is those with us do desire that every one of you that are in mansoul would still use all your power cunning and skill with delusive persuasions yet to draw the town of mansoul into more sin and wickedness even that sin may be finished and bring forth death  for thus it is concluded with us that the more vile sinful and debauched the town of mansoul is more backward will be their emmanuel to come to their help either by presence or other relief yea the more sinful the more weak and so the more unable will they be to make resistance when we shall make our assault upon them to swallow them up  yea that may cause that their mighty shaddai himself may cast them out of his protection yea and send for his captains and soldiers home with his slings and rams and leave them naked and bare and then the town of mansoul will of itself open to us and fall as the fig into the mouth of the eater  yea to be sure that we then with a great deal of ease shall come upon her and overcome her  as to the time of our coming upon mansoul we as yet have not fully resolved upon that though at present some of us think as you that a marketday or a marketday at night will certainly be the best  however do you be ready and when you shall hear our roaring drum without do you be as busy to make the most horrible confusion within  so shall mansoul certainly be distressed before and behind and shall not know which way to betake herself for help  my lord lucifer my lord beelzebub my lord apollyon my lord legion with the rest salute you as does also my lord diabolus and we wish both you with all that you do or shall possess the very selfsame fruit and success for their doing as we ourselves at present enjoy for ours  from our dreadful confines in the most fearful pit we salute you and so do those many legions here with us wishing you may be as hellishly prosperous as we desire to be ourselves  by the letter carrier mr profane  then mr profane addressed himself for his return to mansoul with his errand from the horrible pit to the diabolonians that dwelt in that town  so he came up the stairs from the deep to the mouth of the cave where cerberus was  now when cerberus saw him he asked how did matters go below about and against the town of mansoul  prof  things go as well as we can expect  the letter that i carried thither was highly approved and well liked by all my lords and i am returning to tell our diabolonians so  i have an answer to it here in my bosom that i am sure will make our masters that sent me glad for the contents thereof are to encourage them to pursue their design to the utmost and to be ready also to fall on within when they shall see my lord diabolus beleaguering the town of mansoul  cerb  but does he intend to go against them himself  prof  does he  ay and he will take along with him more than twenty thousand all sturdy doubters and men of war picked men from the land of doubting to serve him in the expedition  then was cerberus glad and said and is there such brave preparations amaking to go against the miserable town of mansoul and would i might be put at the head of a thousand of them that i might also show my valour against the famous town of mansoul  prof  your wish may come to pass you look like one that has mettle enough and my lord will have with him those that are valiant and stout  but my business requires haste  cerb  ay so it does  speed thee to the town of mansoul with all the deepest mischiefs that this place can afford thee  and when thou shalt come to the house of mr mischief the place where the diabolonians meet to plot tell them that cerberus doth wish them his service and that if he may he will with the army come up against the famous town of mansoul  prof  that i will  and i know that my lords that are there will be glad to hear it and to see you also  so after a few more such kind of compliments mr profane took his leave of his friend cerberus and cerberus again with a thousand of their pitwishes bid him haste with all speed to his masters the which when he had heard he made obeisance and began to gather up his heels to run  thus therefore he returned and went and came to mansoul and going as afore to the house of mr mischief there he found the diabolonians assembled and waiting for his return  now when he was come and had presented himself he also delivered to them his letter and adjoined this compliment to them therewith  my lords from the confines of the pit the high and mighty principalities and powers of the den salute you here the true diabolonians of the town of mansoul  wishing you always the most proper of their benedictions for the great service high attempts and brave achievements that you have put yourselves upon for the restoring to our prince diabolus the famous town of mansoul  this was therefore the present state of the miserable town of mansoul  she had offended her prince and he was gone she had encouraged the powers of hell by her foolishness to come against her to seek her utter destruction  true the town of mansoul was somewhat made sensible of her sin but the diabolonians were gotten into her bowels she cried but emmanuel was gone and her cries did not fetch him as yet again besides she knew not now whether ever or never he would return and come to his mansoul again nor did they know the power and industry of the enemy nor how forward they were to put in execution that plot of hell that they had devised against her  they did indeed still send petition after petition to the prince but he answered all with silence  they did neglect reformation and that was as diabolus would have it for he knew if they regarded iniquity in their heart their king would not hear their prayer they therefore did still grow weaker and weaker and were as a rolling thing before the whirlwind  they cried to their king for help and laid diabolonians in their bosoms  what therefore should a king do to them  yea there seemed now to be a mixture in mansoul the diabolonians and the mansoulians would walk the streets together  yea they began to seek their peace for they thought that since the sickness had been so mortal in mansoul it was in vain to go to handygripes with them  besides the weakness of mansoul was the strength of their enemies and the sins of mansoul the advantage of the diabolonians  the foes of mansoul did also now begin to promise themselves the town for a possession there was no great difference now betwixt mansoulians and diabolonians  both seemed to be masters of mansoul  yea the diabolonians increased and grew but the town of mansoul diminished greatly  there were more than eleven thousand men women and children that died by the sickness in mansoul  but now as shaddai would have it there was one whose name was mr prywell a great lover of the people of mansoul  and he as his manner was did go listening up and down in mansoul to see and to hear if at any time he might whether there was any design against it or no  for he was always a jealous man and feared some mischief sometime would befal it either from the diabolonians within or from some power without  now upon a time it so happened as mr prywell went listening here and there that he lighted upon a place called vilehill in mansoul where diabolonians used to meet so hearing a muttering you must know that it was in the night he softly drew near to hear nor had he stood long under the houseend for there stood a house there but he heard one confidently affirm that it was not or would not be long before diabolus should possess himself again of mansoul and that then the diabolonians did intend to put all mansoulians to the sword and would kill and destroy the kings captains and drive all his soldiers out of the town  he said moreover that he knew there were above twenty thousand fighting men prepared by diabolus for the accomplishing of this design and that it would not be months before they all should see it  when mr prywell had heard this story he did quickly believe it was true  wherefore he went forthwith to my lord mayors house and acquainted him therewith who sending for the subordinate preacher brake the business to him and he as soon gave the alarm to the town for he was now the chief preacher in mansoul because as yet my lord secretary was ill at ease  and this was the way that the subordinate preacher did take to alarm the town therewith the same hour he caused the lecture bell to be rung so the people came together  he gave them then a short exhortation to watchfulness and made mr prywells news the argument thereof for said he an horrible plot is contrived against mansoul even to massacre us all in a day nor is this story to be slighted for mr prywell is the author thereof  mr prywell was always a lover of mansoul a sober and judicious man a man that is no tattler nor raiser of false reports but one that loves to look into the very bottom of matters and talks nothing of news but by very solid arguments  i will call him and you shall hear him your own selves so he called him and he came and told his tale so punctually and affirmed its truth with such ample grounds that mansoul fell presently under a conviction of the truth of what he said  the preacher did also back him saying sirs it is not irrational for us to believe it for we have provoked shaddai to anger and have sinned emmanuel out of the town we have had too much correspondence with diabolonians and have forsaken our former mercies  no marvel then if the enemy both within and without should design and plot our ruin and what time like this to do it the sickness is now in the town and we have been made weak thereby  many a good meaning man is dead and the diabolonians of late grow stronger and stronger  besides quoth the subordinate preacher i have received from this good truthteller this one inkling further that he understood by those that he overheard that several letters have lately passed between the furies and the diabolonians in order to our destruction  when mansoul heard all this and not being able to gainsay it they lift up their voice and wept  mr prywell did also in the presence of the townsmen confirm all that their subordinate preacher had said  wherefore they now set afresh to bewail their folly and to a doubling of petitions to shaddai and his son  they also brake the business to the captains high commanders and men of war in the town of mansoul entreating them to use the means to be strong and to take good courage and that they would look after their harness and make themselves ready to give diabolus battle by night and by day shall he come as they are informed he will to beleaguer the town of mansoul  when the captains heard this they being always true lovers of the town of mansoul what do they but like so many samsons they shake themselves and come together to consult and contrive how to defeat those bold and hellish contrivances that were upon the wheel by the means of diabolus and his friends against the now sickly weakly and much impoverished town of mansoul and they agreed upon these following particulars  1 that the gates of mansoul should be kept shut and made fast with bars and locks and that all persons that went out or came in should be very strictly examined by the captains of the guards to the end said they that those that are managers of the plot amongst us may either coming or going be taken and that we may also find out who are the great contrivers amongst us of our ruin  2 the next thing was that a strict search should be made for all kind of diabolonians throughout the whole town of mansoul and that every mans house from top to bottom should be looked into and that too house by house that if possible a further discovery might be made of all such among them as had a hand in these designs  3 it was further concluded upon that wheresoever or with whomsoever any of the diabolonians were found that even those of the town of mansoul that had given them house and harbour should to their shame and the warning of others take penance in the open place  4 it was moreover resolved by the famous town of mansoul that a public fast and a day of humiliation should be kept throughout the whole corporation to the justifying of their prince the abasing of themselves before him for their transgressions against him and against shaddai his father  it was further resolved that all such in mansoul as did not on that day endeavour to keep that fast and to humble themselves for their faults but that should mind their worldly employs or be found wandering up and down the streets should be taken for diabolonians and should suffer as diabolonians for such their wicked doings  5 it was further concluded then that with what speed and with what warmth of mind they could they would renew their humiliation for sin and their petitions to shaddai for help they also resolved to send tidings to the court of all that mr prywell had told them  6 it was also determined that thanks should be given by the town of mansoul to mr prywell for his diligent seeking of the welfare of their town  and further that forasmuch as he was so naturally inclined to seek their good and also to undermine their foes they gave him a commission of scoutmastergeneral for the good of the town of mansoul  when the corporation with their captains had thus concluded they did as they had said they shut up their gates they made for diabolonians strict search they made those with whom any were found to take penance in the open place  they kept their fast and renewed their petitions to their prince and mr prywell managed his charge and the trust that mansoul had put in his hands with great conscience and good fidelity for he gave himself wholly up to his employ and that not only within the town but he went out to pry to see and to hear  and not many days after he provided for his journey and went towards hellgate hill into the country where the doubters were where he heard of all that had been talked of in mansoul and he perceived also that diabolus was almost ready for his march etc so he came back with speed and calling the captains and elders of mansoul together he told them where he had been what he had heard and what he had seen  particularly he told them that diabolus was almost ready for his march and that he had made old mr incredulity that once brake prison in mansoul the general of his army that his army consisted all of doubters and that their number was above twenty thousand  he told moreover that diabolus did intend to bring with him the chief princes of the infernal pit and that he would make them chief captains over his doubters  he told them moreover that it was certainly true that several of the black den would with diabolus ride reformades to reduce the town of mansoul to the obedience of diabolus their prince  he said moreover that he understood by the doubters among whom he had been that the reason why old incredulity was made general of the whole army was because none truer than he to the tyrant and because he had an implacable spite against the welfare of the town of mansoul  besides said he he remembers the affronts that mansoul has given him and he is resolved to be revenged of them  but the black princes shall be made high commanders only incredulity shall be over them all because which i had almost forgot he can more easily and more dexterously beleaguer the town of mansoul than can any of the princes besides  now when the captains of mansoul with the elders of the town had heard the tidings that mr prywell did bring they thought it expedient without further delay to put into execution the laws that against the diabolonians their prince had made for them and given them in commandment to manage against them  wherefore forthwith a diligent and impartial search was made in all houses in mansoul for all and all manner of diabolonians  now in the house of mr mind and in the house of the great lord willbewill were two diabolonians found  in mr minds house was one lord covetousness found but he had changed his name to prudentthrifty in my lord willbewills house one lasciviousness was found but he had changed his name to harmlessmirth  these two the captains and elders of the town of mansoul took and committed them to custody under the hand of mr trueman the gaoler and this man handled them so severely and loaded them so well with irons that in time they both fell into a very deep consumption and died in the prisonhouse their masters also according to the agreement of the captains and elders were brought to take penance in the open place to their shame and for a warning to the rest of the town of mansoul  now this was the manner of penance in those days  the persons offending being made sensible of the evil of their doings were enjoined open confession of their faults and a strict amendment of their lives  after this the captains and elders of mansoul sought yet to find out more diabolonians wherever they lurked whether in dens caves holes vaults or where else they could in or about the wall or town of mansoul  but though they could plainly see their footing and so follow them by their track and smell to their holds even to the mouths of their caves and dens yet take them hold them and do justice upon them they could not their ways were so crooked their holds so strong and they so quick to take sanctuary there  but mansoul did now with so stiff an hand rule over the diabolonians that were left that they were glad to shrink into corners  time was when they durst walk openly and in the day but now they were forced to embrace privacy and the night  time was when a mansoulian was their companion but now they counted them deadly enemies  this good change did mr prywells intelligence make in the famous town of mansoul  by this time diabolus had finished his army which he intended to bring with him for the ruin of mansoul and had set over them captains and other field officers such as liked his furious stomach best  himself was lord paramount incredulity was general of his army their highest captains shall be named afterwards but now for their officers colours and scutcheons  1 their first captain was captain rage  he was captain over the election doubters his were the red colours his standardbearer was mr destructive and the great red dragon he had for his scutcheon  2 the second captain was captain fury  he was captain over the vocation doubters his standardbearer was mr darkness his colours were those that were pale and he had for his scutcheon the fiery flying serpent  3 the third captain was captain damnation  he was captain over the grace doubters his were the red colours mr nolife bare them and he had for his scutcheon the black den  4 the fourth captain was captain insatiable he was captain over the faith doubters  his were the red colours mr devourer bare them and he had for a scutcheon the yawning jaws  5 the fifth captain was captain brimstone  he was captain over the perseverance doubters his also were the red colours mr burning bare them and his scutcheon was the blue and stinking flame  6 the sixth captain was captain torment  he was captain over the resurrection doubters his colours were those that were pale mr gnaw was his standardbearer and he had the black worm for his scutcheon  7 the seventh captain was captain noease he was captain over the salvation doubters his were the red colours mr restless bare them and his scutcheon was the ghastly picture of death  8 the eighth captain was the captain sepulchre  he was captain over the glory doubters his also were the pale colours mr corruption was his standardbearer and he had for his scutcheon a skull and dead mens bones  9 the ninth captain was captain pasthope he was captain of those that are called the felicity doubters his standardbearer was mr despair his also were the red colours and his scutcheon was a hot iron and the hard heart  these were his captains and these were their forces these were their standards these were their colours and these were their scutcheons  now over these did the great diabolus make superior captains and they were in number seven  as namely the lord beelzebub the lord lucifer the lord legion the lord apollyon the lord python the lord cerberus and the lord belial these seven he set over the captains and incredulity was lordgeneral and diabolus was king  the reformades also such as were like themselves were made some of them captains of hundreds and some of them captains of more  and thus was the army of incredulity completed  so they set out at hellgate hill for there they had their rendezvous from whence they came with a straight course upon their march toward the town of mansoul  now as was hinted before the town had as shaddai would have it received from the mouth of mr prywell the alarm of their coming before  wherefore they set a strong watch at the gates and had also doubled their guards  they also mounted their slings in good places where they might conveniently cast out their great stones to the annoyance of their furious enemy  nor could those diabolonians that were in the town do that hurt as was designed they should for mansoul was now awake  but alas poor people they were sorely affrighted at the first appearance of their foes and at their sitting down before the town especially when they heard the roaring of their drum  this to speak truth was amazingly hideous to hear it frighted all men seven miles round if they were but awake and heard it  the streaming of their colours was also terrible and dejecting to behold  when diabolus was come up against the town first he made his approach to eargate and gave it a furious assault supposing as it seems that his friends in mansoul had been ready to do the work within but care was taken of that before by the vigilance of the captains  wherefore missing of the help that he expected from them and finding his army warmly attended with the stones that the slingers did sling for that i will say for the captains that considering the weakness that yet was upon them by reason of the long sickness that had annoyed the town of mansoul they did gallantly behave themselves he was forced to make some retreat from mansoul and to entrench himself and his men in the field without the reach of the slings of the town  now having entrenched himself he did cast up four mounts against the town  the first he called mount diabolus putting his own name thereon the more to affright the town of mansoul the other three he called thusmount alecto mount megara and mount tisiphone for these are the names of the dreadful furies of hell  thus he began to play his game with mansoul and to serve it as doth the lion his prey even to make it fall before his terror  but as i said the captains and soldiers resisted so stoutly and did do such execution with their stones that they made him though against stomach to retreat wherefore mansoul began to take courage  now upon mount diabolus which was raised on the north side of the town there did the tyrant set up his standard and a fearful thing it was to behold for he had wrought in it by devilish art after the manner of a scutcheon a flaming flame fearful to behold and the picture of mansoul burning in it  when diabolus had thus done he commanded that his drummer should every night approach the walls of the town of mansoul and so to beat a parley the command was to do it at nights for in the daytime they annoyed him with their slings for the tyrant said that he had a mind to parley with the now trembling town of mansoul and he commanded that the drums should beat every night that through weariness they might at last if possible at the first they were unwilling yet be forced to do it  so this drummer did as commanded  he arose and did beat his drum but when his drum did go if one looked toward the town of mansoul behold darkness and sorrow and the light was darkened in the heaven thereof  no noise was ever heard upon earth more terrible except the voice of shaddai when he speaketh  but how did mansoul tremble it now looked for nothing but forthwith to be swallowed up  when this drummer had beaten for a parley he made this speech to mansoul  my master has bid me tell you that if you will willingly submit you shall have the good of the earth but if you shall be stubborn he is resolved to take you by force  but by that the fugitive had done beating his drum the people of mansoul had betaken themselves to the captains that were in the castle so that there was none to regard nor to give this drummer an answer so he proceeded no further that night but returned again to his master to the camp  when diabolus saw that by drumming he could not work out mansoul to his will the next night he sendeth his drummer without his drum still to let the townsmen know that he had a mind to parley with them  but when all came to all his parley was turned into a summons to the town to deliver up themselves  but they gave him neither heed nor hearing  for they remembered what at first it cost them to hear him a few words  the next night he sends again and then who should be his messenger to mansoul but the terrible captain sepulchre so captain sepulchre came up to the walls of mansoul and made this oration to the town  o ye inhabitants of the rebellious town of mansoul  i summon you in the name of the prince diabolus that without any more ado you set open the gates of your town and admit the great lord to come in  but if you shall still rebel when we have taken to us the town by force we will swallow you up as the grave wherefore if you will hearken to my summons say so and if not then let me know  the reason of this my summons quoth he is for that my lord is your undoubted prince and lord as you yourselves have formerly owned  nor shall that assault that was given to my lord when emmanuel dealt so dishonourably by him prevail with him to lose his right and to forbear to attempt to recover his own  consider then o mansoul with thyself wilt thou show thyself peaceable or no  if thou shalt quietly yield up thyself then our old friendship shall be renewed but if thou shalt yet refuse and rebel then expect nothing but fire and sword  when the languishing town of mansoul had heard this summoner and his summons they were yet more put to their dumps but made to the captain no answer at all so away he went as he came  but after some consultation among themselves as also with some of their captains they applied themselves afresh to the lord secretary for counsel and advice from him for this lord secretary was their chief preacher as also is mentioned some pages before only now he was ill at ease and of him they begged favour in these two or three things   1 that he would look comfortably upon them and not keep himself so much retired from them as formerly  also that he would be prevailed with to give them a hearing while they should make known their miserable condition to him  but to this he told them as before that as yet he was but ill at ease and therefore could not do as he had formerly done  2 the second thing that they desired was that he would be pleased to give them his advice about their now so important affairs for that diabolus was come and set down before the town with no less than twenty thousand doubters  they said moreover that both he and his captains were cruel men and that they were afraid of them but to this he said you must look to the law of the prince and there see what is laid upon you to do  3 then they desired that his highness would help them to frame a petition to shaddai and unto emmanuel his son and that he would set his own hand thereto as a token that he was one with them in it  for said they my lord many a one have we sent but can get no answer of peace but now surely one with thy hand unto it may obtain good for mansoul  but all the answer that he gave to this was that they had offended their emmanuel and had also grieved himself and that therefore they must as yet partake of their own devices  this answer of the lord secretary fell like a millstone upon them yea it crushed them so that they could not tell what to do yet they durst not comply with the demands of diabolus nor with the demands of his captain  so then here were the straits that the town of mansoul was betwixt when the enemy came upon her  her foes were ready to swallow her up and her friends did forbear to help her  then stood up my lord mayor whose name was my lord understanding and he began to pick and pick until he had picked comfort out of that seemingly bitter saying of the lord secretary for thus he descanted upon it  first said he this unavoidably follows upon the saying of my lord that we must yet suffer for our sins secondly but quoth he the words yet sound as if at last we should be saved from our enemies and that after a few more sorrows emmanuel will come and be our help  now the lord mayor was the more critical in his dealing with the secretarys words because my lord was more than a prophet and because none of his words were such but that at all times they were most exactly significant and the townsmen were allowed to pry into them and to expound them to their best advantage  so they took their leaves of my lord and returned and went and came to the captains to whom they did tell what my lord high secretary had said who when they had heard it were all of the same opinion as was my lord mayor himself  the captains therefore began to take some courage unto them and to prepare to make some brave attempt upon the camp of the enemy and to destroy all that were diabolonians with the roving doubters that the tyrant had brought with him to destroy the poor town of mansoul  so all betook themselves forthwith to their placesthe captains to theirs the lord mayor to his the subordinate preacher to his and my lord willbewill to his  the captains longed to be at some work for their prince for they delighted in warlike achievements  the next day therefore they came together and consulted and after consultation had they resolved to give an answer to the captain of diabolus with slings and so they did at the rising of the sun on the morrow for diabolus had adventured to come nearer again but the slingstones were to him and his like hornets  for as there is nothing to the town of mansoul so terrible as the roaring of diaboluss drum so there is nothing to diabolus so terrible as the well playing of emmanuels slings  wherefore diabolus was forced to make another retreat yet further off from the famous town of mansoul  then did the lord mayor of mansoul cause the bells to be rung and that thanks should be sent to the lord high secretary by the mouth of the subordinate preacher for that by his words the captains and elders of mansoul had been strengthened against diabolus  when diabolus saw that his captains and soldiers high lords and renowned were frightened and beaten down by the stones that came from the golden slings of the prince of the town of mansoul he bethought himself and said i will try to catch them by fawning i will try to flatter them into my net  wherefore after a while he came down again to the wall not now with his drum nor with captain sepulchre but having all besugared his lips he seemed to be a very sweetmouthed peaceable prince designing nothing for humours sake nor to be revenged on mansoul for injuries by them done to him but the welfare and good and advantage of the town and people therein was now as he said his only design  wherefore after he had called for audience and desired that the townsfolk would give it to him he proceeded in his oration and said  oh the desire of my heart the famous town of mansoul how many nights have i watched and how many weary steps have i taken if perhaps i might do thee good  far be it far be it from me to desire to make a war upon you if ye will but willingly and quietly deliver up yourselves unto me  you know that you were mine of old remember also that so long as you enjoyed me for your lord and that i enjoyed you for my subjects you wanted for nothing of all the delights of the earth that i your lord and prince could get for you or that i could invent to make you bonny and blithe withal  consider you never had so many hard dark troublesome and heartafflicting hours while you were mine as you have had since you revolted from me nor shall you ever have peace again until you and i become one as before  but be but prevailed with to embrace me again and i will grant yea enlarge your old charter with abundance of privileges so that your license and liberty shall be to take hold enjoy and make your own all that is pleasant from the east to the west  nor shall any of those incivilities wherewith you have offended me be ever charged upon you by me so long as the sun and moon endure  nor shall any of those dear friends of mine that now for the fear of you lie lurking in dens and holes and caves in mansoul be hurtful to you any more yea they shall be your servants and shall minister unto you of their substance and of whatever shall come to hand  i need speak no more you know them and have sometime since been much delighted in their company  why then should we abide at such odds  let us renew our old acquaintance and friendship again  bear with your friend i take the liberty at this time to speak thus freely unto you  the love that i have to you presses me to do it as also does the zeal of my heart for my friends with you  put me not therefore to further trouble nor yourselves to further fears and frights  have you i will in a way of peace or war nor do you flatter yourselves with the power and force of your captains or that your emmanuel will shortly come in to your help for such strength will do you no pleasure  i am come against you with a stout and valiant army and all the chief princes of the den are even at the head of it  besides my captains are swifter than eagles stronger than lions and more greedy of prey than are the evening wolves  what is og of bashan what is goliath of gath and what are an hundred more of them to one of the least of my captains  how then shall mansoul think to escape my hand and force  diabolus having thus handed his flattering fawning deceitful and lying speech to the famous town of mansoul the lord mayor replied to him as follows  o diabolus prince of darkness and master of all deceit thy lying flatteries we have had and made sufficient probation of and have tasted too deeply of that destructive cup already  should we therefore again hearken unto thee and so break the commandments of our great shaddai to join in affinity with thee would not our prince reject us and cast us off for ever and being cast off by him can the place that he has prepared for thee be a place of rest for us  besides o thou that art empty and void of all truth we are rather ready to die by thy hand than to fall in with thy flattering and lying deceits  when the tyrant saw that there was little to be got by parleying with my lord mayor he fell into an hellish rage and resolved that again with his army of doubters he would another time assault the town of mansoul  so he called for his drummer who beat up for his men and while he did beat mansoul did shake to be in a readiness to give battle to the corporation  then diabolus drew near with his army and thus disposed of his men  captain cruel and captain torment these he drew up and placed against feelgate and commanded them to sit down there for the war  and he also appointed that if need were captain noease should come in to their relief  at nosegate he placed the captain brimstone and captain sepulchre and bid them look well to their ward on that side of the town of mansoul  but at eyegate he placed that grimfaced one the captain pasthope and there also now he did set up his terrible standard  now captain insatiable he was to look to the carriages of diabolus and was also appointed to take into custody that or those persons and things that should at any time as prey be taken from the enemy  now mouthgate the inhabitants of mansoul kept for a sallyport wherefore that they kept strong for that it was it by and out at which the townsfolk did send their petitions to emmanuel their prince  that also was the gate from the top of which the captains did play their slings at the enemies for that gate stood somewhat ascending so that the placing of them there and the letting of them fly from that place did much execution against the tyrants army  wherefore for these causes with others diabolus sought if possible to land up mouthgate with dirt  now as diabolus was busy and industrious in preparing to make his assault upon the town of mansoul without so the captains and soldiers in the corporation were as busy in preparing within they mounted their slings they set up their banners they sounded their trumpets and put themselves in such order as was judged most for the annoyance of the enemy and for the advantage of mansoul and gave to their soldiers orders to be ready at the sound of the trumpet for war  the lord willbewill also he took the charge of watching against the rebels within and to do what he could to take them while without or to stifle them within their caves dens and holes in the townwall of mansoul  and to speak the truth of him ever since he took penance for his fault he has showed as much honesty and bravery of spirit as any he in mansoul for he took one jolly and his brother griggish the two sons of his servant harmlessmirth for to that day though the father was committed to ward the sons had a dwelling in the house of my lordi say he took them and with his own hands put them to the cross  and this was the reason why he hanged them up  after their father was put into the hands of mr trueman the gaoler they his sons began to play his pranks and to be ticking and toying with the daughters of their lord nay it was jealoused that they were too familiar with them the which was brought to his lordships ear now his lordship being unwilling unadvisedly to put any man to death did not suddenly fall upon them but set watch and spies to see if the thing was true of the which he was soon informed for his two servants whose names were findout and tellall catched them together in uncivil manner more than once or twice and went and told their lord  so when my lord willbewill had sufficient ground to believe the thing was true he takes the two young diabolonians for such they were for their father was a diabolonian born and has them to eyegate where he raised a very high cross just in the face of diabolus and of his army and there he hanged the young villains in defiance to captain past hope and of the horrible standard of the tyrant  now this christian act of the brave lord willbewill did greatly abash captain pasthope discouraged the army of diabolus put fear into the diabolonian runagates in mansoul and put strength and courage into the captains that belonged to emmanuel the prince for they without did gather and that by this very act of my lord that mansoul was resolved to fight and that the diabolonians within the town could not do such things as diabolus had hopes they would  nor was this the only proof of the brave lord willbewills honesty to the town nor of his loyalty to his prince as will afterwards appear  now when the children of prudentthrifty who dwelt with mr mind for thrift left children with mr mind when he was also committed to prison and their names were gripe and rakeall these he begat of mr minds bastard daughter whose name was mrs holdfast badi say when his children perceived how the lord willbewill had served them that dwelt with him what do they but lest they should drink of the same cup endeavour to make their escape  but mr mind being wary of it took them and put them in hold in his house till morning for this was done over night and remembering that by the law of mansoul all diabolonians were to die and to be sure they were at least by fathers side such and some say by mothers side too what does he but takes them and puts them in chains and carries them to the selfsame place where my lord hanged his two before and there he hanged them  the townsmen also took great encouragement at this act of mr mind and did what they could to have taken some more of these diabolonian troublers of mansoul but at that time the rest lay so squat and close that they could not be apprehended so they set against them a diligent watch and went every man to his place  i told you a little before that diabolus and his army were somewhat abashed and discouraged at the sight of what my lord willbewill did when he hanged up those two young diabolonians but his discouragement quickly turned itself into furious madness and rage against the town of mansoul and fight it he would  also the townsmen and captains within they had their hopes and their expectations heightened believing at last the day would be theirs so they feared them the less  their subordinate preacher too made a sermon about it and he took that theme for his text gad a troop shall overcome him  but he shall overcome at the last whence he showed that though mansoul should be sorely put to it at the first yet the victory should most certainly be mansouls at the last  so diabolus commanded that his drummer should beat a charge against the town and the captains also that were in the town sounded a charge against them but they had no drum  they were trumpets of silver with which they sounded against them  then they which were of the camp of diabolus came down to the town to take it and the captains in the castle with the slingers at mouthgate played upon them amain  and now there was nothing heard in the camp of diabolus but horrible rage and blasphemy but in the town good words prayer and singing of psalms  the enemy replied with horrible objections and the terribleness of their drum but the town made answer with the slapping of their slings and the melodious noise of their trumpets  and thus the fight lasted for several days together only now and then they had some small intermission in the which the townsmen refreshed themselves and the captains made ready for another assault  the captains of emmanuel were clad in silver armour and the soldiers in that which was of proof the soldiers of diabolus were clad in iron which was made to give place to emmanuels engine shot  in the town some were hurt and some were greatly wounded now the worst of it was a chirurgeon was scarce in mansoul for that emmanuel at present was absent  howbeit with the leaves of a tree the wounded were kept from dying yet their wounds did greatly putrefy and some did grievously stink  of the townsmen these were wounded namely my lord reason he was wounded in the head another that was wounded was the brave lord mayor he was wounded in the eye  another that was wounded was mr mind he received his wound about the stomach  the honest subordinate preacher also he received a shot not far off the heart but none of these were mortal  many also of the inferior sort were not only wounded but slain outright  now in the camp of diabolus were wounded and slain a considerable number for instance captain rage he was wounded and so was captain cruel  captain damnation was made to retreat and to intrench himself further off of mansoul  the standard also of diabolus was beaten down and his standardbearer captain much hurt had his brains beat out with a slingstone to the no little grief and shame of his prince diabolus  many also of the doubters were slain outright though enough of them were left alive to make mansoul shake and totter  now the victory that day being turned to mansoul did put great valour into the townsmen and captains and did cover diaboluss camp with a cloud but withal it made them far more furious  so the next day mansoul rested and commanded that the bells should be rung the trumpets also joyfully sounded and the captains shouted round the town  my lord willbewill also was not idle but did notable service within against the domestics or the diabolonians that were in the town not only by keeping them in awe for he lighted on one at last whose name was mr anything a fellow of whom mention was made before for it was he if you remember that brought the three fellows to diabolus whom the diabolonians took out of captain boanergess companies and that persuaded them to list themselves under the tyrant to fight against the army of shaddai  my lord willbewill did also take a notable diabolonian whose name was loosefoot  this loosefoot was a scout to the vagabonds in mansoul and that did use to carry tidings out of mansoul to the camp and out of the camp to those of the enemies in mansoul  both these my lord sent away safe to mr trueman the gaoler with a commandment to keep them in irons for he intended then to have them out to be crucified when it would be for the best to the corporation and most for the discouragement of the camp of the enemies  my lord mayor also though he could not stir about so much as formerly because of the wound that he lately received yet gave he out orders to all that were the natives of mansoul to look to their watch and stand upon their guard and as occasion should offer to prove themselves men  mr conscience the preacher he also did his utmost to keep all his good documents alive upon the hearts of the people of mansoul  well awhile after the captains and stout ones of the town of mansoul agreed and resolved upon a time to make a sally out upon the camp of diabolus and this must be done in the night and there was the folly of mansoul for the night is always the best for the enemy but the worst for mansoul to fight in but yet they would do it their courage was so high their last victory also still stuck in their memories  so the night appointed being come the princes brave captains cast lots who should lead the van in this new and desperate expedition against diabolus and against his diabolonian army and the lot fell to captain credence to captain experience and to captain goodhope to lead the forlorn hope  this captain experience the prince created such when himself did reside in the town of mansoul  so as i said they made their sally out upon the army that lay in the siege against them and their hap was to fall in with the main body of their enemies  now diabolus and his men being expertly accustomed to nightwork took the alarm presently and were as ready to give them battle as if they had sent them word of their coming  wherefore to it they went amain and blows were hard on every side the hell drum also was beat most furiously while the trumpets of the prince most sweetly sounded and thus the battle was joined and captain insatiable looked to the enemys carriages and waited when he should receive some prey  the princes captains fought it stoutly beyond what indeed could be expected they should they wounded many they made the whole army of diabolus to make a retreat  but i cannot tell how but the brave captain credence captain goodhope and captain experience as they were upon the pursuit cutting down and following hard after the enemy in the rear captain credence stumbled and fell by which fall he caught so great a hurt that he could not rise till captain experience did help him up at which their men were put in disorder  the captain also was so full of pain that he could not forbear but aloud to cry out  at this the other two captains fainted supposing that captain credence had received his mortal wound their men also were more disordered and had no list to fight  now diabolus being very observing though at this time as yet he was put to the worst perceiving that a halt was made among the men that were the pursuers what does he but taking it for granted that the captains were either wounded or dead he therefore makes at first a stand then faces about and so comes up upon the princes army with as much of his fury as hell could help him to and his hap was to fall in just among the three captains captain credence captain goodhope and captain experience and did cut wound and pierce them so dreadfully that what through discouragement what through disorder and what through the wounds that they had received and also the loss of much blood they scarce were able though they had for their power the three best hands in mansoul to get safe into the hold again  now when the body of the princes army saw how these three captains were put to the worst they thought it their wisdom to make as safe and good a retreat as they could and so returned by the sallyport again and so there was an end of this present action  but diabolus was so flushed with this nights work that he promised himself in few days an easy and complete conquest over the town of mansoul wherefore on the day following he comes up to the sides thereof with great boldness and demands entrance and that forthwith they deliver themselves up to his government the diabolonians too that were within they began to be somewhat brisk as we shall show afterward  but the valiant lord mayor replied that what he got he must get by force for as long as emmanuel their prince was alive though he at present was not so with them as they wished they should never consent to yield mansoul up to another  and with that the lord willbewill stood up and said diabolus thou master of the den and enemy to all that is good we poor inhabitants of the town of mansoul are too well acquainted with thy rule and government and with the end of those things that for certain will follow submitting to thee to do it  wherefore though while we were without knowledge we suffered thee to take us as the bird that saw not the snare fell into the hands of the fowler yet since we have been turned from darkness to light we have also been turned from the power of satan to god  and though through thy subtlety and also the subtlety of the diabolonians within we have sustained much loss and also plunged ourselves into much perplexity yet give up ourselves lay down our arms and yield to so horrid a tyrant as thou we shall not die upon the place we choose rather to do  besides we have hopes that in time deliverance will come from court unto us and therefore we yet will maintain a war against thee  this brave speech of the lord willbewill with that also of the lord mayor did somewhat abate the boldness of diabolus though it kindled the fury of his rage  it also succoured the townsmen and captains yea it was as a plaster to the brave captain credences wound for you must know that a brave speech now when the captains of the town with their men of war came home routed and when the enemy took courage and boldness at the success that he had obtained to draw up to the walls and demand entrance as he did was in season and also advantageous  the lord willbewill also did play the man within for while the captains and soldiers were in the field he was in arms in the town and wherever by him there was a diabolonian found they were forced to feel the weight of his heavy hand and also the edge of his penetrating sword  many therefore of the diabolonians he wounded as the lord cavil the lord brisk the lord pragmatic and the lord murmur several also of the meaner sort he did sorely maim though there cannot at this time an account be given you of any that he slew outright  the cause or rather the advantage that my lord willbewill had at this time to do thus was for that the captains were gone out to fight the enemy in the field  for now thought the diabolonians within is our time to stir and make an uproar in the town  what do they therefore but quickly get themselves into a body and fall forthwith to hurricaning in mansoul as if now nothing but whirlwind and tempest should be there  wherefore as i said he takes this opportunity to fall in among them with his men cutting and slashing with courage that was undaunted at which the diabolonians with all haste dispersed themselves to their holds and my lord to his place as before  this brave act of my lord did somewhat revenge the wrong done by diabolus to the captains and also did let them know that mansoul was not to be parted with for the loss of a victory or two wherefore the wing of the tyrant was clipped again as to boastingi mean in comparison of what he would have done if the diabolonians had put the town to the same plight to which he had put the captains  well diabolus yet resolves to have the other bout with mansoul for thought he since i beat them once i may beat them twice wherefore he commanded his men to be ready at such an hour of the night to make a fresh assault upon the town and he gave it out in special that they should bend all their force against feelgate and attempt to break into the town through that  the word that then he did give to his officers and soldiers was hellfire and said he if we break in upon them as i wish we do either with some or with all our force let them that break in look to it that they forget not the word  and let nothing be heard in the town of mansoul but hellfire  hellfire hellfire  the drummer was also to beat without ceasing and the standardbearers were to display their colours the soldiers too were to put on what courage they could and to see that they played manfully their parts against the town  so when night was come and all things by the tyrant made ready for the work he suddenly makes his assault upon feelgate and after he had awhile struggled there he throws the gate wide open  for the truth is those gates were but weak and so most easily made to yield  when diabolus had thus far made his attempt he placed his captains namely torment and noease there so he attempted to press forward but the princes captains came down upon him and made his entrance more difficult than he desired  and to speak truth they made what resistance they could but the three of their best and most valiant captains being wounded and by their wounds made much incapable of doing the town that service they would and all the rest having more than their hands full of the doubters and their captains that did follow diabolus they were overpowered with force nor could they keep them out of the town  wherefore the princes men and their captains betook themselves to the castle as to the stronghold of the town  and this they did partly for their own security partly for the security of the town and partly or rather chiefly to preserve to emmanuel the prerogative royal of mansoul for so was the castle of mansoul  the captains therefore being fled into the castle the enemy without much resistance possess themselves of the rest of the town and spreading themselves as they went into every corner they cried out as they marched according to the command of the tyrant hellfire hellfire hellfire so that nothing for a while throughout the town of mansoul could be heard but the direful noise of hellfire together with the roaring of diaboluss drum  and now did the clouds hang black over mansoul nor to reason did anything but ruin seem to attend it  diabolus also quartered his soldiers in the houses of the inhabitants of the town of mansoul yea the subordinate preachers house was as full of these outlandish doubters as ever it could hold and so was my lord mayors and my lord willbewills also  yea where was there a corner a cottage a barn or a hogstye that now was not full of these vermin  yea they turned the men of the town out of their houses and would lie in their beds and sit at their tables themselves  ah poor mansoul now thou feelest the fruits of sin yea what venom was in the flattering words of mr carnalsecurity they made great havoc of whatever they laid their hands on yea they fired the town in several places many young children also were by them dashed in pieces and those that were yet unborn they destroyed in their mothers wombs  for you must needs think that it could not now be otherwise for what conscience what pity what bowels of compassion can any expect at the hands of outlandish doubters  many in mansoul that were women both young and old they forced ravished and beastlike abused so that they swooned miscarried and many of them died and so lay at the top of every street and in all byplaces of the town  and now did mansoul seem to be nothing but a den of dragons an emblem of hell and a place of total darkness  now did mansoul lie almost like the barren wilderness nothing but nettles briars thorns weeds and stinking things seemed now to cover the face of mansoul  i told you before how that these diabolonian doubters turned the men of mansoul out of their beds and now i will add they wounded them they mauled them yea and almost brained many of them  many did i say yea most if not all of them  mr conscience they so wounded yea and his wounds so festered that he could have no ease day nor night but lay as if continually upon a rack but that shaddai rules all certainly they had slain him outright  mr lord mayor they so abused that they almost put out his eyes and had not my lord willbewill got into the castle they intended to have chopped him all to pieces for they did look upon him as his heart now stood to be one of the very worst that was in mansoul against diabolus and his crew  and indeed he hath shown himself a man and more of his exploits you will hear of afterwards  now a man might have walked for days together in mansoul and scarcely have seen one in the town that looked like a religious man  oh the fearful state of mansoul now now every corner swarmed with outlandish doubters redcoats and blackcoats walked the town by clusters and filled up all the houses with hideous noises vain songs lying stories and blasphemous language against shaddai and his son  now also those diabolonians that lurked in the walls and dens and holes that were in the town of mansoul came forth and showed themselves yea walked with open face in company with the doubters that were in mansoul  yea they had more boldness now to walk the streets to haunt the houses and to show themselves abroad than had any of the honest inhabitants of the now woful town of mansoul  but diabolus and his outlandish men were not at peace in mansoul for they were not there entertained as were the captains and forces of emmanuel  the townsmen did browbeat them what they could nor did they partake or make stroy of any of the necessaries of mansoul but that which they seized on against the townsmens will what they could they hid from them and what they could not they had with an illwill  they poor hearts had rather have had their room than their company but they were at present their captives and their captives for the present they were forced to be  but i say they discountenanced them as much as they were able and showed them all the dislike that they could  the captains also from the castle did hold them in continual play with their slings to the chafing and fretting of the minds of the enemies  true diabolus made a great many attempts to have broken open the gates of the castle but mr godlyfear was made the keeper of that and he was a man of that courage conduct and valour that it was in vain as long as life lasted within him to think to do that work though mostly desired wherefore all the attempts that diabolus made against him were fruitless  i have wished sometimes that that man had had the whole rule of the town of mansoul  well this was the condition of the town of mansoul for about two years and a half  the body of the town was the seat of war the people of the town were driven into holes and the glory of mansoul was laid in the dust  what rest then could be to the inhabitants what peace could mansoul have and what sun could shine upon it  had the enemy lain so long without in the plain against the town it had been enough to have famished them  but now when they shall be within when the town shall be their tent their trench and fort against the castle that was in the town when the town shall be against the town and shall serve to be a defence to the enemies of her strength and life  i say when they shall make use of the forts and townholds to secure themselves in even till they shall take spoil and demolish the castlethis was terrible and yet this was now the state of the town of mansoul  after the town of mansoul had been in this sad and lamentable condition for so long a time as i have told you and no petitions that they presented their prince with all this while could prevail the inhabitants of the town namely the elders and chief of mansoul gathered together and after some time spent in condoling their miserable state and this miserable judgment coming upon them they agreed together to draw up yet another petition and to send it away to emmanuel for relief  but mr godlyfear stood up and answered that he knew that his lord the prince never did nor ever would receive a petition for these matters from the hand of any whoever unless the lord secretarys hand was to it and this quoth he is the reason that you prevailed not all this while  then they said they would draw up one and get the lord secretarys hand unto it  but mr godlyfear answered again that he knew also that the lord secretary would not set his hand to any petition that himself had not an hand in composing and drawing up  and besides said he the prince doth know my lord secretarys hand from all the hands in the world wherefore he cannot be deceived by any pretence whatever  wherefore my advice is that you go to my lord and implore him to lend you his aid now he did yet abide in the castle where all the captains and menatarms were  so they heartily thanked mr godlyfear took his counsel and did as he had bidden them  so they went and came to my lord and made known the cause of their coming to him namely that since mansoul was in so deplorable a condition his highness would be pleased to undertake to draw up a petition for them to emmanuel the son of the mighty shaddai and to their king and his father by him  then said the secretary to them what petition is it that you would have me draw up for you  but they said our lord knows best the state and condition of the town of mansoul and how we are backslidden and degenerated from the prince  thou also knowest who is come up to war against us and how mansoul is now the seat of war  my lord knows moreover what barbarous usages our men women and children have suffered at their hands and how our homebred diabolonians do walk now with more boldness than dare the townsmen in the streets of mansoul  let our lord therefore according to the wisdom of god that is in him draw up a petition for his poor servants to our prince emmanuel  well said the lord secretary i will draw up a petition for you and will also set my hand thereto  then said they but when shall we call for it at the hands of our lord  but he answered yourselves must be present at the doing of it yea you must put your desires to it true the hand and pen shall be mine but the ink and paper must be yours else how can you say it is your petition  nor have i need to petition for myself because i have not offended he also added as followeth  no petition goes from me in my name to the prince and so to his father by him but when the people that are chiefly concerned therein do join in heart and soul in the matter for that must be inserted therein  so they did heartily agree with the sentence of the lord and a petition was forthwith drawn up for them  but now who should carry it that was next  but the secretary advised that captain credence should carry it for he was a wellspoken man  they therefore called for him and propounded to him the business well said the captain i gladly accept of the motion and though i am lame i will do this business for you with as much speed and as well as i can  the contents of the petition were to this purpose  o our lord and sovereign prince emmanuel the potent the long suffering prince grace is poured into thy lips and to thee belong mercy and forgiveness though we have rebelled against thee  we who are no more worthy to be called thy mansoul nor yet fit to partake of common benefits do beseech thee and thy father by thee to do away our transgressions  we confess that thou mightest cast us away for them but do it not for thy names sake  let the lord rather take an opportunity at our miserable condition to let out his bowels and compassions to us  we are compassed on every side lord our own backslidings reprove us our diabolonians within our town fright us and the army of the angel of the bottomless pit distresses us  thy grace can be our salvation and whither to go but to thee we know not  furthermore o gracious prince we have weakened our captains and they are discouraged sick and of late some of them grievously worsted and beaten out of the field by the power and force of the tyrant  yea even those of our captains in whose valour we did formerly use to put most of our confidence they are as wounded men  besides lord our enemies are lively and they are strong they vaunt and boast themselves and do threaten to part us among themselves for a booty  they are fallen also upon us lord with many thousand doubters such as with whom we cannot tell what to do they are all grimlooked and unmerciful ones and they bid defiance to us and thee  our wisdom is gone our power is gone because thou art departed from us nor have we what we may call ours but sin shame and confusion of face for sin  take pity upon us o lord take pity upon us thy miserable town of mansoul and save us out of the hands of our enemies  amen  this petition as was touched afore was handed by the lord secretary and carried to the court by the brave and most stout captain credence  now he carried it out at mouthgate for that as i said was the sallyport of the town and he went and came to emmanuel with it  now how it came out i do not know but for certain it did and that so far as to reach the ears of diabolus thus i conclude because that the tyrant had it presently by the end and charged the town of mansoul with it saying thou rebellious and stubbornhearted mansoul i will make thee to leave off petitioning  art thou yet for petitioning  i will make thee to leave  yea he also knew who the messenger was that carried the petition to the prince and it made him both to fear and rage  wherefore he commanded that his drum should be beat again a thing that mansoul could not abide to hear  but when diabolus will have his drum beat mansoul must abide the noise  well the drum was beat and the diabolonians were gathered together  then said diabolus o ye stout diabolonians be it known unto you that there is treachery hatched against us in the rebellious town of mansoul for albeit the town is in our possession as you see yet these miserable mansoulians have attempted to dare and have been so hardy as yet to send to the court to emmanuel for help this i give you to understand that ye may yet know how to carry it to the wretched town of mansoul  wherefore o my trusty diabolonians i command that yet more and more ye distress this town of mansoul and vex it with your wiles ravish their women deflower their virgins slay their children brain their ancients fire their town and what other mischief you can and let this be the reward of the mansoulians from me for their desperate rebellions against me  this you see was the charge but something stepped in betwixt that and execution for as yet there was but little more done than to rage  moreover when diabolus had done thus he went the next way up to the castle gates and demanded that upon pain of death the gates should be opened to him and that entrance should be given him and his men that followed after  to whom mr godlyfear replied for he it was that had the charge of that gate that the gate should not be opened unto him nor to the men that followed after him  he said moreover that mansoul when she had suffered awhile should be made perfect strengthened settled  then said diabolus deliver me then the men that have petitioned against me especially captain credence that carried it to your prince deliver that varlet into my hands and i will depart from the town  then up starts a diabolonian whose name was mr fooling and said my lord offereth you fair  it is better for you that one man perish than that your whole mansoul should be undone  but mr godlyfear made him this replication how long will mansoul be kept out of the dungeon when she hath given up her faith to diabolus  as good lose the town as lose captain credence for if one be gone the other must follow  but to that mr fooling said nothing  then did my lord mayor reply and said o thou devouring tyrant be it known unto thee we shall hearken to none of thy words we are resolved to resist thee as long as a captain a man a sling and a stone to throw at thee shall be found in the town of mansoul  but diabolus answered do you hope do you wait do you look for help and deliverance  you have sent to emmanuel but your wickedness sticks too close in your skirts to let innocent prayers come out of your lips  think you that you shall be prevailers and prosper in this design  you will fail in your wish you will fail in your attempts for it is not only i but your emmanuel is against you  yea it is he that hath sent me against you to subdue you  for what then do you hope or by what means will you escape  then said the lord mayor we have sinned indeed but that shall be no help to thee for our emmanuel hath said it and that in great faithfulness and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out  he hath also told us o our enemy that all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to the sons of men  therefore we dare not despair but will look for wait for and hope for deliverance still  now by this time captain credence was returned and come from the court from emmanuel to the castle of mansoul and he returned to them with a packet  so my lord mayor hearing that captain credence was come withdrew himself from the noise of the roaring of the tyrant and left him to yell at the wall of the town or against the gates of the castle  so he came up to the captains lodgings and saluting him he asked him of his welfare and what was the best news at court  but when he asked captain credence that the water stood in his eyes  then said the captain cheer up my lord for all will be well in time  and with that he first produced his packet and laid it by but that the lord mayor and the rest of the captains took for sign of good tidings  now a season of grace being come he sent for all the captains and elders of the town that were here and there in their lodgings in the castle and upon their guard to let them know that captain credence was returned from the court and that he had something in general and something in special to communicate to them  so they all came up to him and saluted him and asked him concerning his journey and what was the best news at the court  and he answered them as he had done the lord mayor before that all would be well at last now when the captain had thus saluted them he opened his packet and thence did draw out his several notes for those that he had sent for  and the first note was for my lord mayor wherein was signified that the prince emmanuel had taken it well that my lord mayor had been so true and trusty in his office and the great concerns that lay upon him for the town and people of mansoul  also he bid him to know that he took it well that he had been so bold for his prince emmanuel and had engaged so faithfully in his cause against diabolus  he also signified at the close of his letter that he should shortly receive his reward  the second note that came out was for the noble lord willbewill wherein there was signified that his prince emmanuel did well understand how valiant and courageous he had been for the honour of his lord now in his absence and when his name was under contempt by diabolus  there was signified also that his prince had taken it well that he had been so faithful to the town of mansoul in his keeping of so strict a hand and eye over and so strict a rein upon the neck of the diabolonians that did still lie lurking in their several holes in the famous town of mansoul  he signified moreover how that he understood that my lord had with his own hand done great execution upon some of the chief of the rebels there to the great discouragement of the adverse party and to the good example of the whole town of mansoul and that shortly his lordship should have his reward  the third note came out for the subordinate preacher wherein was signified that his prince took it well from him that he had so honestly and so faithfully performed his office and executed the trust committed to him by his lord while he exhorted rebuked and forewarned mansoul according to the laws of the town  he signified moreover that he took it well at his hand that he called to fasting to sackcloth and ashes when mansoul was under her revolt  also that he called for the aid of the captain boanerges to help in so weighty a work and that shortly he also should receive his reward  the fourth note came out for mr godlyfear wherein his lord thus signified that his lordship observed that he was the first of all the men in mansoul that detected mr carnalsecurity as the only one that through his subtlety and cunning had obtained for diabolus a defection and decay of goodness in the blessed town of mansoul  moreover his lord gave him to understand that he still remembered his tears and mourning for the state of mansoul  it was also observed by the same note that his lord took notice of his detecting of this mr carnalsecurity at his own table among his guests in his own house and that in the midst of his jolliness even while he was seeking to perfect his villanies against the town of mansoul  emmanuel also took notice that this reverend person mr godlyfear stood stoutly to it at the gates of the castle against all the threats and attempts of the tyrant and that he had put the townsmen in a way to make their petition to their prince so as that he might accept thereof and as they might obtain an answer of peace and that therefore shortly he should receive his reward  after all this there was yet produced a note which was written to the whole town of mansoul whereby they perceivedthat their lord took notice of their so often repeating of petitions to him and that they should see more of the fruits of such their doings in time to come  their prince did also therein tell them that he took it well that their heart and mind now at last abode fixed upon him and his ways though diabolus had made such inroads upon them and that neither flatteries on the one hand nor hardships on the other could make them yield to serve his cruel designs  there was also inserted at the bottom of this notethat his lordship had left the town of mansoul in the hands of the lord secretary and under the conduct of captain credence saying beware that you yet yield yourselves unto their governance and in due time you shall receive your reward  so after the brave captain credence had delivered his notes to those to whom they belonged he retired himself to my lord secretarys lodgings and there spends time in conversing with him for they too were very great one with another and did indeed know more how things would go with mansoul than did all the townsmen besides  the lord secretary also loved the captain credence dearly yea many a good bit was sent him from my lords table also he might have a show of countenance when the rest of mansoul lay under the clouds  so after some time for converse was spent the captain betook himself to his chambers to rest  but it was not long after when my lord did send for the captain again so the captain came to him and they greeted one another with usual salutations  then said the captain to the lord secretary what hath my lord to say to his servant  so the lord secretary took him and had him aside and after a sign or two of more favour he said i have made thee the lords lieutenant over all the forces in mansoul so that from this day forward all men in mansoul shall be at thy word and thou shalt be he that shall lead in and that shall lead out mansoul  thou shalt therefore manage according to thy place the war for thy prince and for the town of mansoul against the force and power of diabolus and at thy command shall the rest of the captains be  now the townsmen began to perceive what interest the captain had both with the court and also with the lord secretary in mansoul for no man before could speed when sent nor bring such good news from emmanuel as he  wherefore what do they after some lamentation that they made no more use of him in their distresses but send by their subordinate preacher to the lord secretary to desire him that all that ever they were and had might be put under the government care custody and conduct of captain credence  so their preacher went and did his errand and received this answer from the mouth of his lord  that captain credence should be the great doer in all the kings army against the kings enemies and also for the welfare of mansoul  so he bowed to the ground and thanked his lordship and returned and told his news to the townsfolk  but all this was done with all imaginable secrecy because the foes had yet great strength in the town  but to return to our story again  when diabolus saw himself thus boldly confronted by the lord mayor and perceived the stoutness of mr godlyfear he fell into a rage and forthwith called a council of war that he might be revenged on mansoul  so all the princes of the pit came together and old incredulity at the head of them with all the captains of his army so they consult what to do  now the effect and conclusion of the council that day was how they might take the castle because they could not conclude themselves masters of the town so long as that was in the possession of their enemies  so one advised this way and another advised that but when they could not agree in their verdict apollyon that president of the council stood up and thus he began  my brotherhood quoth he i have two things to propound unto you and my first is this  let us withdraw ourselves from the town into the plain again for our presence here will do us no good because the castle is yet in our enemies hands nor is it possible that we should take that so long as so many brave captains are in it and that this bold fellow godlyfear is made the keeper of the gates of it  now when we have withdrawn ourselves into the plain they of their own accord will be glad of some little ease and it may be of their own accord they again may begin to be remiss and even their so being will give them a bigger blow than we can possibly give them ourselves  but if that should fail our going forth of the town may draw the captains out after us and you know what it cost them when we fought them in the field before  besides can we but draw them out into the field we may lay an ambush behind the town which shall when they are come forth abroad rush in and take possession of the castle  but beelzebub stood up and replied saying  it is impossible to draw them all off from the castle some you may be sure will lie there to keep that wherefore it will be but in vain thus to attempt unless we were sure that they will all come out  he therefore concluded that what was done must be done by some other means  and the most likely means that the greatest of their heads could invent was that which apollyon had advised to before namely to get the townsmen again to sin  for said he it is not our being in the town nor in the field nor our fighting nor our killing of their men that can make us the masters of mansoul for so long as one in the town is able to lift up his finger against us emmanuel will take their parts and if he shall take their parts we know what time of day it will be with us wherefore for my part quoth he there is in my judgment no way to bring them into bondage to us like inventing a way to make them sin  had we said he left all our doubters at home we had done as well as we have done now unless we could have made them the masters and governors of the castle for doubters at a distance are but like objections refelled with arguments  indeed can we but get them into the hold and make them possessors of that the day will be our own  let us therefore withdraw ourselves into the plain not expecting that the captains in mansoul should follow us but yet i say let us do this and before we so do let us advise again with our trusty diabolonians that are yet in their holds of mansoul and set them to work to betray the town to us for they indeed must do it or it will be left undone for ever  by these sayings of beelzebub for i think it was he that gave this counsel the whole conclave was forced to be of his opinion namely that the way to get the castle was to get the town to sin  then they fell to inventing by what means they might do this thing  then lucifer stood up and said  the counsel of beelzebub is pertinent  now the way to bring this to pass in mine opinion is this  let us withdraw our force from the town of mansoul let us do this and let us terrify them no more either with summons or threats or with the noise of our drum or any other awakening means  only let us lie in the field at a distance and be as if we regarded them not for frights i see do but awaken them and make them more stand to their arms  i have also another stratagem in my head  you know mansoul is a markettown and a town that delights in commerce what therefore if some of our diabolonians shall feign themselves farcountry men and shall go out and bring to the market of mansoul some of our wares to sell and what matter at what rates they sell their wares though it be but for half the worth  now let those that thus shall trade in their market be those that are witty and true to us and i will lay my crown to pawn it will do  there are two that are come to my thoughts already that i think will be arch at this work and they are mr pennywisepoundfoolish and mr getithehundredandloseithe shire nor is this man with the long name at all inferior to the other  what also if you join with them mr sweetworld and mr presentgood they are men that are civil and cunning but our true friends and helpers  let these with as many more engage in this business for us and let mansoul be taken up in much business and let them grow full and rich and this is the way to get ground of them  remember ye not that thus we prevailed upon laodicea and how many at present do we hold in this snare  now when they begin to grow full they will forget their misery and if we shall not affright them they may happen to fall asleep and so be got to neglect their town watch their castle watch as well as their watch at the gates  yea may we not by this means so cumber mansoul with abundance that they shall be forced to make of their castle a warehouse instead of a garrison fortified against us and a receptacle for men of war  thus if we get our goods and commodities thither i reckon that the castle is more than half ours  besides could we so order it that it shall be filled with such kind of wares then if we made a sudden assault upon them it would be hard for the captains to take shelter there  do you not know that of the parable the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and again when the heart is overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and the cares of this life all mischief comes upon them at unawares  furthermore my lords quoth he you very well know that it is not easy for a people to be filled with our things and not to have some of our diabolonians as retainers to their houses and services where is a mansoulian that is full of this world that has not for his servants and waitingmen mr profuse or mr prodigality or some other of our diabolonian gang as mr voluptuous mr pragmatical mr ostentation or the like  now these can take the castle of mansoul or blow it up or make it unfit for a garrison for emmanuel and any of these will do  yea these for aught i know may do it for us sooner than an army of twenty thousand men wherefore to end as i began my advice is that we quietly withdraw ourselves not offering any further force or forcible attempts upon the castle at least at this time and let us set on foot our new project and let us see if that will not make them destroy themselves  this advice was highly applauded by them all and was accounted the very masterpiece of hell namely to choke mansoul with a fulness of this world and to surfeit her heart with the good things thereof  but see how things meet together  just as this diabolonian council was broken up captain credence received a letter from emmanuel the contents of which were these  that upon the third day he would meet him in the field in the plains about mansoul  meet me in the field quoth the captain what meaneth my lord by this  i know not what he meaneth by meeting me in the field  so he took the note in his hand and did carry it to my lord secretary to ask his thoughts thereupon for my lord was a seer in all matters concerning the king and also for the good and comfort of the town of mansoul  so he showed my lord the note and desired his opinion thereof  for my part quoth captain credence i know not the meaning thereof  so my lord did take and read it and after a little pause he said the diabolonians have had against mansoul a great consultation today they have i say this day been contriving the utter ruin of the town and the result of their council is to set mansoul into such a way which if taken will surely make her destroy herself  and to this end they are making ready for their own departure out of the town intending to betake themselves to the field again and there to lie till they shall see whether this their project will take or no but be thou ready with the men of thy lord for on the third day they will be in the plain there to fall upon the diabolonians for the prince will by that time be in the field yea by that it is break of day sunrising or before and that with a mighty force against them  so he shall be before them and thou shalt be behind them and betwixt you both their army shall be destroyed  when captain credence heard this away goes he to the rest of the captains and tells them what a note he had a while since received from the hand of emmanuel  and said he that which was dark therein hath my lord the lord secretary expounded unto me  he told them moreover what by himself and by them must be done to answer the mind of their lord  then were the captains glad and captain credence commanded that all the kings trumpeters should ascend to the battlements of the castle and there in the audience of diabolus and of the whole town of mansoul make the best music that heart could invent  the trumpeters then did as they were commanded  they got themselves up to the top of the castle and thus they began to sound  then did diabolus start and said what can be the meaning of this they neither sound bootandsaddle nor horseandaway nor a charge  what do these madmen mean that yet they should be so merry and glad  then answered one of themselves and said this is for joy that their prince emmanuel is coming to relieve the town of mansoul and to this end he is at the head of an army and that this relief is near  the men of mansoul also were greatly concerned at this melodious charm of the trumpets they said yea they answered one another saying this can be no harm to us surely this can be no harm to us  then said the diabolonians what had we best to do and it was answered it was best to quit the town and that said one ye may do in pursuance of your last counsel and by so doing also be better able to give the enemy battle should an army from without come upon us  so on the second day they withdrew themselves from mansoul and abode in the plains without but they encamped themselves before eyegate in what terrene and terrible manner they could  the reason why they would not abide in the town besides the reasons that were debated in their late conclave was for that they were not possessed of the stronghold and because said they we shall have more convenience to fight and also to fly if need be when we are encamped in the open plains besides the town would have been a pit for them rather than a place of defence had the prince come up and inclosed them fast therein  therefore they betook themselves to the field that they might also be out of the reach of the slings by which they were much annoyed all the while that they were in the town  well the time that the captains were to fall upon the diabolonians being come they eagerly prepared themselves for action for captain credence had told the captains over night that they should meet their prince in the field tomorrow  this therefore made them yet far more desirous to be engaging the enemy for you shall see the prince in the field tomorrow was like oil to a flaming fire for of a long time they had been at a distance  they therefore were for this the more earnest and desirous of the work so as i said the hour being come captain credence with the rest of the men of war drew out their forces before it was day by the sallyport of the town  and being all ready captain credence went up to the head of the army and gave to the rest of the captains the word and so they to their underofficers and soldiers  the word was the sword of the prince emmanuel and the shield of captain credence which is in the mansoulian tongue the word of god and faith  then the captains fell on and began roundly to front and flank and rear diaboluss camp  now they left captain experience in the town because he was yet ill of his wounds which the diabolonians had given him in the last fight  but when he perceived that the captains were at it what does he but calling for his crutches with haste gets up and away he goes to the battle saying shall i lie here when my brethren are in the fight and when emmanuel the prince will show himself in the field to his servants  but when the enemy saw the man come with his crutches they were daunted yet the more for thought they what spirit has possessed these mansoulians that they fight us upon their crutches  well the captains as i said fell on and did bravely handle their weapons still crying out and shouting as they laid on blows the sword of the prince emmanuel and the shield of captain credence  now when diabolus saw that the captains were come out and that so valiantly they surrounded his men he concluded that for the present nothing from them was to be looked for but blows and the dints of their twoedged sword  wherefore he also falls on upon the princes army with all his deadly force  so the battle was joined  now who was it that at first diabolus met with in the fight but captain credence on the one hand and the lord willbewill on the other  now willbewills blows were like the blows of a giant for that man had a strong arm and he fell in upon the election doubters for they were the lifeguard of diabolus and he kept them in play a good while cutting and battering shrewdly  now when captain credence saw my lord engaged he did stoutly fall on on the other hand upon the same company also so they put them to great disorder  now captain goodhope had engaged the vocation doubters and they were sturdy men but the captain was a valiant man  captain experience did also send him some aid so he made the vocation doubters to retreat  the rest of the armies were hotly engaged and that on every side and the diabolonians did fight stoutly  then did my lord secretary command that the slings from the castle should be played and his men could throw stones at an hairs breadth  but after a while those that were made to fly before the captains of the prince did begin to rally again and they came up stoutly upon the rear of the princes army  wherefore the princes army began to faint but remembering that they should see the face of their prince byandby they took courage and a very fierce battle was fought  then shouted the captains saying the sword of the prince emmanuel and the shield of captain credence and with that diabolus gave back thinking that more aid had been come  but no emmanuel as yet appeared  moreover the battle did hang in doubt and they made a little retreat on both sides  now in the time of respite captain credence bravely encouraged his men to stand to it and diabolus did the like as well as he could  but captain credence made a brave speech to his soldiers the contents whereof here follow  gentlemen soldiers and my brethren in this design it rejoiceth me much to see in the field for our prince this day so stout and so valiant an army and such faithful lovers of mansoul  you have hitherto as hath become you shown yourselves men of truth and courage against the diabolonian forces so that for all their boast they have not yet much cause to boast of their gettings now take to yourselves your wonted courage and show yourselves men even this once only for in a few minutes after the next engagement this time you shall see your prince show himself in the field for we must make this second assault upon this tyrant diabolus and then emmanuel comes  no sooner had the captain made this speech to his soldiers but one mr speedy came post to the captain from the prince to tell him that emmanuel was at hand  this news when the captain had received he communicated to the other fieldofficers and they again to their soldiers and men of war  wherefore like men raised from the dead so the captains and their men arose made up to the enemy and cried as before the sword of the prince emmanuel and the shield of captain credence  the diabolonians also bestirred themselves and made resistance as well as they could but in this last engagement the diabolonians lost their courage and many of the doubters fell down dead to the ground  now when they had been in heat of battle about an hour or more captain credence lift up his eyes and saw and behold emmanuel came and he came with colours flying trumpets sounding and the feet of his men scarce touched the ground they hasted with that celerity towards the captains that were engaged  then did credence wind with his men to the townward and gave to diabolus the field  so emmanuel came upon him on the one side and the enemies place was betwixt them both  then again they fell to it afresh and now it was but a little while more but emmanuel and captain credence met still trampling down the slain as they came  but when the captains saw that the prince was come and that he fell upon the diabolonians on the other side and that captain credence and his highness had got them up betwixt them they shouted they so shouted that the ground rent again saying the sword of emmanuel and the shield of captain credence  now when diabolus saw that he and his forces were so hard beset by the prince and his princely army what does he and the lords of the pit that were with him but make their escape and forsake their army and leave them to fall by the hand of emmanuel and of his noble captain credence  so they fell all down slain before them before the prince and before his royal army there was not left so much as one doubter alive they lay spread upon the ground dead men as one would spread dung upon the land  when the battle was over all things came into order in the camp then the captains and elders of mansoul came together to salute emmanuel while without the corporation  so they saluted him and welcomed him and that with a thousand welcomes for that he was come to the borders of mansoul again  so he smiled upon them and said peace be to you  then they addressed themselves to go to the town they went then to go up to mansoul they the prince with all the new forces that now he had brought with him to the war  also all the gates of the town were set open for his reception so glad were they of his blessed return  and this was the manner and order of this going of his into mansoul  first  as i said all the gates of the town were set open yea the gates of the castle also the elders too of the town of mansoul placed themselves at the gates of the town to salute him at his entrance thither  and so they did for as he drew near and approached towards the gates they said lift up your heads o ye gates and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in  and they answered again who is the king of glory and they made return to themselves the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle  lift up your heads o ye gates even lift them up ye everlasting doors etc  secondly  it was ordered also by those of mansoul that all the way from the town gates to those of the castle his blessed majesty should be entertained with the song by them that had the best skill in music in all the town of mansoul  then did the elders and the rest of the men of mansoul answer one another as emmanuel entered the town till he came at the castle gates with songs and sound of trumpets saying they have seen thy goings o god even the goings of my god my king in the sanctuary  so the singers went before the players on instruments followed after and among them were the damsels playing on timbrels  thirdly  then the captains for i would speak a word of them they in their order waited on the prince as he entered into the gates of mansoul  captain credence went before and captain good hope with him captain charity came behind with other of his companions and captain patience followed after all and the rest of the captains some on the right hand and some on the left accompanied emmanuel into mansoul  and all the while the colours were displayed the trumpets sounded and continual shoutings were among the soldiers  the prince himself rode into the town in his armour which was all of beaten gold and in his chariotthe pillars of it were of silver the bottom thereof of gold the covering of it was of purple the midst thereof being paved with love for the daughters of the town of mansoul  fourthly  when the prince was come to the entrance of mansoul he found all the streets strewed with lilies and flowers curiously decked with boughs and branches from the green trees that stood round about the town  every door also was filled with persons who had adorned every one their forepart against their house with something of variety and singular excellency to entertain him withal as he passed in the streets  they also themselves as emmanuel passed by did welcome him with shouts and acclamations of joy saying blessed be the prince that cometh in the name of his father shaddai  fifthly  at the castle gates the elders of mansoul namely the lord mayor the lord willbewill the subordinate preacher mr knowledge and mr mind with other of the gentry of the place saluted emmanuel again  they bowed before him they kissed the dust of his feet they thanked they blessed and praised his highness for not taking advantage against them for their sins but rather had pity upon them in their misery and returned to them with mercies and to build up their mansoul for ever  thus was he had up straightway to the castle for that was the royal palace and the place where his honour was to dwell the which was ready prepared for his highness by the presence of the lord secretary and the work of captain credence  so he entered in  sixthly  then the people and commonalty of the town of mansoul came to him into the castle to mourn and to weep and to lament for their wickedness by which they had forced him out of the town so when they were come bowed themselves to the ground seven times they also wept they wept aloud and asked forgiveness of the prince and prayed that he would again as of old confirm his love to mansoul  to the which the great prince replied weep not but go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet and send portions to them for whom nought is prepared for the joy of your lord is your strength i am returned to mansoul with mercies and my name shall be set up exalted and magnified by it  he also took these inhabitants and kissed them and laid them in his bosom  moreover he gave to the elders of mansoul and to each town officer a chain of gold and a signet  he also sent to their wives earrings and jewels and bracelets and other things  he also bestowed upon the trueborn children of mansoul many precious things  when emmanuel the prince had done all these things for the famous town of mansoul then he said unto them first wash your garments then put on your ornaments and then come to me into the castle of mansoul  so they went to the fountain that was set open for judah and jerusalem to wash in and there they washed and there they made their garments white and came again to the prince into the castle and thus they stood before him  and now there was music and dancing throughout the whole town of mansoul and that because their prince had again granted to them his presence and the light of his countenance the bells also did ring and the sun shone comfortably upon them for a great while together  the town of mansoul did also now more thoroughly seek the destruction and ruin of all remaining diabolonians that abode in the walls and the dens that they had in the town of mansoul for there was of them that had to this day escaped with life and limb from the hand of their suppressors in the famous town of mansoul  but my lord willbewill was a greater terror to them now than ever he had been before forasmuch as his heart was yet more fully bent to seek contrive and pursue them to the death he pursued them night and day and did put them now to sore distress as will afterwards appear  after things were thus far put into order in the famous town of mansoul care was taken and order given by the blessed prince emmanuel that the townsmen should without further delay appoint some to go forth into the plain to bury the dead that were there the dead that fell by the sword of emmanuel and by the shield of the captain credencelest the fumes and ill savours that would arise from them might infect the air and so annoy the famous town of mansoul  this also was a reason of this order namely that as much as in mansoul lay they might cut off the name and being and remembrance of those enemies from the thought of the famous town of mansoul and its inhabitants  so order was given out by the lord mayor that wise and trusty friend of the town of mansoul that persons should be employed about this necessary business and mr godlyfear and one mr upright were to be overseers about this matter  so persons were put under them to work in the fields and to bury the slain that lay dead in the plains  and these were their places of employment some were to make the graves some to bury the dead and some were to go to and fro in the plains and also round about the borders of mansoul to see if a skull or a bone or a piece of a bone of a doubter was yet to be found above ground anywhere near the corporation and if any were found it was ordered that the searchers that searched should set up a mark thereby and a sign that those that were appointed to bury them might find it and bury it out of sight that the name and remembrance of a diabolonian doubter might be blotted out from under heaven and that the children and they that were to be born in mansoul might not know if possible what a skull what a bone or a piece of a bone of a doubter was  so the buriers and those that were appointed for that purpose did as they were commanded  they buried the doubters and all the skulls and bones and pieces of bones of doubters wherever they found them and so they cleansed the plains  now also mr godspeace took up his commission and acted again as in former days  thus they buried in the plains about mansoul the election doubters the vocation doubters the grace doubters the perseverance doubters the resurrection doubters the salvation doubters and the glory doubters whose captains were captain rage captain cruel captain damnation captain insatiable captain brimstone captain torment captain noease captain sepulchre and captain pasthope and old incredulity was under diabolus their general there were also the seven heads of their army and they were the lord beelzebub the lord lucifer the lord legion the lord apollyon the lord python the lord cerberus and the lord belial but the princes and the captains with old incredulity their general did all of them make their escape  so their men fell down slain by the power of the princes forces and by the hands of the men of the town of mansoul  they also were buried as is afore related to the exceeding great joy of the now famous town of mansoul  they that buried them buried also with them their arms which were cruel instruments of death  their weapons were arrows darts mauls firebrands and the like  they buried also their armour their colours banners with the standard of diabolus and what else soever they could find that did but smell of a diabolonian doubter  now when the tyrant had arrived at hellgate hill with his old friend incredulity they immediately descended the den and having there with their fellows for a while condoled their misfortune and great loss that they sustained against the town of mansoul they fell at length into a passion and revenged they would be for the loss that they sustained before the town of mansoul  wherefore they presently call a council to contrive yet further what was to be done against the famous town of mansoul for their yawning paunches could not wait to see the result of their lord lucifers and their lord apollyons counsel that they had given before for their raging gorge thought every day even as long as a short for ever until they were filled with the body and soul with the flesh and bones and with all the delicates of mansoul  they therefore resolve to make another attempt upon the town of mansoul and that by an army mixed and made up partly of doubters and partly of bloodmen  a more particular account now take of both  the doubters are such as have their name from their nature as well as from the land and kingdom where they are born  their nature is to put a question upon every one of the truths of emmanuel and their country is called the land of doubting and that land lieth off and farthest remote to the north between the land of darkness and that called the valley of the shadow of death  for though the land of darkness and that called the valley of the shadow of death be sometimes called as if they were one and the selfsame place yet indeed they are two lying but a little way asunder and the land of doubting points in and lieth between them  this is the land of doubting and these that came with diabolus to ruin the town of mansoul are the natives of that country  the bloodmen are a people that have their name derived from the malignity of their nature and from the fury that is in them to execute it upon the town of mansoul  their land lieth under the dogstar and by that they are governed as to their intellectuals the name of their country is the province of loathgood  the remote parts of it are far distant from the land of doubting yet they do both butt and bound upon the hill called hellgate hill these people are always in league with the doubters for they jointly do make question of the faith and fidelity of the men of the town of mansoul and so are both alike qualified for the service of their prince  now of these two countries did diabolus by the beating of his drum raise another army against the town of mansoul of fiveand twenty thousand strong  there were ten thousand doubters and fifteen thousand bloodmen and they were put under several captains for the war and old incredulity was again made general of the army  as for the doubters their captains were five of the seven that were heads of the last diabolonian army and these are their names captain beelzebub captain lucifer captain apollyon captain legion and captain cerberus and the captains that they had before were some of them made lieutenants and some ensigns of the army  but diabolus did not count that in this expedition of his these doubters would prove his principal men for their manhood had been tried before also the mansoulians had put them to the worst  only he did bring them to multiply a number and to help if need was at a pinch  but his trust he put in his bloodmen for that they were all rugged villains and he knew that they had done feats heretofore  as for the bloodmen they also were under command and the names of their captains were captain cain captain nimrod captain ishmael captain esau captain saul captain absalom captain judas and captain pope  1 captain cain was over two bands namely the zealous and the angry bloodmen  his standardbearer bare the red colours and his scutcheon was the murdering club  2 captain nimrod was captain over two bands namely the tyrannical and encroaching bloodmen  his standardbearer bare the red colours and his scutcheon was the great bloodhound  3 captain ishmael was captain over two bands namely the mocking and scorning bloodmen  his standardbearer bare the red colours and his scutcheon was one mocking at abrahams isaac  4 captain esau was captain over two bands namely the bloodmen that grudged that another should have the blessing also over the bloodmen that are for executing their private revenge upon others his standardbearer bare the red colours and his scutcheon was one privately lurking to murder jacob  5 captain saul was captain over two bands namely the groundlessly jealous and the devilishly furious bloodmen  his standardbearer bare the red colours and his scutcheon was three bloody darts cast at harmless david  6 captain absalom was captain over two bands namely over the bloodmen that will kill a father or a friend for the glory of this world also over those bloodmen that will hold one fair in hand with words till they shall have pierced him with their swords his standardbearer did bear the red colours and his scutcheon was the son pursuing the fathers blood  7 captain judas was over two bands namely the bloodmen that will sell a mans life for money and those also that will betray their friend with a kiss  his standardbearer bare the red colours and his scutcheon was thirty pieces of silver and the halter  8 captain pope was captain over one band for all these spirits are joined in one under him  his standardbearer bare the red colours and his scutcheon was the stake the flame and the good man in it  now the reason why diabolus did so soon rally another force after he had been beaten out of the field was for that he put mighty confidence in this army of bloodmen for he put a great deal of more trust in them than he did before in his army of doubters though they had also often done great service for him in the strengthening of him in his kingdom  but these bloodmen he had proved them often and their sword did seldom return empty besides he knew that these like mastiffs would fasten upon any upon father mother brother sister prince or governor yea upon the prince of princes  and that which encouraged him the more was for that they once did force emmanuel out of the kingdom of universe and why thought he may they not also drive him from the town of mansoul  so this army of fiveandtwenty thousand strong was by their general the great lord incredulity led up against the town of mansoul  now mr prywell the scoutmastergeneral did himself go out to spy and he did bring mansoul tidings of their coming wherefore they shut up their gates and put themselves in a posture of defence against these new diabolonians that came up against the town  so diabolus brought up his army and beleaguered the town of mansoul the doubters were placed about feelgate and the blood men set down before eyegate and eargate  now when this army had thus encamped themselves incredulity did in the name of diabolus his own name and in the name of the bloodmen and the rest that were with him send a summons as hot as a redhot iron to mansoul to yield to their demands threatening that if they still stood it out against them they would presently burn down mansoul with fire  for you must know that as for the bloodmen they were not so much that mansoul should be surrendered as that mansoul should be destroyed and cut off out of the land of the living  true they send to them to surrender but should they so do that would not stench or quench the thirsts of these men  they must have blood the blood of mansoul else they die and it is from hence that they have their name wherefore these bloodmen he reserved while now that they might when all his engines proved ineffectual as his last and sure card be played against the town of mansoul  now when the townsmen had received this redhot summons it begat in them at present some changing and interchanging thoughts but they jointly agreed in less than half an hour to carry the summons to the prince the which they did when they had writ at the bottom of it lord save mansoul from bloody men  so he took it and looked upon it and considered it and took notice also of that short petition that the men of mansoul had written at the bottom of it and called to him the noble captain credence and bid him go and take captain patience with him and go and take care of that side of mansoul that was beleaguered by the bloodmen  so they went and did as they were commanded  the captain credence went and took captain patience and they both secured that side of mansoul that was besieged by the bloodmen  then he commanded that captain goodhope and captain charity and my lord willbewill should take charge of the other side of the town  and i said the prince will set my standard upon the battlements of your castle and do you three watch against the doubters  this done he again commanded that the brave captain the captain experience should draw up his men in the marketplace and that there he should exercise them day by day before the people of the town of mansoul  now this siege was long and many a fierce attempt did the enemy especially those called the bloodmen make upon the town of mansoul and many a shrewd brush did some of the townsmen meet with from them especially captain selfdenial who i should have told you before was commanded to take the care of eargate and eyegate now against the bloodmen  this captain selfdenial was a young man but stout and a townsman in mansoul as captain experience also was  and emmanuel at his second return to mansoul made him a captain over a thousand of the mansoulians for the good of the corporation  this captain therefore being an hardy man and a man of great courage and willing to venture himself for the good of the town of mansoul would now and then sally out upon the bloodmen and give them many notable alarms and entered several brisk skirmishes with them and also did some execution upon them but you must think that this could not easily be done but he must meet with brushes himself for he carried several of their marks in his face yea and some in some other parts of his body  so after some time spent for the trial of the faith and hope and love of the town of mansoul the prince emmanuel upon a day calls his captains and men of war together and divides them into two companies this done he commands them at a time appointed and that in the morning very early to sally out upon the enemy saying  let half of you fall upon the doubters and half of you fall upon the bloodmen  those of you that go out against the doubters kill and slay and cause to perish so many of them as by any means you can lay hands on but for you that go out against the bloodmen slay them not but take them alive  so at the time appointed betimes in the morning the captains went out as they were commanded against the enemies  captain goodhope captain charity and those that were joined with them as captain innocent and captain experience went out against the doubters and captain credence and captain patience with captain selfdenial and the rest that were to join with them went out against the bloodmen  now those that went out against the doubters drew up into a body before the plain and marched on to bid them battle  but the doubters remembering their last success made a retreat not daring to stand the shock but fled from the princes men wherefore they pursued them and in their pursuit slew many but they could not catch them all  now those that escaped went some of them home and the rest by fives nines and seventeens like wanderers went straggling up and down the country where they upon the barbarous people showed and exercised many of their diabolonian actions  nor did these people rise up in arms against them but suffered themselves to be enslaved by them  they would also after this show themselves in companies before the town of mansoul but never to abide in it for if captain credence captain goodhope or captain experience did but show themselves they fled  those that went out against the bloodmen did as they were commanded  they forbore to slay any but sought to compass them about  but the bloodmen when they saw that no emmanuel was in the field concluded also that no emmanuel was in mansoul wherefore they looking upon what the captains did to be as they called it a fruit of the extravagancy of their wild and foolish fancies rather despised them than feared them  but the captains minding their business at last did compass them round they also that had routed the doubters came in amain to their aid  so in fine after some little struggling for the bloodmen also would have run for it only now it was too late for though they are mischievous and cruel where they can overcome yet all bloodmen are chickenhearted men when they once come to see themselves matched and equalledso the captains took them and brought them to the prince  now when they were taken had before the prince and examined he found them to be of three several counties though they all came out of one land  1 one sort of them came out of blindmanshire and they were such as did ignorantly what they did  2 another sort of them came out of blindzealshire and they did superstitiously what they did  3 the third sort of them came out of the town of malice in the county of envy and they did what they did out of spite and implacableness  for the first of these namely they that came out of blindman shire when they saw where they were and against whom they had fought they trembled and cried as they stood before him and as many of these as asked him mercy he touched their lips with his golden sceptre  they that came out of blindzealshire they did not as their fellows did for they pleaded that they had a right to do what they did because mansoul was a town whose laws and customs were diverse from all that dwelt thereabouts  very few of these could be brought to see their evil but those that did and asked mercy they also obtained favour  now they that came out of the town of malice that is in the county of envy they neither wept nor disputed nor repented but stood gnawing their tongues before him for anguish and madness because they could not have their will upon mansoul  now these last with all those of the other two sorts that did not unfeignedly ask pardon for their faultsthose he made to enter into sufficient bond to answer for what they had done against mansoul and against her king at the great and general assizes to be holden for our lord the king where he himself should appoint for the country and kingdom of universe  so they became bound each man for himself to come in when called upon to answer before our lord the king for what they had done as before  and thus much concerning this second army that was sent by diabolus to overthrow mansoul  but there were three of those that came from the land of doubting who after they had wandered and ranged the country a while and perceived that they had escaped were so hardy as to thrust themselves knowing that yet there were in the town diabolonians i say they were so hardy as to thrust themselves into mansoul among them  three did i say  i think there were four  now to whose house should these diabolonian doubters go but to the house of an old diabolonian in mansoul whose name was evilquestioning a very great enemy he was to mansoul and a great doer among the diabolonians there  well to this evilquestionings house as was said did these diabolonians come you may be sure that they had directions how to find the way thither so he made them welcome pitied their misfortune and succoured them with the best that he had in his house  now after a little acquaintance and it was not long before they had that this old evilquestioning asked the doubters if they were all of a town he knew that they were all of one kingdom and they answered  no nor not of one shire neither for i said one am an election doubter  i said another am a vocation doubter then said the third i am a salvation doubter and the fourth said he was a grace doubter well quoth the old gentleman be of what shire you will i am persuaded that you are down boys  you have the very length of my foot are one with my heart and shall be welcome to me  so they thanked him and were glad that they had found themselves an harbour in mansoul  then said evilquestioning to them  how many of your company might there be that came with you to the siege of mansoul and they answered  there were but ten thousand doubters in all for the rest of the army consisted of fifteen thousand bloodmen these bloodmen quoth they border upon our country but poor men as we hear they were every one taken by emmanuels forces ten thousand quoth the old gentleman i will promise you that is a round company  but how came it to pass since you were so mighty a number that you fainted and durst not fight your foes our general said they was the first man that did run for it pray quoth their landlord who was that your cowardly general  he was once the lord mayor of mansoul said they but pray call him not a cowardly general for whether any from the east to the west has done more service for our prince diabolus than has my lord incredulity will be a hard question for you to answer  but had they catched him they would for certain have hanged him and we promise you hanging is but a bad business then said the old gentleman i would that all the ten thousand doubters were now well armed in mansoul and myself at the head of them i would see what i could do  ay said they that would be well if we could see that but wishes alas what are they and these words were spoken aloud  well said old evilquestioning take heed that you talk not too loud you must be quat and close and must take care of yourselves while you are here or i will assure you you will be snapped  why quoth the doubters why quoth the old gentleman why because both the prince and lord secretary and their captains and soldiers are all at present in town yea the town is as full of them as ever it can hold  and besides there is one whose name is willbewill a most cruel enemy of ours and him the prince has made keeper of the gates and has commanded him that with all the diligence he can he should look for search out and destroy all and all manner of diabolonians and if he lighteth upon you down you go though your heads were made of gold  and now to see how it happened one of the lord willbewills faithful soldiers whose name was mr diligence stood all this while listening under old evilquestionings eaves and heard all the talk that had been betwixt him and the doubters that he entertained under his roof  the soldier was a man that my lord had much confidence in and that he loved dearly and that both because he was a man of courage and also a man that was unwearied in seeking after diabolonians to apprehend them  now this man as i told you heard all the talk that was between old evilquestioning and these diabolonians wherefore what does he but goes to his lord and tells him what he had heard  and sayest thou so my trusty quoth my lord  ay quoth diligence that i do and if your lordship will be pleased to go with me you shall find it as i have said  and are they there quoth my lord  i know evilquestioning well for he and i were great in the time of our apostasy  but i know not now where he dwells  but i do said his man and if your lordship will go i will lead you the way to his den  go quoth my lord that i will  come my diligence let us go find them out  so my lord and his man went together the direct way to his house now his man went before to show him his way and they went till they came even under old mr evilquestionings wall  then said diligence hark my lord do you know the old gentlemans tongue when you hear it  yes said my lord i know it well but i have not seen him many a day  this i know he is cunning i wish he doth not give us the slip  let me alone for that said his servant diligence  but how shall we find the door quoth my lord  let me alone for that too said his man  so he had my lord willbewill about and showed him the way to the door  then my lord without more ado broke open the door rushed into the house and caught them all five together even as diligence his man had told him  so my lord apprehended them and led them away and committed them to the hand of mr trueman the gaoler and commanded and he did put them in ward  this done my lord mayor was acquainted in the morning with what my lord willbewill had done over night and his lordship rejoiced much at the news not only because there were doubters apprehended but because that old evil questioning was taken for he had been a very great trouble to mansoul and much affliction to my lord mayor himself  he had also been sought for often but no hand could ever be laid upon him till now  well the next thing was to make preparation to try these five that by my lord had been apprehended and that were in the hands of mr trueman the gaoler  so the day was set and the court called and come together and the prisoners brought to the bar  my lord willbewill had power to have slain them when at first he took them and that without any more ado but he thought it at this time more for the honour of the prince the comfort of mansoul and the discouragement of the enemy to bring them forth to public judgment  but i say mr trueman brought them in chains to the bar to the townhall for that was the place of judgment  so to be short the jury was panelled the witnesses sworn and the prisoners tried for their lives  the jury was the same that tried mr notruth pitiless haughty and the rest of their companions  and first old questioning himself was set to the bar for he was the receiver the entertainer and comforter of these doubters that by nation were outlandish men  then he was bid to hearken to his charge and was told that he had liberty to object if he had ought to say for himself  so his indictment was read  the manner and form here follows  mr questioning thou art here indicted by the name of evil questioning an intruder upon the town of mansoul for that thou art a diabolonian by nature and also a hater of the prince emmanuel and one that hast studied the ruin of the town of mansoul  thou art also here indicted for countenancing the kings enemies after wholesome laws made to the contrary  for 1 thou hast questioned the truth of her doctrine and state  2 in wishing that ten thousand doubters were in her  3 in receiving in entertaining and encouraging of her enemies that came from their army unto thee  what sayest thou to this indictment art thou guilty or not guilty  my lord quoth he i know not the meaning of this indictment forasmuch as i am not the man concerned in it the man that standeth by this charge accused before this bench is called by the name of evilquestioning which name i deny to be mine mine being honestinquiry  the one indeed sounds like the other but i trow your lordships know that between these two there is a wide difference for i hope that a man even in the worst of times and that too amongst the worst of men may make an honest inquiry after things without running the danger of death  then spake my lord willbewill for he was one of the witnesses my lord and you the honourable bench and magistrates of the town of mansoul you all have heard with your ears that the prisoner at the bar has denied his name and so thinks to shift from the charge of the indictment  but i know him to be the man concerned and that his proper name is evilquestioning  i have known him my lord above these thirty years for he and i a shame it is for me to speak it were great acquaintance when diabolus that tyrant had the government of mansoul and i testify that he is a diabolonian by nature an enemy to our prince and a hater of the blessed town of mansoul  he has in times of rebellion been at and lain in my house my lord not so little as twenty nights together and we did use to talk then for the substance of talk as he and his doubters have talked of late  true i have not seen him many a day  i suppose that the coming of emmanuel to mansoul has made him change his lodgings as this indictment has driven him to change his name but this is the man my lord  then said the court unto him hast thou any more to say  yes quoth the old gentleman that i have for all that as yet has been said against me is but by the mouth of one witness and it is not lawful for the famous town of mansoul at the mouth of one witness to put any man to death  then stood forth mr diligence and said my lord as i was upon my watch such a night at the head of bad street in this town i chanced to hear a muttering within this gentlemans house  then thought i what is to do here  so i went up close but very softly to the side of the house to listen thinking as indeed it fell out that there i might light upon some diabolonian conventicle  so as i said i drew nearer and nearer and when i was got up close to the wall it was but a while before i perceived that there were outlandish men in the house but i did well understand their speech for i have been a traveller myself  now hearing such language in such a tottering cottage as this old gentleman dwelt in i clapped mine ear to a hole in the window and there heard them talk as followeth  this old mr questioning asked these doubters what they were whence they came and what was their business in these parts and they told him to all these questions yet he did entertain them  he also asked what numbers there were of them and they told him ten thousand men  he then asked them why they made no more manly assault upon mansoul and they told him  so he called their general coward for marching off when he should have fought for his prince  further this old evil questioning wished and i heard him wish would all the ten thousand doubters were now in mansoul and himself at the head of them  he bid them also to take heed and lie quat for if they were taken they must die although they had heads of gold  then said the court  mr evilquestioning here is now another witness against you and his testimony is full  1 he swears that you did receive these men into your house and that you did nourish them there though you knew that they were diabolonians and the kings enemies  2 he swears that you did wish ten thousand of them in mansoul  3 he swears that you did give them advice to be quat and close lest they were taken by the kings servants  all which manifesteth that thou art a diabolonian but hadst thou been a friend to the king thou wouldst have apprehended them  then said evilquestioning  to the first of these i answer the men that came into mine house were strangers and i took them in and is it now become a crime in mansoul for a man to entertain strangers  that i did also nourish them is true and why should my charity be blamed  as for the reason why i wished ten thousand of them in mansoul i never told it to the witnesses nor to themselves  i might wish them to be taken and so my wish might mean well to mansoul for aught that any yet knows  i did also bid them take heed that they fell not into the captains hands but that might be because i am unwilling that any man should be slain and not because i would have the kings enemies as such escape  my lord mayor then replied  that though it was a virtue to entertain strangers yet it was treason to entertain the kings enemies  and for what else thou hast said thou dost by words but labour to evade and defer the execution of judgment  but could there be no more proved against thee but that thou art a diabolonian thou must for that die the death by the law but to be a receiver a nourisher a countenancer and a harbourer of others of them yea of outlandish diabolonians yea of them that came from far on purpose to cut off and destroy our mansoulthis must not be borne  then said evilquestioning  i see how the game will go  i must die for my name and for my charity  and so he held his peace  then they called the outlandish doubters to the bar and the first of them that was arraigned was the election doubter  so his indictment was read and because he was an outlandish man the substance of it was told him by an interpreter namely that he was there charged with being an enemy of emmanuel the prince a hater of the town of mansoul and an opposer of her most wholesome doctrine  then the judge asked him if he would plead but he said only this that he confessed that he was an election doubter and that that was the religion that he had ever been brought up in  and said moreover if i must die for my religion i trow i shall die a martyr and so i care the less  judge  then it was replied  to question election is to overthrow a great doctrine of the gospel namely the omnisciency and power and will of god to take away the liberty of god with his creature to stumble the faith of the town of mansoul and to make salvation to depend upon works and not upon grace  it also belied the word and disquieted the minds of the men of mansoul therefore by the best of laws he must die  then was the vocation doubter called and set to the bar and his indictment for substance was the same with the other only he was particularly charged with denying the calling of mansoul  the judge asked him also what he had to say for himself  so he replied  that he never believed that there was any such thing as a distinct and powerful call of god to mansoul otherwise than by the general voice of the word nor by that neither otherwise than as it exhorted them to forbear evil and to do that which is good and in so doing a promise of happiness is annexed  then said the judge  thou art a diabolonian and hast denied a great part of one of the most experimental truths of the prince of the town of mansoul for he has called and she has heard a most distinct and powerful call of her emmanuel by which she has been quickened awakened and possessed with heavenly grace to desire to have communion with her prince to serve him and to do his will and to look for her happiness merely of his good pleasure  and for thine abhorrence of this good doctrine thou must die the death  then the grace doubter was called and his indictment was read and he replied thereto  that though he was of the land of doubting his father was the offspring of a pharisee and lived in good fashion among his neighbours and that he taught him to believe and believe it i do and will that mansoul shall never be saved freely by grace  then said the judge  why the law of the prince is plain  1 negatively not of works 2 positively by grace you are saved  and thy religion settleth in and upon the works of the flesh for the works of the law are the works of the flesh besides in saying as thou hast done thou hast robbed god of his glory and given it to a sinful man thou hast robbed christ of the necessity of his undertaking and the sufficiency thereof and hast given both these to the works of the flesh  thou hast despised the work of the holy ghost and hast magnified the will of the flesh and of the legal mind  thou art a diabolonian the son of a diabolonian and for thy diabolonian principles thou must die  the court then having proceeded thus far with them sent out the jury who forthwith brought them in guilty of death  then stood up the recorder and addressed himself to the prisoners  you the prisoners at the bar you have been here indicted and proved guilty of high crimes against emmanuel our prince and against the welfare of the famous town of mansoul crimes for which you must be put to death and die ye accordingly  so they were sentenced to the death of the cross  the place assigned them for execution was that where diabolus drew up his last army against mansoul save only that old evilquestioning was hanged at the top of bad street just over against his own door  when the town of mansoul had thus far rid themselves of their enemies and of the troublers of their peace in the next place a strict commandment was given out that yet my lord willbewill should with diligence his man search for and do his best to apprehend what town diabolonians were yet left alive in mansoul the names of several of them were mr fooling mr letgoodslip mr slavishfear mr nolove mr mistrust mr flesh and mr sloth  it was also commanded that he should apprehend mr evil questionings children that he left behind him and that they should demolish his house  the children that he left behind him were these  mr doubt and he was his eldest son the next to him was legallife unbelief wrongthoughtsofchrist clippromise carnalsense livebyfeeling selflove  all these he had by one wife and her name was nohope she was the kinswoman of old incredulity for he was her uncle and when her father old dark was dead he took her and brought her up and when she was marriageable he gave her to this old evilquestioning to wife  now the lord willbewill did put into execution his commission with great diligence his man  he took fooling in the streets and hanged him up in wantwitalley over against his own house  this fooling was he that would have had the town of mansoul deliver up captain credence into the hands of diabolus provided that then he would have withdrawn his force out of the town  he also took mr letgoodslip one day as he was busy in the market and executed him according to law  now there was an honest poor man in mansoul and his name was mr meditation one of no great account in the days of apostasy but now of repute with the best of the town this man therefore they were willing to prefer  now mr let goodslip had a great deal of wealth heretofore in mansoul and at emmanuels coming it was sequestered to the use of the prince this therefore was now given to mr meditation to improve for the common good and after him to his son mr thinkwell this thinkwell he had by mrs piety his wife and she was the daughter of mr recorder  after this my lord apprehended clippromise  now because he was a notorious villain for by his doings much of the kings coin was abused therefore he was made a public example  he was arraigned and judged to be first set in the pillory then to be whipped by all the children and servants in mansoul and then to be hanged till he was dead  some may wonder at the severity of this mans punishment but those that are honest traders in mansoul are sensible of the great abuse that one clipper of promises in little time may do to the town of mansoul  and truly my judgment is that all those of his name and life should be served even as he  he also apprehended carnalsense and put him in hold but how it came about i cannot tell but he brake prison and made his escape  yea and the bold villain will not yet quit the town but lurks in the diabolonian dens a days and haunts like a ghost honest mens houses a nights  wherefore there was a proclamation set up in the marketplace in mansoul signifying that whosoever could discover carnalsense and apprehend him and slay him should be admitted daily to the princes table and should be made keeper of the treasure of mansoul  many therefore did bend themselves to do this thing but take him and slay him they could not though often he was discovered  but my lord took mr wrongthoughtsofchrist and put him in prison and he died there though it was long first for he died of a lingering consumption  selflove was also taken and committed to custody but there were many that were allied to him in mansoul so his judgment was deferred  but at last mr selfdenial stood up and said  if such villains as these may be winked at in mansoul i will lay down my commission  he also took him from the crowd and had him among his soldiers and there he was brained  but some in mansoul muttered at it though none durst speak plainly because emmanuel was in town  but this brave act of captain selfdenial came to the princes ears so he sent for him and made him a lord in mansoul my lord willbewill also obtained great commendations of emmanuel for what he had done for the town of mansoul  then my lord selfdenial took courage and set to the pursuing of the diabolonians with my lord willbewill and they took liveby feeling and they took legallife and put them in hold till they died  but mr unbelief was a nimble jack  him they could never lay hold of though they attempted to do it often  he therefore and some few more of the subtlest of the diabolonian tribe did yet remain in mansoul to the time that mansoul left off to dwell any longer in the kingdom of universe  but they kept them to their dens and holes  if one of them did appear or happen to be seen in any of the streets of the town of mansoul the whole town would be up in arms after them yea the very children in mansoul would cry out after them as after a thief and would wish that they might stone them to death with stones  and now did mansoul arrive to some good degree of peace and quiet her prince also did abide within her borders her captains also and her soldiers did their duties and mansoul minded her trade that she had with the country that was afar off also she was busy in her manufacture  when the town of mansoul had thus far rid themselves of so many of their enemies and the troublers of their peace the prince sent to them and appointed a day wherein he would at the marketplace meet the whole people and there give them in charge concerning some further matters that if observed would tend to their further safety and comfort and to the condemnation and destruction of their homebred diabolonians  so the day appointed was come and the townsmen met together emmanuel also came down in his chariot and all his captains in their state attending him on the right hand and on the left  then was an oyes made for silence and after some mutual carriages of love the prince began and thus proceeded  you my mansoul and the beloved of mine heart many and great are the privileges that i have bestowed upon you i have singled you out from others and have chosen you to myself not for your worthiness but for mine own sake  i have also redeemed you not only from the dread of my fathers law but from the hand of diabolus  this i have done because i loved you and because i have set my heart upon you to do you good  i have also that all things that might hinder thy way to the pleasures of paradise might be taken out of the way laid down for thee for thy soul a plenary satisfaction and have bought thee to myself a price not of corruptible things as of silver and gold but a price of blood mine own blood which i have freely spilled upon the ground to make thee mine  so i have reconciled thee o my mansoul to my father and entrusted thee in the mansion houses that are with my father in the royal city where things are o my mansoul that eye hath not seen nor hath entered into the heart of man to conceive  besides o my mansoul thou seest what i have done and how i have taken thee out of the hands of thine enemies  unto whom thou hadst deeply revolted from my father and by whom thou wast content to be possessed and also to be destroyed  i came to thee first by my law then by my gospel to awaken thee and show thee my glory and thou knowest what thou wast what thou saidst what thou didst and how many times thou rebelledst against my father and me yet i left thee not as thou seest this day but came to thee have borne thy manners have waited upon thee and after all accepted of thee even of my mere grace and favour and would not suffer thee to be lost as thou most willingly wouldst have been  i also compassed thee about and afflicted thee on every side that i might make thee weary of thy ways and bring down thy heart with molestation to a willingness to close with thy good and happiness and when i had gotten a complete conquest over thee i turned it to thy advantage  thou seest also what a company of my fathers host i have lodged within thy borders  captains and rulers soldiers and men of war engines and excellent devices to subdue and bring down thy foes thou knowest my meaning o mansoul  and they are my servants and thine too mansoul  yea my design of possessing of thee with them and the natural tendency of each of them is to defend purge strengthen and sweeten thee for myself o mansoul and to make thee meet for my fathers presence blessing and glory for thou my mansoul art created to be prepared unto these  thou seest moreover my mansoul how i have passed by thy backslidings and have healed thee  indeed i was angry with thee but i have turned mine anger away from thee because i loved thee still and mine anger and mine indignation is ceased in the destruction of thine enemies o mansoul  nor did thy goodness fetch me again unto thee after that i for thy transgressions have hid my face and withdrawn my presence from thee  the way of backsliding was thine but the way and means of thy recovery was mine  i invented the means of thy return it was i that made an hedge and a wall when thou wast beginning to turn to things in which i delighted not  it was i that made thy sweet bitter thy day night thy smooth way thorny and that also confounded all that sought thy destruction  it was i that set mr godlyfear to work in mansoul  it was i that stirred up thy conscience and understanding thy will and thy affections after thy great and woful decay  it was i that put life into thee o mansoul to seek me that thou mightest find me and in thy finding find thine own health happiness and salvation  it was i that fetched the second time the diabolonians out of mansoul and it was i that overcame them and that destroyed them before thy face  and now my mansoul i am returned to thee in peace and thy transgressions against me are as if they had not been  nor shall it be with thee as in former days but i will do better for thee than at thy beginning  for yet a little while o my mansoul even after a few more times are gone over thy head i will but be not thou troubled at what i say take down this famous town of mansoul stick and stone to the ground  and i will carry the stones thereof and the timber thereof and the walls thereof and the dust thereof and the inhabitants thereof into mine own country even into a kingdom of my father and will there set it up in such strength and glory as it never did see in the kingdom where now it is placed  i will even there set it up for my fathers habitation for for that purpose it was at first erected in the kingdom of universe and there will i make it a spectacle of wonder a monument of mercy and the admirer of its own mercy  there shall the natives of mansoul see all that of which they have seen nothing here  there shall they be equal to those unto whom they have been inferior here  and there shalt thou o my mansoul have such communion with me with my father and with your lord secretary as it is not possible here to be enjoyed nor ever could be shouldest thou live in universe the space of a thousand years  and there o my mansoul thou shalt be afraid of murderers no more of diabolonians and their threats no more  there there shall be no more plots nor contrivances nor designs against thee o my mansoul  there thou shalt no more hear the eviltidings or the noise of the diabolonian drum  there thou shalt not see the diabolonian standardbearers nor yet behold diaboluss standard no diabolonian mount shall be cast up against thee there nor shall there the diabolonian standard be set up to make thee afraid there thou shalt not need captains engines soldiers and men of war  there thou shalt meet with no sorrow nor grief nor shall it be possible that any diabolonian should again for ever be able to creep into thy skirts burrow in thy walls or be seen again within thy borders all the days of eternity  life shall there last longer than here you are able to desire it should and yet it shall always be sweet and new nor shall any impediment attend it for ever  there o mansoul thou shalt meet with many of those that have been like thee and that have been partakers of thy sorrows even such as i have chosen and redeemed and set apart as thou for my fathers court and cityroyal  all they will be glad in thee and thou when thou seest them shalt be glad in thine heart  there are things o mansoul even things of my fathers providing and mine that never were seen since the beginning of the world and they are laid up with my father and sealed up among his treasures for thee till thou shalt come thither to enjoy them  i told you before that i would remove my mansoul and set it up elsewhere and where i will set it there are those that love thee and those that rejoice in thee now but how much more when they shall see thee exalted to honour  my father will then send them for you to fetch you and their bosoms are chariots to put you in and you o my mansoul shall ride upon the wings of the wind  they will come to convey conduct and bring you to that when your eyes see more that will be your desired haven  and thus o my mansoul i have showed unto thee what shall be done to thee hereafter if thou canst hear if thou canst understand and now i will tell thee what at present must be thy duty and practice until i come and fetch thee to myself according as is related in the scriptures of truth  first i charge thee that thou dost hereafter keep more white and clean the liveries which i gave thee before my last withdrawing from thee  do it i say for this will be thy wisdom  they are in themselves fine linen but thou must keep them white and clean this will be your wisdom your honour and will be greatly for my glory  when your garments are white the world will count you mine  also when your garments are white then i am delighted in your ways for then your goings to and fro will be like a flash of lightning that those that are present must take notice of also their eyes will be made to dazzle thereat  deck thyself therefore according to my bidding and make thyself by my law straight steps for thy feet so shall thy king greatly desire thy beauty for he is thy lord and worship thou him  now that thou mayest keep them as i bid thee i have as i before did tell thee provided for thee an open fountain to wash thy garments in  look therefore that thou wash often in my fountain and go not in defiled garments for as it is to my dishonour and my disgrace so it will be to thy discomfort when you shall walk in filthy garments  let not therefore my garments your garments the garments that i gave thee be defiled or spotted by the flesh keep thy garments always white and let thy head lack no ointment  my mansoul i have ofttimes delivered thee from the designs plots attempts and conspiracies of diabolus and for all this i ask thee nothing but that thou render not to me evil for my good but that thou bear in mind my love and the continuation of my kindness to my beloved mansoul so as to provoke thee to walk in thy measure according to the benefit bestowed on thee  of old the sacrifices were bound with coords to the horns of the altar consider what is said to thee o my blessed mansoul  o my mansoul i have lived i have died i live and will die no more for thee  i live that thou mayest not die  because i live thou shalt live also  i reconciled thee to my father by the blood of my cross and being reconciled thou shalt live through me  i will pray for thee i will fight for thee i will yet do thee good  nothing can hurt thee but sin nothing can grieve me but sin nothing can make thee base before thy foes but sin  take heed of sin my mansoul  and dost thou know why i at first and do still suffer diabolonians to dwell in thy walls o mansoul  it is to keep thee wakening to try thy love to make thee watchful and to cause thee yet to prize my noble captains their soldiers and my mercy  it is also that yet thou mayest be made to remember what a deplorable condition thou once wast in  i mean when not some but all did dwell not in thy walls but in thy castle and in thy stronghold o mansoul  o my mansoul should i slay all them within many there be without that would bring thee into bondage for were all these within cut off those without would find thee sleeping and then as in a moment they would swallow up my mansoul  i therefore left them in thee not to do thee hurt the which they yet will if thou hearken to them and serve them but to do thee good the which they must if thou watch and fight against them  know therefore that whatever they shall tempt thee to my design is that they should drive thee not further off but nearer to my father to learn thee war to make petitioning desirable to thee and to make thee little in thine own eyes  hearken diligently to this my mansoul  show me then thy love my mansoul and let not those that are within thy walls take thy affections off from him that hath redeemed thy soul  yea let the sight of a diabolonian heighten thy love to me  i came once and twice and thrice to save thee from the poison of those arrows that would have wrought thy death stand for me thy friend my mansoul against the diabolonians and i will stand for thee before my father and all his court  love me against temptation and i will love

till i come
