15318476	ships company  by ww jacobs    friends in need   r joseph gibbs finished his halfpint in the private bar of the red lion with the slowness of a man unable to see where the next was coming from and placing the mug on the counter filled his pipe from a small paper of tobacco and shook his head slowly at his companions  first ive ad since ten oclock this morning he said in a hard voice  cheer up said mr george brown  it cant go on for ever said bob kidd encouragingly  all i ask foris work said mr gibbs impressively  not slavery mind yer but work  its rather difficult to distinguish

feel like to make a hole in the water  lots o chaps do do it said mr brown musingly  and leave their wives and families to starve said mr gibbs icily  very often the wife is better off said his friend  its one mouth less for her to feed  besides she genrally gets something  when pore old bill went they ad a friendly lead at the kings head and got his missis pretty nearly seventeen pounds  and i believe wed get more than that for your old woman said mr kidd  theres no kids and she could keep erself easy  not that i want to encourage you to make away with yourself  mr gibbs scowled and tilting his mug peered gloomily into the interior  joe wont make no ole in the water said mr brown wagging his head if it was beer now  mr gibbs turned and drawing himself up to five feet three surveyed the speaker with an offensive stare  i dont see why he need make a ole in anything said mr kidd slowly it ud do just as well if we said he ad  then we could pass the hat round and share it  divide it into three halves and each ave one said mr brown nodding but ow is it to be done  ave some more beer and think it over said mr kidd pale with excitement  three pints please  he and mr brown took up their pints and nodded at each other  mr gibbs toying idly with the handle of his eyed them carefully  mind im not promising anything he said slowly  understand i aint acommitting of myself by drinking this ere pint  you leave it to me joe said mr kidd  mr gibbs left it to him after a discussion in which pints played a persuasive part with the result that mr brown sitting in the same bar the next evening with two or three friends was rudely disturbed by the cyclonic entrance of mr kidd who dripping with water sank on a bench and breathed heavily  whats up  whats the matter  demanded several voices  its joepoor joe gibbs said mr kidd  i was on smiths wharf shifting that lighter to the next berth and o course joe must come aboard to help  he was shoving her off with is foot when  he broke off and shuddered and accepting a mug of beer pending the arrival of some brandy that a sympathizer had ordered drank it slowly  it all appened in a flash he said looking round  by the time i ad run round to his end he was just going down for the third time  i hung over the side and grabbed at im and his collar and tie came off in my hand  nearly went in i did  he held out the collar and tie and approving notice was taken of the fact that he was soaking wet from the top of his head to the middle button of his waistcoat  pore chap  said the landlord leaning over the bar  he was in ere only arf an hour ago standing in this very bar  well hes ad his last drop o beer said a carman in a chastened voice  thats more than anybody can say said the landlord sharply  i never heard anything against the man hes led a good life so far as i know and ow can we tell that he wont ave beer  he made mr kidd a present of another small glass of brandy  he didnt leave any family did he he inquired as he passed it over  only a wife said mr kidd and whos to tell that pore soul i dont know  she fair doated on im  ow shes to live i dont know  i shall do what i can for er  same ere said mr brown in a deep voice  something ought to be done for er said the carman as he went out  first thing is to tell the police said the landlord  they ought to know then praps one of themll tell her  its what theyre paid for  its so awfully sudden  i dont know where i am ardly said mr kidd i dont believe shes got a pennypiece in the ouse  pore joe ad a lot o pals  i wonder whether we couldnt get up something for her  go round and tell the police first said the landlord pursing up his lips thoughtfully  we can talk about that later on  mr kidd thanked him warmly and withdrew accompanied by mr brown twenty minutes later they left the station considerably relieved at the matteroffact way in which the police had received the tidings and hurrying across london bridge made their way towards a small figure supporting its back against a post in the borough market  well  said mr gibbs snappishly as he turned at the sound of their footsteps  itll be all right joe said mr kidd  weve sowed the seed  sowed the wot  demanded the other  mr kidd explained  ho  said mr gibbs  an while your precious seed is acoming up wot am i to do  wot about my comfortable ome  wot about my bed and grub  his two friends looked at each other uneasily  in the excitement of the arrangements they had for gotten these things and a long and sometimes painful experience of mr gibbs showed them only too plainly where they were drifting  youll ave to get a bed this side o the river somewhere said mr brown slowly  coffeeshop or something and a smart active man wot keeps his eyes open can always pick up a little money  mr gibbs laughed  and mind said mr kidd furiously in reply to the laugh anything we lend you is to be paid back out of your half when you get it  and wots more you dont get a hapenny till youve come into a barbers shop and ad them whiskers off  we dont want no accidents  mr gibbs with his back against the post fought for his whiskers for nearly half an hour and at the end of that time was led into a barbers and in a state of sullen indignation proffered his request for a clean shave  he gazed at the barefaced creature that confronted him in the glass after the operation in openeyed consternation and messrs  kidd and browns politeness easily gave way before their astonishment  well i may as well have a aircut while im here said mr gibbs after a lengthy survey  and a shampoo sir  said the assistant  just as you like said mr gibbs turning a deaf ear to the frenzied expostulations of his financial backers  wot is it  illustration mr gibbs with his back against the post fought for nearly half an hour  he sat in amazed discomfort during the operation and emerging with his friends remarked that he felt half a stone lighter  the information was received in stony silence and having spent some time in the selection they found a quiet publichouse and in a retired corner formed themselves into a committee of ways and means  thatll do for you to go on with said mr kidd after he and mr brown had each made a contribution and mind its coming off of your share  mr gibbs nodded  and any evening you want to see me youll find me in here he remarked  beers ripping  now youd better go and see my old woman  the two friends departed and to their great relief found a little knot of people outside the abode of mrs gibbs  it was clear that the news had been already broken and pushing their way upstairs they found the widow with a damp handkerchief in her hand surrounded by attentive friends  in feeble accents she thanked mr kidd for his noble attempts at rescue  he aint dry yet said mr brown  i done wot i could said mr kidd simply  pore joe  nobody could ha had a better pal  nobody  always ready to lend a helping and to them as was in trouble he was said mr brown looking round  ear ear  said a voice  and well lend im a helping and said mr kidd energetically  we cant do im no good pore chap but we can try and do something for er as is left behind  he moved slowly to the door accompanied by mr brown and catching the eye of one or two of the men beckoned them to follow  under his able guidance a small but gradually increasing crowd made its way to the red lion for the next three or four days the friends worked unceasingly cards stating that a friendly lead would be held at the red lion for the benefit of the widow of the late mr joseph gibbs were distributed broadcast and anecdotes portraying a singularly rare and beautiful character obtained an even wider circulation  too late wapping realized the benevolent disposition and the kindly but unobtrusive nature that had departed from it for ever  mr gibbs from his retreat across the water fully shared his friends enthusiasm but an insane desireengendered by vanityto be present at the function was a source of considerable trouble and annoyance to them when he offered to black his face and take part in the entertainment as a nigger minstrel mr kidd had to be led outside and kept there until such time as he could converse in english pure and undefiled  getting above imself thats wot it is said mr brown as they wended their way home  hes having too much money out of us to spend but it wont be for long now  hes having a lords life of it while were slaving ourselves to death grumbled mr kidd  i never seeim looking so fat and well  by rights he oughtnt to ave the same share as wot were going to ave he aint doing none of the work  his illhumour lasted until the night of the lead which largely owing to the presence of a sporting fishmonger who had done well at the races that day and some of his friends realized a sum far beyond the expectations of the hardworking promoters  the fishmonger led off by placing a fivepound note in the plate and the packed audience breathed so hard that the plateholders responsibility began to weigh upon his spirits  in all a financial tribute of thirtyseven pounds three and fourpence was paid to the memory of the late mr gibbs  over twelve quid apiece said the delighted mr kidd as he bade his coworker good night  sounds too good to be true  the next day passed all too slowly but work was over at last and mr kidd led the way over london bridge a yard or two ahead of the more phlegmatic mr brown  mr gibbs was in his old corner at the wheelwrights arms and instead of going into ecstasies over the sum realized hinted darkly that it would have been larger if he had been allowed to have had a hand in it  itll ardly pay me for my trouble he said shaking his head  its very dull over ere all alone by myself  by the time you two have ad your share besides taking wot i owe you therell be ardly anything left  ill talk to you another time said mr kidd regarding him fixedly wot youve got to do now is to come acrost the river with us  what for  demanded mr gibbs  were going to break the joyful news to your old woman that youre alive afore she starts spending money wot isnt hers said mr kidd  and we want you to be close by in case she dont believe us  well do it gentle mind said the fond husband  we dont want er screaming or anything o that sort  i know er better than wot you do and my advice to you is to go easy  he walked along by the side of them and after some demur consented as a further disguise to put on a pair of spectacles for which mr kidds wifes mother had been hunting high and low since eight oclock that morning  you doddle about ere for ten minutes said mr kidd as they reached the monument and then foller on  when you pass a lamppost old your handkerchief up to your face  and wait for us at the corner of your road till we come for you  he went off at a brisk pace with mr brown a pace moderated to one of almost funeral solemnity as they approached the residence of mrs gibbs to their relief she was alone and after the usual amenities thanked them warmly for all they had done for her  id do more than that for pore joe said mr brown  theythey avent found im yet  said the widow  mr kidd shook his head  my idea is they wont find im he said slowly  went down on the ebb tide explained mr brown and spoilt mr kidds opening  wherever he is es better off said mrs gibbs  no more trouble about being out o work no more worry no more pain weve all got to go some day  yes began mr kidd but  im sure i dont wish im back said mrs gibbs that would be sinful  but ow if he wanted to come back  said mr kidd playing for an opening  and elp you spend that money said mr brown ignoring the scowls of his friend  mrs gibbs looked bewildered  spend the money she began  suppose said mr kidd suppose he wasnt drownded after all  only last night i dreamt he was alive  so did i said mr brown  he was smiling at me said mr kidd in a tender voice  bob he ses go and tell my pore missis that im alive he ses break it to er gentle  its the very words he said to me in my dream said mr brown  bit strange aint it  very said mrs gibbs  i suppose said mr kidd after a pause i suppose you havent been dreaming about im  no im a teetotaller said the widow  the two gentlemen exchanged glances and mr kidd ever of an impulsive nature resolved to bring matters to a head  wot would you do if joe was to come in ere at this door  he asked  scream the house down said the widow promptly  screamscream the ouse down  said the distressed mr kidd  mrs gibbs nodded  i should go screaming raving mad she said with conviction  butbut not if e was alive  said mr kidd  i dont know what youre driving at said mrs gibbs  why dont you speak out plain  poor joe is drownded you know that you saw it all and yet you come talking to me about dreams and things  mr kidd bent over her and put his hand affectionately on her shoulder he escaped he said in a thrilling whisper  hes alive and well  what said mrs gibbs starting back  true as i stand ere said mr kidd aint it george  truer said mr brown loyally  mrs gibbs leaned back gasping  alive she said  but ow  ow can he be  dont make such a noise said mr kidd earnestly  mind if anybody else gets to ear of it youll ave to give that money back  id give more than that to get im back said mrs gibbs wildly  i believe youre deceiving me  true as i stand ere asseverated the other  hes only a minute or two off and if it wasnt for you screaming id go out and fetch im in  i wont scream said mrs gibbs not if i know its flesh and blood oh where is he  why dont you bring im in  let me go to im  all right said mr kidd with a satisfied smile at mr brown all in good time  ill go and fetch im now but mind if you scream youll spoil everything  he bustled cheerfully out of the room and downstairs and mrs gibbs motioning mr brown to silence stood by the door with parted lips waiting  three or four minutes elapsed  ere they come said mr brown as footsteps sounded on the stairs now no screaming mind  mrs gibbs drew back and to the gratification of all concerned did not utter a sound as mr kidd followed by her husband entered the room she stood looking expectantly towards the doorway  where is he  she gasped  eh  said mr kidd in a startled voice  why here  dont you know im  its me susan said mr gibbs in a low voice  oh i might ave known it was a joke cried mrs gibbs in a faint voice as she tottered to a chair  ohow cruel of you to tell me my pore joe was alive  oh ow could you  lor lumme said the incensed mr kidd pushing mr gibbs forward here he is  same as you saw im last except for is whiskers  dont make that sobbing noise peoplell be coming in  oh  oh  oh  take im away cried mrs gibbs  go and play your tricks with somebody elses broken art  but its your husband said mr brown  take im away wailed mrs gibbs  mr kidd grinding his teeth tried to think  ave you got any marks on your body joe  he inquired  i aint got a mark on me said mr gibbs with a satisfied air or a blemish  my skin is as whi  thats enough about your skin interrupted mr kidd rudely  if you aint all of you gone before i count ten said mrs gibbs in a suppressed voice ill scream  ow dare you come into a respectable womans place and talk about your skins  are you going  one  two three  four  five  her voice rose with each numeral and mr gibbs himself led the way downstairs and followed by his friends slipped nimbly round the corner  its a wonder she didnt rouse the whole ouse he said wiping his brow on his sleeve and where should we ha been then  i thought at the time it was a mistake you making me ave my whiskers off but i let you know best  shes never seen me without em  i ad a remarkable strong growth when i was quite a boy  while other boys was  shutup  vociferated mr kidd  shant  said mr gibbs defiantly  ive ad enough of being away from my comfortable little ome and my wife and im going to let em start growing agin this very night  shell never reckernize me without em thats certain  hes right bob said mr brown with conviction  dye mean to tell me weve got to wait till is blasted whiskers grow cried mr kidd almost dancing with fury  and go on keeping im in idleness till they do  youll get it all back out o my share said mr gibbs with dignity but you can please yourself  if you like to call it quits now i dont mind  mr brown took his seething friend aside and conferred with him in low but earnest tones  mr gibbs with an indifferent air stood by whistling softly  ow long will they take to grow  inquired mr kidd turning to him with a growl  mr gibbs shrugged his shoulders  cant say he replied but i should think two or three weeks would be enough for er to reckernize me by  if she dont we must wait another week or so thats all  well there wont be much o your share left mind that said mr kidd glowering at him  i cant help it said mr gibbs  you neednt keep reminding me of it  they walked the rest of the way in silence and for the next fortnight mr gibbss friends paid nightly visits to note the change in his appearance and grumble at its slowness  well try and pull it off tomorrow night said mr kidd at the end of that period  im fair sick o lending you money  mr gibbs shook his head and spoke sagely about not spoiling the ship for a haporth o tar but mr kidd was obdurate  theres enough for er to reckernize you by he said sternly and we dont want other people to  meet us at the monument at eight oclock tomorrow night and well get it over  give your orders said mr gibbs in a nasty voice  keep your at well over your eyes commanded mr kidd sternly  put them spectacles on wot i lent you and it wouldnt be a bad idea if you tied your face up in a piece o red flannel  i know wot im going to do without you telling me said mr gibbs nodding  ill bet you pots round that you dont either of you reckernize me tomorrow night  the bet was taken at once and from eight oclock until ten minutes to nine the following night messrs kidd and brown did their best to win it then did mr kidd turning to mr brown in perplexity inquire with many redundant words what it all meant  illustration gone exclaimed both gentlemen  where  he must ave gone on by imself said mr brown  wed better go and see  in a state of some disorder they hurried back to wapping and mounting the stairs to mrs gibbss room found the door fast  to their fervent and repeated knocking there was no answer  ah you wont make her ear said a woman thrusting an untidy head over the balusters on the next landing  shes gone  gone  exclaimed both gentlemen  where  canada said the woman  she went off this morning  mr kidd leaned up against the wall for support mr brown stood open mouthed and voiceless  it was a surprise to me said the woman but she told me this morning shes been getting ready on the quiet for the last fortnight  good spirits she was in too laughing like anything  laughing  repeated mr kidd in a terrible voice  the woman nodded  and when i spoke about it and reminded er that she ad only just lost er pore husband i thought she would ha burst she said severely  she sat down on that stair and laughed till the tears ran dowwn er face like water  mr brown turned a bewildered face upon his partner  laughing  he said slowly  wot ad she got to laugh at  two bornfools replied mr kidd
