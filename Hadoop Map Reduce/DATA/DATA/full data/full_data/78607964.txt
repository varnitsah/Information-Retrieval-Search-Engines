timeplenty of em but i cant truthfully say as ow any of them was the better for meeting me  he rose slowly from the packingcase on which he had been sitting and stamping down the point of a rusty nail with his heel resumed his seat remarking that he had endured it for some time under the impression that it was only a splinter  ive surprised more than one in my time he continued slowly  when i met one of these ere artful ones i used fust of all to pretend to be more stupid than wot i really am  he stopped and stared fixedly  more stupid than i looked he said  he stopped again  more stupid than wot they thought i looked he said speaking with marked deliberation  and id let em go on and on until i thought i had ad about enough and then turn round on em  nobody ever got the better o me except my wife and that was only before we was married  two nights arterwards she found a fishhook in my trouserpocket and arter that i could ha left untold gold thereif id ha had it  it spoilt wot some people call the honeymoon but it paid in the long run  one o the worst things a man can do is to take up artfulness all of a sudden  i never knew it to answer yet and i can tell you of a case thatll prove my words true  its some years ago now and the chap it appened to was a young man a shipmate o mine named charlie tagg  very steady young chap he was too steady for most of em  thats ow it was me and im got to be such pals  hed been saving up for years to get married and all the advice we could give im didnt ave any effect  he saved up nearly every penny of is money and gave it to his gal to keep for im and the time im speaking of shed got seventytwo pounds of is and seventeenandsix of er own to set up housekeeping with  then a thing happened that ive known to appen to sailormen afore  at sydney e got silly on another gal and started walking out with her and afore he knew wot he was about hed promised to marry er too  sydney and london being a long way from each other was in is favour but the thing that troubled im was ow to get that seventytwo pounds out of emma cook is london gal so as he could marry the other with it  it worried im all the way home and by the time we got into the london river is head was all in a maze with it  emma cook ad got it all saved up in the bank to take a little shop with when they got spliced and ow to get it he could not think  he went straight off to poplar where she lived as soon as the ship was berthed  he walked all the way so as to ave more time for thinking but wot with bumping into two old gentlemen with bad tempers and being nearly run over by a cabman with a white orse and red whiskers he got to the house without aving thought of anything  they was just finishing their tea as e got there and they all seemed so pleased to see im that it made it worse than ever for im  mrs cook who ad pretty near finished gave im her own cup to drink out of and said that she ad dreamt of im the night afore last and old cook said that he ad got so goodlooking e shouldnt ave known him  i should ave passed im in the street he ses  i never see such an alteration  theyll be a nicelooking couple ses his wife looking at a young chap named george smith that ad been sitting next to emma  charlie tagg filled is mouth with bread and butter and wondered ow he was to begin  he squeezed emmas and just for the sake of keeping up appearances and all the time e was thinking of the other gal waiting for im thousands o miles away  youve come ome just in the nick o time ses old cook if youd done it o purpose you couldnt ave arranged it better  somebodys birthday ses charlie trying to smile  old cook shook his ead  though mine is next wednesday he ses and thank you for thinking of it  no youre just in time for the biggest bargain in the chandlery line that anybody ever ad a chance of  if you adnt ha come back we should have ad to ha done it without you  eighty pounds ses mrs cook smiling at charlie  with the money emmas got saved and your wages this trip youll ave plenty  you must come round arter tea and ave a look at it  little place not arf a mile from ere ses old cook  properly worked up the way emmall do it itll be a little fortune  i wish id had a chance like it in my young time  he sat shaking his ead to think wot hed lost and charlie tagg sat staring at im and wondering wot he was to do  my idea is for charlie to go for a few more vyges arter theyre married while emma works up the business ses mrs cook shell be all right with young bill and sarah ann to elp her and keep er company while hes away  well see as she aint lonely ses george smith turning to charlie  charlie tagg gave a bit of a cough and said it wanted considering  he said it was no good doing things in a urry and then repenting of em all the rest of your life  and e said hed been given to understand that chandlery wasnt wot it ad been and some of the cleverest people e knew thought that it would be worse before it was better  by the time hed finished they was all looking at im as though they couldnt believe their ears  you just step round and ave a look at the place ses old cook if that dont make you alter your tune call me a sinner  charlie tagg felt as though e could ha called im a lot o worse things than that but he took up is hat and mrs cook and emma got their bonnets on and they went round  i dont think much of it for eighty pounds ses charlie beginning his artfulness as they came near a big shop with plateglass and a double front  eh ses old cook staring at im  why that aint the place  why you wouldnt get that for eight undred  well i dont think much of it ses charlie if its worse than that i cant look at iti cant indeed  you aint been drinking charlie ses old cook in a puzzled voice  certainly not ses charlie  he was pleased to see ow anxious they all looked and when they did come to the shop e set up a laugh that old cook said chilled the marrer in is bones  he stood looking in a elpless sort o way at his wife and emma and then at last he ses there it is and a fair bargain at the price  i spose you aint been drinking ses charlie  wots the matter with it ses mrs cook flaring up  come inside and look at it ses emma taking old of his arm  not me ses charlie hanging back  why i wouldnt take it at a gift  he stood there on the kerbstone and all they could do e wouldnt budge he said it was a bad road and a little shop and ad got a look about it he didnt like  they walked back ome like a funeral procession and emma ad to keep saying hs in wispers to er mother all the way  illustration he said it was a had road and a little shop and ad got a look about it he didnt like  i dont know wot charlie does want im sure ses mrs cook taking off er bonnet as soon as she got indoors and pitching it on the chair he was just going to set down on  its so awkard ses old cook rubbing his cad  fact is charlie we pretty near gave em to understand as wed buy it  its as good as settled ses mrs cook trembling all over with temper  they wont settle till they get the money ses charlie  you may make your mind easy about that  emmas drawn it all out of the bank ready ses old cook eager like  charlie felt ot and cold all over  id better take care of it he ses in a trembling voice  you might be robbed  so might you be ses mrs cook  dont you worry its in a safe place  sailormen are always being robbed ses george smith who ad been helping young bill with is sums while they ad gone to look at the shop theres more sailormen robbed than all the rest put together  they wont rob charlie ses mrs cook pressing er lips together ill take care o that  charlie tried to laugh but e made such a queer noise that young bill made a large blot on is exercisebook and old cook wot was lighting his pipe burnt is fingers through not looking wot e was doing  you see ses charlie if i was robbed which aint at all likely it ud only be me losing my own money but if you was robbed of it youd never forgive yourselves  i dessay i should get over it ses mrs cook sniffing  id ave a try at all events  charlie started to laugh agin and old cook who had struck another match blew it out and waited till hed finished  the whole truth is ses charlie looking round ive got something better to do with the money  ive got a chance offered me thatll make me able to double it afore you know where you are  not afore i know where i am ses mrs cook with a laugh that was worse than charlies  the chance of a lifetime ses charlie trying to keep is temper  i cant tell you wot it is because ive promised to keep it secret for a time  youll be surprised when i do tell you  if i wait till then till im surprised ses mrs cook i shall ave to wait a long time  my advice to you is to take that shop and ha done with it  charlie sat there arguing all the evening but it was no good and the idea o them people sitting there and refusing to let im have his own money pretty near sent im crazy  it was all e could do to kiss emma goodnight and e couldnt have elped slamming the front door if hed been paid for it  the only comfort he ad got left was the sydney gals photygraph and he took that out and looked at it under nearly every lamppost he passed  he went round the next night and ad another try to get is money but it was no use and all the good he done was to make mrs cook in such a temper that she ad to go to bed before he ad arf finished  it was no good talking to old cook and emma because they darent do anything without er and it was no good calling things up the stairs to her because she didnt answer  three nights running mrs cook went off to bed afore eight oclock for fear she should say something to im as shed be sorry for arterwards and for three nights charlie made imself so disagreeable that emma told im plain the sooner e went back to sea agin the better she should like it  the only one who seemed to enjoy it was george smith and e used to bring bits out o newspapers and read to em showing ow silly people was done out of their money  on the fourth night charlie dropped it and made imself so amiable that mrs cook stayed up and made im a welsh rarebit for is supper and made im drink two glasses o beer instead o one while old cook sat and drank three glasses o water just out of temper and to show that e didnt mind  when she started on the chandlers shop agin charlie said hed think it over and when e went away mrs cook called im her sailorboy and wished im pleasant dreams  but charlie tagg ad got better things to do than to dream and e sat up in bed arf the night thinking out a new plan hed thought of to get that money  when e did fall asleep at last e dreamt of taking a little farm in australia and riding about on orseback with the sydney gal watching his men at work  in the morning he went and hunted up a shipmate of is a young feller named jack bates  jack was one o these ere chaps nobodys enemy but their own as the saying is a goodarted freeanded chap as you could wish to see  everybody liked im and the ships cat loved im  hed ha sold the shirt off is back to oblige a pal and three times in one week he got is face scratched for trying to prevent usbands knocking their wives about  charlie tagg went to im because he was the only man e could trust and for over arf an hour he was telling jack bates all is troubles and at last as a great favour he let im see the sydney gals photygraph and told him that all that pore gals future appiness depended upon im  ill step round tonight and rob em of that seventytwo pounds ses jack its your money and youve a right to it  charlie shook his ead  that wouldnt do he ses besides i dont know where they keep it  no ive got a better plan than that  come round to the crooked billet so as we can talk it over in peace and quiet  he stood jack three or four arfpints afore e told im his plan and jack was so pleased with it that he wanted to start at once but charlie persuaded im to wait  and dont you spare me mind out o friendship ses charlie because the blacker you paint me the better i shall like it  you trust me mate ses jack bates if i dont get that seventytwo pounds for you you may call me a dutchman  why its fair robbery i call it sticking to your money like that  they spent the rest o the day together and when evening came charlie went off to the cooks  emma ad arf expected they was going to a theayter that night but charlie said he wasnt feeling the thing and he sat there so quiet and miserable they didnt know wot to make of im  ave you got any trouble on your mind charlie ses mrs cook or is it the toothache  it aint the toothache ses charlie  he sat there pulling a long face and staring at the floor but all mrs cook and emma could do e wouldnt tell them wot was the matter with im he said e didnt want to worry other people with is troubles let everybody bear their own that was is motto  even when george smith offered to go to the theayter with emma instead of im he didnt fire up and if it adnt ha been for mrs cook george wouldnt ha been sorry that e spoke  theayters aint for me ses charlie with a groan  im more likely to go to gaol so far as i can see than a theayter  mrs cook and emma both screamed and sarah ann did er first highstericks and very well too considering that she ad only just turned fifteen  gaol ses old cook as soon as they ad quieted sarah ann with a bowl o cold water that young bill ad the presence o mind to go and fetch gaol  what for  you wouldnt believe if i was to tell you  ses charlie getting up to go and besides i dont want any of you to think as ow i am worse than wot i am  he shook his cad at them sorrowfullike and afore they could stop im he ad gone  old cook shouted arter im but it was no use and the others was running into the scullery to fill the bowl agin for emma  mrs cook went round to is lodgings next morning but found that e was out  they began to fancy all sorts o things then but charlie turned up agin that evening more miserable than ever  i went round to see you this morning ses mrs cook but you wasnt at ome  i never am ardly ses charlie  i cant beit aint safe  why not ses mrs cook fidgeting  if i was to tell you youd lose your good opinion of me ses charlie  it wouldnt be much to lose ses mrs cook firing up  charlie didnt answer er  when he did speak he spoke to the old man and he was so downarted that e gave im the chills amost he ardly took any notice of emma and when mrs cook spoke about the shop agin said that chandlers shops was for happy people not for im  by the time they sat down to supper they was nearly all as miserable as charlie imself  from words he let drop they all seemed to ave the idea that the police was arter im and mrs cook was just asking im for wot she called the third and last time but wot was more likely the hundred and third wot hed done when there was a knock at the front door so loud and so sudden that old cook and young bill both cut their mouths at the same time  anybody ere o
