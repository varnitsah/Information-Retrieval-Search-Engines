82844667	mosses from an old manse                        by nathaniel hawthorne                         the old apple dealer    the lover of the moral picturesque may sometimes find what he seeks in a character which is nevertheless of too negative a description to be seized upon and represented to the imaginative vision by wordpainting  as an instance i remember an old man who carries on a little trade of gingerbread and apples at the depot of one of our railroads  while awaiting the departure of the cars my observation flitting to and fro among the livelier characteristics of the scene has often settled insensibly upon this almost hueless object  thus unconsciously to myself and unsuspected by him i have studied the old appledealer until he has become a naturalized citizen of my inner world  how little would he imaginepoor neglected friendless unappreciated and with little that demands appreciationthat the mental eye of an utter stranger has so often reverted to his figure  many a noble form many a beautiful face has flitted before me and vanished like a shadow  it is a strange witchcraft whereby this faded and featureless old appledealer has gained a settlement in my memory  he is a small man with gray hair and gray stubble beard and is invariably clad in a shabby surtout of snuffcolor closely buttoned and half concealing a pair of gray pantaloons the whole dress though clean and entire being evidently flimsy with much wear  his face thin withered furrowed and with features which even age has failed to render impressive has a frostbitten aspect it is a moral frost which no physical warmth or comfortableness could counteract  the summer sunshine may fling its white heat upon him or the good fire of the depot room may slake him the focus of its blaze on a winters day but all in vain for still the old roan looks as if he were in a frosty atmosphere with scarcely warmth enough to keep life in the region about his heart  it is a patient longsuffering quiet hopeless shivering aspect  he is not desperatethat though its etymology implies no more would be too positive an expressionbut merely devoid of hope  as all his past life probably offers no spots of brightness to his memory so he takes his present poverty and discomfort as entirely a matter of course he thinks it the definition of existence so far as himself is concerned to be poor cold and uncomfortable  it may be added that time has not thrown dignity as a mantle over the old mans figure there is nothing venerable about him you pity him without a scruple  he sits on a bench in the depot room and before him on the floor are deposited two baskets of a capacity to contain his whole stock in trade  across from one basket to the other extends a board on which is displayed a plate of cakes and gingerbread some russet and redcheeked apples and a box containing variegated sticks of candy together with that delectable condiment known by children as gibraltar rock neatly done up in white paper  there is likewise a halfpeck measure of cracked walnuts and two or three tin halfpints or gills filled with the nutkernels ready for purchasers  such are the small commodities with which our old friend comes daily before the world ministering to its petty needs and little freaks of appetite and seeking thence the solid subsistenceso far as he may subsist of his life  a slight observer would speak of the old mans quietude but on closer scrutiny you discover that there is a continual unrest within him which somewhat resembles the fluttering action of the nerves in a corpse from which life has recently departed  though he never exhibits any violent action and indeed might appear to be sitting quite still yet you perceive when his minuter peculiarities begin to be detected that he is always making some little movement or other  he looks anxiously at his plate of cakes or pyramid of apples and slightly alters their arrangement with an evident idea that a great deal depends on their being disposed exactly thus and so  then for a moment he gazes out of the window then he shivers quietly and folds his arms across his breast as if to draw himself closer within himself and thus keep a flicker of warmth in his lonesome heart  now he turns again to his merchandise of cakes apples and candy and discovers that this cake or that apple or yonder stick of red and white candy has somehow got out of its proper position  and is there not a walnutkernel too many or too few in one of those small tin measures  again the whole arrangement appears to be settled to his mind but in the course of a minute or two there will assuredly be something to set right  at times by an indescribable shadow upon his features too quiet however to be noticed until you are familiar with his ordinary aspect the expression of frostbitten patient despondency becomes very touching  it seems as if just at that instant the suspicion occurred to him that in his chill decline of life earning scanty bread by selling cakes apples and candy he is a very miserable old fellow  but if he thinks so it is a mistake  he can never suffer the extreme of misery because the tone of his whole being is too much subdued for him to feel anything acutely  occasionally one of the passengers to while away a tedious interval approaches the old man inspects the articles upon his board and even peeps curiously into the two baskets  another striding to and fro along the room throws a look at the apples and gingerbread at every turn  a third it may be of a more sensitive and delicate texture of being glances shyly thitherward cautious not to excite expectations of a purchaser while yet undetermined whether to buy  but there appears to be no need of such a scrupulous regard to our old friends feelings true he is conscious of the remote possibility to sell a cake or an apple but innumerable disappointments have rendered him so far a philosopher that even if the purchased article should be returned he will consider it altogether in the ordinary train of events  he speaks to none and makes no sign of offering his wares to the public not that he is deterred by pride but by the certain conviction that such demonstrations would not increase his custom  besides this activity in business would require an energy that never could have been a characteristic of his almost passive disposition even in youth  whenever an actual customer customer appears the old man looks up with a patient eye if the price and the article are approved he is ready to make change otherwise his eyelids droop again sadly enough but with no heavier despondency than before  he shivers perhaps folds his lean arms around his lean body and resumes the lifelong frozen patience in which consists his strength  once in a while a schoolboy comes hastily up places cent or two upon the board and takes up a cake or stick of candy or a measure of walnuts or an apple as redchecked as himself  there are no words as to price that being as well known to the buyer as to the seller  the old appledealer never speaks an unnecessary word not that he is sullen and morose but there is none of the cheeriness and briskness in him that stirs up people to talk  not seldom he is greeted by some old neighbor a man well to do in the world who makes a civil patronizing observation about the weather and then by way of performing a charitable deed begins to chaffer for an apple  our friend presumes not on any past acquaintance he makes the briefest possible response to all general remarks and shrinks quietly into himself again  after every diminution of his stock he takes care to produce from the basket another cake another stick of candy another apple or another measure of walnuts to supply the place of the article sold  two or three attemptsor perchance half a dozenare requisite before the board can be rearranged to his satisfaction if he have received a silver coin he waits till the purchaser is out of sight then examines it closely and tries to bend it with his finger and thumb finally he puts it into his waistcoatpocket with seemingly a gentle sigh  this sigh so faint as to be hardly perceptible and not expressive of any definite emotion is the accompaniment and conclusion of all his actions it is the symbol of the chillness and torpid melancholy of his old age which only make themselves felt sensibly when his repose is slightly disturbed  our man of gingerbread and apples is not a specimen of the needy man who has seen better days  doubtless there have been better and brighter days in the faroff time of his youth but none with so much sunshine of prosperity in them that the chill the depression the narrowness of means in his declining years can have come upon him by surprise  his life has all been of a piece  his subdued and nerveless boyhood prefigured his abortive prime which likewise contained within itself the prophecy and image of his lean and torpid age  he was perhaps a mechanic who never came to be a master in his craft or a petty tradesman rubbing onward between passably to do and poverty  possibly he may look back to some brilliant epoch of his career when there were a hundred or two of dollars to his credit in the savings bank  such must have been the extent of his better fortunehis little measure of this worlds triumphsall that he has known of success  a meek downcast humble uncomplaining creature he probably has never felt himself entitled to more than so much of the gifts of providence  is it not still something that he has never held out his hand for charity nor has yet been driven to that sad home and household of earths forlorn and brokenspirited children the almshouse  he cherishes no quarrel therefore with his destiny nor with the author of it all is as it should be  if indeed he have been bereaved of a son a bold energetic vigorous young man on whom the fathers feeble nature leaned as on a staff of strength in that case he may have felt a bitterness that could not otherwise have been generated in his heart  but methinks the joy of possessing such a son and the agony of losing him would have developed the old mans moral and intellectual nature to a much greater degree than we now find it intense grief appears to be as much out of keeping with his life as fervid happiness  to confess the truth it is not the easiest matter in the world to define and individualize a character like this which we are now handling  the portrait must be so generally negative that the most delicate pencil is likely to spoil it by introducing some too positive tint  every touch must be kept down or else you destroy the subdued tone which is absolutely essential to the whole effect perhaps more may be done by contrast than by direct description for this purpose i make use of another cake and candy merchant who likewise infests the railroad depot this latter worthy is a very smart and welldressed boy of ten years old or thereabouts who skips briskly hither and thither addressing the passengers in a pert voice yet with somewhat of good breeding in his tone and pronunciation  now he has caught my eye and skips across the room with a pretty pertness which i should like to correct with a box on the ear  any cake sir any candy  no none for me my lad  i did but glance at your brisk figure in order to catch a reflected light and throw it upon your old rival yonder  again in order to invest my conception of the old man with a more decided sense of reality i look at him in the very moment of intensest bustle on the arrival of the cars  the shriek of the engine as it rushes into the carhouse is the utterance of the steam fiend whom man has subdued by magic spells and compels to serve as a beast of burden  he has skimmed rivers in his headlong rush dashed through forests plunged into the hearts of mountains and glanced from the city to the desertplace and again to a faroff city with a meteoric progress seen and out of sight while his reverberating roar still fills the ear  the travellers swarm forth from the cars  all are full of the momentum which they have caught from their mode of conveyance it seems as if the whole world both morally and physically were detached from its old standfasts and set in rapid motion  and in the midst of this terrible activity there sits the old man of gingerbread so subdued so hopeless so without a stake in life and yet not positively miserablethere he sits the forlorn old creature one chill and sombre day after another gathering scanty coppers for his cakes apples and candythere sits the old appledealer in his threadbare suit of snuffcolor and gray and his grizzly stubble heard  see he folds his lean arms around his lean figure with that quiet sigh and that scarcely perceptible shiver which are the tokens of his inward state  i have him now  he and the steam fiend are each others antipodes the latter is the type of all that go ahead and the old man the representative of that melancholy class who by some sad witchcraft are doomed never to share in the worlds exulting progress  thus the contrast between mankind and this desolate brother becomes picturesque and even sublime  and now farewell old friend  little do you suspect that a student of human life has made your character the theme of more than one solitary and thoughtful hour  many would say that you have hardly individuality enough to be the object of your own selflove  how then can a strangers eye detect anything in your mind and heart to study and to wonder at  yet could i read but a tithe of what is written there it would be a volume of deeper and more comprehensive import than all that the wisest mortals have given to the world for the soundless depths of the human soul and of eternity have an opening through your breast god be praised were it only for your sake that the present shapes of human existence are not cast in iron nor hewn in everlasting adamant but moulded of the vapors that vanish away while the essence flits upward to the infinite  there is a spiritual essence in this gray and lean old shape that shall flit upward too  yes doubtless there is a region where the lifelong shiver will pass away from his being and that quiet sigh which it has taken him so many years to breathe will be brought to a close for good and all
