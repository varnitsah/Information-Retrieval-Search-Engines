40600674	the portrait of a lady  volume ii of ii   by henry james     chapter xxviii  on the morrow in the evening lord warburton went again to see his friends at their hotel and at this establishment he learned that they had gone to the opera he drove to the opera with the idea of paying them a visit in their box after the easy italian fashion and when he had obtained his admittanceit was one of the secondary theatreslooked about the large bare illlighted house an act had just terminated and he was at liberty to pursue his quest after scanning two or three tiers of boxes he perceived in one of the largest of these receptacles a lady whom he easily recognised miss archer was seated facing the stage and partly screened by the curtain of the box and beside her leaning back in his chair was mr gilbert osmond they appeared to have the place to themselves and warburton supposed their companions had taken advantage of the recess to enjoy the relative coolness of the lobby he stood a while with his eyes on the interesting pair he asked himself if he should go up and interrupt the harmony at last he judged that isabel had seen him and this accident determined him there should be no marked holding off he took his way to the upper regions and on the staircase met ralph touchett slowly descending his hat at the inclination of ennui and his hands where they usually were  i saw you below a moment since and was going down to you i feel lonely and want company was ralphs greeting  youve some thats very good which youve yet deserted  do you mean my cousin oh she has a visitor and doesnt want me then miss stackpole and bantling have gone out to a cafe to eat an icemiss stackpole delights in an ice i didnt think they wanted me either the operas very bad the women look like laundresses and sing like peacocks i feel very low  you had better go home lord warburton said without affectation  and leave my young lady in this sad place ah no i must watch over her  she seems to have plenty of friends  yes thats why i must watch said ralph with the same large mockmelancholy  if she doesnt want you its probable she doesnt want me  no youre different go to the box and stay there while i walk about  lord warburton went to the box where isabels welcome was as to a friend so honourably old that he vaguely asked himself what queer temporal province she was annexing he exchanged greetings with mr osmond to whom he had been introduced the day before and who after he came in sat blandly apart and silent as if repudiating competence in the subjects of allusion now probable it struck her second visitor that miss archer had in operatic conditions a radiance even a slight exaltation as she was however at all times a keenlyglancing quicklymoving completely animated young woman he may have been mistaken on this point her talk with him moreover pointed to presence of mind it expressed a kindness so ingenious and deliberate as to indicate that she was in undisturbed possession of her faculties poor lord warburton had moments of bewilderment she had discouraged him formally as much as a woman could what business had she then with such arts and such felicities above all with such tones of reparationpreparation her voice had tricks of sweetness but why play them on him the others came back the bare familiar trivial opera began again the box was large and there was room for him to remain if he would sit a little behind and in the dark he did so for half an hour while mr osmond remained in front leaning forward his elbows on his knees just behind isabel lord warburton heard nothing and from his gloomy corner saw nothing but the clear profile of this young lady defined against the dim illumination of the house when there was another interval no one moved mr osmond talked to isabel and lord warburton kept his corner he did so but for a short time however after which he got up and bade goodnight to the ladies isabel said nothing to detain him but it didnt prevent his being puzzled again why should she mark so one of his valuesquite the wrong onewhen she would have nothing to do with another which was quite the right he was angry with himself for being puzzled and then angry for being angry verdis music did little to comfort him and he left the theatre and walked homeward without knowing his way through the tortuous tragic streets of rome where heavier sorrows than his had been carried under the stars  whats the character of that gentleman osmond asked of isabel after he had retired  irreproachabledont you see it  he owns about half england thats his character henrietta remarked thats what they call a free country  ah hes a great proprietor happy man said gilbert osmond  do you call that happinessthe ownership of wretched human beings cried miss stackpole he owns his tenants and has thousands of them its pleasant to own something but inanimate objects are enough for me i dont insist on flesh and blood and minds and consciences  it seems to me you own a human being or two mr bantling suggested jocosely i wonder if warburton orders his tenants about as you do me  lord warburtons a great radical isabel said he has very advanced opinions  he has very advanced stone walls his parks enclosed by a gigantic iron fence some thirty miles round henrietta announced for the information of mr osmond i should like him to converse with a few of our boston radicals  dont they approve of iron fences asked mr bantling  only to shut up wicked conservatives i always feel as if i were talking to you over something with a neat topfinish of broken glass  do you know him well this unreformed reformer osmond went on questioning isabel  well enough for all the use i have for him  and how much of a use is that  well i like to like him  liking to likewhy it makes a passion said osmond  noshe consideredkeep that for liking to dislike  do you wish to provoke me then osmond laughed to a passion for him  she said nothing for a moment but then met the light question with a disproportionate gravity no mr osmond i dont think i should ever dare to provoke you lord warburton at any rate she more easily added is a very nice man  of great ability her friend enquired  of excellent ability and as good as he looks  as good as hes goodlooking do you mean hes very goodlooking how detestably fortunateto be a great english magnate to be clever and handsome into the bargain and by way of finishing off to enjoy your high favour thats a man i could envy  isabel considered him with interest you seem to me to be always envying some one yesterday it was the pope today its poor lord warburton  my envys not dangerous it wouldnt hurt a mouse i dont want to destroy the peoplei only want to be them you see it would destroy only myself  youd like to be the pope said isabel  i should love itbut i should have gone in for it earlier but whyosmond reverteddo you speak of your friend as poor  womenwhen they are very very good sometimes pity men after theyve hurt them thats their great way of showing kindness said ralph joining in the conversation for the first time and with a cynicism so transparently ingenious as to be virtually innocent  pray have i hurt lord warburton isabel asked raising her eyebrows as if the idea were perfectly fresh  it serves him right if you have said henrietta while the curtain rose for the ballet  isabel saw no more of her attributive victim for the next twentyfour hours but on the second day after the visit to the opera she encountered him in the gallery of the capitol where he stood before the lion of the collection the statue of the dying gladiator she had come in with her companions among whom on this occasion again gilbert osmond had his place and the party having ascended the staircase entered the first and finest of the rooms lord warburton addressed her alertly enough but said in a moment that he was leaving the gallery and im leaving rome he added i must bid you goodbye isabel inconsequently enough was now sorry to hear it this was perhaps because she had ceased to be afraid of his renewing his suit she was thinking of something else she was on the point of naming her regret but she checked herself and simply wished him a happy journey which made him look at her rather unlightedly im afraid youll think me very volatile i told you the other day i wanted so much to stop  oh no you could easily change your mind  thats what i have done  bon voyage then  youre in a great hurry to get rid of me said his lordship quite dismally  not in the least but i hate partings  you dont care what i do he went on pitifully  isabel looked at him a moment ah she said youre not keeping your promise  he coloured like a boy of fifteen if im not then its because i cant and thats why im going  goodbye then  goodbye he lingered still however when shall i see you again  isabel hesitated but soon as if she had had a happy inspiration some day after youre married  that will never be it will be after you are  that will do as well she smiled  yes quite as well goodbye  they shook hands and he left her alone in the glorious room among the shining antique marbles she sat down in the centre of the circle of these presences regarding them vaguely resting her eyes on their beautiful blank faces listening as it were to their eternal silence it is impossible in rome at least to look long at a great company of greek sculptures without feeling the effect of their noble quietude which as with a high door closed for the ceremony slowly drops on the spirit the large white mantle of peace i say in rome especially because the roman air is an exquisite medium for such impressions the golden sunshine mingles with them the deep stillness of the past so vivid yet though it is nothing but a void full of names seems to throw a solemn spell upon them the blinds were partly closed in the windows of the capitol and a clear warm shadow rested on the figures and made them more mildly human isabel sat there a long time under the charm of their motionless grace wondering to what of their experience their absent eyes were open and how to our ears their alien lips would sound the dark red walls of the room threw them into relief the polished marble floor reflected their beauty she had seen them all before but her enjoyment repeated itself and it was all the greater because she was glad again for the time to be alone at last however her attention lapsed drawn off by a deeper tide of life an occasional tourist came in stopped and stared a moment at the dying gladiator and then passed out of the other door creaking over the smooth pavement at the end of half an hour gilbert osmond reappeared apparently in advance of his companions he strolled toward her slowly with his hands behind him and his usual enquiring yet not quite appealing smile im surprised to find you alone i thought you had company  so i havethe best and she glanced at the antinous and the faun  do you call them better company than an english peer  ah my english peer left me some time ago she got up speaking with intention a little dryly  mr osmond noted her dryness which contributed for him to the interest of his question im afraid that what i heard the other evening is true youre rather cruel to that nobleman  isabel looked a moment at the vanquished gladiator its not true im scrupulously kind  thats exactly what i mean gilbert osmond returned and with such happy hilarity that his joke needs to be explained we know that he was fond of originals of rarities of the superior and the exquisite and now that he had seen lord warburton whom he thought a very fine example of his race and order he perceived a new attraction in the idea of taking to himself a young lady who had qualified herself to figure in his collection of choice objects by declining so noble a hand gilbert osmond had a high appreciation of this particular patriciate not so much for its distinction which he thought easily surpassable as for its solid actuality he had never forgiven his star for not appointing him to an english dukedom and he could measure the unexpectedness of such conduct as isabels it would be proper that the woman he might marry should have done something of that sort    chapter xxix  ralph touchett in talk with his excellent friend had rather markedly qualified as we know his recognition of gilbert osmonds personal merits but he might really have felt himself illiberal in the light of that gentlemans conduct during the rest of the visit to rome osmond spent a portion of each day with isabel and her companions and ended by affecting them as the easiest of men to live with who wouldnt have seen that he could command as it were both tact and gaietywhich perhaps was exactly why ralph had made his oldtime look of superficial sociability a reproach to him even isabels invidious kinsman was obliged to admit that he was just now a delightful associate his good humour was imperturbable his knowledge of the right fact his production of the right word as convenient as the friendly flicker of a match for your cigarette clearly he was amusedas amused as a man could be who was so little ever surprised and that made him almost applausive it was not that his spirits were visibly highhe would never in the concert of pleasure touch the big drum by so much as a knuckle he had a mortal dislike to the high ragged note to what he called random ravings he thought miss archer sometimes of too precipitate a readiness it was pity she had that fault because if she had not had it she would really have had none she would have been as smooth to his general need of her as handled ivory to the palm if he was not personally loud however he was deep and during these closing days of the roman may he knew a complacency that matched with slow irregular walks under the pines of the villa borghese among the small sweet meadowflowers and the mossy marbles he was pleased with everything he had never before been pleased with so many things at once old impressions old enjoyments renewed themselves one evening going home to his room at the inn he wrote down a little sonnet to which he prefixed the title of rome revisited a day or two later he showed this piece of correct and ingenious verse to isabel explaining to her that it was an italian fashion to commemorate the occasions of life by a tribute to the muse  he took his pleasures in general singly he was too oftenhe would have admitted thattoo sorely aware of something wrong something ugly the fertilising dew of a conceivable felicity too seldom descended on his spirit but at present he was happyhappier than he had perhaps ever been in his life and the feeling had a large foundation this was simply the sense of successthe most agreeable emotion of the human heart osmond had never had too much of it in this respect he had the irritation of satiety as he knew perfectly well and often reminded himself ah no ive not been spoiled certainly ive not been spoiled he used inwardly to repeat if i do succeed before i die i shall thoroughly have earned it he was too apt to reason as if earning this boon consisted above all of covertly aching for it and might be confined to that exercise absolutely void of it also his career had not been he might indeed have suggested to a spectator here and there that he was resting on vague laurels but his triumphs were some of them now too old others had been too easy the present one had been less arduous than might have been expected but had been easythat is had been rapidonly because he had made an altogether exceptional effort a greater effort than he had believed it in him to make the desire to have something or other to show for his partsto show somehow or otherhad been the dream of his youth but as the years went on the conditions attached to any marked proof of rarity had affected him more and more as gross and detestable like the swallowing of mugs of beer to advertise what one could stand if an anonymous drawing on a museum wall had been conscious and watchful it might have known this peculiar pleasure of being at last and all of a sudden identifiedas from the hand of a great masterby the so high and so unnoticed fact of style his style was what the girl had discovered with a little help and now beside herself enjoying it she should publish it to the world without his having any of the trouble she should do the thing for him and he would not have waited in vain  shortly before the time fixed in advance for her departure this young lady received from mrs touchett a telegram running as follows leave florence 4th june for bellaggio and take you if you have not other views but cant wait if you dawdle in rome the dawdling in rome was very pleasant but isabel had different views and she let her aunt know she would immediately join her she told gilbert osmond that she had done so and he replied that spending many of his summers as well as his winters in italy he himself would loiter a little longer in the cool shadow of saint peters he would not return to florence for ten days more and in that time she would have started for bellaggio it might be months in this case before he should see her again this exchange took place in the large decorated sittingroom occupied by our friends at the hotel it was late in the evening and ralph touchett was to take his cousin back to florence on the morrow osmond had found the girl alone miss stackpole had contracted a friendship with a delightful american family on the fourth floor and had mounted the interminable staircase to pay them a visit henrietta contracted friendships in travelling with great freedom and had formed in railwaycarriages several that were among her most valued ties ralph was making arrangements for the morrows journey and isabel sat alone in a wilderness of yellow upholstery the chairs and sofas were orange the walls and windows were draped in purple and gilt the mirrors the pictures had great flamboyant frames the ceiling was deeply vaulted and painted over with naked muses and cherubs for osmond the place was ugly to distress the false colours the sham splendour were like vulgar bragging lying talk isabel had taken in hand a volume of ampere presented on their arrival in rome by ralph but though she held it in her lap with her finger vaguely kept in the place she was not impatient to pursue her study a lamp covered with a drooping veil of pink tissuepaper burned on the table beside her and diffused a strange pale rosiness over the scene  you say youll come back but who knows gilbert osmond said  i think youre much more likely to start on your voyage round the world youre under no obligation to come back you can do exactly what you choose you can roam through space  well italys a part of space isabel answered i can take it on the way  on the way round the world no dont do that dont put us in a parenthesisgive us a chapter to ourselves i dont want to see you on your travels id rather see you when theyre over i should like to see you when youre tired and satiated osmond added in a moment i shall prefer you in that state  isabel with her eyes bent fingered the pages of m ampere you turn things into ridicule without seeming to do it though not i think without intending it youve no respect for my travelsyou think them ridiculous  where do you find that  she went on in the same tone fretting the edge of her book with the paperknife you see my ignorance my blunders the way i wander about as if the world belonged to me simply becausebecause it has been put into my power to do so you dont think a woman ought to do that you think it bold and ungraceful  i think it beautiful said osmond you know my opinionsive treated you to enough of them dont you remember my telling you that one ought to make ones life a work of art you looked rather shocked at first but then i told you that it was exactly what you seemed to me to be trying to do with your own  she looked up from her book what you despise most in the world is bad is stupid art  possibly but yours seem to me very clear and very good  if i were to go to japan next winter you would laugh at me she went on  osmond gave a smilea keen one but not a laugh for the tone of their conversation was not jocose isabel had in fact her solemnity he had seen it before you have one  thats exactly what i say you think such an idea absurd  i would give my little finger to go to japan its one of the countries i want most to see cant you believe that with my taste for old lacquer  i havent a taste for old lacquer to excuse me said isabel  youve a better excusethe means of going youre quite wrong in your theory that i laugh at you i dont know what has put it into your head  it wouldnt be remarkable if you did think it ridiculous that i should have the means to travel when youve not for you know everything and i know nothing  the more reason why you should travel and learn smiled osmond besides he added as if it were a point to be made i dont know everything  isabel was not struck with the oddity of his saying this gravely she was thinking that the pleasantest incident of her lifeso it pleased her to qualify these too few days in rome which she might musingly have likened to the figure of some small princess of one of the ages of dress overmuffled in a mantle of state and dragging a train that it took pages or historians to hold upthat this felicity was coming to an end that most of the interest of the time had been owing to mr osmond was a reflexion she was not just now at pains to make she had already done the point abundant justice but she said to herself that if there were a danger they should never meet again perhaps after all it would be as well happy things dont repeat themselves and her adventure wore already the changed the seaward face of some romantic island from which after feasting on purple grapes she was putting off while the breeze rose she might come back to italy and find him differentthis strange man who pleased her just as he was and it would be better not to come than run the risk of that but if she was not to come the greater the pity that the chapter was closed she felt for a moment a pang that touched the source of tears the sensation kept her silent and gilbert osmond was silent too he was looking at her go everywhere he said at last in a low kind voice do everything get everything out of life be happybe triumphant  what do you mean by being triumphant  well doing what you like  to triumph then it seems to me is to fail doing all the vain things one likes is often very tiresome  exactly said osmond with his quiet quickness as i intimated just now youll be tired some day he paused a moment and then he went on i dont know whether i had better not wait till then for something i want to say to you  ah i cant advise you without knowing what it is but im horrid when im tired isabel added with due inconsequence  i dont believe that youre angry sometimesthat i can believe though ive never seen it but im sure youre never cross  not even when i lose my temper  you dont lose ityou find it and that must be beautiful osmond spoke with a noble earnestness they must be great moments to see  if i could only find it now isabel nervously cried  im not afraid i should fold my arms and admire you im speaking very seriously he leaned forward a hand on each knee for some moments he bent his eyes on the floor what i wish to say to you he went on at last looking up is that i find im in love with you  she instantly rose ah keep that till i am tired  tired of hearing it from others he sat there raising his eyes to her no you may heed it now or never as you please but after all i must say it now she had turned away but in the movement she had stopped herself and dropped her gaze upon him the two remained a while in this situation exchanging a long lookthe large conscious look of the critical hours of life then he got up and came near her deeply respectful as if he were afraid he had been too familiar im absolutely in love with you  he had repeated the announcement in a tone of almost impersonal discretion like a man who expected very little from it but who spoke for his own needed relief the tears came into her eyes this time they obeyed the sharpness of the pang that suggested to her somehow the slipping of a fine boltbackward forward she couldnt have said which the words he had uttered made him as he stood there beautiful and generous invested him as with the golden air of early autumn but morally speaking she retreated before themfacing him stillas she had retreated in the other cases before a like encounter oh dont say that please she answered with an intensity that expressed the dread of having in this case too to choose and decide what made her dread great was precisely the force which as it would seem ought to have banished all dreadthe sense of something within herself deep down that she supposed to be inspired and trustful passion it was there like a large sum stored in a bankwhich there was a terror in having to begin to spend if she touched it it would all come out  i havent the idea that it will matter much to you said osmond ive too little to offer you what i haveits enough for me but its not enough for you ive neither fortune nor fame nor extrinsic advantages of any kind so i offer nothing i only tell you because i think it cant offend you and some day or other it may give you pleasure it gives me pleasure i assure you he went on standing there before her considerately inclined to her turning his hat which he had taken up slowly round with a movement which had all the decent tremor of awkwardness and none of its oddity and presenting to her his firm refined slightly ravaged face it gives me no pain because its perfectly simple for me youll always be the most important woman in the world  isabel looked at herself in this characterlooked intently thinking she filled it with a certain grace but what she said was not an expression of any such complacency you dont offend me but you ought to remember that without being offended one may be incommoded troubled incommoded she heard herself saying that and it struck her as a ridiculous word but it was what stupidly came to her  i remember perfectly of course youre surprised and startled but if its nothing but that it will pass away and it will perhaps leave something that i may not be ashamed of  i dont know what it may leave you see at all events that im not overwhelmed said isabel with rather a pale smile im not too troubled to think and i think that im glad i leave rome tomorrow  of course i dont agree with you there  i dont at all know you she added abruptly and then she coloured as she heard herself saying what she had said almost a year before to lord warburton  if you were not going away youd know me better  i shall do that some other time  i hope so im very easy to know  no no she emphatically answeredthere youre not sincere youre not easy to know no one could be less so  well he laughed i said that because i know myself it may be a boast but i do  very likely but youre very wise  so are you miss archer osmond exclaimed  i dont feel so just now still im wise enough to think you had better go goodnight  god bless you said gilbert osmond taking the hand which she failed to surrender after which he added if we meet again youll find me as you leave me if we dont i shall be so all the same  thank you very much goodbye  there was something quietly firm about isabels visitor he might go of his own movement but wouldnt be dismissed theres one thing more i havent asked anything of younot even a thought in the future you must do me that justice but theres a little service i should like to ask i shall not return home for several days romes delightful and its a good place for a man in my state of mind oh i know youre sorry to leave it but youre right to do what your aunt wishes  she doesnt even wish it isabel broke out strangely  osmond was apparently on the point of saying something that would match these words but he changed his mind and rejoined simply ah well its proper you should go with her very proper do everything thats proper i go in for that excuse my being so patronising you say you dont know me but when you do youll discover what a worship i have for propriety  youre not conventional isabel gravely asked  i like the way you utter that word no im not conventional im convention itself you dont understand that and he paused a moment smiling i should like to explain it then with a sudden quick bright naturalness do come back again he pleaded there are so many things we might talk about  she stood there with lowered eyes what service did you speak of just now  go and see my little daughter before you leave florence shes alone at the villa i decided not to send her to my sister who hasnt at all my ideas tell her she must love her poor father very much said gilbert osmond gently  it will be a great pleasure to me to go isabel answered ill tell her what you say once more goodbye  on this he took a rapid respectful leave when he had gone she stood a moment looking about her and seated herself slowly and with an air of deliberation she sat there till her companions came back with folded hands gazing at the ugly carpet her agitationfor it had not diminishedwas very still very deep what had happened was something that for a week past her imagination had been going forward to meet but here when it came she stoppedthat sublime principle somehow broke down the working of this young ladys spirit was strange and i can only give it to you as i see it not hoping to make it seem altogether natural her imagination as i say now hung back there was a last vague space it couldnt crossa dusky uncertain tract which looked ambiguous and even slightly treacherous like a moorland seen in the winter twilight but she was to cross it yet    chapter xxx  she returned on the morrow to florence under her cousins escort and ralph touchett though usually restive under railway discipline thought very well of the successive hours passed in the train that hurried his companion away from the city now distinguished by gilbert osmonds preferencehours that were to form the first stage in a larger scheme of travel miss stackpole had remained behind she was planning a little trip to naples to be carried out with mr bantlings aid isabel was to have three days in florence before the 4th of june the date of mrs touchetts departure and she determined to devote the last of these to her promise to call on pansy osmond her plan however seemed for a moment likely to modify itself in deference to an idea of madame merles this lady was still at casa touchett but she too was on the point of leaving florence her next station being an ancient castle in the mountains of tuscany the residence of a noble family of that country whose acquaintance she had known them as she said forever seemed to isabel in the light of certain photographs of their immense crenellated dwelling which her friend was able to show her a precious privilege she mentioned to this fortunate woman that mr osmond had asked her to take a look at his daughter but didnt mention that he had also made her a declaration of love  ah comme cela se trouve madame merle exclaimed i myself have been thinking it would be a kindness to pay the child a little visit before i go off  we can go together then isabel reasonably said reasonably because the proposal was not uttered in the spirit of enthusiasm she had prefigured her small pilgrimage as made in solitude she should like it better so she was nevertheless prepared to sacrifice this mystic sentiment to her great consideration for her friend  that personage finely meditated after all why should we both go having each of us so much to do during these last hours  very good i can easily go alone  i dont know about your going aloneto the house of a handsome bachelor he has been marriedbut so long ago  isabel stared when mr osmonds away what does it matter  they dont know hes away you see  they whom do you mean  every one but perhaps it doesnt signify  if you were going why shouldnt i isabel asked  because im an old frump and youre a beautiful young woman  granting all that youve not promised  how much you think of your promises said the elder woman in mild mockery  i think a great deal of my promises does that surprise you  youre right madame merle audibly reflected i really think you wish to be kind to the child  i wish very much to be kind to her  go and see her then no one will be the wiser and tell her id have come if you hadnt or rather madame merle added dont tell her she wont care  as isabel drove in the publicity of an open vehicle along the winding way which led to mr osmonds hilltop she wondered what her friend had meant by no ones being the wiser once in a while at large intervals this lady whose voyaging discretion as a general thing was rather of the open sea than of the risky channel dropped a remark of ambiguous quality struck a note that sounded false what cared isabel archer for the vulgar judgements of obscure people and did madame merle suppose that she was capable of doing a thing at all if it had to be sneakingly done of course not she must have meant something elsesomething which in the press of the hours that preceded her departure she had not had time to explain isabel would return to this some day there were sorts of things as to which she liked to be clear she heard pansy strumming at the piano in another place as she herself was ushered into mr osmonds drawingroom the little girl was practising and isabel was pleased to think she performed this duty with rigour she immediately came in smoothing down her frock and did the honours of her fathers house with a wideeyed earnestness of courtesy isabel sat there half an hour and pansy rose to the occasion as the small winged fairy in the pantomime soars by the aid of the dissimulated wirenot chattering but conversing and showing the same respectful interest in isabels affairs that isabel was so good as to take in hers isabel wondered at her she had never had so directly presented to her nose the white flower of cultivated sweetness how well the child had been taught said our admiring young woman how prettily she had been directed and fashioned and yet how simple how natural how innocent she had been kept isabel was fond ever of the question of character and quality of sounding as who should say the deep personal mystery and it had pleased her up to this time to be in doubt as to whether this tender slip were not really allknowing was the extremity of her candour but the perfection of selfconsciousness was it put on to please her fathers visitor or was it the direct expression of an unspotted nature the hour that isabel spent in mr osmonds beautiful empty dusky roomsthe windows had been halfdarkened to keep out the heat and here and there through an easy crevice the splendid summer day peeped in lighting a gleam of faded colour or tarnished gilt in the rich gloomher interview with the daughter of the house i say effectually settled this question pansy was really a blank page a pure white surface successfully kept so she had neither art nor guile nor temper nor talentonly two or three small exquisite instincts for knowing a friend for avoiding a mistake for taking care of an old toy or a new frock yet to be so tender was to be touching withal and she could be felt as an easy victim of fate she would have no will no power to resist no sense of her own importance she would easily be mystified easily crushed her force would be all in knowing when and where to cling she moved about the place with her visitor who had asked leave to walk through the other rooms again where pansy gave her judgement on several works of art she spoke of her prospects her occupations her fathers intentions she was not egotistical but felt the propriety of supplying the information so distinguished a guest would naturally expect  please tell me she said did papa in rome go to see madame catherine he told me he would if he had time perhaps he had not time papa likes a great deal of time he wished to speak about my education it isnt finished yet you know i dont know what they can do with me more but it appears its far from finished papa told me one day he thought he would finish it himself for the last year or two at the convent the masters that teach the tall girls are so very dear papas not rich and i should be very sorry if he were to pay much money for me because i dont think im worth it i dont learn quickly enough and i have no memory for what im told yesespecially when its pleasant but not for what i learn in a book there was a young girl who was my best friend and they took her away from the convent when she was fourteen to makehow do you say it in englishto make a dot you dont say it in english i hope it isnt wrong i only mean they wished to keep the money to marry her i dont know whether it is for that that papa wishes to keep the moneyto marry me it costs so much to marry pansy went on with a sigh i think papa might make that economy at any rate im too young to think about it yet and i dont care for any gentleman i mean for any but him if he were not my papa i should like to marry him i would rather be his daughter than the wife ofof some strange person i miss him very much but not so much as you might think for ive been so much away from him papa has always been principally for holidays i miss madame catherine almost more but you must not tell him that you shall not see him again im very sorry and hell be sorry too of everyone who comes here i like you the best thats not a great compliment for there are not many people it was very kind of you to come todayso far from your house for im really as yet only a child oh yes ive only the occupations of a child when did you give them up the occupations of a child i should like to know how old you are but i dont know whether its right to ask at the convent they told us that we must never ask the age i dont like to do anything thats not expected it looks as if one had not been properly taught i myselfi should never like to be taken by surprise papa left directions for everything i go to bed very early when the sun goes off that side i go into the garden papa left strict orders that i was not to get scorched i always enjoy the view the mountains are so graceful in rome from the convent we saw nothing but roofs and belltowers i practise three hours i dont play very well you play yourself i wish very much youd play something for me papa has the idea that i should hear good music madame merle has played for me several times thats what i like best about madame merle she has great facility i shall never have facility and ive no voicejust a small sound like the squeak of a slatepencil making flourishes  isabel gratified this respectful wish drew off her gloves and sat down to the piano while pansy standing beside her watched her white hands move quickly over the keys when she stopped she kissed the child goodbye held her close looked at her long be very good she said give pleasure to your father  i think thats what i live for pansy answered he has not much pleasure hes rather a sad man  isabel listened to this assertion with an interest which she felt it almost a torment to be obliged to conceal it was her pride that obliged her and a certain sense of decency there were still other things in her head which she felt a strong impulse instantly checked to say to pansy about her father there were things it would have given her pleasure to hear the child to make the child say but she no sooner became conscious of these things than her imagination was hushed with horror at the idea of taking advantage of the little girlit was of this she would have accused herselfand of exhaling into that air where he might still have a subtle sense for it any breath of her charmed state she had comeshe had come but she had stayed only an hour she rose quickly from the musicstool even then however she lingered a moment still holding her small companion drawing the childs sweet slimness closer and looking down at her almost in envy she was obliged to confess it to herselfshe would have taken a passionate pleasure in talking of gilbert osmond to this innocent diminutive creature who was so near him but she said no other word she only kissed pansy once again they went together through the vestibule to the door that opened on the court and there her young hostess stopped looking rather wistfully beyond i may go no further ive promised papa not to pass this door  youre right to obey him hell never ask you anything unreasonable  i shall always obey him but when will you come again  not for a long time im afraid  as soon as you can i hope im only a little girl said pansy but i shall always expect you and the small figure stood in the high dark doorway watching isabel cross the clear grey court and disappear into the brightness beyond the big portone which gave a wider dazzle as it opened    chapter xxxi  isabel came back to florence but only after several months an interval sufficiently replete with incident it is not however during this interval that we are closely concerned with her our attention is engaged again on a certain day in the late springtime shortly after her return to palazzo crescentini and a year from the date of the incidents just narrated she was alone on this occasion in one of the smaller of the numerous rooms devoted by mrs touchett to social uses and there was that in her expression and attitude which would have suggested that she was expecting a visitor the tall window was open and though its green shutters were partly drawn the bright air of the garden had come in through a broad interstice and filled the room with warmth and perfume our young woman stood near it for some time her hands clasped behind her she gazed abroad with the vagueness of unrest too troubled for attention she moved in a vain circle yet it could not be in her thought to catch a glimpse of her visitor before he should pass into the house since the entrance to the palace was not through the garden in which stillness and privacy always reigned she wished rather to forestall his arrival by a process of conjecture and to judge by the expression of her face this attempt gave her plenty to do grave she found herself and positively more weighted as by the experience of the lapse of the year she had spent in seeing the world she had ranged she would have said through space and surveyed much of mankind and was therefore now in her own eyes a very different person from the frivolous young woman from albany who had begun to take the measure of europe on the lawn at gardencourt a couple of years before she flattered herself she had harvested wisdom and learned a great deal more of life than this lightminded creature had even suspected if her thoughts just now had inclined themselves to retrospect instead of fluttering their wings nervously about the present they would have evoked a multitude of interesting pictures these pictures would have been both landscapes and figurepieces the latter however would have been the more numerous with several of the images that might have been projected on such a field we are already acquainted there would be for instance the conciliatory lily our heroines sister and edmund ludlows wife who had come out from new york to spend five months with her relative she had left her husband behind her but had brought her children to whom isabel now played with equal munificence and tenderness the part of maidenaunt mr ludlow toward the last had been able to snatch a few weeks from his forensic triumphs and crossing the ocean with extreme rapidity had spent a month with the two ladies in paris before taking his wife home the little ludlows had not yet even from the american point of view reached the proper touristage so that while her sister was with her isabel had confined her movements to a narrow circle lily and the babies had joined her in switzerland in the month of july and they had spent a summer of fine weather in an alpine valley where the flowers were thick in the meadows and the shade of great chestnuts made a restingplace for such upward wanderings as might be undertaken by ladies and children on warm afternoons they had afterwards reached the french capital which was worshipped and with costly ceremonies by lily but thought of as noisily vacant by isabel who in these days made use of her memory of rome as she might have done in a hot and crowded room of a phial of something pungent hidden in her handkerchief  mrs ludlow sacrificed as i say to paris yet had doubts and wonderments not allayed at that altar and after her husband had joined her found further chagrin in his failure to throw himself into these speculations they all had isabel for subject but edmund ludlow as he had always done before declined to be surprised or distressed or mystified or elated at anything his sisterinlaw might have done or have failed to do mrs ludlows mental motions were sufficiently various at one moment she thought it would be so natural for that young woman to come home and take a house in new yorkthe rossiters for instance which had an elegant conservatory and was just round the corner from her own at another she couldnt conceal her surprise at the girls not marrying some member of one of the great aristocracies on the whole as i have said she had fallen from high communion with the probabilities she had taken more satisfaction in isabels accession of fortune than if the money had been left to herself it had seemed to her to offer just the proper setting for her sisters slightly meagre but scarce the less eminent figure isabel had developed less however than lily had thought likelydevelopment to lilys understanding being somehow mysteriously connected with morningcalls and eveningparties intellectually doubtless she had made immense strides but she appeared to have achieved few of those social conquests of which mrs ludlow had expected to admire the trophies lilys conception of such achievements was extremely vague but this was exactly what she had expected of isabelto give it form and body isabel could have done as well as she had done in new york and mrs ludlow appealed to her husband to know whether there was any privilege she enjoyed in europe which the society of that city might not offer her we know ourselves that isabel had made conquestswhether inferior or not to those she might have effected in her native land it would be a delicate matter to decide and it is not altogether with a feeling of complacency that i again mention that she had not rendered these honourable victories public she had not told her sister the history of lord warburton nor had she given her a hint of mr osmonds state of mind and she had had no better reason for her silence than that she didnt wish to speak it was more romantic to say nothing and drinking deep in secret of romance she was as little disposed to ask poor lilys advice as she would have been to close that rare volume forever but lily knew nothing of these discriminations and could only pronounce her sisters career a strange anticlimaxan impression confirmed by the fact that isabels silence about mr osmond for instance was in direct proportion to the frequency with which he occupied her thoughts as this happened very often it sometimes appeared to mrs ludlow that she had lost her courage so uncanny a result of so exhilarating an incident as inheriting a fortune was of course perplexing to the cheerful lily it added to her general sense that isabel was not at all like other people  our young ladys courage however might have been taken as reaching its height after her relations had gone home she could imagine braver things than spending the winter in parisparis had sides by which it so resembled new york paris was like smart neat proseand her close correspondence with madame merle did much to stimulate such flights she had never had a keener sense of freedom of the absolute boldness and wantonness of liberty than when she turned away from the platform at the euston station on one of the last days of november after the departure of the train that was to convey poor lily her husband and her children to their ship at liverpool it had been good for her to regale she was very conscious of that she was very observant as we know of what was good for her and her effort was constantly to find something that was good enough to profit by the present advantage till the latest moment she had made the journey from paris with the unenvied travellers she would have accompanied them to liverpool as well only edmund ludlow had asked her as a favour not to do so it made lily so fidgety and she asked such impossible questions isabel watched the train move away she kissed her hand to the elder of her small nephews a demonstrative child who leaned dangerously far out of the window of the carriage and made separation an occasion of violent hilarity and then she walked back into the foggy london street the world lay before hershe could do whatever she chose there was a deep thrill in it all but for the present her choice was tolerably discreet she chose simply to walk back from euston square to her hotel the early dusk of a november afternoon had already closed in the streetlamps in the thick brown air looked weak and red our heroine was unattended and euston square was a long way from piccadilly but isabel performed the journey with a positive enjoyment of its dangers and lost her way almost on purpose in order to get more sensations so that she was disappointed when an obliging policeman easily set her right again she was so fond of the spectacle of human life that she enjoyed even the aspect of gathering dusk in the london streetsthe moving crowds the hurrying cabs the lighted shops the flaring stalls the dark shining dampness of everything that evening at her hotel she wrote to madame merle that she should start in a day or two for rome she made her way down to rome without touching at florencehaving gone first to venice and then proceeded southward by ancona she accomplished this journey without other assistance than that of her servant for her natural protectors were not now on the ground ralph touchett was spending the winter at corfu and miss stackpole in the september previous had been recalled to america by a telegram from the interviewer this journal offered its brilliant correspondent a fresher field for her genius than the mouldering cities of europe and henrietta was cheered on her way by a promise from mr bantling that he would soon come over to see her isabel wrote to mrs touchett to apologise for not presenting herself just yet in florence and her aunt replied characteristically enough apologies mrs touchett intimated were of no more use to her than bubbles and she herself never dealt in such articles one either did the thing or one didnt and what one would have done belonged to the sphere of the irrelevant like the idea of a future life or of the origin of things her letter was frank but a rare case with mrs touchett not so frank as it pretended she easily forgave her niece for not stopping at florence because she took it for a sign that gilbert osmond was less in question there than formerly she watched of course to see if he would now find a pretext for going to rome and derived some comfort from learning that he had not been guilty of an absence isabel on her side had not been a fortnight in rome before she proposed to madame merle that they should make a little pilgrimage to the east madame merle remarked that her friend was restless but she added that she herself had always been consumed with the desire to visit athens and constantinople the two ladies accordingly embarked on this expedition and spent three months in greece in turkey in egypt isabel found much to interest her in these countries though madame merle continued to remark that even among the most classic sites the scenes most calculated to suggest repose and reflexion a certain incoherence prevailed in her isabel travelled rapidly and recklessly she was like a thirsty person draining cup after cup madame merle meanwhile as ladyinwaiting to a princess circulating incognita panted a little in her rear it was on isabels invitation she had come and she imparted all due dignity to the girls uncountenanced state she played her part with the tact that might have been expected of her effacing herself and accepting the position of a companion whose expenses were profusely paid the situation however had no hardships and people who met this reserved though striking pair on their travels would not have been able to tell you which was patroness and which client to say that madame merle improved on acquaintance states meagrely the impression she made on her friend who had found her from the first so ample and so easy at the end of an intimacy of three months isabel felt she knew her better her character had revealed itself and the admirable woman had also at last redeemed her promise of relating her history from her own point of viewa consummation the more desirable as isabel had already heard it related from the point of view of others this history was so sad a one in so far as it concerned the late m merle a positive adventurer she might say though originally so plausible who had taken advantage years before of her youth and of an inexperience in which doubtless those who knew her only now would find it difficult to believe it abounded so in startling and lamentable incidents that her companion wondered a person so eprouvee could have kept so much of her freshness her interest in life into this freshness of madame merles she obtained a considerable insight she seemed to see it as professional as slightly mechanical carried about in its case like the fiddle of the virtuoso or blanketed and bridled like the favourite of the jockey she liked her as much as ever but there was a corner of the curtain that never was lifted it was as if she had remained after all something of a public performer condemned to emerge only in character and in costume she had once said that she came from a distance that she belonged to the old old world and isabel never lost the impression that she was the product of a different moral or social clime from her own that she had grown up under other stars  she believed then that at bottom she had a different morality of course the morality of civilised persons has always much in common but our young woman had a sense in her of values gone wrong or as they said at the shops marked down she considered with the presumption of youth that a morality differing from her own must be inferior to it and this conviction was an aid to detecting an occasional flash of cruelty an occasional lapse from candour in the conversation of a person who had raised delicate kindness to an art and whose pride was too high for the narrow ways of deception her conception of human motives might in certain lights have been acquired at the court of some kingdom in decadence and there were several in her list of which our heroine had not even heard she had not heard of everything that was very plain and there were evidently things in the world of which it was not advantageous to hear she had once or twice had a positive scare since it so affected her to have to exclaim of her friend heaven forgive her she doesnt understand me absurd as it may seem this discovery operated as a shock left her with a vague dismay in which there was even an element of foreboding the dismay of course subsided in the light of some sudden proof of madame merles remarkable intelligence but it stood for a highwatermark in the ebb and flow of confidence madame merle had once declared her belief that when a friendship ceases to grow it immediately begins to declinethere being no point of equilibrium between liking more and liking less a stationary affection in other words was impossibleit must move one way or the other however that might be the girl had in these days a thousand uses for her sense of the romantic which was more active than it had ever been i do not allude to the impulse it received as she gazed at the pyramids in the course of an excursion from cairo or as she stood among the broken columns of the acropolis and fixed her eyes upon the point designated to her as the strait of salamis deep and memorable as these emotions had remained she came back by the last of march from egypt and greece and made another stay in rome a few days after her arrival gilbert osmond descended from florence and remained three weeks during which the fact of her being with his old friend madame merle in whose house she had gone to lodge made it virtually inevitable that he should see her every day when the last of april came she wrote to mrs touchett that she should now rejoice to accept an invitation given long before and went to pay a visit at palazzo crescentini madame merle on this occasion remaining in rome she found her aunt alone her cousin was still at corfu ralph however was expected in florence from day to day and isabel who had not seen him for upwards of a year was prepared to give him the most affectionate welcome    chapter xxxii  it was not of him nevertheless that she was thinking while she stood at the window near which we found her a while ago and it was not of any of the matters i have rapidly sketched she was not turned to the past but to the immediate impending hour she had reason to expect a scene and she was not fond of scenes she was not asking herself what she should say to her visitor this question had already been answered what he would say to herthat was the interesting issue it could be nothing in the least soothingshe had warrant for this and the conviction doubtless showed in the cloud on her brow for the rest however all clearness reigned in her she had put away her mourning and she walked in no small shimmering splendour she only felt olderever so much and as if she were worth more for it like some curious piece in an antiquarys collection she was not at any rate left indefinitely to her apprehensions for a servant at last stood before her with a card on his tray let the gentleman come in she said and continued to gaze out of the window after the footman had retired it was only when she had heard the door close behind the person who presently entered that she looked round  caspar goodwood stood therestood and received a moment from head to foot the bright dry gaze with which she rather withheld than offered a greeting whether his sense of maturity had kept pace with isabels we shall perhaps presently ascertain let me say meanwhile that to her critical glance he showed nothing of the injury of time straight strong and hard there was nothing in his appearance that spoke positively either of youth or of age if he had neither innocence nor weakness so he had no practical philosophy his jaw showed the same voluntary cast as in earlier days but a crisis like the present had in it of course something grim he had the air of a man who had travelled hard he said nothing at first as if he had been out of breath this gave isabel time to make a reflexion poor fellow what great things hes capable of and what a pity he should waste so dreadfully his splendid force what a pity too that one cant satisfy everybody it gave her time to do more to say at the end of a minute i cant tell you how i hoped you wouldnt come  ive no doubt of that and he looked about him for a seat not only had he come but he meant to settle  you must be very tired said isabel seating herself and generously as she thought to give him his opportunity  no im not at all tired did you ever know me to be tired  never i wish i had when did you arrive  last night very late in a kind of snailtrain they call the express these italian trains go at about the rate of an american funeral  thats in keepingyou must have felt as if you were coming to bury me and she forced a smile of encouragement to an easy view of their situation she had reasoned the matter well out making it perfectly clear that she broke no faith and falsified no contract but for all this she was afraid of her visitor she was ashamed of her fear but she was devoutly thankful there was nothing else to be ashamed of he looked at her with his stiff insistence an insistence in which there was such a want of tact especially when the dull dark beam in his eye rested on her as a physical weight  no i didnt feel that i couldnt think of you as dead i wish i could he candidly declared  i thank you immensely  id rather think of you as dead than as married to another man  thats very selfish of you she returned with the ardour of a real conviction if youre not happy yourself others have yet a right to be  very likely its selfish but i dont in the least mind your saying so i dont mind anything you can say nowi dont feel it the cruellest things you could think of would be mere pinpricks after what youve done i shall never feel anythingi mean anything but that that i shall feel all my life  mr goodwood made these detached assertions with dry deliberateness in his hard slow american tone which flung no atmospheric colour over propositions intrinsically crude the tone made isabel angry rather than touched her but her anger perhaps was fortunate inasmuch as it gave her a further reason for controlling herself it was under the pressure of this control that she became after a little irrelevant when did you leave new york  he threw up his head as if calculating seventeen days ago  you must have travelled fast in spite of your slow trains  i came as fast as i could id have come five days ago if i had been able  it wouldnt have made any difference mr goodwood she coldly smiled  not to youno but to me  you gain nothing that i see  thats for me to judge  of course to me it seems that you only torment yourself and then to change the subject she asked him if he had seen henrietta stackpole he looked as if he had not come from boston to florence to talk of henrietta stackpole but he answered distinctly enough that this young lady had been with him just before he left america she came to see you isabel then demanded  yes she was in boston and she called at my office it was the day i had got your letter  did you tell her isabel asked with a certain anxiety  oh no said caspar goodwood simply i didnt want to do that shell hear it quick enough she hears everything  i shall write to her and then shell write to me and scold me isabel declared trying to smile again  caspar however remained sternly grave i guess shell come right out he said  on purpose to scold me  i dont know she seemed to think she had not seen europe thoroughly  im glad you tell me that isabel said i must prepare for her  mr goodwood fixed his eyes for a moment on the floor then at last raising them does she know mr osmond he enquired  a little and she doesnt like him but of course i dont marry to please henrietta she added it would have been better for poor caspar if she had tried a little more to gratify miss stackpole but he didnt say so he only asked presently when her marriage would take place to which she made answer that she didnt know yet i can only say it will be soon ive told no one but yourself and one other personan old friend of mr osmonds  is it a marriage your friends wont like he demanded  i really havent an idea as i say i dont marry for my friends  he went on making no exclamation no comment only asking questions doing it quite without delicacy who and what then is mr gilbert osmond  who and what nobody and nothing but a very good and very honourable man hes not in business said isabel hes not rich hes not known for anything in particular  she disliked mr goodwoods questions but she said to herself that she owed it to him to satisfy him as far as possible the satisfaction poor caspar exhibited was however small he sat very upright gazing at her where does he come from where does he belong  she had never been so little pleased with the way he said belawng he comes from nowhere he has spent most of his life in italy  you said in your letter he was american hasnt he a native place  yes but he has forgotten it he left it as a small boy  has he never gone back  why should he go back isabel asked flushing all defensively he has no profession  he might have gone back for his pleasure doesnt he like the united states  he doesnt know them then hes very quiet and very simplehe contents himself with italy  with italy and with you said mr goodwood with gloomy plainness and no appearance of trying to make an epigram what has he ever done he added abruptly  that i should marry him nothing at all isabel replied while her patience helped itself by turning a little to hardness if he had done great things would you forgive me any better give me up mr goodwood im marrying a perfect nonentity dont try to take an interest in him you cant  i cant appreciate him thats what you mean and you dont mean in the least that hes a perfect nonentity you think hes grand you think hes great though no one else thinks so  isabels colour deepened she felt this really acute of her companion and it was certainly a proof of the aid that passion might render perceptions she had never taken for fine why do you always comeback to what others think i cant discuss mr osmond with you  of course not said caspar reasonably and he sat there with his air of stiff helplessness as if not only this were true but there were nothing else that they might discuss  you see how little you gain she accordingly broke outhow little comfort or satisfaction i can give you  i didnt expect you to give me much  i dont understand then why you came  i came because i wanted to see you once moreeven just as you are  i appreciate that but if you had waited a while sooner or later we should have been sure to meet and our meeting would have been pleasanter for each of us than this  waited till after youre married thats just what i didnt want to do youll be different then  not very i shall still be a great friend of yours youll see  that will make it all the worse said mr goodwood grimly  ah youre unaccommodating i cant promise to dislike you in order to help you to resign yourself  i shouldnt care if you did  isabel got up with a movement of repressed impatience and walked to the window where she remained a moment looking out when she turned round her visitor was still motionless in his place she came toward him again and stopped resting her hand on the back of the chair she had just quitted do you mean you came simply to look at me thats better for you perhaps than for me  i wished to hear the sound of your voice he said  youve heard it and you see it says nothing very sweet  it gives me pleasure all the same and with this he got up she had felt pain and displeasure on receiving early that day the news he was in florence and by her leave would come within an hour to see her she had been vexed and distressed though she had sent back word by his messenger that he might come when he would she had not been better pleased when she saw him his being there at all was so full of heavy implications it implied things she could never assent torights reproaches remonstrance rebuke the expectation of making her change her purpose these things however if implied had not been expressed and now our young lady strangely enough began to resent her visitors remarkable selfcontrol there was a dumb misery about him that irritated her there was a manly staying of his hand that made her heart beat faster she felt her agitation rising and she said to herself that she was angry in the way a woman is angry when she has been in the wrong she was not in the wrong she had fortunately not that bitterness to swallow but all the same she wished he would denounce her a little she had wished his visit would be short it had no purpose no propriety yet now that he seemed to be turning away she felt a sudden horror of his leaving her without uttering a word that would give her an opportunity to defend herself more than she had done in writing to him a month before in a few carefully chosen words to announce her engagement if she were not in the wrong however why should she desire to defend herself it was an excess of generosity on isabels part to desire that mr goodwood should be angry and if he had not meanwhile held himself hard it might have made him so to hear the tone in which she suddenly exclaimed as if she were accusing him of having accused her ive not deceived you i was perfectly free  yes i know that said caspar  i gave you full warning that id do as i chose  you said youd probably never marry and you said it with such a manner that i pretty well believed it  she considered this an instant no one can be more surprised than myself at my present intention  you told me that if i heard you were engaged i was not to believe it caspar went on i heard it twenty days ago from yourself but i remembered what you had said i thought there might be some mistake and thats partly why i came  if you wish me to repeat it by word of mouth thats soon done theres no mistake whatever  i saw that as soon as i came into the room  what good would it do you that i shouldnt marry she asked with a certain fierceness  i should like it better than this  youre very selfish as i said before  i know that im selfish as iron  even iron sometimes melts if youll be reasonable ill see you again  dont you call me reasonable now  i dont know what to say to you she answered with sudden humility  i shant trouble you for a long time the young man went on he made a step towards the door but he stopped another reason why i came was that i wanted to hear what you would say in explanation of your having changed your mind  her humbleness as suddenly deserted her in explanation do you think im bound to explain  he gave her one of his long dumb looks you were very positive i did believe it  so did i do you think i could explain if i would  no i suppose not well he added ive done what i wished ive seen you  how little you make of these terrible journeys she felt the poverty of her presently replying  if youre afraid im knocked upin any such way as thatyou may he at your ease about it he turned away this time in earnest and no handshake no sign of parting was exchanged between them  at the door he stopped with his hand on the knob i shall leave florence tomorrow he said without a quaver  im delighted to hear it she answered passionately five minutes after he had gone out she burst into tears    chapter xxxiii  her fit of weeping however was soon smothered and the signs of it had vanished when an hour later she broke the news to her aunt i use this expression because she had been sure mrs touchett would not be pleased isabel had only waited to tell her till she had seen mr goodwood she had an odd impression that it would not be honourable to make the fact public before she should have heard what mr goodwood would say about it he had said rather less than she expected and she now had a somewhat angry sense of having lost time but she would lose no more she waited till mrs touchett came into the drawingroom before the midday breakfast and then she began aunt lydia ive something to tell you  mrs touchett gave a little jump and looked at her almost fiercely you neednt tell me i know what it is  i dont know how you know  the same way that i know when the windows openby feeling a draught youre going to marry that man  what man do you mean isabel enquired with great dignity  madame merles friendmr osmond  i dont know why you call him madame merles friend is that the principal thing hes known by  if hes not her friend he ought to beafter what she has done for him cried mrs touchett i shouldnt have expected it of her im disappointed  if you mean that madame merle has had anything to do with my engagement youre greatly mistaken isabel declared with a sort of ardent coldness  you mean that your attractions were sufficient without the gentlemans having had to be lashed up youre quite right theyre immense your attractions and he would never have presumed to think of you if she hadnt put him up to it he has a very good opinion of himself but he was not a man to take trouble madame merle took the trouble for him  he has taken a great deal for himself cried isabel with a voluntary laugh  mrs touchett gave a sharp nod i think he must after all to have made you like him so much  i thought he even pleased you  he did at one time and thats why im angry with him  be angry with me not with him said the girl  oh im always angry with you thats no satisfaction was it for this that you refused lord warburton  please dont go back to that why shouldnt i like mr osmond since others have done so  others at their wildest moments never wanted to marry him theres nothing of him mrs touchett explained  then he cant hurt me said isabel  do you think youre going to be happy no ones happy in such doings you should know  i shall set the fashion then what does one marry for  what you will marry for heaven only knows people usually marry as they go into partnershipto set up a house but in your partnership youll bring everything  is it that mr osmond isnt rich is that what youre talking about isabel asked  he has no money he has no name he has no importance i value such things and i have the courage to say it i think theyre very precious many other people think the same and they show it but they give some other reason  isabel hesitated a little i think i value everything thats valuable i care very much for money and thats why i wish mr osmond to have a little  give it to him then but marry some one else  his names good enough for me the girl went on its a very pretty name have i such a fine one myself  all the more reason you should improve on it there are only a dozen american names do you marry him out of charity  it was my duty to tell you aunt lydia but i dont think its my duty to explain to you even if it were i shouldnt be able so please dont remonstrate in talking about it you have me at a disadvantage i cant talk about it  i dont remonstrate i simply answer you i must give some sign of intelligence i saw it coming and i said nothing i never meddle  you never do and im greatly obliged to you youve been very considerate  it was not considerateit was convenient said mrs touchett but i shall talk to madame merle  i dont see why you keep bringing her in she has been a very good friend to me  possibly but she has been a poor one to me  what has she done to you  she has deceived me she had as good as promised me to prevent your engagement  she couldnt have prevented it  she can do anything thats what ive always liked her for i knew she could play any part but i understood that she played them one by one i didnt understand that she would play two at the same time  i dont know what part she may have played to you isabel said thats between yourselves to me she has been honest and kind and devoted  devoted of course she wished you to marry her candidate she told me she was watching you only in order to interpose  she said that to please you the girl answered conscious however of the inadequacy of the explanation  to please me by deceiving me she knows me better am i pleased today  i dont think youre ever much pleased isabel was obliged to reply if madame merle knew you would learn the truth what had she to gain by insincerity  she gained time as you see while i waited for her to interfere you were marching away and she was really beating the drum  thats very well but by your own admission you saw i was marching and even if she had given the alarm you wouldnt have tried to stop me  no but some one else would  whom do you mean isabel asked looking very hard at her aunt mrs touchetts little bright eyes active as they usually were sustained her gaze rather than returned it would you have listened to ralph  not if he had abused mr osmond  ralph doesnt abuse people you know that perfectly he cares very much for you  i know he does said isabel and i shall feel the value of it now for he knows that whatever i do i do with reason  he never believed you would do this i told him you were capable of it and he argued the other way  he did it for the sake of argument the girl smiled you dont accuse him of having deceived you why should you accuse madame merle  he never pretended hed prevent it  im glad of that cried isabel gaily i wish very much she presently added that when he comes youd tell him first of my engagement  of course ill mention it said mrs touchett i shall say nothing more to you about it but i give you notice i shall talk to others  thats as you please i only meant that its rather better the announcement should come from you than from me  i quite agree with you its much more proper and on this the aunt and the niece went to breakfast where mrs touchett as good as her word made no allusion to gilbert osmond after an interval of silence however she asked her companion from whom she had received a visit an hour before  from an old friendan american gentleman isabel said with a colour in her cheek  an american gentleman of course its only an american gentleman who calls at ten oclock in the morning  it was halfpast ten he was in a great hurry he goes away this evening  couldnt he have come yesterday at the usual time  he only arrived last night  he spends but twentyfour hours in florence mrs touchett cried hes an american gentleman truly  he is indeed said isabel thinking with perverse admiration of what caspar goodwood had done for her  two days afterward ralph arrived but though isabel was sure that mrs touchett had lost no time in imparting to him the great fact he showed at first no open knowledge of it their prompted talk was naturally of his health isabel had many questions to ask about corfu she had been shocked by his appearance when he came into the room she had forgotten how ill he looked in spite of corfu he looked very ill today and she wondered if he were really worse or if she were simply disaccustomed to living with an invalid poor ralph made no nearer approach to conventional beauty as he advanced in life and the now apparently complete loss of his health had done little to mitigate the natural oddity of his person blighted and battered but still responsive and still ironic his face was like a lighted lantern patched with paper and unsteadily held his thin whisker languished upon a lean cheek the exorbitant curve of his nose defined itself more sharply lean he was altogether lean and long and loosejointed an accidental cohesion of relaxed angles his brown velvet jacket had become perennial his hands had fixed themselves in his pockets he shambled and stumbled and shuffled in a manner that denoted great physical helplessness it was perhaps this whimsical gait that helped to mark his character more than ever as that of the humorous invalidthe invalid for whom even his own disabilities are part of the general joke they might well indeed with ralph have been the chief cause of the want of seriousness marking his view of a world in which the reason for his own continued presence was past finding out isabel had grown fond of his ugliness his awkwardness had become dear to her they had been sweetened by association they struck her as the very terms on which it had been given him to be charming he was so charming that her sense of his being ill had hitherto had a sort of comfort in it the state of his health had seemed not a limitation but a kind of intellectual advantage it absolved him from all professional and official emotions and left him the luxury of being exclusively personal the personality so resulting was delightful he had remained proof against the staleness of disease he had had to consent to be deplorably ill yet had somehow escaped being formally sick such had been the girls impression of her cousin and when she had pitied him it was only on reflection as she reflected a good deal she had allowed him a certain amount of compassion but she always had a dread of wasting that essencea precious article worth more to the giver than to any one else now however it took no great sensibility to feel that poor ralphs tenure of life was less elastic than it should be he was a bright free generous spirit he had all the illumination of wisdom and none of its pedantry and yet he was distressfully dying  isabel noted afresh that life was certainly hard for some people and she felt a delicate glow of shame as she thought how easy it now promised to become for herself she was prepared to learn that ralph was not pleased with her engagement but she was not prepared in spite of her affection for him to let this fact spoil the situation she was not even prepared or so she thought to resent his want of sympathy for it would be his privilegeit would be indeed his natural lineto find fault with any step she might take toward marriage ones cousin always pretended to hate ones husband that was traditional classical it was a part of ones cousins always pretending to adore one ralph was nothing if not critical and though she would certainly other things being equal have been as glad to marry to please him as to please any one it would be absurd to regard as important that her choice should square with his views what were his views after all he had pretended to believe she had better have married lord warburton but this was only because she had refused that excellent man if she had accepted him ralph would certainly have taken another tone he always took the opposite you could criticise any marriage it was the essence of a marriage to be open to criticism how well she herself should she only give her mind to it might criticise this union of her own she had other employment however and ralph was welcome to relieve her of the care isabel was prepared to be most patient and most indulgent he must have seen that and this made it the more odd he should say nothing after three days had elapsed without his speaking our young woman wearied of waiting dislike it as he would he might at least go through the form we who know more about poor ralph than his cousin may easily believe that during the hours that followed his arrival at palazzo crescentini he had privately gone through many forms his mother had literally greeted him with the great news which had been even more sensibly chilling than mrs touchetts maternal kiss ralph was shocked and humiliated his calculations had been false and the person in the world in whom he was most interested was lost he drifted about the house like a rudderless vessel in a rocky stream or sat in the garden of the palace on a great cane chair his long legs extended his head thrown back and his hat pulled over his eyes he felt cold about the heart he had never liked anything less what could he do what could he say if the girl were irreclaimable could he pretend to like it to attempt to reclaim her was permissible only if the attempt should succeed to try to persuade her of anything sordid or sinister in the man to whose deep art she had succumbed would be decently discreet only in the event of her being persuaded otherwise he should simply have damned himself it cost him an equal effort to speak his thought and to dissemble he could neither assent with sincerity nor protest with hope meanwhile he knewor rather he supposedthat the affianced pair were daily renewing their mutual vows osmond at this moment showed himself little at palazzo crescentini but isabel met him every day elsewhere as she was free to do after their engagement had been made public she had taken a carriage by the month so as not to be indebted to her aunt for the means of pursuing a course of which mrs touchett disapproved and she drove in the morning to the cascine this suburban wilderness during the early hours was void of all intruders and our young lady joined by her lover in its quietest part strolled with him a while through the grey italian shade and listened to the nightingales    chapter xxxiv  one morning on her return from her drive some halfhour before luncheon she quitted her vehicle in the court of the palace and instead of ascending the great staircase crossed the court passed beneath another archway and entered the garden a sweeter spot at this moment could not have been imagined the stillness of noontide hung over it and the warm shade enclosed and still made bowers like spacious caves ralph was sitting there in the clear gloom at the base of a statue of terpsichorea dancing nymph with taper fingers and inflated draperies in the manner of bernini the extreme relaxation of his attitude suggested at first to isabel that he was asleep her light footstep on the grass had not roused him and before turning away she stood for a moment looking at him during this instant he opened his eyes upon which she sat down on a rustic chair that matched with his own though in her irritation she had accused him of indifference she was not blind to the fact that he had visibly had something to brood over but she had explained his air of absence partly by the languor of his increased weakness partly by worries connected with the property inherited from his fatherthe fruit of eccentric arrangements of which mrs touchett disapproved and which as she had told isabel now encountered opposition from the other partners in the bank he ought to have gone to england his mother said instead of coming to florence he had not been there for months and took no more interest in the bank than in the state of patagonia  im sorry i waked you isabel said you look too tired  i feel too tired but i was not asleep i was thinking of you  are you tired of that  very much so it leads to nothing the roads long and i never arrive  what do you wish to arrive at she put to him closing her parasol  at the point of expressing to myself properly what i think of your engagement  dont think too much of it she lightly returned  do you mean that its none of my business  beyond a certain point yes  thats the point i want to fix i had an idea you may have found me wanting in good manners ive never congratulated you  of course ive noticed that i wondered why you were silent  there have been a good many reasons ill tell you now ralph said he pulled off his hat and laid it on the ground then he sat looking at her he leaned back under the protection of bernini his head against his marble pedestal his arms dropped on either side of him his hands laid upon the rests of his wide chair he looked awkward uncomfortable he hesitated long isabel said nothing when people were embarrassed she was usually sorry for them but she was determined not to help ralph to utter a word that should not be to the honour of her high decision i think ive hardly got over my surprise he went on at last you were the last person i expected to see caught  i dont know why you call it caught  because youre going to be put into a cage  if i like my cage that neednt trouble you she answered  thats what i wonder at thats what ive been thinking of  if youve been thinking you may imagine how ive thought im satisfied that im doing well  you must have changed immensely a year ago you valued your liberty beyond everything you wanted only to see life  ive seen it said isabel it doesnt look to me now i admit such an inviting expanse  i dont pretend it is only i had an idea that you took a genial view of it and wanted to survey the whole field  ive seen that one cant do anything so general one must choose a corner and cultivate that  thats what i think and one must choose as good a corner as possible i had no idea all winter while i read your delightful letters that you were choosing you said nothing about it and your silence put me off my guard  it was not a matter i was likely to write to you about besides i knew nothing of the future it has all come lately if you had been on your guard however isabel asked what would you have done  i should have said wait a little longer  wait for what  well for a little more light said ralph with rather an absurd smile while his hands found their way into his pockets  where should my light have come from from you  i might have struck a spark or two  isabel had drawn off her gloves she smoothed them out as they lay upon her knee the mildness of this movement was accidental for her expression was not conciliatory youre beating about the bush ralph you wish to say you dont like mr osmond and yet youre afraid  willing to wound and yet afraid to strike im willing to wound him yesbut not to wound you im afraid of you not of him if you marry him it wont be a fortunate way for me to have spoken  if i marry him have you had any expectation of dissuading me  of course that seems to you too fatuous  no said isabel after a little it seems to me too touching  thats the same thing it makes me so ridiculous that you pity me  she stroked out her long gloves again i know youve a great affection for me i cant get rid of that  for heavens sake dont try keep that well in sight it will convince you how intensely i want you to do well  and how little you trust me  there was a moments silence the warm noontide seemed to listen i trust you but i dont trust him said ralph  she raised her eyes and gave him a wide deep look youve said it now and im glad youve made it so clear but youll suffer by it  not if youre just  im very just said isabel what better proof of it can there be than that im not angry with you i dont know whats the matter with me but im not i was when you began but it has passed away perhaps i ought to be angry but mr osmond wouldnt think so he wants me to know everything thats what i like him for youve nothing to gain i know that ive never been so nice to you as a girl that you should have much reason for wishing me to remain one you give very good advice youve often done so no im very quiet ive always believed in your wisdom she went on boasting of her quietness yet speaking with a kind of contained exaltation it was her passionate desire to be just it touched ralph to the heart affected him like a caress from a creature he had injured he wished to interrupt to reassure her for a moment he was absurdly inconsistent he would have retracted what he had said but she gave him no chance she went on having caught a glimpse as she thought of the heroic line and desiring to advance in that direction i see youve some special idea i should like very much to hear it im sure its disinterested i feel that it seems a strange thing to argue about and of course i ought to tell you definitely that if you expect to dissuade me you may give it up youll not move me an inch its too late as you say im caught certainly it wont be pleasant for you to remember this but your pain will be in your own thoughts i shall never reproach you  i dont think you ever will said ralph its not in the least the sort of marriage i thought youd make  what sort of marriage was that pray  well i can hardly say i hadnt exactly a positive view of it but i had a negative i didnt think youd decide forwell for that type  whats the matter with mr osmonds type if it be one his being so independent so individual is what i most see in him the girl declared what do you know against him you know him scarcely at all  yes ralph said i know him very little and i confess i havent facts and items to prove him a villain but all the same i cant help feeling that youre running a grave risk  marriage is always a grave risk and his risks as grave as mine  thats his affair if hes afraid let him back out i wish to god he would  isabel reclined in her chair folding her arms and gazing a while at her cousin i dont think i understand you she said at last coldly i dont know what youre talking about  i believed youd marry a man of more importance  cold i say her tone had been but at this a colour like a flame leaped into her face of more importance to whom it seems to me enough that ones husband should be of importance to ones self  ralph blushed as well his attitude embarrassed him physically speaking he proceeded to change it he straightened himself then leaned forward resting a hand on each knee he fixed his eyes on the ground he had an air of the most respectful deliberation  ill tell you in a moment what i mean he presently said he felt agitated intensely eager now that he had opened the discussion he wished to discharge his mind but he wished also to be superlatively gentle  isabel waited a littlethen she went on with majesty in everything that makes one care for people mr osmond is preeminent there may be nobler natures but ive never had the pleasure of meeting one mr osmonds is the finest i know hes good enough for me and interesting enough and clever enough im far more struck with what he has and what he represents than with what he may lack  i had treated myself to a charming vision of your future ralph observed without answering this i had amused myself with planning out a high destiny for you there was to be nothing of this sort in it you were not to come down so easily or so soon  come down you say  well that renders my sense of what has happened to you you seemed to me to be soaring far up in the blueto be sailing in the bright light over the heads of men suddenly some one tosses up a faded rosebuda missile that should never have reached youand straight you drop to the ground it hurts me said ralph audaciously hurts me as if i had fallen myself  the look of pain and bewilderment deepened in his companions face i dont understand you in the least she repeated you say you amused yourself with a project for my careeri dont understand that dont amuse yourself too much or i shall think youre doing it at my expense  ralph shook his head im not afraid of your not believing that ive had great ideas for you  what do you mean by my soaring and sailing she pursued  ive never moved on a higher plane than im moving on now theres nothing higher for a girl than to marry aa person she likes said poor isabel wandering into the didactic  its your liking the person we speak of that i venture to criticise my dear cousin i should have said that the man for you would have been a more active larger freer sort of nature ralph hesitated then added i cant get over the sense that osmond is somehowwell small he had uttered the last word with no great assurance he was afraid she would flash out again but to his surprise she was quiet she had the air of considering  small she made it sound immense  i think hes narrow selfish he takes himself so seriously  he has a great respect for himself i dont blame him for that said isabel it makes one more sure to respect others  ralph for a moment felt almost reassured by her reasonable tone  yes but everything is relative one ought to feel ones relation to thingsto others i dont think mr osmond does that  ive chiefly to do with his relation to me in that hes excellent  hes the incarnation of taste ralph went on thinking hard how he could best express gilbert osmonds sinister attributes without putting himself in the wrong by seeming to describe him coarsely he wished to describe him impersonally scientifically he judges and measures approves and condemns altogether by that  its a happy thing then that his taste should be exquisite  its exquisite indeed since it has led him to select you as his bride but have you ever seen such a tastea really exquisite oneruffled  i hope it may never be my fortune to fail to gratify my husbands  at these words a sudden passion leaped to ralphs lips ah thats wilful thats unworthy of you you were not meant to be measured in that wayyou were meant for something better than to keep guard over the sensibilities of a sterile dilettante  isabel rose quickly and he did the same so that they stood for a moment looking at each other as if he had flung down a defiance or an insult but you go too far she simply breathed  ive said what i had on my mindand ive said it because i love you  isabel turned pale was he too on that tiresome list she had a sudden wish to strike him off ah then youre not disinterested  i love you but i love without hope said ralph quickly forcing a smile and feeling that in that last declaration he had expressed more than he intended  isabel moved away and stood looking into the sunny stillness of the garden but after a little she turned back to him im afraid your talk then is the wildness of despair i dont understand itbut it doesnt matter im not arguing with you its impossible i should ive only tried to listen to you im much obliged to you for attempting to explain she said gently as if the anger with which she had just sprung up had already subsided its very good of you to try to warn me if youre really alarmed but i wont promise to think of what youve said i shall forget it as soon as possible try and forget it yourself youve done your duty and no man can do more i cant explain to you what i feel what i believe and i wouldnt if i could she paused a moment and then went on with an inconsequence that ralph observed even in the midst of his eagerness to discover some symptom of concession i cant enter into your idea of mr osmond i cant do it justice because i see him in quite another way hes not importantno hes not important hes a man to whom importance is supremely indifferent if thats what you mean when you call him small then hes as small as you please i call that largeits the largest thing i know i wont pretend to argue with you about a person im going to marry isabel repeated im not in the least concerned to defend mr osmond hes not so weak as to need my defence i should think it would seem strange even to yourself that i should talk of him so quietly and coldly as if he were any one else i wouldnt talk of him at all to any one but you and you after what youve saidi may just answer you once for all pray would you wish me to make a mercenary marriagewhat they call a marriage of ambition ive only one ambitionto be free to follow out a good feeling i had others once but theyve passed away do you complain of mr osmond because hes not rich thats just what i like him for ive fortunately money enough ive never felt so thankful for it as today there have been moments when i should like to go and kneel down by your fathers grave he did perhaps a better thing than he knew when he put it into my power to marry a poor mana man who has borne his poverty with such dignity with such indifference mr osmond has never scrambled nor struggledhe has cared for no worldly prize if thats to be narrow if thats to be selfish then its very well im not frightened by such words im not even displeased im only sorry that you should make a mistake others might have done so but im surprised that you should you might know a gentleman when you see oneyou might know a fine mind mr osmond makes no mistakes he knows everything he understands everything he has the kindest gentlest highest spirit youve got hold of some false idea its a pity but i cant help it it regards you more than me isabel paused a moment looking at her cousin with an eye illumined by a sentiment which contradicted the careful calmness of her mannera mingled sentiment to which the angry pain excited by his words and the wounded pride of having needed to justify a choice of which she felt only the nobleness and purity equally contributed though she paused ralph said nothing he saw she had more to say she was grand but she was highly solicitous she was indifferent but she was all in a passion what sort of a person should you have liked me to marry she asked suddenly you talk about ones soaring and sailing but if one marries at all one touches the earth one has human feelings and needs one has a heart in ones bosom and one must marry a particular individual your mother has never forgiven me for not having come to a better understanding with lord warburton and shes horrified at my contenting myself with a person who has none of his great advantagesno property no title no honours no houses nor lands nor position nor reputation nor brilliant belongings of any sort its the total absence of all these things that pleases me mr osmonds simply a very lonely a very cultivated and a very honest manhes not a prodigious proprietor  ralph had listened with great attention as if everything she said merited deep consideration but in truth he was only half thinking of the things she said he was for the rest simply accommodating himself to the weight of his total impressionthe impression of her ardent good faith she was wrong but she believed she was deluded but she was dismally consistent it was wonderfully characteristic of her that having invented a fine theory about gilbert osmond she loved him not for what he really possessed but for his very poverties dressed out as honours ralph remembered what he had said to his father about wishing to put it into her power to meet the requirements of her imagination he had done so and the girl had taken full advantage of the luxury poor ralph felt sick he felt ashamed isabel had uttered her last words with a low solemnity of conviction which virtually terminated the discussion and she closed it formally by turning away and walking back to the house ralph walked beside her and they passed into the court together and reached the big staircase here he stopped and isabel paused turning on him a face of elationabsolutely and perversely of gratitude his opposition had made her own conception of her conduct clearer to her shall you not come up to breakfast she asked  no i want no breakfast im not hungry  you ought to eat said the girl you live on air  i do very much and i shall go back into the garden and take another mouthful i came thus far simply to say this i told you last year that if you were to get into trouble i should feel terribly sold thats how i feel today  do you think im in trouble  ones in trouble when ones in error  very well said isabel i shall never complain of my trouble to you and she moved up the staircase  ralph standing there with his hands in his pockets followed her with his eyes then the lurking chill of the highwalled court struck him and made him shiver so that he returned to the garden to breakfast on the florentine sunshine    chapter xxxv  isabel when she strolled in the cascine with her lover felt no impulse to tell him how little he was approved at palazzo crescentini the discreet opposition offered to her marriage by her aunt and her cousin made on the whole no great impression upon her the moral of it was simply that they disliked gilbert osmond this dislike was not alarming to isabel she scarcely even regretted it for it served mainly to throw into higher relief the fact in every way so honourable that she married to please herself one did other things to please other people one did this for a more personal satisfaction and isabels satisfaction was confirmed by her lovers admirable good conduct gilbert osmond was in love and he had never deserved less than during these still bright days each of them numbered which preceded the fulfilment of his hopes the harsh criticism passed upon him by ralph touchett the chief impression produced on isabels spirit by this criticism was that the passion of love separated its victim terribly from every one but the loved object she felt herself disjoined from every one she had ever known beforefrom her two sisters who wrote to express a dutiful hope that she would be happy and a surprise somewhat more vague at her not having chosen a consort who was the hero of a richer accumulation of anecdote from henrietta who she was sure would come out too late on purpose to remonstrate from lord warburton who would certainly console himself and from caspar goodwood who perhaps would not from her aunt who had cold shallow ideas about marriage for which she was not sorry to display her contempt and from ralph whose talk about having great views for her was surely but a whimsical cover for a personal disappointment ralph apparently wished her not to marry at allthat was what it really meantbecause he was amused with the spectacle of her adventures as a single woman his disappointment made him say angry things about the man she had preferred even to him isabel flattered herself that she believed ralph had been angry it was the more easy for her to believe this because as i say she had now little free or unemployed emotion for minor needs and accepted as an incident in fact quite as an ornament of her lot the idea that to prefer gilbert osmond as she preferred him was perforce to break all other ties she tasted of the sweets of this preference and they made her conscious almost with awe of the invidious and remorseless tide of the charmed and possessed condition great as was the traditional honour and imputed virtue of being in love it was the tragic part of happiness ones right was always made of the wrong of some one else  the elation of success which surely now flamed high in osmond emitted meanwhile very little smoke for so brilliant a blaze contentment on his part took no vulgar form excitement in the most selfconscious of men was a kind of ecstasy of selfcontrol this disposition however made him an admirable lover it gave him a constant view of the smitten and dedicated state he never forgot himself as i say and so he never forgot to be graceful and tender to wear the appearancewhich presented indeed no difficultyof stirred senses and deep intentions he was immensely pleased with his young lady madame merle had made him a present of incalculable value what could be a finer thing to live with than a high spirit attuned to softness for would not the softness be all for ones self and the strenuousness for society which admired the air of superiority what could be a happier gift in a companion than a quick fanciful mind which saved one repetitions and reflected ones thought on a polished elegant surface osmond hated to see his thought reproduced literallythat made it look stale and stupid he preferred it to be freshened in the reproduction even as words by music his egotism had never taken the crude form of desiring a dull wife this ladys intelligence was to be a silver plate not an earthen onea plate that he might heap up with ripe fruits to which it would give a decorative value so that talk might become for him a sort of served dessert he found the silver quality in this perfection in isabel he could tap her imagination with his knuckle and make it ring he knew perfectly though he had not been told that their union enjoyed little favour with the girls relations but he had always treated her so completely as an independent person that it hardly seemed necessary to express regret for the attitude of her family nevertheless one morning he made an abrupt allusion to it its the difference in our fortune they dont like he said they think im in love with your money  are you speaking of my auntof my cousin isabel asked how do you know what they think  youve not told me theyre pleased and when i wrote to mrs touchett the other day she never answered my note if they had been delighted i should have had some sign of it and the fact of my being poor and you rich is the most obvious explanation of their reserve but of course when a poor man marries a rich girl he must be prepared for imputations i dont mind them i only care for one thingfor your not having the shadow of a doubt i dont care what people of whom i ask nothing thinkim not even capable perhaps of wanting to know ive never so concerned myself god forgive me and why should i begin today when i have taken to myself a compensation for everything i wont pretend im sorry youre rich im delighted i delight in everything thats yourswhether it be money or virtue moneys a horrid thing to follow but a charming thing to meet it seems to me however that ive sufficiently proved the limits of my itch for it i never in my life tried to earn a penny and i ought to be less subject to suspicion than most of the people one sees grubbing and grabbing i suppose its their business to suspectthat of your family its proper on the whole they should theyll like me better some day so will you for that matter meanwhile my business is not to make myself bad blood but simply to be thankful for life and love it has made me better loving you he said on another occasion it has made me wiser and easier andi wont pretend to denybrighter and nicer and even stronger i used to want a great many things before and to be angry i didnt have them theoretically i was satisfied as i once told you i flattered myself i had limited my wants but i was subject to irritation i used to have morbid sterile hateful fits of hunger of desire now im really satisfied because i cant think of anything better its just as when one has been trying to spell out a book in the twilight and suddenly the lamp comes in i had been putting out my eyes over the book of life and finding nothing to reward me for my pains but now that i can read it properly i see its a delightful story my dear girl i cant tell you how life seems to stretch there before uswhat a long summer afternoon awaits us its the latter half of an italian daywith a golden haze and the shadows just lengthening and that divine delicacy in the light the air the landscape which i have loved all my life and which you love today upon my honour i dont see why we shouldnt get on weve got what we liketo say nothing of having each other weve the faculty of admiration and several capital convictions were not stupid were not mean were not under bonds to any kind of ignorance or dreariness youre remarkably fresh and im remarkably wellseasoned weve my poor child to amuse us well try and make up some little life for her its all soft and mellowit has the italian colouring  they made a good many plans but they left themselves also a good deal of latitude it was a matter of course however that they should live for the present in italy it was in italy that they had met italy had been a party to their first impressions of each other and italy should be a party to their happiness osmond had the attachment of old acquaintance and isabel the stimulus of new which seemed to assure her a future at a high level of consciousness of the beautiful the desire for unlimited expansion had been succeeded in her soul by the sense that life was vacant without some private duty that might gather ones energies to a point she had told ralph she had seen life in a year or two and that she was already tired not of the act of living but of that of observing what had become of all her ardours her aspirations her theories her high estimate of her independence and her incipient conviction that she should never marry these things had been absorbed in a more primitive needa need the answer to which brushed away numberless questions yet gratified infinite desires it simplified the situation at a stroke it came down from above like the light of the stars and it needed no explanation there was explanation enough in the fact that he was her lover her own and that she should be able to be of use to him she could surrender to him with a kind of humility she could marry him with a kind of pride she was not only taking she was giving  he brought pansy with him two or three times to the cascinepansy who was very little taller than a year before and not much older that she would always be a child was the conviction expressed by her father who held her by the hand when she was in her sixteenth year and told her to go and play while he sat down a little with the pretty lady pansy wore a short dress and a long coat her hat always seemed too big for her she found pleasure in walking off with quick short steps to the end of the alley and then in walking back with a smile that seemed an appeal for approbation isabel approved in abundance and the abundance had the personal touch that the childs affectionate nature craved she watched her indications as if for herself also much depended on thempansy already so represented part of the service she could render part of the responsibility she could face her father took so the childish view of her that he had not yet explained to her the new relation in which he stood to the elegant miss archer she doesnt know he said to isabel she doesnt guess she thinks it perfectly natural that you and i should come and walk here together simply as good friends there seems to me something enchantingly innocent in that its the way i like her to be no im not a failure as i used to think ive succeeded in two things im to marry the woman i adore and ive brought up my child as i wished in the old way  he was very fond in all things of the old way that had struck isabel as one of his fine quiet sincere notes it occurs to me that youll not know whether youve succeeded until youve told her she said you must see how she takes your news she may be horrifiedshe may be jealous  im not afraid of that shes too fond of you on her own account i should like to leave her in the dark a little longerto see if it will come into her head that if were not engaged we ought to be  isabel was impressed by osmonds artistic the plastic view as it somehow appeared of pansys innocenceher own appreciation of it being more anxiously moral she was perhaps not the less pleased when he told her a few days later that he had communicated the fact to his daughter who had made such a pretty little speechoh then i shall have a beautiful sister she was neither surprised nor alarmed she had not cried as he expected  perhaps she had guessed it said isabel  dont say that i should be disgusted if i believed that i thought it would be just a little shock but the way she took it proves that her good manners are paramount thats also what i wished you shall see for yourself tomorrow she shall make you her congratulations in person  the meeting on the morrow took place at the countess geminis whither pansy had been conducted by her father who knew that isabel was to come in the afternoon to return a visit made her by the countess on learning that they were to become sistersinlaw calling at casa touchett the visitor had not found isabel at home but after our young woman had been ushered into the countesss drawingroom pansy arrived to say that her aunt would presently appear pansy was spending the day with that lady who thought her of an age to begin to learn how to carry herself in company it was isabels view that the little girl might have given lessons in deportment to her relative and nothing could have justified this conviction more than the manner in which pansy acquitted herself while they waited together for the countess her fathers decision the year before had finally been to send her back to the convent to receive the last graces and madame catherine had evidently carried out her theory that pansy was to be fitted for the great world  papa has told me that youve kindly consented to marry him said this excellent womans pupil its very delightful i think youll suit very well  you think i shall suit you  youll suit me beautifully but what i mean is that you and papa will suit each other youre both so quiet and so serious youre not so quiet as heor even as madame merle but youre more quiet than many others he should not for instance have a wife like my aunt shes always in motion in agitationtoday especially youll see when she comes in they told us at the convent it was wrong to judge our elders but i suppose theres no harm if we judge them favourably youll be a delightful companion for papa  for you too i hope isabel said  i speak first of him on purpose ive told you already what i myself think of you i liked you from the first i admire you so much that i think it will be a good fortune to have you always before me youll be my model i shall try to imitate you though im afraid it will be very feeble im very glad for papahe needed something more than me without you i dont see how he could have got it youll be my stepmother but we mustnt use that word theyre always said to be cruel but i dont think youll ever so much as pinch or even push me im not afraid at all  my good little pansy said isabel gently i shall be ever so kind to you a vague inconsequent vision of her coming in some odd way to need it had intervened with the effect of a chill  very well then ive nothing to fear the child returned with her note of prepared promptitude what teaching she had had it seemed to suggestor what penalties for nonperformance she dreaded  her description of her aunt had not been incorrect the countess gemini was further than ever from having folded her wings she entered the room with a flutter through the air and kissed isabel first on the forehead and then on each cheek as if according to some ancient prescribed rite she drew the visitor to a sofa and looking at her with a variety of turns of the head began to talk very much as if seated brush in hand before an easel she were applying a series of considered touches to a composition of figures already sketched in if you expect me to congratulate you i must beg you to excuse me i dont suppose you care if i do or not i believe youre supposed not to carethrough being so cleverfor all sorts of ordinary things but i care myself if i tell fibs i never tell them unless theres something rather good to be gained i dont see whats to be gained with youespecially as you wouldnt believe me i dont make professions any more than i make paper flowers or flouncey lampshadesi dont know how my lampshades would be sure to take fire my roses and my fibs to be larger than life im very glad for my own sake that youre to marry osmond but i wont pretend im glad for yours youre very brilliantyou know thats the way youre always spoken of youre an heiress and very goodlooking and original not banal so its a good thing to have you in the family our familys very good you know osmond will have told you that and my mother was rather distinguishedshe was called the american corinne but were dreadfully fallen i think and perhaps youll pick us up ive great confidence in you there are ever so many things i want to talk to you about i never congratulate any girl on marrying i think they ought to make it somehow not quite so awful a steel trap i suppose pansy oughtnt to hear all this but thats what she has come to me forto acquire the tone of society theres no harm in her knowing what horrors she may be in for when first i got an idea that my brother had designs on you i thought of writing to you to recommend you in the strongest terms not to listen to him then i thought it would be disloyal and i hate anything of that kind besides as i say i was enchanted for myself and after all im very selfish by the way you wont respect me not one little mite and we shall never be intimate i should like it but you wont some day all the same we shall be better friends than you will believe at first my husband will come and see you though as you probably know hes on no sort of terms with osmond hes very fond of going to see pretty women but im not afraid of you in the first place i dont care what he does in the second you wont care a straw for him he wont be a bit at any time your affair and stupid as he is hell see youre not his some day if you can stand it ill tell you all about him do you think my niece ought to go out of the room pansy go and practise a little in my boudoir  let her stay please said isabel i would rather hear nothing that pansy may not    chapter xxxvi  one afternoon of the autumn of 1876 toward dusk a young man of pleasing appearance rang at the door of a small apartment on the third floor of an old roman house on its being opened he enquired for madame merle whereupon the servant a neat plain woman with a french face and a ladys maids manner ushered him into a diminutive drawingroom and requested the favour of his name mr edward rosier said the young man who sat down to wait till his hostess should appear  the reader will perhaps not have forgotten that mr rosier was an ornament of the american circle in paris but it may also be remembered that he sometimes vanished from its horizon he had spent a portion of several winters at pau and as he was a gentleman of constituted habits he might have continued for years to pay his annual visit to this charming resort in the summer of 1876 however an incident befell him which changed the current not only of his thoughts but of his customary sequences he passed a month in the upper engadine and encountered at saint moritz a charming young girl to this little person he began to pay on the spot particular attention she struck him as exactly the household angel he had long been looking for he was never precipitate he was nothing if not discreet so he forbore for the present to declare his passion but it seemed to him when they partedthe young lady to go down into italy and her admirer to proceed to geneva where he was under bonds to join other friendsthat he should be romantically wretched if he were not to see her again the simplest way to do so was to go in the autumn to rome where miss osmond was domiciled with her family mr rosier started on his pilgrimage to the italian capital and reached it on the first of november it was a pleasant thing to do but for the young man there was a strain of the heroic in the enterprise he might expose himself unseasoned to the poison of the roman air which in november lay notoriously much in wait fortune however favours the brave and this adventurer who took three grains of quinine a day had at the end of a month no cause to deplore his temerity he had made to a certain extent good use of his time he had devoted it in vain to finding a flaw in pansy osmonds composition she was admirably finished she had had the last touch she was really a consummate piece he thought of her in amorous meditation a good deal as he might have thought of a dresdenchina shepherdess miss osmond indeed in the bloom of her juvenility had a hint of the rococo which rosier whose taste was predominantly for that manner could not fail to appreciate that he esteemed the productions of comparatively frivolous periods would have been apparent from the attention he bestowed upon madame merles drawingroom which although furnished with specimens of every style was especially rich in articles of the last two centuries he had immediately put a glass into one eye and looked round and then by jove she has some jolly good things he had yearningly murmured the room was small and densely filled with furniture it gave an impression of faded silk and little statuettes which might totter if one moved rosier got up and wandered about with his careful tread bending over the tables charged with knickknacks and the cushions embossed with princely arms when madame merle came in she found him standing before the fireplace with his nose very close to the great lace flounce attached to the damask cover of the mantel he had lifted it delicately as if he were smelling it  its old venetian she said its rather good  its too good for this you ought to wear it  they tell me you have some better in paris in the same situation  ah but i cant wear mine smiled the visitor  i dont see why you shouldnt ive better lace than that to wear  his eyes wandered lingeringly round the room again youve some very good things  yes but i hate them  do you want to get rid of them the young man quickly asked  no its good to have something to hate one works it off  i love my things said mr rosier as he sat there flushed with all his recognitions but its not about them nor about yours that i came to talk to you he paused a moment and then with greater softness i care more for miss osmond than for all the bibelots in europe  madame merle opened wide eyes did you come to tell me that  i came to ask your advice  she looked at him with a friendly frown stroking her chin with her large white hand a man in love you know doesnt ask advice  why not if hes in a difficult position thats often the case with a man in love ive been in love before and i know but never so much as this timereally never so much i should like particularly to know what you think of my prospects im afraid that for mr osmond im notwell a real collectors piece  do you wish me to intercede madame merle asked with her fine arms folded and her handsome mouth drawn up to the left  if you could say a good word for me i should be greatly obliged there will be no use in my troubling miss osmond unless i have good reason to believe her father will consent  youre very considerate thats in your favour but you assume in rather an offhand way that i think you a prize  youve been very kind to me said the young man thats why i came  im always kind to people who have good louis quatorze its very rare now and theres no telling what one may get by it with which the lefthand corner of madame merles mouth gave expression to the joke  but he looked in spite of it literally apprehensive and consistently strenuous ah i thought you liked me for myself  i like you very much but if you please we wont analyse pardon me if i seem patronising but i think you a perfect little gentleman i must tell you however that ive not the marrying of pansy osmond  i didnt suppose that but youve seemed to me intimate with her family and i thought you might have influence  madame merle considered whom do you call her family  why her father andhow do you say it in englishher bellemere  mr osmonds her father certainly but his wife can scarcely be termed a member of her family mrs osmond has nothing to do with marrying her  im sorry for that said rosier with an amiable sigh of good faith i think mrs osmond would favour me  very likelyif her husband doesnt  he raised his eyebrows does she take the opposite line from him  in everything they think quite differently  well said rosier im sorry for that but its none of my business shes very fond of pansy  yes shes very fond of pansy  and pansy has a great affection for her she has told me how she loves her as if she were her own mother  you must after all have had some very intimate talk with the poor child said madame merle have you declared your sentiments  never cried rosier lifting his neatlygloved hand never till ive assured myself of those of the parents  you always wait for that youve excellent principles you observe the proprieties  i think youre laughing at me the young man murmured dropping back in his chair and feeling his small moustache i didnt expect that of you madame merle  she shook her head calmly like a person who saw things as she saw them you dont do me justice i think your conduct in excellent taste and the best you could adopt yes thats what i think  i wouldnt agitate heronly to agitate her i love her too much for that said ned rosier  im glad after all that youve told me madame merle went on leave it to me a little i think i can help you  i said you were the person to come to her visitor cried with prompt elation  you were very clever madame merle returned more dryly when i say i can help you i mean once assuming your cause to be good let us think a little if it is  im awfully decent you know said rosier earnestly i wont say ive no faults but ill say ive no vices  all thats negative and it always depends also on what people call vices whats the positive side whats the virtuous what have you got besides your spanish lace and your dresden teacups  ive a comfortable little fortuneabout forty thousand francs a year with the talent i have for arranging we can live beautifully on such an income  beautifully no sufficiently yes even that depends on where you live  well in paris i would undertake it in paris  madame merles mouth rose to the left it wouldnt be famous youd have to make use of the teacups and theyd get broken  we dont want to be famous if miss osmond should have everything pretty it would be enough when ones as pretty as she one can affordwell quite cheap faience she ought never to wear anything but muslinwithout the sprig said rosier reflectively  wouldnt you even allow her the sprig shed be much obliged to you at any rate for that theory  its the correct one i assure you and im sure shed enter into it she understands all that thats why i love her  shes a very good little girl and most tidyalso extremely graceful but her father to the best of my belief can give her nothing  rosier scarce demurred i dont in the least desire that he should but i may remark all the same that he lives like a rich man  the moneys his wifes she brought him a large fortune  mrs osmond then is very fond of her stepdaughter she may do something  for a lovesick swain you have your eyes about you madame merle exclaimed with a laugh  i esteem a dot very much i can do without it but i esteem it  mrs osmond madame merle went on will probably prefer to keep her money for her own children  her own children surely she has none  she may have yet she had a poor little boy who died two years ago six months after his birth others therefore may come  i hope they will if it will make her happy shes a splendid woman  madame merle failed to burst into speech ah about her theres much to be said splendid as you like weve not exactly made out that youre a parti the absence of vices is hardly a source of income  pardon me i think it may be said rosier quite lucidly  youll be a touching couple living on your innocence  i think you underrate me  youre not so innocent as that seriously said madame merle of course forty thousand francs a year and a nice character are a combination to be considered i dont say its to be jumped at but there might be a worse offer mr osmond however will probably incline to believe he can do better  he can do so perhaps but what can his daughter do she cant do better than marry the man she loves for she does you know rosier added eagerly  she doesi know it  ah cried the young man i said you were the person to come to  but i dont know how you know it if you havent asked her madame merle went on  in such a case theres no need of asking and telling as you say were an innocent couple how did you know it  i who am not innocent by being very crafty leave it to me ill find out for you  rosier got up and stood smoothing his hat you say that rather coldly dont simply find out how it is but try to make it as it should be  ill do my best ill try to make the most of your advantages  thank you so very much meanwhile then ill say a word to mrs osmond  gardezvousen bien and madame merle was on her feet dont set her going or youll spoil everything  rosier gazed into his hat he wondered whether his hostess had been after all the right person to come to i dont think i understand you im an old friend of mrs osmond and i think she would like me to succeed  be an old friend as much as you like the more old friends she has the better for she doesnt get on very well with some of her new but dont for the present try to make her take up the cudgels for you her husband may have other views and as a person who wishes her well i advise you not to multiply points of difference between them  poor rosiers face assumed an expression of alarm a suit for the hand of pansy osmond was even a more complicated business than his taste for proper transitions had allowed but the extreme good sense which he concealed under a surface suggesting that of a careful owners best set came to his assistance i dont see that im bound to consider mr osmond so very much he exclaimed no but you should consider her you say youre an old friend would you make her suffer  not for the world  then be very careful and let the matter alone till ive taken a few soundings  let the matter alone dear madame merle remember that im in love  oh you wont burn up why did you come to me if youre not to heed what i say  youre very kind ill be very good the young man promised but im afraid mr osmonds pretty hard he added in his mild voice as he went to the door  madame merle gave a short laugh it has been said before but his wife isnt easy either  ah shes a splendid woman ned rosier repeated for departure he resolved that his conduct should be worthy of an aspirant who was already a model of discretion but he saw nothing in any pledge he had given madame merle that made it improper he should keep himself in spirits by an occasional visit to miss osmonds home he reflected constantly on what his adviser had said to him and turned over in his mind the impression of her rather circumspect tone he had gone to her de confiance as they put it in paris but it was possible he had been precipitate he found difficulty in thinking of himself as rashhe had incurred this reproach so rarely but it certainly was true that he had known madame merle only for the last month and that his thinking her a delightful woman was not when one came to look into it a reason for assuming that she would be eager to push pansy osmond into his arms gracefully arranged as these members might be to receive her she had indeed shown him benevolence and she was a person of consideration among the girls people where she had a rather striking appearance rosier had more than once wondered how she managed it of being intimate without being familiar but possibly he had exaggerated these advantages there was no particular reason why she should take trouble for him a charming woman was charming to every one and rosier felt rather a fool when he thought of his having appealed to her on the ground that she had distinguished him very likelythough she had appeared to say it in jokeshe was really only thinking of his bibelots had it come into her head that he might offer her two or three of the gems of his collection if she would only help him to marry miss osmond he would present her with his whole museum he could hardly say so to her outright it would seem too gross a bribe but he should like her to believe it  it was with these thoughts that he went again to mrs osmonds mrs osmond having an eveningshe had taken the thursday of each weekwhen his presence could be accounted for on general principles of civility the object of mr rosiers wellregulated affection dwelt in a high house in the very heart of rome a dark and massive structure overlooking a sunny piazzetta in the neighbourhood of the farnese palace in a palace too little pansy liveda palace by roman measure but a dungeon to poor rosiers apprehensive mind it seemed to him of evil omen that the young lady he wished to marry and whose fastidious father he doubted of his ability to conciliate should be immured in a kind of domestic fortress a pile which bore a stern old roman name which smelt of historic deeds of crime and craft and violence which was mentioned in murray and visited by tourists who looked on a vague survey disappointed and depressed and which had frescoes by caravaggio in the piano nobile and a row of mutilated statues and dusty urns in the wide noblyarched loggia overhanging the damp court where a fountain gushed out of a mossy niche in a less preoccupied frame of mind he could have done justice to the palazzo roccanera he could have entered into the sentiment of mrs osmond who had once told him that on settling themselves in rome she and her husband had chosen this habitation for the love of local colour it had local colour enough and though he knew less about architecture than about limoges enamels he could see that the proportions of the windows and even the details of the cornice had quite the grand air but rosier was haunted by the conviction that at picturesque periods young girls had been shut up there to keep them from their true loves and hen under the threat of being thrown into convents had been forced into unholy marriages there was one point however to which he always did justice when once he found himself in mrs osmonds warm richlooking receptionrooms which were on the second floor he acknowledged that these people were very strong in good things it was a taste of osmonds ownnot at all of hers this she had told him the first time he came to the house when after asking himself for a quarter of an hour whether they had even better french than he in paris he was obliged on the spot to admit that they had very much and vanquished his envy as a gentleman should to the point of expressing to his hostess his pure admiration of her treasures he learned from mrs osmond that her husband had made a large collection before their marriage and that though he had annexed a number of fine pieces within the last three years he had achieved his greatest finds at a time when he had not the advantage of her advice rosier interpreted this information according to principles of his own for advice read cash he said to himself and the fact that gilbert osmond had landed his highest prizes during his impecunious season confirmed his most cherished doctrinethe doctrine that a collector may freely be poor if he be only patient in general when rosier presented himself on a thursday evening his first recognition was for the walls of the saloon there were three or four objects his eyes really yearned for but after his talk with madame merle he felt the extreme seriousness of his position and now when he came in he looked about for the daughter of the house with such eagerness as might be permitted a gentleman whose smile as he crossed a threshold always took everything comfortable for granted    chapter xxxvii  pansy was not in the first of the rooms a large apartment with a concave ceiling and walls covered with old red damask it was here mrs osmond usually satthough she was not in her most customary place tonightand that a circle of more especial intimates gathered about the fire the room was flushed with subdued diffused brightness it contained the larger things andalmost alwaysan odour of flowers pansy on this occasion was presumably in the next of the series the resort of younger visitors where tea was served osmond stood before the chimney leaning back with his hands behind him he had one foot up and was warming the sole half a dozen persons scattered near him were talking together but he was not in the conversation his eyes had an expression frequent with them that seemed to represent them as engaged with objects more worth their while than the appearances actually thrust upon them rosier coming in unannounced failed to attract his attention but the young man who was very punctilious though he was even exceptionally conscious that it was the wife not the husband he had come to see went up to shake hands with him osmond put out his left hand without changing his attitude  how dye do my wifes somewhere about  never fear i shall find her said rosier cheerfully  osmond however took him in he had never in his life felt himself so efficiently looked at madame merle has told him and he doesnt like it he privately reasoned he had hoped madame merle would be there but she was not in sight perhaps she was in one of the other rooms or would come later he had never especially delighted in gilbert osmond having a fancy he gave himself airs but rosier was not quickly resentful and where politeness was concerned had ever a strong need of being quite in the right he looked round him and smiled all without help and then in a moment i saw a jolly good piece of capo di monte today he said  osmond answered nothing at first but presently while he warmed his bootsole i dont care a fig for capo di monte he returned  i hope youre not losing your interest  in old pots and plates yes im losing my interest  rosier for an instant forgot the delicacy of his position youre not thinking of parting with aa piece or two  no im not thinking of parting with anything at all mr rosier said osmond with his eyes still on the eyes of his visitor  ah you want to keep but not to add rosier remarked brightly  exactly ive nothing i wish to match  poor rosier was aware he had blushed he was distressed at his want of assurance ah well i have was all he could murmur and he knew his murmur was partly lost as he turned away he took his course to the adjoining room and met mrs osmond coming out of the deep doorway she was dressed in black velvet she looked high and splendid as he had said and yet oh so radiantly gentle we know what mr rosier thought of her and the terms in which to madame merle he had expressed his admiration like his appreciation of her dear little stepdaughter it was based partly on his eye for decorative character his instinct for authenticity but also on a sense for uncatalogued values for that secret of a lustre beyond any recorded losing or rediscovering which his devotion to brittle wares had still not disqualified him to recognise mrs osmond at present might well have gratified such tastes the years had touched her only to enrich her the flower of her youth had not faded it only hung more quietly on its stem she had lost something of that quick eagerness to which her husband had privately taken exceptionshe had more the air of being able to wait now at all events framed in the gilded doorway she struck our young man as the picture of a gracious lady you see im very regular he said but who should be if im not  yes ive known you longer than any one here but we mustnt indulge in tender reminiscences i want to introduce you to a young lady  ah please what young lady rosier was immensely obliging but this was not what he had come for  she sits there by the fire in pink and has no one to speak to rosier hesitated a moment cant mr osmond speak to her hes within six feet of her  mrs osmond also hesitated shes not very lively and he doesnt like dull people  but shes good enough for me ah now thats hard  i only mean that youve ideas for two and then youre so obliging  no hes notto me and mrs osmond vaguely smiled  thats a sign he should be doubly so to other women  so i tell him she said still smiling  you see i want some tea rosier went on looking wistfully beyond  thats perfect go and give some to my young lady  very good but after that ill abandon her to her fate the simple truth is im dying to have a little talk with miss osmond  ah said isabel turning away i cant help you there  five minutes later while he handed a teacup to the damsel in pink whom he had conducted into the other room he wondered whether in making to mrs osmond the profession i have just quoted he had broken the spirit of his promise to madame merle such a question was capable of occupying this young mans mind for a considerable time at last however he becamecomparatively speakingreckless he cared little what promises he might break the fate to which he had threatened to abandon the damsel in pink proved to be none so terrible for pansy osmond who had given him the tea for his companionpansy was as fond as ever of making teapresently came and talked to her into this mild colloquy edward rosier entered little he sat by moodily watching his small sweetheart if we look at her now through his eyes we shall at first not see much to remind us of the obedient little girl who at florence three years before was sent to walk short distances in the cascine while her father and miss archer talked together of matters sacred to elder people but after a moment we shall perceive that if at nineteen pansy has become a young lady she doesnt really fill out the part that if she has grown very pretty she lacks in a deplorable degree the quality known and esteemed in the appearance of females as style and that if she is dressed with great freshness she wears her smart attire with an undisguised appearance of saving itvery much as if it were lent her for the occasion edward rosier it would seem would have been just the man to note these defects and in point of fact there was not a quality of this young lady of any sort that he had not noted only he called her qualities by names of his ownsome of which indeed were happy enough no shes uniqueshes absolutely unique he used to say to himself and you may be sure that not for an instant would he have admitted to you that she was wanting in style style why she had the style of a little princess if you couldnt see it you had no eye it was not modern it was not conscious it would produce no impression in broadway the small serious damsel in her stiff little dress only looked like an infanta of velasquez this was enough for edward rosier who thought her delightfully oldfashioned her anxious eyes her charming lips her slip of a figure were as touching as a childish prayer he had now an acute desire to know just to what point she liked hima desire which made him fidget as he sat in his chair it made him feel hot so that he had to pat his forehead with his handkerchief he had never been so uncomfortable she was such a perfect jeune fille and one couldnt make of a jeune fille the enquiry requisite for throwing light on such a point a jeune fille was what rosier had always dreamed ofa jeune fille who should yet not be french for he had felt that this nationality would complicate the question he was sure pansy had never looked at a newspaper and that in the way of novels if she had read sir walter scott it was the very most an american jeune fillewhat could be better than that she would be frank and gay and yet would not have walked alone nor have received letters from men nor have been taken to the theatre to see the comedy of manners rosier could not deny that as the matter stood it would be a breach of hospitality to appeal directly to this unsophisticated creature but he was now in imminent danger of asking himself if hospitality were the most sacred thing in the world was not the sentiment that he entertained for miss osmond of infinitely greater importance of greater importance to himyes but not probably to the master of the house there was one comfort even if this gentleman had been placed on his guard by madame merle he would not have extended the warning to pansy it would not have been part of his policy to let her know that a prepossessing young man was in love with her but he was in love with her the prepossessing young man and all these restrictions of circumstance had ended by irritating him what had gilbert osmond meant by giving him two fingers of his left hand if osmond was rude surely he himself might be bold he felt extremely bold after the dull girl in so vain a disguise of rosecolour had responded to the call of her mother who came in to say with a significant simper at rosier that she must carry her off to other triumphs the mother and daughter departed together and now it depended only upon him that he should be virtually alone with pansy he had never been alone with her before he had never been alone with a jeune fille it was a great moment poor rosier began to pat his forehead again there was another room beyond the one in which they stooda small room that had been thrown open and lighted but that the company not being numerous had remained empty all the evening it was empty yet it was upholstered in pale yellow there were several lamps through the open door it looked the very temple of authorised love rosier gazed a moment through this aperture he was afraid that pansy would run away and felt almost capable of stretching out a hand to detain her but she lingered where the other maiden had left them making no motion to join a knot of visitors on the far side of the room for a little it occurred to him that she was frightenedtoo frightened perhaps to move but a second glance assured him she was not and he then reflected that she was too innocent indeed for that after a supreme hesitation he asked her if he might go and look at the yellow room which seemed so attractive yet so virginal he had been there already with osmond to inspect the furniture which was of the first french empire and especially to admire the clock which he didnt really admire an immense classic structure of that period he therefore felt that he had now begun to manoeuvre  certainly you may go said pansy and if you like ill show you she was not in the least frightened  thats just what i hoped youd say youre so very kind rosier murmured  they went in together rosier really thought the room very ugly and it seemed cold the same idea appeared to have struck pansy its not for winter evenings its more for summer she said its papas taste he has so much  he had a good deal rosier thought but some of it was very bad he looked about him he hardly knew what to say in such a situation doesnt mrs osmond care how her rooms are done has she no taste he asked  oh yes a great deal but its more for literature said pansyand for conversation but papa cares also for those things i think he knows everything  rosier was silent a little theres one thing im sure he knows he broke out presently he knows that when i come here its with all respect to him with all respect to mrs osmond whos so charmingits really said the young man to see you  to see me and pansy raised her vaguely troubled eyes  to see you thats what i come for rosier repeated feeling the intoxication of a rupture with authority  pansy stood looking at him simply intently openly a blush was not needed to make her face more modest i thought it was for that  and it was not disagreeable to you  i couldnt tell i didnt know you never told me said pansy  i was afraid of offending you  you dont offend me the young girl murmured smiling as if an angel had kissed her  you like me then pansy rosier asked very gently feeling very happy  yesi like you  they had walked to the chimneypiece where the big cold empire clock was perched they were well within the room and beyond observation from without the tone in which she had said these four words seemed to him the very breath of nature and his only answer could be to take her hand and hold it a moment then he raised it to his lips she submitted still with her pure trusting smile in which there was something ineffably passive she liked himshe had liked him all the while now anything might happen she was readyshe had been ready always waiting for him to speak if he had not spoken she would have waited for ever but when the word came she dropped like the peach from the shaken tree rosier felt that if he should draw her toward him and hold her to his heart she would submit without a murmur would rest there without a question it was true that this would be a rash experiment in a yellow empire salottino she had known it was for her he came and yet like what a perfect little lady she had carried it off  youre very dear to me he murmured trying to believe that there was after all such a thing as hospitality  she looked a moment at her hand where he had kissed it did you say papa knows  you told me just now he knows everything  i think you must make sure said pansy  ah my dear when once im sure of you rosier murmured in her ear whereupon she turned back to the other rooms with a little air of consistency which seemed to imply that their appeal should be immediate  the other rooms meanwhile had become conscious of the arrival of madame merle who wherever she went produced an impression when she entered how she did it the most attentive spectator could not have told you for she neither spoke loud nor laughed profusely nor moved rapidly nor dressed with splendour nor appealed in any appreciable manner to the audience large fair smiling serene there was something in her very tranquillity that diffused itself and when people looked round it was because of a sudden quiet on this occasion she had done the quietest thing she could do after embracing mrs osmond which was more striking she had sat down on a small sofa to commune with the master of the house there was a brief exchange of commonplaces between these twothey always paid in public a certain formal tribute to the commonplaceand then madame merle whose eyes had been wandering asked if little mr rosier had come this evening  he came nearly an hour agobut he has disappeared osmond said  and wheres pansy  in the other room there are several people there  hes probably among them said madame merle  do you wish to see him osmond asked in a provokingly pointless tone  madame merle looked at him a moment she knew each of his tones to the eighth of a note yes i should like to say to him that ive told you what he wants and that it interests you but feebly  dont tell him that hell try to interest me morewhich is exactly what i dont want tell him i hate his proposal  but you dont hate it  it doesnt signify i dont love it i let him see that myself this evening i was rude to him on purpose that sort of things a great bore theres no hurry  ill tell him that youll take time and think it over  no dont do that hell hang on  if i discourage him hell do the same  yes but in the one case hell try to talk and explainwhich would be exceedingly tiresome in the other hell probably hold his tongue and go in for some deeper game that will leave me quiet i hate talking with a donkey  is that what you call poor mr rosier  oh hes a nuisancewith his eternal majolica  madame merle dropped her eyes she had a faint smile hes a gentleman he has a charming temper and after all an income of forty thousand francs  its miserygenteel misery osmond broke in its not what ive dreamed of for pansy  very good then he has promised me not to speak to her  do you believe him osmond asked absentmindedly  perfectly pansy has thought a great deal about him but i dont suppose you consider that that matters  i dont consider it matters at all but neither do i believe she has thought of him  that opinions more convenient said madame merle quietly  has she told you shes in love with him  for what do you take her and for what do you take me madame merle added in a moment  osmond had raised his foot and was resting his slim ankle on the other knee he clasped his ankle in his hand familiarlyhis long fine forefinger and thumb could make a ring for itand gazed a while before him this kind of thing doesnt find me unprepared its what i educated her for it was all for thisthat when such a case should come up she should do what i prefer  im not afraid that shell not do it  well then wheres the hitch  i dont see any but all the same i recommend you not to get rid of mr rosier keep him on hand he may be useful  i cant keep him keep him yourself  very good ill put him into a corner and allow him so much a day madame merle had for the most part while they talked been glancing about her it was her habit in this situation just as it was her habit to interpose a good many blanklooking pauses a long drop followed the last words i have quoted and before it had ended she saw pansy come out of the adjoining room followed by edward rosier the girl advanced a few steps and then stopped and stood looking at madame merle and at her father  he has spoken to her madame merle went on to osmond  her companion never turned his head so much for your belief in his promises he ought to be horsewhipped  he intends to confess poor little man  osmond got up he had now taken a sharp look at his daughter it doesnt matter he murmured turning away  pansy after a moment came up to madame merle with her little manner of unfamiliar politeness this ladys reception of her was not more intimate she simply as she rose from the sofa gave her a friendly smile  youre very late the young creature gently said  my dear child im never later than i intend to be  madame merle had not got up to be gracious to pansy she moved toward edward rosier he came to meet her and very quickly as if to get it off his mind ive spoken to her he whispered  i know it mr rosier  did she tell you  yes she told me behave properly for the rest of the evening and come and see me tomorrow at a quarter past five she was severe and in the manner in which she turned her back to him there was a degree of contempt which caused him to mutter a decent imprecation  he had no intention of speaking to osmond it was neither the time nor the place but he instinctively wandered toward isabel who sat talking with an old lady he sat down on the other side of her the old lady was italian and rosier took for granted she understood no english you said just now you wouldnt help me he began to mrs osmond perhaps youll feel differently when you knowwhen you know  isabel met his hesitation when i know what  that shes all right  what do you mean by that  well that weve come to an understanding  shes all wrong said isabel it wont do  poor rosier gazed at her halfpleadingly halfangrily a sudden flush testified to his sense of injury ive never been treated so he said what is there against me after all thats not the way im usually considered i could have married twenty times  its a pity you didnt i dont mean twenty times but once comfortably isabel added smiling kindly youre not rich enough for pansy  she doesnt care a straw for ones money  no but her father does  ah yes he has proved that cried the young man  isabel got up turning away from him leaving her old lady without ceremony and he occupied himself for the next ten minutes in pretending to look at gilbert osmonds collection of miniatures which were neatly arranged on a series of small velvet screens but he looked without seeing his cheek burned he was too full of his sense of injury it was certain that he had never been treated that way before he was not used to being thought not good enough he knew how good he was and if such a fallacy had not been so pernicious he could have laughed at it he searched again for pansy but she had disappeared and his main desire was now to get out of the house before doing so he spoke once more to isabel it was not agreeable to him to reflect that he had just said a rude thing to herthe only point that would now justify a low view of him  i referred to mr osmond as i shouldnt have done a while ago he began but you must remember my situation  i dont remember what you said she answered coldly  ah youre offended and now youll never help me  she was silent an instant and then with a change of tone its not that i wont i simply cant her manner was almost passionate  if you could just a little id never again speak of your husband save as an angel  the inducements great said isabel gravelyinscrutably as he afterwards to himself called it and she gave him straight in the eyes a look which was also inscrutable it made him remember somehow that he had known her as a child and yet it was keener than he liked and he took himself off    chapter xxxviii  he went to see madame merle on the morrow and to his surprise she let him off rather easily but she made him promise that he would stop there till something should have been decided mr osmond had had higher expectations it was very true that as he had no intention of giving his daughter a portion such expectations were open to criticism or even if one would to ridicule but she would advise mr rosier not to take that tone if he would possess his soul in patience he might arrive at his felicity mr osmond was not favourable to his suit but it wouldnt be a miracle if he should gradually come round pansy would never defy her father he might depend on that so nothing was to be gained by precipitation mr osmond needed to accustom his mind to an offer of a sort that he had not hitherto entertained and this result must come of itselfit was useless to try to force it rosier remarked that his own situation would be in the meanwhile the most uncomfortable in the world and madame merle assured him that she felt for him but as she justly declared one couldnt have everything one wanted she had learned that lesson for herself there would be no use in his writing to gilbert osmond who had charged her to tell him as much he wished the matter dropped for a few weeks and would himself write when he should have anything to communicate that it might please mr rosier to hear  he doesnt like your having spoken to pansy ah he doesnt like it at all said madame merle  im perfectly willing to give him a chance to tell me so  if you do that hell tell you more than you care to hear go to the house for the next month as little as possible and leave the rest to me  as little as possible whos to measure the possibility  let me measure it go on thursday evenings with the rest of the world but dont go at all at odd times and dont fret about pansy ill see that she understands everything shes a calm little nature shell take it quietly  edward rosier fretted about pansy a good deal but he did as he was advised and awaited another thursday evening before returning to palazzo roccanera there had been a party at dinner so that though he went early the company was already tolerably numerous osmond as usual was in the first room near the fire staring straight at the door so that not to be distinctly uncivil rosier had to go and speak to him  im glad that you can take a hint pansys father said slightly closing his keen conscious eyes  i take no hints but i took a message as i supposed it to be  you took it where did you take it  it seemed to poor rosier he was being insulted and he waited a moment asking himself how much a true lover ought to submit to madame merle gave me as i understood it a message from youto the effect that you declined to give me the opportunity i desire the opportunity to explain my wishes to you and he flattered himself he spoke rather sternly  i dont see what madame merle has to do with it why did you apply to madame merle  i asked her for an opinionfor nothing more i did so because she had seemed to me to know you very well  she doesnt know me so well as she thinks said osmond  im sorry for that because she has given me some little ground for hope  osmond stared into the fire a moment i set a great price on my daughter  you cant set a higher one than i do dont i prove it by wishing to marry her  i wish to marry her very well osmond went on with a dry impertinence which in another mood poor rosier would have admired  of course i pretend shed marry well in marrying me she couldnt marry a man who loves her moreor whom i may venture to add she loves more  im not bound to accept your theories as to whom my daughter lovesand osmond looked up with a quick cold smile  im not theorising your daughter has spoken  not to me osmond continued now bending forward a little and dropping his eyes to his boottoes  i have her promise sir cried rosier with the sharpness of exasperation  as their voices had been pitched very low before such a note attracted some attention from the company osmond waited till this little movement had subsided then he said all undisturbed i think she has no recollection of having given it  they had been standing with their faces to the fire and after he had uttered these last words the master of the house turned round again to the room before rosier had time to reply he perceived that a gentlemana strangerhad just come in unannounced according to the roman custom and was about to present himself to his host the latter smiled blandly but somewhat blankly the visitor had a handsome face and a large fair beard and was evidently an englishman  you apparently dont recognise me he said with a smile that expressed more than osmonds  ah yes now i do i expected so little to see you  rosier departed and went in direct pursuit of pansy he sought her as usual in the neighbouring room but he again encountered mrs osmond in his path he gave his hostess no greetinghe was too righteously indignant but said to her crudely your husbands awfully coldblooded  she gave the same mystical smile he had noticed before you cant expect every one to be as hot as yourself  i dont pretend to be cold but im cool what has he been doing to his daughter  ive no idea  dont you take any interest rosier demanded with his sense that she too was irritating  for a moment she answered nothing then no she said abruptly and with a quickened light in her eyes which directly contradicted the word  pardon me if i dont believe that wheres miss osmond  in the corner making tea please leave her there  rosier instantly discovered his friend who had been hidden by intervening groups he watched her but her own attention was entirely given to her occupation what on earth has he done to her he asked again imploringly he declares to me she has given me up  she has not given you up isabel said in a low tone and without looking at him  ah thank you for that now ill leave her alone as long as you think proper  he had hardly spoken when he saw her change colour and became aware that osmond was coming toward her accompanied by the gentleman who had just entered he judged the latter in spite of the advantage of good looks and evident social experience a little embarrassed isabel said her husband i bring you an old friend  mrs osmonds face though it wore a smile was like her old friends not perfectly confident im very happy to see lord warburton she said rosier turned away and now that his talk with her had been interrupted felt absolved from the little pledge he had just taken he had a quick impression that mrs osmond wouldnt notice what he did  isabel in fact to do him justice for some time quite ceased to observe him she had been startled she hardly knew if she felt a pleasure or a pain lord warburton however now that he was face to face with her was plainly quite sure of his own sense of the matter though his grey eyes had still their fine original property of keeping recognition and attestation strictly sincere he was heavier than of yore and looked older he stood there very solidly and sensibly  i suppose you didnt expect to see me he said ive but just arrived literally i only got here this evening you see ive lost no time in coming to pay you my respects i knew you were at home on thursdays  you see the fame of your thursdays has spread to england osmond remarked to his wife  its very kind of lord warburton to come so soon were greatly flattered isabel said  ah well its better than stopping in one of those horrible inns osmond went on  the hotel seems very good i think its the same at which i saw you four years since you know it was here in rome that we first met its a long time ago do you remember where i bade you goodbye his lordship asked of his hostess it was in the capitol in the first room  i remember that myself said osmond i was there at the time  yes i remember you there i was very sorry to leave romeso sorry that somehow or other it became almost a dismal memory and ive never cared to come back till today but i knew you were living here her old friend went on to isabel and i assure you ive often thought of you it must be a charming place to live in he added with a look round him at her established home in which she might have caught the dim ghost of his old ruefulness  we should have been glad to see you at any time osmond observed with propriety  thank you very much i havent been out of england since then till a month ago i really supposed my travels over  ive heard of you from time to time said isabel who had already with her rare capacity for such inward feats taken the measure of what meeting him again meant for her  i hope youve heard no harm my life has been a remarkably complete blank  like the good reigns in history osmond suggested he appeared to think his duties as a host now terminatedhe had performed them so conscientiously nothing could have been more adequate more nicely measured than his courtesy to his wifes old friend it was punctilious it was explicit it was everything but naturala deficiency which lord warburton who himself had on the whole a good deal of nature may be supposed to have perceived ill leave you and mrs osmond together he added you have reminiscences into which i dont enter  im afraid you lose a good deal lord warburton called after him as he moved away in a tone which perhaps betrayed overmuch an appreciation of his generosity then the visitor turned on isabel the deeper the deepest consciousness of his look which gradually became more serious im really very glad to see you  its very pleasant youre very kind  do you know that youre changeda little  she just hesitated yesa good deal  i dont mean for the worse of course and yet how can i say for the better  i think i shall have no scruple in saying that to you she bravely returned  ah well for meits a long time it would be a pity there shouldnt be something to show for it they sat down and she asked him about his sisters with other enquiries of a somewhat perfunctory kind he answered her questions as if they interested him and in a few moments she sawor believed she sawthat he would press with less of his whole weight than of yore time had breathed upon his heart and without chilling it given it a relieved sense of having taken the air isabel felt her usual esteem for time rise at a bound her friends manner was certainly that of a contented man one who would rather like people or like her at least to know him for such theres something i must tell you without more delay he resumed ive brought ralph touchett with me  brought him with you isabels surprise was great  hes at the hotel he was too tired to come out and has gone to bed  ill go to see him she immediately said  thats exactly what i hoped youd do i had an idea you hadnt seen much of him since your marriage that in fact your relations were aa little more formal thats why i hesitatedlike an awkward briton  im as fond of ralph as ever isabel answered but why has he come to rome the declaration was very gentle the question a little sharp  because hes very far gone mrs osmond  rome then is no place for him i heard from him that he had determined to give up his custom of wintering abroad and to remain in england indoors in what he called an artificial climate  poor fellow he doesnt succeed with the artificial i went to see him three weeks ago at gardencourt and found him thoroughly ill he has been getting worse every year and now he has no strength left he smokes no more cigarettes he had got up an artificial climate indeed the house was as hot as calcutta nevertheless he had suddenly taken it into his head to start for sicily i didnt believe in itneither did the doctors nor any of his friends his mother as i suppose you know is in america so there was no one to prevent him he stuck to his idea that it would be the saving of him to spend the winter at catania he said he could take servants and furniture could make himself comfortable but in point of fact he hasnt brought anything i wanted him at least to go by sea to save fatigue but he said he hated the sea and wished to stop at rome after that though i thought it all rubbish i made up my mind to come with him im acting aswhat do you call it in americaas a kind of moderator poor ralphs very moderate now we left england a fortnight ago and he has been very bad on the way he cant keep warm and the further south we come the more he feels the cold he has got rather a good man but im afraid hes beyond human help i wanted him to take with him some clever fellowi mean some sharp young doctor but he wouldnt hear of it if you dont mind my saying so i think it was a most extraordinary time for mrs touchett to decide on going to america  isabel had listened eagerly her face was full of pain and wonder my aunt does that at fixed periods and lets nothing turn her aside when the date comes round she starts i think shed have started if ralph had been dying  i sometimes think he is dying lord warburton said  isabel sprang up ill go to him then now  he checked her he was a little disconcerted at the quick effect of his words i dont mean i thought so tonight on the contrary today in the train he seemed particularly well the idea of our reaching romehes very fond of rome you knowgave him strength an hour ago when i bade him goodnight he told me he was very tired but very happy go to him in the morning thats all i mean i didnt tell him i was coming here i didnt decide to till after we had separated then i remembered he had told me you had an evening and that it was this very thursday it occurred to me to come in and tell you hes here and let you know you had perhaps better not wait for him to call i think he said he hadnt written to you there was no need of isabels declaring that she would act upon lord warburtons information she looked as she sat there like a winged creature held back let alone that i wanted to see you for myself her visitor gallantly added  i dont understand ralphs plan it seems to me very wild she said i was glad to think of him between those thick walls at gardencourt  he was completely alone there the thick walls were his only company  you went to see him youve been extremely kind  oh dear i had nothing to do said lord warburton  we hear on the contrary that youre doing great things every one speaks of you as a great statesman and im perpetually seeing your name in the times which by the way doesnt appear to hold it in reverence youre apparently as wild a radical as ever  i dont feel nearly so wild you know the world has come round to me touchett and i have kept up a sort of parliamentary debate all the way from london i tell him hes the last of the tories and he calls me the king of the gothssays i have down to the details of my personal appearance every sign of the brute so you see theres life in him yet  isabel had many questions to ask about ralph but she abstained from asking them all she would see for herself on the morrow she perceived that after a little lord warburton would tire of that subjecthe had a conception of other possible topics she was more and more able to say to herself that he had recovered and what is more to the point she was able to say it without bitterness he had been for her of old such an image of urgency of insistence of something to be resisted and reasoned with that his reappearance at first menaced her with a new trouble but she was now reassured she could see he only wished to live with her on good terms that she was to understand he had forgiven her and was incapable of the bad taste of making pointed allusions this was not a form of revenge of course she had no suspicion of his wishing to punish her by an exhibition of disillusionment she did him the justice to believe it had simply occurred to him that she would now take a goodnatured interest in knowing he was resigned it was the resignation of a healthy manly nature in which sentimental wounds could never fester british politics had cured him she had known they would she gave an envious thought to the happier lot of men who are always free to plunge into the healing waters of action lord warburton of course spoke of the past but he spoke of it without implications he even went so far as to allude to their former meeting in rome as a very jolly time and he told her he had been immensely interested in hearing of her marriage and that it was a great pleasure for him to make mr osmonds acquaintancesince he could hardly be said to have made it on the other occasion he had not written to her at the time of that passage in her history but he didnt apologise to her for this the only thing he implied was that they were old friends intimate friends it was very much as an intimate friend that he said to her suddenly after a short pause which he had occupied in smiling as he looked about him like a person amused at a provincial entertainment by some innocent game of guesses  well now i suppose youre very happy and all that sort of thing  isabel answered with a quick laugh the tone of his remark struck her almost as the accent of comedy do you suppose if i were not id tell you  well i dont know i dont see why not  i do then fortunately however im very happy  youve got an awfully good house  yes its very pleasant but thats not my meritits my husbands  you mean he has arranged it  yes it was nothing when we came  he must be very clever  he has a genius for upholstery said isabel  theres a great rage for that sort of thing now but you must have a taste of your own  i enjoy things when theyre done but ive no ideas i can never propose anything  do you mean you accept what others propose  very willingly for the most part  thats a good thing to know i shall propose to you something  it will be very kind i must say however that ive in a few small ways a certain initiative i should like for instance to introduce you to some of these people  oh please dont i prefer sitting here unless it be to that young lady in the blue dress she has a charming face  the one talking to the rosy young man thats my husbands daughter  lucky man your husband what a dear little maid  you must make her acquaintance  in a momentwith pleasure i like looking at her from here he ceased to look at her however very soon his eyes constantly reverted to mrs osmond do you know i was wrong just now in saying you had changed he presently went on you seem to me after all very much the same  and yet i find it a great change to be married said isabel with mild gaiety  it affects most people more than it has affected you you see i havent gone in for that  it rather surprises me  you ought to understand it mrs osmond but i do want to marry he added more simply  it ought to be very easy isabel said risingafter which she reflected with a pang perhaps too visible that she was hardly the person to say this it was perhaps because lord warburton divined the pang that he generously forbore to call her attention to her not having contributed then to the facility  edward rosier had meanwhile seated himself on an ottoman beside pansys teatable he pretended at first to talk to her about trifles and she asked him who was the new gentleman conversing with her stepmother  hes an english lord said rosier i dont know more  i wonder if hell have some tea the english are so fond of tea  never mind that ive something particular to say to you  dont speak so loud every one will hear said pansy  they wont hear if you continue to look that way as if your only thought in life was the wish the kettle would boil  it has just been filled the servants never knowand she sighed with the weight of her responsibility  do you know what your father said to me just now that you didnt mean what you said a week ago  i dont mean everything i say how can a young girl do that but i mean what i say to you  he told me you had forgotten me  ah no i dont forget said pansy showing her pretty teeth in a fixed smile  then everythings just the very same  ah no not the very same papa has been terribly severe  what has he done to you  he asked me what you had done to me and i told him everything then he forbade me to marry you  you neednt mind that  oh yes i must indeed i cant disobey papa  not for one who loves you as i do and whom you pretend to love  she raised the lid of the teapot gazing into this vessel for a moment then she dropped six words into its aromatic depths i love you just as much  what good will that do me  ah said pansy raising her sweet vague eyes i dont know that  you disappoint me groaned poor rosier  she was silent a little she handed a teacup to a servant please dont talk any more  is this to be all my satisfaction  papa said i was not to talk with you  do you sacrifice me like that ah its too much  i wish youd wait a little said the girl in a voice just distinct enough to betray a quaver  of course ill wait if youll give me hope but you take my life away  ill not give you upoh no pansy went on  hell try and make you marry some one else  ill never do that  what then are we to wait for  she hesitated again ill speak to mrs osmond and shell help us it was in this manner that she for the most part designated her stepmother  she wont help us much shes afraid  afraid of what  of your father i suppose  pansy shook her little head shes not afraid of any one we must have patience  ah thats an awful word rosier groaned he was deeply disconcerted oblivious of the customs of good society he dropped his head into his hands and supporting it with a melancholy grace sat staring at the carpet presently he became aware of a good deal of movement about him and as he looked up saw pansy making a curtseyit was still her little curtsey of the conventto the english lord whom mrs osmond had introduced     chapter xxxix  it will probably not surprise the reflective reader that ralph touchett should have seen less of his cousin since her marriage than he had done before that eventan event of which he took such a view as could hardly prove a confirmation of intimacy he had uttered his thought as we know and after this had held his peace isabel not having invited him to resume a discussion which marked an era in their relations that discussion had made a differencethe difference he feared rather than the one he hoped it had not chilled the girls zeal in carrying out her engagement but it had come dangerously near to spoiling a friendship no reference was ever again made between them to ralphs opinion of gilbert osmond and by surrounding this topic with a sacred silence they managed to preserve a semblance of reciprocal frankness but there was a difference as ralph often said to himselfthere was a difference she had not forgiven him she never would forgive him that was all he had gained she thought she had forgiven him she believed she didnt care and as she was both very generous and very proud these convictions represented a certain reality but whether or no the event should justify him he would virtually have done her a wrong and the wrong was of the sort that women remember best as osmonds wife she could never again be his friend if in this character she should enjoy the felicity she expected she would have nothing but contempt for the man who had attempted in advance to undermine a blessing so dear and if on the other hand his warning should be justified the vow she had taken that he should never know it would lay upon her spirit such a burden as to make her hate him so dismal had been during the year that followed his cousins marriage ralphs prevision of the future and if his meditations appear morbid we must remember he was not in the bloom of health he consoled himself as he might by behaving as he deemed beautifully and was present at the ceremony by which isabel was united to mr osmond and which was performed in florence in the month of june he learned from his mother that isabel at first had thought of celebrating her nuptials in her native land but that as simplicity was what she chiefly desired to secure she had finally decided in spite of osmonds professed willingness to make a journey of any length that this characteristic would be best embodied in their being married by the nearest clergyman in the shortest time the thing was done therefore at the little american chapel on a very hot day in the presence only of mrs touchett and her son of pansy osmond and the countess gemini that severity in the proceedings of which i just spoke was in part the result of the absence of two persons who might have been looked for on the occasion and who would have lent it a certain richness madame merle had been invited but madame merle who was unable to leave rome had written a gracious letter of excuses henrietta stackpole had not been invited as her departure from america announced to isabel by mr goodwood was in fact frustrated by the duties of her profession but she had sent a letter less gracious than madame merles intimating that had she been able to cross the atlantic she would have been present not only as a witness but as a critic her return to europe had taken place somewhat later and she had effected a meeting with isabel in the autumn in paris when she had indulgedperhaps a trifle too freelyher critical genius poor osmond who was chiefly the subject of it had protested so sharply that henrietta was obliged to declare to isabel that she had taken a step which put a barrier between them it isnt in the least that youve marriedit is that you have married him she had deemed it her duty to remark agreeing it will be seen much more with ralph touchett than she suspected though she had few of his hesitations and compunctions henriettas second visit to europe however was not apparently to have been made in vain for just at the moment when osmond had declared to isabel that he really must object to that newspaperwoman and isabel had answered that it seemed to her he took henrietta too hard the good mr bantling had appeared upon the scene and proposed that they should take a run down to spain henriettas letters from spain had proved the most acceptable she had yet published and there had been one in especial dated from the alhambra and entitled moors and moonlight which generally passed for her masterpiece isabel had been secretly disappointed at her husbands not seeing his way simply to take the poor girl for funny she even wondered if his sense of fun or of the funnywhich would be his sense of humour wouldnt itwere by chance defective of course she herself looked at the matter as a person whose present happiness had nothing to grudge to henriettas violated conscience osmond had thought their alliance a kind of monstrosity he couldnt imagine what they had in common for him mr bantlings fellow tourist was simply the most vulgar of women and he had also pronounced her the most abandoned against this latter clause of the verdict isabel had appealed with an ardour that had made him wonder afresh at the oddity of some of his wifes tastes isabel could explain it only by saying that she liked to know people who were as different as possible from herself why then dont you make the acquaintance of your washerwoman osmond had enquired to which isabel had answered that she was afraid her washerwoman wouldnt care for her now henrietta cared so much  ralph had seen nothing of her for the greater part of the two years that had followed her marriage the winter that formed the beginning of her residence in rome he had spent again at san remo where he had been joined in the spring by his mother who afterwards had gone with him to england to see what they were doing at the bankan operation she couldnt induce him to perform ralph had taken a lease of his house at san remo a small villa which he had occupied still another winter but late in the month of april of this second year he had come down to rome it was the first time since her marriage that he had stood face to face with isabel his desire to see her again was then of the keenest she had written to him from time to time but her letters told him nothing he wanted to know he had asked his mother what she was making of her life and his mother had simply answered that she supposed she was making the best of it mrs touchett had not the imagination that communes with the unseen and she now pretended to no intimacy with her niece whom she rarely encountered this young woman appeared to be living in a sufficiently honourable way but mrs touchett still remained of the opinion that her marriage had been a shabby affair it had given her no pleasure to think of isabels establishment which she was sure was a very lame business from time to time in florence she rubbed against the countess gemini doing her best always to minimise the contact and the countess reminded her of osmond who made her think of isabel the countess was less talked of in these days but mrs touchett augured no good of that it only proved how she had been talked of before there was a more direct suggestion of isabel in the person of madame merle but madame merles relations with mrs touchett had undergone a perceptible change isabels aunt had told her without circumlocution that she had played too ingenious a part and madame merle who never quarrelled with any one who appeared to think no one worth it and who had performed the miracle of living more or less for several years with mrs touchett and showing no symptom of irritationmadame merle now took a very high tone and declared that this was an accusation from which she couldnt stoop to defend herself she added however without stooping that her behaviour had been only too simple that she had believed only what she saw that she saw isabel was not eager to marry and osmond not eager to please his repeated visits had been nothing he was boring himself to death on his hilltop and he came merely for amusement isabel had kept her sentiments to herself and her journey to greece and egypt had effectually thrown dust in her companions eyes madame merle accepted the eventshe was unprepared to think of it as a scandal but that she had played any part in it double or single was an imputation against which she proudly protested it was doubtless in consequence of mrs touchetts attitude and of the injury it offered to habits consecrated by many charming seasons that madame merle had after this chosen to pass many months in england where her credit was quite unimpaired mrs touchett had done her a wrong there are some things that cant be forgiven but madame merle suffered in silence there was always something exquisite in her dignity  ralph as i say had wished to see for himself but while engaged in this pursuit he had yet felt afresh what a fool he had been to put the girl on her guard he had played the wrong card and now he had lost the game he should see nothing he should learn nothing for him she would always wear a mask his true line would have been to profess delight in her union so that later when as ralph phrased it the bottom should fall out of it she might have the pleasure of saying to him that he had been a goose he would gladly have consented to pass for a goose in order to know isabels real situation at present however she neither taunted him with his fallacies nor pretended that her own confidence was justified if she wore a mask it completely covered her face there was something fixed and mechanical in the serenity painted on it this was not an expression ralph saidit was a representation it was even an advertisement she had lost her child that was a sorrow but it was a sorrow she scarcely spoke of there was more to say about it than she could say to ralph it belonged to the past moreover it had occurred six months before and she had already laid aside the tokens of mourning she appeared to be leading the life of the world ralph heard her spoken of as having a charming position he observed that she produced the impression of being peculiarly enviable that it was supposed among many people to be a privilege even to know her her house was not open to every one and she had an evening in the week to which people were not invited as a matter of course she lived with a certain magnificence but you needed to be a member of her circle to perceive it for there was nothing to gape at nothing to criticise nothing even to admire in the daily proceedings of mr and mrs osmond ralph in all this recognised the hand of the master for he knew that isabel had no faculty for producing studied impressions she struck him as having a great love of movement of gaiety of late hours of long rides of fatigue an eagerness to be entertained to be interested even to be bored to make acquaintances to see people who were talked about to explore the neighbourhood of rome to enter into relation with certain of the mustiest relics of its old society in all this there was much less discrimination than in that desire for comprehensiveness of development on which he had been used to exercise his wit there was a kind of violence in some of her impulses of crudity in some of her experiments which took him by surprise it seemed to him that she even spoke faster moved faster breathed faster than before her marriage certainly she had fallen into exaggerationsshe who used to care so much for the pure truth and whereas of old she had a great delight in goodhumoured argument in intellectual play she never looked so charming as when in the genial heat of discussion she received a crushing blow full in the face and brushed it away as a feather she appeared now to think there was nothing worth peoples either differing about or agreeing upon of old she had been curious and now she was indifferent and yet in spite of her indifference her activity was greater than ever slender still but lovelier than before she had gained no great maturity of aspect yet there was an amplitude and a brilliancy in her personal arrangements that gave a touch of insolence to her beauty poor humanhearted isabel what perversity had bitten her her light step drew a mass of drapery behind it her intelligent head sustained a majesty of ornament the free keen girl had become quite another person what he saw was the fine lady who was supposed to represent something what did isabel represent ralph asked himself and he could only answer by saying that she represented gilbert osmond good heavens what a function he then woefully exclaimed he was lost in wonder at the mystery of things  he recognised osmond as i say he recognised him at every turn he saw how he kept all things within limits how he adjusted regulated animated their manner of life osmond was in his element at last he had material to work with he always had an eye to effect and his effects were deeply calculated they were produced by no vulgar means but the motive was as vulgar as the art was great to surround his interior with a sort of invidious sanctity to tantalise society with a sense of exclusion to make people believe his house was different from every other to impart to the face that he presented to the world a cold originalitythis was the ingenious effort of the personage to whom isabel had attributed a superior morality he works with superior material ralph said to himself its rich abundance compared with his former resources ralph was a clever man but ralph had neverto his own sensebeen so clever as when he observed in petto that under the guise of caring only for intrinsic values osmond lived exclusively for the world far from being its master as he pretended to be he was its very humble servant and the degree of its attention was his only measure of success he lived with his eye on it from morning till night and the world was so stupid it never suspected the trick everything he did was posepose so subtly considered that if one were not on the lookout one mistook it for impulse ralph had never met a man who lived so much in the land of consideration his tastes his studies his accomplishments his collections were all for a purpose his life on his hilltop at florence had been the conscious attitude of years his solitude his ennui his love for his daughter his good manners his bad manners were so many features of a mental image constantly present to him as a model of impertinence and mystification his ambition was not to please the world but to please himself by exciting the worlds curiosity and then declining to satisfy it it had made him feel great ever to play the world a trick the thing he had done in his life most directly to please himself was his marrying miss archer though in this case indeed the gullible world was in a manner embodied in poor isabel who had been mystified to the top of her bent ralph of course found a fitness in being consistent he had embraced a creed and as he had suffered for it he could not in honour forsake it i give this little sketch of its articles for what they may at the time have been worth it was certain that he was very skilful in fitting the facts to his theoryeven the fact that during the month he spent in rome at this period the husband of the woman he loved appeared to regard him not in the least as an enemy  for gilbert osmond ralph had not now that importance it was not that he had the importance of a friend it was rather that he had none at all he was isabels cousin and he was rather unpleasantly illit was on this basis that osmond treated with him he made the proper enquiries asked about his health about mrs touchett about his opinion of winter climates whether he were comfortable at his hotel he addressed him on the few occasions of their meeting not a word that was not necessary but his manner had always the urbanity proper to conscious success in the presence of conscious failure for all this ralph had had toward the end a sharp inward vision of osmonds making it of small ease to his wife that she should continue to receive mr touchett he was not jealoushe had not that excuse no one could be jealous of ralph but he made isabel pay for her oldtime kindness of which so much was still left and as ralph had no idea of her paying too much so when his suspicion had become sharp he had taken himself off in doing so he had deprived isabel of a very interesting occupation she had been constantly wondering what fine principle was keeping him alive she had decided that it was his love of conversation his conversation had been better than ever he had given up walking he was no longer a humorous stroller he sat all day in a chairalmost any chair would serve and was so dependent on what you would do for him that had not his talk been highly contemplative you might have thought he was blind the reader already knows more about him than isabel was ever to know and the reader may therefore be given the key to the mystery what kept ralph alive was simply the fact that he had not yet seen enough of the person in the world in whom he was most interested he was not yet satisfied there was more to come he couldnt make up his mind to lose that he wanted to see what she would make of her husbandor what her husband would make of her this was only the first act of the drama and he was determined to sit out the performance his determination had held good it had kept him going some eighteen months more till the time of his return to rome with lord warburton it had given him indeed such an air of intending to live indefinitely that mrs touchett though more accessible to confusions of thought in the matter of this strange unremunerativeand unremuneratedson of hers than she had ever been before had as we have learned not scrupled to embark for a distant land if ralph had been kept alive by suspense it was with a good deal of the same emotionthe excitement of wondering in what state she should find himthat isabel mounted to his apartment the day after lord warburton had notified her of his arrival in rome  she spent an hour with him it was the first of several visits gilbert osmond called on him punctually and on their sending their carriage for him ralph came more than once to palazzo roccanera a fortnight elapsed at the end of which ralph announced to lord warburton that he thought after all he wouldnt go to sicily the two men had been dining together after a day spent by the latter in ranging about the campagna they had left the table and warburton before the chimney was lighting a cigar which he instantly removed from his lips  wont go to sicily where then will you go  well i guess i wont go anywhere said ralph from the sofa all shamelessly  do you mean youll return to england  oh dear no ill stay in rome  rome wont do for you romes not warm enough  it will have to do ill make it do see how well ive been  lord warburton looked at him a while puffing a cigar and as if trying to see it youve been better than you were on the journey certainly i wonder how you lived through that but i dont understand your condition i recommend you to try sicily  i cant try said poor ralph ive done trying i cant move further i cant face that journey fancy me between scylla and charybdis i dont want to die on the sicilian plainsto be snatched away like proserpine in the same locality to the plutonian shades  what the deuce then did you come for his lordship enquired  because the idea took me i see it wont do it really doesnt matter where i am now ive exhausted all remedies ive swallowed all climates as im here ill stay i havent a single cousin in sicilymuch less a married one  your cousins certainly an inducement but what does the doctor say  i havent asked him and i dont care a fig if i die here mrs osmond will bury me but i shall not die here  i hope not lord warburton continued to smoke reflectively well i must say he resumed for myself im very glad you dont insist on sicily i had a horror of that journey  ah but for you it neednt have mattered i had no idea of dragging you in my train  i certainly didnt mean to let you go alone  my dear warburton i never expected you to come further than this ralph cried  i should have gone with you and seen you settled said lord warburton  youre a very good christian youre a very kind man  then i should have come back here  and then youd have gone to england  no no i should have stayed  well said ralph if thats what we are both up to i dont see where sicily comes in  his companion was silent he sat staring at the fire at last looking up i say tell me this he broke out did you really mean to go to sicily when we started  ah vous men demandez trop let me put a question first did you come with me quiteplatonically  i dont know what you mean by that i wanted to come abroad  i suspect weve each been playing our little game  speak for yourself i made no secret whatever of my desiring to be here a while  yes i remember you said you wished to see the minister of foreign affairs  ive seen him three times hes very amusing  i think youve forgotten what you came for said ralph  perhaps i have his companion answered rather gravely  these two were gentlemen of a race which is not distinguished by the absence of reserve and they had travelled together from london to rome without an allusion to matters that were uppermost in the mind of each there was an old subject they had once discussed but it had lost its recognised place in their attention and even after their arrival in rome where many things led back to it they had kept the same halfdiffident halfconfident silence  i recommend you to get the doctors consent all the same lord warburton went on abruptly after an interval  the doctors consent will spoil it i never have it when i can help it  what then does mrs osmond think ralphs friend demanded ive not told her shell probably say that romes too cold and even offer to go with me to catania shes capable of that  in your place i should like it  her husband wont like it  ah well i can fancy that though it seems to me youre not bound to mind his likings theyre his affair  i dont want to make any more trouble between them said ralph  is there so much already  theres complete preparation for it her going off with me would make the explosion osmond isnt fond of his wifes cousin  then of course hed make a row but wont he make a row if you stop here  thats what i want to see he made one the last time i was in rome and then i thought it my duty to disappear now i think its my duty to stop and defend her  my dear touchett your defensive powers lord warburton began with a smile but he saw something in his companions face that checked him your duty in these premises seems to me rather a nice question he observed instead  ralph for a short time answered nothing its true that my defensive powers are small he returned at last but as my aggressive ones are still smaller osmond may after all not think me worth his gunpowder at any rate he added there are things im curious to see  youre sacrificing your health to your curiosity then  im not much interested in my health and im deeply interested in mrs osmond  so am i but not as i once was lord warburton added quickly this was one of the allusions he had not hitherto found occasion to make  does she strike you as very happy ralph enquired emboldened by this confidence  well i dont know ive hardly thought she told me the other night she was happy  ah she told you of course ralph exclaimed smiling  i dont know that it seems to me i was rather the sort of person she might have complained to  complained shell never complain she has done itwhat she has doneand she knows it shell complain to you least of all shes very careful  she neednt be i dont mean to make love to her again  im delighted to hear it there can be no doubt at least of your duty  ah no said lord warburton gravely none  permit me to ask ralph went on whether its to bring out the fact that you dont mean to make love to her that youre so very civil to the little girl  lord warburton gave a slight start he got up and stood before the fire looking at it hard does that strike you as very ridiculous  ridiculous not in the least if you really like her  i think her a delightful little person i dont know when a girl of that age has pleased me more  shes a charming creature ah she at least is genuine  of course theres the difference in our agesmore than twenty years  my dear warburton said ralph are you serious  perfectly seriousas far as ive got  im very glad and heaven help us cried ralph how cheeredup old osmond will be  his companion frowned i say dont spoil it i shouldnt propose for his daughter to please him  hell have the perversity to be pleased all the same  hes not so fond of me as that said his lordship  as that my dear warburton the drawback of your position is that people neednt be fond of you at all to wish to be connected with you now with me in such a case i should have the happy confidence that they loved me  lord warburton seemed scarcely in the mood for doing justice to general axiomshe was thinking of a special case do you judge shell be pleased  the girl herself delighted surely  no no i mean mrs osmond  ralph looked at him a moment my dear fellow what has she to do with it  whatever she chooses shes very fond of pansy  very truevery true and ralph slowly got up its an interesting questionhow far her fondness for pansy will carry her he stood there a moment with his hands in his pockets and rather a clouded brow i hope you know that youre veryvery sure the deuce he broke off i dont know how to say it  yes you do you know how to say everything  well its awkward i hope youre sure that among miss osmonds merits her beingaso near her stepmother isnt a leading one  good heavens touchett cried lord warburton angrily for what do you take me    chapter xl  isabel had not seen much of madame merle since her marriage this lady having indulged in frequent absences from rome at one time she had spent six months in england at another she had passed a portion of a winter in paris she had made numerous visits to distant friends and gave countenance to the idea that for the future she should be a less inveterate roman than in the past as she had been inveterate in the past only in the sense of constantly having an apartment in one of the sunniest niches of the pincianan apartment which often stood emptythis suggested a prospect of almost constant absence a danger which isabel at one period had been much inclined to deplore familiarity had modified in some degree her first impression of madame merle but it had not essentially altered it there was still much wonder of admiration in it that personage was armed at all points it was a pleasure to see a character so completely equipped for the social battle she carried her flag discreetly but her weapons were polished steel and she used them with a skill which struck isabel as more and more that of a veteran she was never weary never overcome with disgust she never appeared to need rest or consolation she had her own ideas she had of old exposed a great many of them to isabel who knew also that under an appearance of extreme selfcontrol her highlycultivated friend concealed a rich sensibility but her will was mistress of her life there was something gallant in the way she kept going it was as if she had learned the secret of itas if the art of life were some clever trick she had guessed isabel as she herself grew older became acquainted with revulsions with disgusts there were days when the world looked black and she asked herself with some sharpness what it was that she was pretending to live for her old habit had been to live by enthusiasm to fall in love with suddenlyperceived possibilities with the idea of some new adventure as a younger person she had been used to proceed from one little exaltation to the other there were scarcely any dull places between but madame merle had suppressed enthusiasm she fell in love nowadays with nothing she lived entirely by reason and by wisdom there were hours when isabel would have given anything for lessons in this art if her brilliant friend had been near she would have made an appeal to her she had become aware more than before of the advantage of being like thatof having made ones self a firm surface a sort of corselet of silver  but as i say it was not till the winter during which we lately renewed acquaintance with our heroine that the personage in question made again a continuous stay in rome isabel now saw more of her than she had done since her marriage but by this time isabels needs and inclinations had considerably changed it was not at present to madame merle that she would have applied for instruction she had lost the desire to know this ladys clever trick if she had troubles she must keep them to herself and if life was difficult it would not make it easier to confess herself beaten madame merle was doubtless of great use to herself and an ornament to any circle but was shewould she beof use to others in periods of refined embarrassment the best way to profit by her friendthis indeed isabel had always thoughtwas to imitate her to be as firm and bright as she she recognised no embarrassments and isabel considering this fact determined for the fiftieth time to brush aside her own it seemed to her too on the renewal of an intercourse which had virtually been interrupted that her old ally was different was almost detachedpushing to the extreme a certain rather artificial fear of being indiscreet ralph touchett we know had been of the opinion that she was prone to exaggeration to forcing the notewas apt in the vulgar phrase to overdo it isabel had never admitted this chargehad never indeed quite understood it madame merles conduct to her perception always bore the stamp of good taste was always quiet but in this matter of not wishing to intrude upon the inner life of the osmond family it at last occurred to our young woman that she overdid a little that of course was not the best taste that was rather violent she remembered too much that isabel was married that she had now other interests that though she madame merle had known gilbert osmond and his little pansy very well better almost than any one she was not after all of the inner circle she was on her guard she never spoke of their affairs till she was asked even pressedas when her opinion was wanted she had a dread of seeming to meddle madame merle was as candid as we know and one day she candidly expressed this dread to isabel  i must be on my guard she said i might so easily without suspecting it offend you you would be right to be offended even if my intention should have been of the purest i must not forget that i knew your husband long before you did i must not let that betray me if you were a silly woman you might be jealous youre not a silly woman i know that perfectly but neither am i therefore im determined not to get into trouble a little harms very soon done a mistakes made before one knows it of course if i had wished to make love to your husband i had ten years to do it in and nothing to prevent so it isnt likely i shall begin today when im so much less attractive than i was but if i were to annoy you by seeming to take a place that doesnt belong to me you wouldnt make that reflection youd simply say i was forgetting certain differences im determined not to forget them certainly a good friend isnt always thinking of that one doesnt suspect ones friends of injustice i dont suspect you my dear in the least but i suspect human nature dont think i make myself uncomfortable im not always watching myself i think i sufficiently prove it in talking to you as i do now all i wish to say is however that if you were to be jealousthats the form it would takei should be sure to think it was a little my fault it certainly wouldnt be your husbands  isabel had had three years to think over mrs touchetts theory that madame merle had made gilbert osmonds marriage we know how she had at first received it madame merle might have made gilbert osmonds marriage but she certainly had not made isabel archers that was the work ofisabel scarcely knew what of nature providence fortune of the eternal mystery of things it was true her aunts complaint had been not so much of madame merles activity as of her duplicity she had brought about the strange event and then she had denied her guilt such guilt would not have been great to isabels mind she couldnt make a crime of madame merles having been the producing cause of the most important friendship she had ever formed this had occurred to her just before her marriage after her little discussion with her aunt and at a time when she was still capable of that large inward reference the tone almost of the philosophic historian to her scant young annals if madame merle had desired her change of state she could only say it had been a very happy thought with her moreover she had been perfectly straightforward she had never concealed her high opinion of gilbert osmond after their union isabel discovered that her husband took a less convenient view of the matter he seldom consented to finger in talk this roundest and smoothest bead of their social rosary dont you like madame merle isabel had once said to him she thinks a great deal of you  ill tell you once for all osmond had answered i liked her once better than i do today im tired of her and im rather ashamed of it shes so almost unnaturally good im glad shes not in italy it makes for relaxationfor a sort of moral detente dont talk of her too much it seems to bring her back shell come back in plenty of time  madame merle in fact had come back before it was too latetoo late i mean to recover whatever advantage she might have lost but meantime if as i have said she was sensibly different isabels feelings were also not quite the same her consciousness of the situation was as acute as of old but it was much less satisfying a dissatisfied mind whatever else it may miss is rarely in want of reasons they bloom as thick as buttercups in june the fact of madame merles having had a hand in gilbert osmonds marriage ceased to be one of her titles to consideration it might have been written after all that there was not so much to thank her for as time went on there was less and less and isabel once said to herself that perhaps without her these things would not have been that reflection indeed was instantly stifled she knew an immediate horror at having made it whatever happens to me let me not be unjust she said let me bear my burdens myself and not shift them upon others this disposition was tested eventually by that ingenious apology for her present conduct which madame merle saw fit to make and of which i have given a sketch for there was something irritatingthere was almost an air of mockeryin her neat discriminations and clear convictions in isabels mind today there was nothing clear there was a confusion of regrets a complication of fears she felt helpless as she turned away from her friend who had just made the statements i have quoted madame merle knew so little what she was thinking of she was herself moreover so unable to explain jealous of herjealous of her with gilbert the idea just then suggested no near reality she almost wished jealousy had been possible it would have made in a manner for refreshment wasnt it in a manner one of the symptoms of happiness madame merle however was wise so wise that she might have been pretending to know isabel better than isabel knew herself this young woman had always been fertile in resolutionsany of them of an elevated character but at no period had they flourished in the privacy of her heart more richly than today it is true that they all had a family likeness they might have been summed up in the determination that if she was to be unhappy it should not be by a fault of her own her poor winged spirit had always had a great desire to do its best and it had not as yet been seriously discouraged it wished therefore to hold fast to justicenot to pay itself by petty revenges to associate madame merle with its disappointment would be a petty revengeespecially as the pleasure to be derived from that would be perfectly insincere it might feed her sense of bitterness but it would not loosen her bonds it was impossible to pretend that she had not acted with her eyes open if ever a girl was a free agent she had been a girl in love was doubtless not a free agent but the sole source of her mistake had been within herself there had been no plot no snare she had looked and considered and chosen when a woman had made such a mistake there was only one way to repair itjust immensely oh with the highest grandeur to accept it one folly was enough especially when it was to last for ever a second one would not much set it off in this vow of reticence there was a certain nobleness which kept isabel going but madame merle had been right for all that in taking her precautions  one day about a month after ralph touchetts arrival in rome isabel came back from a walk with pansy it was not only a part of her general determination to be just that she was at present very thankful for pansyit was also a part of her tenderness for things that were pure and weak pansy was dear to her and there was nothing else in her life that had the rightness of the young creatures attachment or the sweetness of her own clearness about it it was like a soft presencelike a small hand in her own on pansys part it was more than an affectionit was a kind of ardent coercive faith on her own side her sense of the girls dependence was more than a pleasure it operated as a definite reason when motives threatened to fail her she had said to herself that we must take our duty where we find it and that we must look for it as much as possible pansys sympathy was a direct admonition it seemed to say that here was an opportunity not eminent perhaps but unmistakeable yet an opportunity for what isabel could hardly have said in general to be more for the child than the child was able to be for herself isabel could have smiled in these days to remember that her little companion had once been ambiguous for she now perceived that pansys ambiguities were simply her own grossness of vision she had been unable to believe any one could care so muchso extraordinarily muchto please but since then she had seen this delicate faculty in operation and now she knew what to think of it it was the whole creatureit was a sort of genius pansy had no pride to interfere with it and though she was constantly extending her conquests she took no credit for them the two were constantly together mrs osmond was rarely seen without her stepdaughter isabel liked her company it had the effect of ones carrying a nosegay composed all of the same flower and then not to neglect pansy not under any provocation to neglect herthis she had made an article of religion the young girl had every appearance of being happier in isabels society than in that of any one save her fatherwhom she admired with an intensity justified by the fact that as paternity was an exquisite pleasure to gilbert osmond he had always been luxuriously mild isabel knew how pansy liked to be with her and how she studied the means of pleasing her she had decided that the best way of pleasing her was negative and consisted in not giving her troublea conviction which certainly could have had no reference to trouble already existing she was therefore ingeniously passive and almost imaginatively docile she was careful even to moderate the eagerness with which she assented to isabels propositions and which might have implied that she could have thought otherwise she never interrupted never asked social questions and though she delighted in approbation to the point of turning pale when it came to her never held out her hand for it she only looked toward it wistfullyan attitude which as she grew older made her eyes the prettiest in the world when during the second winter at palazzo roccanera she began to go to parties to dances she always at a reasonable hour lest mrs osmond should be tired was the first to propose departure isabel appreciated the sacrifice of the late dances for she knew her little companion had a passionate pleasure in this exercise taking her steps to the music like a conscientious fairy society moreover had no drawbacks for her she liked even the tiresome partsthe heat of ballrooms the dulness of dinners the crush at the door the awkward waiting for the carriage during the day in this vehicle beside her stepmother she sat in a small fixed appreciative posture bending forward and faintly smiling as if she had been taken to drive for the first time  on the day i speak of they had been driven out of one of the gates of the city and at the end of half an hour had left the carriage to await them by the roadside while they walked away over the short grass of the campagna which even in the winter months is sprinkled with delicate flowers this was almost a daily habit with isabel who was fond of a walk and had a swift length of step though not so swift a one as on her first coming to europe it was not the form of exercise that pansy loved best but she liked it because she liked everything and she moved with a shorter undulation beside her fathers wife who afterwards on their return to rome paid a tribute to her preferences by making the circuit of the pincian or the villa borghese she had gathered a handful of flowers in a sunny hollow far from the walls of rome and on reaching palazzo roccanera she went straight to her room to put them into water isabel passed into the drawingroom the one she herself usually occupied the second in order from the large antechamber which was entered from the staircase and in which even gilbert osmonds rich devices had not been able to correct a look of rather grand nudity just beyond the threshold of the drawingroom she stopped short the reason for her doing so being that she had received an impression the impression had in strictness nothing unprecedented but she felt it as something new and the soundlessness of her step gave her time to take in the scene before she interrupted it madame merle was there in her bonnet and gilbert osmond was talking to her for a minute they were unaware she had come in isabel had often seen that before certainly but what she had not seen or at least had not noticed was that their colloquy had for the moment converted itself into a sort of familiar silence from which she instantly perceived that her entrance would startle them madame merle was standing on the rug a little way from the fire osmond was in a deep chair leaning back and looking at her her head was erect as usual but her eyes were bent on his what struck isabel first was that he was sitting while madame merle stood there was an anomaly in this that arrested her then she perceived that they had arrived at a desultory pause in their exchange of ideas and were musing face to face with the freedom of old friends who sometimes exchange ideas without uttering them there was nothing to shock in this they were old friends in fact but the thing made an image lasting only a moment like a sudden flicker of light their relative positions their absorbed mutual gaze struck her as something detected but it was all over by the time she had fairly seen it madame merle had seen her and had welcomed her without moving her husband on the other hand had instantly jumped up he presently murmured something about wanting a walk and after having asked their visitor to excuse him left the room  i came to see you thinking you would have come in and as you hadnt i waited for you madame merle said  didnt he ask you to sit down isabel asked with a smile  madame merle looked about her ah its very true i was going away  you must stay now  certainly i came for a reason ive something on my mind  ive told you that before isabel saidthat it takes something extraordinary to bring you to this house  and you know what ive told you that whether i come or whether i stay away ive always the same motivethe affection i bear you  yes youve told me that  you look just now as if you didnt believe it said madame merle  ah isabel answered the profundity of your motives thats the last thing i doubt  you doubt sooner of the sincerity of my words  isabel shook her head gravely i know youve always been kind to me  as often as you would let me you dont always take it then one has to let you alone its not to do you a kindness however that ive come today its quite another affair ive come to get rid of a trouble of my ownto make it over to you ive been talking to your husband about it  im surprised at that he doesnt like troubles  especially other peoples i know very well but neither do you i suppose at any rate whether you do or not you must help me its about poor mr rosier  ah said isabel reflectively its his trouble then not yours  he has succeeded in saddling me with it he comes to see me ten times a week to talk about pansy  yes he wants to marry her i know all about it  madame merle hesitated i gathered from your husband that perhaps you didnt  how should he know what i know he has never spoken to me of the matter  its probably because he doesnt know how to speak of it  its nevertheless the sort of question in which hes rarely at fault  yes because as a general thing he knows perfectly well what to think today he doesnt  havent you been telling him isabel asked  madame merle gave a bright voluntary smile do you know youre a little dry  yes i cant help it mr rosier has also talked to me  in that theres some reason youre so near the child  ah said isabel for all the comfort ive given him if you think me dry i wonder what he thinks  i believe he thinks you can do more than you have done  i can do nothing  you can do more at least than i i dont know what mysterious connection he may have discovered between me and pansy but he came to me from the first as if i held his fortune in my hand now he keeps coming back to spur me up to know what hope there is to pour out his feelings  hes very much in love said isabel  very muchfor him  very much for pansy you might say as well  madame merle dropped her eyes a moment dont you think shes attractive  the dearest little person possiblebut very limited  she ought to be all the easier for mr rosier to love mr rosiers not unlimited  no said isabel he has about the extent of ones pockethandkerchiefthe small ones with lace borders her humour had lately turned a good deal to sarcasm but in a moment she was ashamed of exercising it on so innocent an object as pansys suitor hes very kind very honest she presently added and hes not such a fool as he seems  he assures me that she delights in him said madame merle  i dont know ive not asked her  youve never sounded her a little  its not my place its her fathers  ah youre too literal said madame merle  i must judge for myself  madame merle gave her smile again it isnt easy to help you  to help me said isabel very seriously what do you mean  its easy to displease you dont you see how wise i am to be careful i notify you at any rate as i notified osmond that i wash my hands of the loveaffairs of miss pansy and mr edward rosier je ny peux rien moi i cant talk to pansy about him especially added madame merle as i dont think him a paragon of husbands  isabel reflected a little after which with a smile you dont wash your hands then she said after which again she added in another tone you cantyoure too much interested  madame merle slowly rose she had given isabel a look as rapid as the intimation that had gleamed before our heroine a few moments before only this time the latter saw nothing ask him the next time and youll see  i cant ask him he has ceased to come to the house gilbert has let him know that hes not welcome  ah yes said madame merle i forgot thatthough its the burden of his lamentation he says osmond has insulted him all the same she went on osmond doesnt dislike him so much as he thinks she had got up as if to close the conversation but she lingered looking about her and had evidently more to say isabel perceived this and even saw the point she had in view but isabel also had her own reasons for not opening the way  that must have pleased him if youve told him she answered smiling  certainly ive told him as far as that goes ive encouraged him ive preached patience have said that his case isnt desperate if hell only hold his tongue and be quiet unfortunately he has taken it into his head to be jealous  jealous  jealous of lord warburton who he says is always here  isabel who was tired had remained sitting but at this she also rose ah she exclaimed simply moving slowly to the fireplace madame merle observed her as she passed and while she stood a moment before the mantelglass and pushed into its place a wandering tress of hair  poor mr rosier keeps saying theres nothing impossible in lord warburtons falling in love with pansy madame merle went on isabel was silent a little she turned away from the glass its truetheres nothing impossible she returned at last gravely and more gently  so ive had to admit to mr rosier so too your husband thinks  that i dont know  ask him and youll see  i shall not ask him said isabel  pardon me i forgot you had pointed that out of course madame merle added youve had infinitely more observation of lord warburtons behaviour than i  i see no reason why i shouldnt tell you that he likes my stepdaughter very much  madame merle gave one of her quick looks again likes her you meanas mr rosier means  i dont know how mr rosier means but lord warburton has let me know that hes charmed with pansy  and youve never told osmond this observation was immediate precipitate it almost burst from madame merles lips  isabels eyes rested on her i suppose hell know in time lord warburton has a tongue and knows how to express himself  madame merle instantly became conscious that she had spoken more quickly than usual and the reflection brought the colour to her cheek she gave the treacherous impulse time to subside and then said as if she had been thinking it over a little that would be better than marrying poor mr rosier  much better i think  it would be very delightful it would be a great marriage its really very kind of him  very kind of him  to drop his eyes on a simple little girl  i dont see that  its very good of you but after all pansy osmond  after all pansy osmonds the most attractive person he has ever known isabel exclaimed  madame merle stared and indeed she was justly bewildered ah a moment ago i thought you seemed rather to disparage her  i said she was limited and so she is and sos lord warburton  so are we all if you come to that if its no more than pansy deserves all the better but if she fixes her affections on mr rosier i wont admit that she deserves it that will be too perverse  mr rosiers a nuisance isabel cried abruptly  i quite agree with you and im delighted to know that im not expected to feed his flame for the future when he calls on me my door shall be closed to him and gathering her mantle together madame merle prepared to depart she was checked however on her progress to the door by an inconsequent request from isabel  all the same you know be kind to him  she lifted her shoulders and eyebrows and stood looking at her friend i dont understand your contradictions decidedly i shant be kind to him for it will be a false kindness i want to see her married to lord warburton  you had better wait till he asks her  if what you says true hell ask her especially said madame merle in a moment if you make him  if i make him  its quite in your power youve great influence with him  isabel frowned a little where did you learn that  mrs touchett told me not younever said madame merle smiling  i certainly never told you anything of the sort  you might have done soso far as opportunity wentwhen we were by way of being confidential with each other but you really told me very little ive often thought so since  isabel had thought so too and sometimes with a certain satisfaction but she didnt admit it nowperhaps because she wished not to appear to exult in it you seem to have had an excellent informant in my aunt she simply returned  she let me know you had declined an offer of marriage from lord warburton because she was greatly vexed and was full of the subject of course i think youve done better in doing as you did but if you wouldnt marry lord warburton yourself make him the reparation of helping him to marry some one else  isabel listened to this with a face that persisted in not reflecting the bright expressiveness of madame merles but in a moment she said reasonably and gently enough i should be very glad indeed if as regards pansy it could be arranged upon which her companion who seemed to regard this as a speech of good omen embraced her more tenderly than might have been expected and triumphantly withdrew    chapter xli  osmond touched on this matter that evening for the first time coming very late into the drawingroom where she was sitting alone they had spent the evening at home and pansy had gone to bed he himself had been sitting since dinner in a small apartment in which he had arranged his books and which he called his study at ten oclock lord warburton had come in as he always did when he knew from isabel that she was to be at home he was going somewhere else and he sat for half an hour isabel after asking him for news of ralph said very little to him on purpose she wished him to talk with her stepdaughter she pretended to read she even went after a little to the piano she asked herself if she mightnt leave the room she had come little by little to think well of the idea of pansys becoming the wife of the master of beautiful lockleigh though at first it had not presented itself in a manner to excite her enthusiasm madame merle that afternoon had applied the match to an accumulation of inflammable material when isabel was unhappy she always looked about herpartly from impulse and partly by theoryfor some form of positive exertion she could never rid herself of the sense that unhappiness was a state of diseaseof suffering as opposed to doing to doit hardly mattered whatwould therefore be an escape perhaps in some degree a remedy besides she wished to convince herself that she had done everything possible to content her husband she was determined not to be haunted by visions of his wifes limpness under appeal it would please him greatly to see pansy married to an english nobleman and justly please him since this nobleman was so sound a character it seemed to isabel that if she could make it her duty to bring about such an event she should play the part of a good wife she wanted to be that she wanted to be able to believe sincerely and with proof of it that she had been that then such an undertaking had other recommendations it would occupy her and she desired occupation it would even amuse her and if she could really amuse herself she perhaps might be saved lastly it would be a service to lord warburton who evidently pleased himself greatly with the charming girl it was a little weird he shouldbeing what he was but there was no accounting for such impressions pansy might captivate any oneany one at least but lord warburton isabel would have thought her too small too slight perhaps even too artificial for that there was always a little of the doll about her and that was not what he had been looking for still who could say what men ever were looking for they looked for what they found they knew what pleased them only when they saw it no theory was valid in such matters and nothing was more unaccountable or more natural than anything else if he had cared for her it might seem odd he should care for pansy who was so different but he had not cared for her so much as he had supposed or if he had he had completely got over it and it was natural that as that affair had failed he should think something of quite another sort might succeed enthusiasm as i say had not come at first to isabel but it came today and made her feel almost happy it was astonishing what happiness she could still find in the idea of procuring a pleasure for her husband it was a pity however that edward rosier had crossed their path  at this reflection the light that had suddenly gleamed upon that path lost something of its brightness isabel was unfortunately as sure that pansy thought mr rosier the nicest of all the young menas sure as if she had held an interview with her on the subject it was very tiresome she should be so sure when she had carefully abstained from informing herself almost as tiresome as that poor mr rosier should have taken it into his own head he was certainly very inferior to lord warburton it was not the difference in fortune so much as the difference in the men the young american was really so light a weight he was much more of the type of the useless fine gentleman than the english nobleman it was true that there was no particular reason why pansy should marry a statesman still if a statesman admired her that was his affair and she would make a perfect little pearl of a peeress  it may seem to the reader that mrs osmond had grown of a sudden strangely cynical for she ended by saying to herself that this difficulty could probably be arranged an impediment that was embodied in poor rosier could not anyhow present itself as a dangerous one there were always means of levelling secondary obstacles isabel was perfectly aware that she had not taken the measure of pansys tenacity which might prove to be inconveniently great but she inclined to see her as rather letting go under suggestion than as clutching under deprecationsince she had certainly the faculty of assent developed in a very much higher degree than that of protest she would cling yes she would cling but it really mattered to her very little what she clung to lord warburton would do as well as mr rosierespecially as she seemed quite to like him she had expressed this sentiment to isabel without a single reservation she had said she thought his conversation most interestinghe had told her all about india his manner to pansy had been of the rightest and easiestisabel noticed that for herself as she also observed that he talked to her not in the least in a patronising way reminding himself of her youth and simplicity but quite as if she understood his subjects with that sufficiency with which she followed those of the fashionable operas this went far enough for attention to the music and the barytone he was careful only to be kindhe was as kind as he had been to another fluttered young chit at gardencourt a girl might well be touched by that she remembered how she herself had been touched and said to herself that if she had been as simple as pansy the impression would have been deeper still she had not been simple when she refused him that operation had been as complicated as later her acceptance of osmond had been pansy however in spite of her simplicity really did understand and was glad that lord warburton should talk to her not about her partners and bouquets but about the state of italy the condition of the peasantry the famous gristtax the pellagra his impressions of roman society she looked at him as she drew her needle through her tapestry with sweet submissive eyes and when she lowered them she gave little quiet oblique glances at his person his hands his feet his clothes as if she were considering him even his person isabel might have reminded her was better than mr rosiers but isabel contented herself at such moments with wondering where this gentleman was he came no more at all to palazzo roccanera it was surprising as i say the hold it had taken of herthe idea of assisting her husband to be pleased  it was surprising for a variety of reasons which i shall presently touch upon on the evening i speak of while lord warburton sat there she had been on the point of taking the great step of going out of the room and leaving her companions alone i say the great step because it was in this light that gilbert osmond would have regarded it and isabel was trying as much as possible to take her husbands view she succeeded after a fashion but she fell short of the point i mention after all she couldnt rise to it something held her and made this impossible it was not exactly that it would be base or insidious for women as a general thing practise such manoeuvres with a perfectly good conscience and isabel was instinctively much more true than false to the common genius of her sex there was a vague doubt that interposeda sense that she was not quite sure so she remained in the drawingroom and after a while lord warburton went off to his party of which he promised to give pansy a full account on the morrow after he had gone she wondered if she had prevented something which would have happened if she had absented herself for a quarter of an hour and then she pronouncedalways mentallythat when their distinguished visitor should wish her to go away he would easily find means to let her know it pansy said nothing whatever about him after he had gone and isabel studiously said nothing as she had taken a vow of reserve until after he should have declared himself he was a little longer in coming to this than might seem to accord with the description he had given isabel of his feelings pansy went to bed and isabel had to admit that she could not now guess what her stepdaughter was thinking of her transparent little companion was for the moment not to be seen through  she remained alone looking at the fire until at the end of half an hour her husband came in he moved about a while in silence and then sat down he looked at the fire like herself but she now had transferred her eyes from the flickering flame in the chimney to osmonds face and she watched him while he kept his silence covert observation had become a habit with her an instinct of which it is not an exaggeration to say that it was allied to that of selfdefence had made it habitual she wished as much as possible to know his thoughts to know what he would say beforehand so that she might prepare her answer preparing answers had not been her strong point of old she had rarely in this respect got further than thinking afterwards of clever things she might have said but she had learned cautionlearned it in a measure from her husbands very countenance it was the same face she had looked into with eyes equally earnest perhaps but less penetrating on the terrace of a florentine villa except that osmond had grown slightly stouter since his marriage he still however might strike one as very distinguished  has lord warburton been here he presently asked  yes he stayed half an hour  did he see pansy  yes he sat on the sofa beside her  did he talk with her much  he talked almost only to her  it seems to me hes attentive isnt that what you call it  i dont call it anything said isabel ive waited for you to give it a name  thats a consideration you dont always show osmond answered after a moment  ive determined this time to try and act as youd like ive so often failed of that  osmond turned his head slowly looking at her are you trying to quarrel with me  no im trying to live at peace  nothings more easy you know i dont quarrel myself  what do you call it when you try to make me angry isabel asked  i dont try if ive done so it has been the most natural thing in the world moreover im not in the least trying now  isabel smiled it doesnt matter ive determined never to be angry again  thats an excellent resolve your temper isnt good  noits not good she pushed away the book she had been reading and took up the band of tapestry pansy had left on the table  thats partly why ive not spoken to you about this business of my daughters osmond said designating pansy in the manner that was most frequent with him i was afraid i should encounter oppositionthat you too would have views on the subject ive sent little rosier about his business  you were afraid id plead for mr rosier havent you noticed that ive never spoken to you of him  ive never given you a chance weve so little conversation in these days i know he was an old friend of yours  yes hes an old friend of mine isabel cared little more for him than for the tapestry that she held in her hand but it was true that he was an old friend and that with her husband she felt a desire not to extenuate such ties he had a way of expressing contempt for them which fortified her loyalty to them even when as in the present case they were in themselves insignificant she sometimes felt a sort of passion of tenderness for memories which had no other merit than that they belonged to her unmarried life but as regards pansy she added in a moment ive given him no encouragement  thats fortunate osmond observed  fortunate for me i suppose you mean for him it matters little  theres no use talking of him osmond said as i tell you ive turned him out  yes but a lover outsides always a lover hes sometimes even more of one mr rosier still has hope  hes welcome to the comfort of it my daughter has only to sit perfectly quiet to become lady warburton  should you like that isabel asked with a simplicity which was not so affected as it may appear she was resolved to assume nothing for osmond had a way of unexpectedly turning her assumptions against her the intensity with which he would like his daughter to become lady warburton had been the very basis of her own recent reflections but that was for herself she would recognise nothing until osmond should have put it into words she would not take for granted with him that he thought lord warburton a prize worth an amount of effort that was unusual among the osmonds it was gilberts constant intimation that for him nothing in life was a prize that he treated as from equal to equal with the most distinguished people in the world and that his daughter had only to look about her to pick out a prince it cost him therefore a lapse from consistency to say explicitly that he yearned for lord warburton and that if this nobleman should escape his equivalent might not be found with which moreover it was another of his customary implications that he was never inconsistent he would have liked his wife to glide over the point but strangely enough now that she was face to face with him and although an hour before she had almost invented a scheme for pleasing him isabel was not accommodating would not glide and yet she knew exactly the effect on his mind of her question it would operate as an humiliation never mind he was terribly capable of humiliating herall the more so that he was also capable of waiting for great opportunities and of showing sometimes an almost unaccountable indifference to small ones isabel perhaps took a small opportunity because she would not have availed herself of a great one  osmond at present acquitted himself very honourably i should like it extremely it would be a great marriage and then lord warburton has another advantage hes an old friend of yours it would be pleasant for him to come into the family its very odd pansys admirers should all be your old friends  its natural that they should come to see me in coming to see me they see pansy seeing her its natural they should fall in love with her  so i think but youre not bound to do so  if she should marry lord warburton i should be very glad isabel went on frankly hes an excellent man you say however that she has only to sit perfectly still perhaps she wont sit perfectly still if she loses mr rosier she may jump up  osmond appeared to give no heed to this he sat gazing at the fire pansy would like to be a great lady he remarked in a moment with a certain tenderness of tone she wishes above all to please he added  to please mr rosier perhaps  no to please me  me too a little i think said isabel  yes she has a great opinion of you but shell do what i like  if youre sure of that its very well she went on  meantime said osmond i should like our distinguished visitor to speak  he has spokento me he has told me it would be a great pleasure to him to believe she could care for him  osmond turned his head quickly but at first he said nothing then why didnt you tell me that he asked sharply  there was no opportunity you know how we live ive taken the first chance that has offered  did you speak to him of rosier  oh yes a little  that was hardly necessary  i thought it best he should know so that so that and isabel paused  so that what  so that he might act accordingly  so that he might back out do you mean  no so that he might advance while theres yet time  thats not the effect it seems to have had  you should have patience said isabel you know englishmen are shy  this ones not he was not when he made love to you  she had been afraid osmond would speak of that it was disagreeable to her i beg your pardon he was extremely so she returned  he answered nothing for some time he took up a book and fingered the pages while she sat silent and occupied herself with pansys tapestry you must have a great deal of influence with him osmond went on at last the moment you really wish it you can bring him to the point  this was more offensive still but she felt the great naturalness of his saying it and it was after all extremely like what she had said to herself why should i have influence she asked what have i ever done to put him under an obligation to me  you refused to marry him said osmond with his eyes on his book  i must not presume too much on that she replied  he threw down the book presently and got up standing before the fire with his hands behind him well i hold that it lies in your hands i shall leave it there with a little goodwill you may manage it think that over and remember how much i count on you he waited a little to give her time to answer but she answered nothing and he presently strolled out of the room     chapter xlii  she had answered nothing because his words had put the situation before her and she was absorbed in looking at it there was something in them that suddenly made vibrations deep so that she had been afraid to trust herself to speak after he had gone she leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes and for a long time far into the night and still further she sat in the still drawingroom given up to her meditation a servant came in to attend to the fire and she bade him bring fresh candles and then go to bed osmond had told her to think of what he had said and she did so indeed and of many other things the suggestion from another that she had a definite influence on lord warburtonthis had given her the start that accompanies unexpected recognition was it true that there was something still between them that might be a handle to make him declare himself to pansya susceptibility on his part to approval a desire to do what would please her isabel had hitherto not asked herself the question because she had not been forced but now that it was directly presented to her she saw the answer and the answer frightened her yes there was somethingsomething on lord warburtons part when he had first come to rome she believed the link that united them to be completely snapped but little by little she had been reminded that it had yet a palpable existence it was as thin as a hair but there were moments when she seemed to hear it vibrate for herself nothing was changed what she once thought of him she always thought it was needless this feeling should change it seemed to her in fact a better feeling than ever but he had he still the idea that she might be more to him than other women had he the wish to profit by the memory of the few moments of intimacy through which they had once passed isabel knew she had read some of the signs of such a disposition but what were his hopes his pretensions and in what strange way were they mingled with his evidently very sincere appreciation of poor pansy was he in love with gilbert osmonds wife and if so what comfort did he expect to derive from it if he was in love with pansy he was not in love with her stepmother and if he was in love with her stepmother he was not in love with pansy was she to cultivate the advantage she possessed in order to make him commit himself to pansy knowing he would do so for her sake and not for the small creatures ownwas this the service her husband had asked of her this at any rate was the duty with which she found herself confrontedfrom the moment she admitted to herself that her old friend had still an uneradicated predilection for her society it was not an agreeable task it was in fact a repulsive one she asked herself with dismay whether lord warburton were pretending to be in love with pansy in order to cultivate another satisfaction and what might be called other chances of this refinement of duplicity she presently acquitted him she preferred to believe him in perfect good faith but if his admiration for pansy were a delusion this was scarcely better than its being an affectation isabel wandered among these ugly possibilities until she had completely lost her way some of them as she suddenly encountered them seemed ugly enough then she broke out of the labyrinth rubbing her eyes and declared that her imagination surely did her little honour and that her husbands did him even less lord warburton was as disinterested as he need be and she was no more to him than she need wish she would rest upon this till the contrary should be proved proved more effectually than by a cynical intimation of osmonds  such a resolution however brought her this evening but little peace for her soul was haunted with terrors which crowded to the foreground of thought as quickly as a place was made for them what had suddenly set them into livelier motion she hardly knew unless it were the strange impression she had received in the afternoon of her husbands being in more direct communication with madame merle than she suspected that impression came back to her from time to time and now she wondered it had never come before besides this her short interview with osmond half an hour ago was a striking example of his faculty for making everything wither that he touched spoiling everything for her that he looked at it was very well to undertake to give him a proof of loyalty the real fact was that the knowledge of his expecting a thing raised a presumption against it it was as if he had had the evil eye as if his presence were a blight and his favour a misfortune was the fault in himself or only in the deep mistrust she had conceived for him this mistrust was now the clearest result of their short married life a gulf had opened between them over which they looked at each other with eyes that were on either side a declaration of the deception suffered it was a strange opposition of the like of which she had never dreamedan opposition in which the vital principle of the one was a thing of contempt to the other it was not her faultshe had practised no deception she had only admired and believed she had taken all the first steps in the purest confidence and then she had suddenly found the infinite vista of a multiplied life to be a dark narrow alley with a dead wall at the end instead of leading to the high places of happiness from which the world would seem to lie below one so that one could look down with a sense of exaltation and advantage and judge and choose and pity it led rather downward and earthward into realms of restriction and depression where the sound of other lives easier and freer was heard as from above and where it served to deepen the feeling of failure it was her deep distrust of her husbandthis was what darkened the world that is a sentiment easily indicated but not so easily explained and so composite in its character that much time and still more suffering had been needed to bring it to its actual perfection suffering with isabel was an active condition it was not a chill a stupor a despair it was a passion of thought of speculation of response to every pressure she flattered herself that she had kept her failing faith to herself howeverthat no one suspected it but osmond oh he knew it and there were times when she thought he enjoyed it it had come graduallyit was not till the first year of their life together so admirably intimate at first had closed that she had taken the alarm then the shadows had begun to gather it was as if osmond deliberately almost malignantly had put the lights out one by one the dusk at first was vague and thin and she could still see her way in it but it steadily deepened and if now and again it had occasionally lifted there were certain corners of her prospect that were impenetrably black these shadows were not an emanation from her own mind she was very sure of that she had done her best to be just and temperate to see only the truth they were a part they were a kind of creation and consequence of her husbands very presence they were not his misdeeds his turpitudes she accused him of nothingthat is but of one thing which was not a crime she knew of no wrong he had done he was not violent he was not cruel she simply believed he hated her that was all she accused him of and the miserable part of it was precisely that it was not a crime for against a crime she might have found redress he had discovered that she was so different that she was not what he had believed she would prove to be he had thought at first he could change her and she had done her best to be what he would like but she was after all herselfshe couldnt help that and now there was no use pretending wearing a mask or a dress for he knew her and had made up his mind she was not afraid of him she had no apprehension he would hurt her for the illwill he bore her was not of that sort he would if possible never give her a pretext never put himself in the wrong isabel scanning the future with dry fixed eyes saw that he would have the better of her there she would give him many pretexts she would often put herself in the wrong there were times when she almost pitied him for if she had not deceived him in intention she understood how completely she must have done so in fact she had effaced herself when he first knew her she had made herself small pretending there was less of her than there really was it was because she had been under the extraordinary charm that he on his side had taken pains to put forth he was not changed he had not disguised himself during the year of his courtship any more than she but she had seen only half his nature then as one saw the disk of the moon when it was partly masked by the shadow of the earth she saw the full moon nowshe saw the whole man she had kept still as it were so that he should have a free field and yet in spite of this she had mistaken a part for the whole  ah she had been immensely under the charm it had not passed away it was there still she still knew perfectly what it was that made osmond delightful when he chose to be he had wished to be when he made love to her and as she had wished to be charmed it was not wonderful he had succeeded he had succeeded because he had been sincere it never occurred to her now to deny him that he admired herhe had told her why because she was the most imaginative woman he had known it might very well have been true for during those months she had imagined a world of things that had no substance she had had a more wondrous vision of him fed through charmed senses and oh such a stirred fancyshe had not read him right a certain combination of features had touched her and in them she had seen the most striking of figures that he was poor and lonely and yet that somehow he was noblethat was what had interested her and seemed to give her her opportunity there had been an indefinable beauty about himin his situation in his mind in his face she had felt at the same time that he was helpless and ineffectual but the feeling had taken the form of a tenderness which was the very flower of respect he was like a sceptical voyager strolling on the beach while he waited for the tide looking seaward yet not putting to sea it was in all this she had found her occasion she would launch his boat for him she would be his providence it would be a good thing to love him and she had loved him she had so anxiously and yet so ardently given herselfa good deal for what she found in him but a good deal also for what she brought him and what might enrich the gift as she looked back at the passion of those full weeks she perceived in it a kind of maternal strainthe happiness of a woman who felt that she was a contributor that she came with charged hands but for her money as she saw today she would never have done it and then her mind wandered off to poor mr touchett sleeping under english turf the beneficent author of infinite woe for this was the fantastic fact at bottom her money had been a burden had been on her mind which was filled with the desire to transfer the weight of it to some other conscience to some more prepared receptacle what would lighten her own conscience more effectually than to make it over to the man with the best taste in the world unless she should have given it to a hospital there would have been nothing better she could do with it and there was no charitable institution in which she had been as much interested as in gilbert osmond he would use her fortune in a way that would make her think better of it and rub off a certain grossness attaching to the good luck of an unexpected inheritance there had been nothing very delicate in inheriting seventy thousand pounds the delicacy had been all in mr touchetts leaving them to her but to marry gilbert osmond and bring him such a portionin that there would be delicacy for her as well there would be less for himthat was true but that was his affair and if he loved her he wouldnt object to her being rich had he not had the courage to say he was glad she was rich  isabels cheek burned when she asked herself if she had really married on a factitious theory in order to do something finely appreciable with her money but she was able to answer quickly enough that this was only half the story it was because a certain ardour took possession of hera sense of the earnestness of his affection and a delight in his personal qualities he was better than any one else this supreme conviction had filled her life for months and enough of it still remained to prove to her that she could not have done otherwise the finestin the sense of being the subtlestmanly organism she had ever known had become her property and the recognition of her having but to put out her hands and take it had been originally a sort of act of devotion she had not been mistaken about the beauty of his mind she knew that organ perfectly now she had lived with it she had lived in it almostit appeared to have become her habitation if she had been captured it had taken a firm hand to seize her that reflection perhaps had some worth a mind more ingenious more pliant more cultivated more trained to admirable exercises she had not encountered and it was this exquisite instrument she had now to reckon with she lost herself in infinite dismay when she thought of the magnitude of his deception it was a wonder perhaps in view of this that he didnt hate her more she remembered perfectly the first sign he had given of itit had been like the bell that was to ring up the curtain upon the real drama of their life he said to her one day that she had too many ideas and that she must get rid of them he had told her that already before their marriage but then she had not noticed it it had come back to her only afterwards this time she might well have noticed it because he had really meant it the words had been nothing superficially but when in the light of deepening experience she had looked into them they had then appeared portentous he had really meant ithe would have liked her to have nothing of her own but her pretty appearance she had known she had too many ideas she had more even than he had supposed many more than she had expressed to him when he had asked her to marry him yes she had been hypocritical she had liked him so much she had too many ideas for herself but that was just what one married for to share them with some one else one couldnt pluck them up by the roots though of course one might suppress them be careful not to utter them it had not been this however his objecting to her opinions this had been nothing she had no opinionsnone that she would not have been eager to sacrifice in the satisfaction of feeling herself loved for it what he had meant had been the whole thingher character the way she felt the way she judged this was what she had kept in reserve this was what he had not known until he had found himselfwith the door closed behind as it wereset down face to face with it she had a certain way of looking at life which he took as a personal offence heaven knew that now at least it was a very humble accommodating way the strange thing was that she should not have suspected from the first that his own had been so different she had thought it so large so enlightened so perfectly that of an honest man and a gentleman hadnt he assured her that he had no superstitions no dull limitations no prejudices that had lost their freshness hadnt he all the appearance of a man living in the open air of the world indifferent to small considerations caring only for truth and knowledge and believing that two intelligent people ought to look for them together and whether they found them or not find at least some happiness in the search he had told her he loved the conventional but there was a sense in which this seemed a noble declaration in that sense that of the love of harmony and order and decency and of all the stately offices of life she went with him freely and his warning had contained nothing ominous but when as the months had elapsed she had followed him further and he had led her into the mansion of his own habitation then then she had seen where she really was  she could live it over again the incredulous terror with which she had taken the measure of her dwelling between those four walls she had lived ever since they were to surround her for the rest of her life it was the house of darkness the house of dumbness the house of suffocation osmonds beautiful mind gave it neither light nor air osmonds beautiful mind indeed seemed to peep down from a small high window and mock at her of course it had not been physical suffering for physical suffering there might have been a remedy she could come and go she had her liberty her husband was perfectly polite he took himself so seriously it was something appalling under all his culture his cleverness his amenity under his goodnature his facility his knowledge of life his egotism lay hidden like a serpent in a bank of flowers she had taken him seriously but she had not taken him so seriously as that how could sheespecially when she had known him better she was to think of him as he thought of himselfas the first gentleman in europe so it was that she had thought of him at first and that indeed was the reason she had married him but when she began to see what it implied she drew back there was more in the bond than she had meant to put her name to it implied a sovereign contempt for every one but some three or four very exalted people whom he envied and for everything in the world but half a dozen ideas of his own that was very well she would have gone with him even there a long distance for he pointed out to her so much of the baseness and shabbiness of life opened her eyes so wide to the stupidity the depravity the ignorance of mankind that she had been properly impressed with the infinite vulgarity of things and of the virtue of keeping ones self unspotted by it but this base if noble world it appeared was after all what one was to live for one was to keep it forever in ones eye in order not to enlighten or convert or redeem it but to extract from it some recognition of ones own superiority on the one hand it was despicable but on the other it afforded a standard osmond had talked to isabel about his renunciation his indifference the ease with which he dispensed with the usual aids to success and all this had seemed to her admirable she had thought it a grand indifference an exquisite independence but indifference was really the last of his qualities she had never seen any one who thought so much of others for herself avowedly the world had always interested her and the study of her fellow creatures been her constant passion she would have been willing however to renounce all her curiosities and sympathies for the sake of a personal life if the person concerned had only been able to make her believe it was a gain this at least was her present conviction and the thing certainly would have been easier than to care for society as osmond cared for it  he was unable to live without it and she saw that he had never really done so he had looked at it out of his window even when he appeared to be most detached from it he had his ideal just as she had tried to have hers only it was strange that people should seek for justice in such different quarters his ideal was a conception of high prosperity and propriety of the aristocratic life which she now saw that he deemed himself always in essence at least to have led he had never lapsed from it for an hour he would never have recovered from the shame of doing so that again was very well here too she would have agreed but they attached such different ideas such different associations and desires to the same formulas her notion of the aristocratic life was simply the union of great knowledge with great liberty the knowledge would give one a sense of duty and the liberty a sense of enjoyment but for osmond it was altogether a thing of forms a conscious calculated attitude he was fond of the old the consecrated the transmitted so was she but she pretended to do what she chose with it he had an immense esteem for tradition he had told her once that the best thing in the world was to have it but that if one was so unfortunate as not to have it one must immediately proceed to make it she knew that he meant by this that she hadnt it but that he was better off though from what source he had derived his traditions she never learned he had a very large collection of them however that was very certain and after a little she began to see the great thing was to act in accordance with them the great thing not only for him but for her isabel had an undefined conviction that to serve for another person than their proprietor traditions must be of a thoroughly superior kind but she nevertheless assented to this intimation that she too must march to the stately music that floated down from unknown periods in her husbands past she who of old had been so free of step so desultory so devious so much the reverse of processional there were certain things they must do a certain posture they must take certain people they must know and not know when she saw this rigid system close about her draped though it was in pictured tapestries that sense of darkness and suffocation of which i have spoken took possession of her she seemed shut up with an odour of mould and decay she had resisted of course at first very humorously ironically tenderly then as the situation grew more serious eagerly passionately pleadingly she had pleaded the cause of freedom of doing as they chose of not caring for the aspect and denomination of their lifethe cause of other instincts and longings of quite another ideal  then it was that her husbands personality touched as it never had been stepped forth and stood erect the things she had said were answered only by his scorn and she could see he was ineffably ashamed of her what did he think of herthat she was base vulgar ignoble he at least knew now that she had no traditions it had not been in his prevision of things that she should reveal such flatness her sentiments were worthy of a radical newspaper or a unitarian preacher the real offence as she ultimately perceived was her having a mind of her own at all her mind was to be hisattached to his own like a small gardenplot to a deerpark he would rake the soil gently and water the flowers he would weed the beds and gather an occasional nosegay it would be a pretty piece of property for a proprietor already farreaching he didnt wish her to be stupid on the contrary it was because she was clever that she had pleased him but he expected her intelligence to operate altogether in his favour and so far from desiring her mind to be a blank he had flattered himself that it would be richly receptive he had expected his wife to feel with him and for him to enter into his opinions his ambitions his preferences and isabel was obliged to confess that this was no great insolence on the part of a man so accomplished and a husband originally at least so tender but there were certain things she could never take in to begin with they were hideously unclean she was not a daughter of the puritans but for all that she believed in such a thing as chastity and even as decency it would appear that osmond was far from doing anything of the sort some of his traditions made her push back her skirts did all women have lovers did they all lie and even the best have their price were there only three or four that didnt deceive their husbands when isabel heard such things she felt a greater scorn for them than for the gossip of a village parloura scorn that kept its freshness in a very tainted air there was the taint of her sisterinlaw did her husband judge only by the countess gemini this lady very often lied and she had practised deceptions that were not simply verbal it was enough to find these facts assumed among osmonds traditionsit was enough without giving them such a general extension it was her scorn of his assumptions it was this that made him draw himself up he had plenty of contempt and it was proper his wife should be as well furnished but that she should turn the hot light of her disdain upon his own conception of thingsthis was a danger he had not allowed for he believed he should have regulated her emotions before she came to it and isabel could easily imagine how his ears had scorched on his discovering he had been too confident when one had a wife who gave one that sensation there was nothing left but to hate her  she was morally certain now that this feeling of hatred which at first had been a refuge and a refreshment had become the occupation and comfort of his life the feeling was deep because it was sincere he had had the revelation that she could after all dispense with him if to herself the idea was startling if it presented itself at first as a kind of infidelity a capacity for pollution what infinite effect might it not be expected to have had upon him it was very simple he despised her she had no traditions and the moral horizon of a unitarian minister poor isabel who had never been able to understand unitarianism this was the certitude she had been living with now for a time that she had ceased to measure what was comingwhat was before them that was her constant question what would he dowhat ought she to do when a man hated his wife what did it lead to she didnt hate him that she was sure of for every little while she felt a passionate wish to give him a pleasant surprise very often however she felt afraid and it used to come over her as i have intimated that she had deceived him at the very first they were strangely married at all events and it was a horrible life until that morning he had scarcely spoken to her for a week his manner was as dry as a burnedout fire she knew there was a special reason he was displeased at ralph touchetts staying on in rome he thought she saw too much of her cousinhe had told her a week before it was indecent she should go to him at his hotel he would have said more than this if ralphs invalid state had not appeared to make it brutal to denounce him but having had to contain himself had only deepened his disgust isabel read all this as she would have read the hour on the clockface she was as perfectly aware that the sight of her interest in her cousin stirred her husbands rage as if osmond had locked her into her roomwhich she was sure was what he wanted to do it was her honest belief that on the whole she was not defiant but she certainly couldnt pretend to be indifferent to ralph she believed he was dying at last and that she should never see him again and this gave her a tenderness for him that she had never known before nothing was a pleasure to her now how could anything be a pleasure to a woman who knew that she had thrown away her life there was an everlasting weight on her heartthere was a livid light on everything but ralphs little visit was a lamp in the darkness for the hour that she sat with him her ache for herself became somehow her ache for him she felt today as if he had been her brother she had never had a brother but if she had and she were in trouble and he were dying he would be dear to her as ralph was ah yes if gilbert was jealous of her there was perhaps some reason it didnt make gilbert look better to sit for half an hour with ralph it was not that they talked of himit was not that she complained his name was never uttered between them it was simply that ralph was generous and that her husband was not there was something in ralphs talk in his smile in the mere fact of his being in rome that made the blasted circle round which she walked more spacious he made her feel the good of the world he made her feel what might have been he was after all as intelligent as osmondquite apart from his being better and thus it seemed to her an act of devotion to conceal her misery from him she concealed it elaborately she was perpetually in their talk hanging out curtains and before her againit lived before her againit had never had time to diethat morning in the garden at florence when he had warned her against osmond she had only to close her eyes to see the place to hear his voice to feel the warm sweet air how could he have known what a mystery what a wonder of wisdom as intelligent as gilbert he was much more intelligentto arrive at such a judgement as that gilbert had never been so deep so just she had told him then that from her at least he should never know if he was right and this was what she was taking care of now it gave her plenty to do there was passion exaltation religion in it women find their religion sometimes in strange exercises and isabel at present in playing a part before her cousin had an idea that she was doing him a kindness it would have been a kindness perhaps if he had been for a single instant a dupe as it was the kindness consisted mainly in trying to make him believe that he had once wounded her greatly and that the event had put him to shame but that as she was very generous and he was so ill she bore him no grudge and even considerately forbore to flaunt her happiness in his face ralph smiled to himself as he lay on his sofa at this extraordinary form of consideration but he forgave her for having forgiven him she didnt wish him to have the pain of knowing she was unhappy that was the great thing and it didnt matter that such knowledge would rather have righted him  for herself she lingered in the soundless saloon long after the fire had gone out there was no danger of her feeling the cold she was in a fever she heard the small hours strike and then the great ones but her vigil took no heed of time her mind assailed by visions was in a state of extraordinary activity and her visions might as well come to her there where she sat up to meet them as on her pillow to make a mockery of rest as i have said she believed she was not defiant and what could be a better proof of it than that she should linger there half the night trying to persuade herself that there was no reason why pansy shouldnt be married as you would put a letter in the postoffice when the clock struck four she got up she was going to bed at last for the lamp had long since gone out and the candles burned down to their sockets but even then she stopped again in the middle of the room and stood there gazing at a remembered visionthat of her husband and madame merle unconsciously and familiarly associated    chapter xliii  three nights after this she took pansy to a great party to which osmond who never went to dances did not accompany them pansy was as ready for a dance as ever she was not of a generalising turn and had not extended to other pleasures the interdict she had seen placed on those of love if she was biding her time or hoping to circumvent her father she must have had a prevision of success isabel thought this unlikely it was much more likely that pansy had simply determined to be a good girl she had never had such a chance and she had a proper esteem for chances she carried herself no less attentively than usual and kept no less anxious an eye upon her vaporous skirts she held her bouquet very tight and counted over the flowers for the twentieth time she made isabel feel old it seemed so long since she had been in a flutter about a ball pansy who was greatly admired was never in want of partners and very soon after their arrival she gave isabel who was not dancing her bouquet to hold isabel had rendered her this service for some minutes when she became aware of the near presence of edward rosier he stood before her he had lost his affable smile and wore a look of almost military resolution the change in his appearance would have made isabel smile if she had not felt his case to be at bottom a hard one he had always smelt so much more of heliotrope than of gunpowder he looked at her a moment somewhat fiercely as if to notify her he was dangerous and then dropped his eyes on her bouquet after he had inspected it his glance softened and he said quickly its all pansies it must be hers  isabel smiled kindly yes its hers she gave it to me to hold  may i hold it a little mrs osmond the poor young man asked  no i cant trust you im afraid you wouldnt give it back  im not sure that i should i should leave the house with it instantly but may i not at least have a single flower  isabel hesitated a moment and then smiling still held out the bouquet choose one yourself its frightful what im doing for you  ah if you do no more than this mrs osmond rosier exclaimed with his glass in one eye carefully choosing his flower  dont put it into your buttonhole she said dont for the world  i should like her to see it she has refused to dance with me but i wish to show her that i believe in her still  its very well to show it to her but its out of place to show it to others her father has told her not to dance with you  and is that all you can do for me i expected more from you mrs osmond said the young man in a tone of fine general reference you know our acquaintance goes back very farquite into the days of our innocent childhood  dont make me out too old isabel patiently answered you come back to that very often and ive never denied it but i must tell you that old friends as we are if you had done me the honour to ask me to marry you i should have refused you on the spot  ah you dont esteem me then say at once that you think me a mere parisian trifler  i esteem you very much but im not in love with you what i mean by that of course is that im not in love with you for pansy  very good i see you pity methats all and edward rosier looked all round inconsequently with his single glass it was a revelation to him that people shouldnt be more pleased but he was at least too proud to show that the deficiency struck him as general  isabel for a moment said nothing his manner and appearance had not the dignity of the deepest tragedy his little glass among other things was against that but she suddenly felt touched her own unhappiness after all had something in common with his and it came over her more than before that here in recognisable if not in romantic form was the most affecting thing in the worldyoung love struggling with adversity would you really be very kind to her she finally asked in a low tone  he dropped his eyes devoutly and raised the little flower that he held in his fingers to his lips then he looked at her you pity me but dont you pity her a little  i dont know im not sure shell always enjoy life  it will depend on what you call life mr rosier effectively said she wont enjoy being tortured  therell be nothing of that  im glad to hear it she knows what shes about youll see  i think she does and shell never disobey her father but shes coming back to me isabel added and i must beg you to go away  rosier lingered a moment till pansy came in sight on the arm of her cavalier he stood just long enough to look her in the face then he walked away holding up his head and the manner in which he achieved this sacrifice to expediency convinced isabel he was very much in love  pansy who seldom got disarranged in dancing looking perfectly fresh and cool after this exercise waited a moment and then took back her bouquet isabel watched her and saw she was counting the flowers whereupon she said to herself that decidedly there were deeper forces at play than she had recognised pansy had seen rosier turn away but she said nothing to isabel about him she talked only of her partner after he had made his bow and retired of the music the floor the rare misfortune of having already torn her dress isabel was sure however she had discovered her lover to have abstracted a flower though this knowledge was not needed to account for the dutiful grace with which she responded to the appeal of her next partner that perfect amenity under acute constraint was part of a larger system she was again led forth by a flushed young man this time carrying her bouquet and she had not been absent many minutes when isabel saw lord warburton advancing through the crowd he presently drew near and bade her goodevening she had not seen him since the day before he looked about him and then wheres the little maid he asked it was in this manner that he had formed the harmless habit of alluding to miss osmond  shes dancing said isabel youll see her somewhere  he looked among the dancers and at last caught pansys eye she sees me but she wont notice me he then remarked are you not dancing  as you see im a wallflower  wont you dance with me  thank you id rather you should dance with the little maid  one neednt prevent the otherespecially as shes engaged  shes not engaged for everything and you can reserve yourself she dances very hard and youll be the fresher  she dances beautifully said lord warburton following her with his eyes ah at last he added she has given me a smile he stood there with his handsome easy important physiognomy and as isabel observed him it came over her as it had done before that it was strange a man of his mettle should take an interest in a little maid it struck her as a great incongruity neither pansys small fascinations nor his own kindness his goodnature not even his need for amusement which was extreme and constant were sufficient to account for it i should like to dance with you he went on in a moment turning back to isabel but i think i like even better to talk with you  yes its better and its more worthy of your dignity great statesmen oughtnt to waltz  dont be cruel why did you recommend me then to dance with miss osmond  ah thats different if you danced with her it would look simply like a piece of kindnessas if you were doing it for her amusement if you dance with me youll look as if you were doing it for your own  and pray havent i a right to amuse myself  no not with the affairs of the british empire on your hands  the british empire be hanged youre always laughing at it  amuse yourself with talking to me said isabel  im not sure its really a recreation youre too pointed ive always to be defending myself and you strike me as more than usually dangerous tonight will you absolutely not dance  i cant leave my place pansy must find me here  he was silent a little youre wonderfully good to her he said suddenly  isabel stared a little and smiled can you imagine ones not being  no indeed i know how one is charmed with her but you must have done a great deal for her  ive taken her out with me said isabel smiling still and ive seen that she has proper clothes  your society must have been a great benefit to her youve talked to her advised her helped her to develop  ah yes if she isnt the rose she has lived near it  she laughed and her companion did as much but there was a certain visible preoccupation in his face which interfered with complete hilarity we all try to live as near it as we can he said after a moments hesitation  isabel turned away pansy was about to be restored to her and she welcomed the diversion we know how much she liked lord warburton she thought him pleasanter even than the sum of his merits warranted there was something in his friendship that appeared a kind of resource in case of indefinite need it was like having a large balance at the bank she felt happier when he was in the room there was something reassuring in his approach the sound of his voice reminded her of the beneficence of nature yet for all that it didnt suit her that he should be too near her that he should take too much of her goodwill for granted she was afraid of that she averted herself from it she wished he wouldnt she felt that if he should come too near as it were it might be in her to flash out and bid him keep his distance pansy came back to isabel with another rent in her skirt which was the inevitable consequence of the first and which she displayed to isabel with serious eyes there were too many gentlemen in uniform they wore those dreadful spurs which were fatal to the dresses of little maids it hereupon became apparent that the resources of women are innumerable isabel devoted herself to pansys desecrated drapery she fumbled for a pin and repaired the injury she smiled and listened to her account of her adventures her attention her sympathy were immediate and active and they were in direct proportion to a sentiment with which they were in no way connecteda lively conjecture as to whether lord warburton might be trying to make love to her it was not simply his words just then it was others as well it was the reference and the continuity this was what she thought about while she pinned up pansys dress if it were so as she feared he was of course unwitting he himself had not taken account of his intention but this made it none the more auspicious made the situation none less impossible the sooner he should get back into right relations with things the better he immediately began to talk to pansyon whom it was certainly mystifying to see that he dropped a smile of chastened devotion pansy replied as usual with a little air of conscientious aspiration he had to bend toward her a good deal in conversation and her eyes as usual wandered up and down his robust person as if he had offered it to her for exhibition she always seemed a little frightened yet her fright was not of the painful character that suggests dislike on the contrary she looked as if she knew that he knew she liked him isabel left them together a little and wandered toward a friend whom she saw near and with whom she talked till the music of the following dance began for which she knew pansy to be also engaged the girl joined her presently with a little fluttered flush and isabel who scrupulously took osmonds view of his daughters complete dependence consigned her as a precious and momentary loan to her appointed partner about all this matter she had her own imaginations her own reserves there were moments when pansys extreme adhesiveness made each of them to her sense look foolish but osmond had given her a sort of tableau of her position as his daughters duenna which consisted of gracious alternations of concession and contraction and there were directions of his which she liked to think she obeyed to the letter perhaps as regards some of them it was because her doing so appeared to reduce them to the absurd  after pansy had been led away she found lord warburton drawing near her again she rested her eyes on him steadily she wished she could sound his thoughts but he had no appearance of confusion she has promised to dance with me later he said  im glad of that i suppose youve engaged her for the cotillion  at this he looked a little awkward no i didnt ask her for that its a quadrille  ah youre not clever said isabel almost angrily i told her to keep the cotillion in case you should ask for it  poor little maid fancy that and lord warburton laughed frankly of course i will if you like  if i like oh if you dance with her only because i like it  im afraid i bore her she seems to have a lot of young fellows on her book  isabel dropped her eyes reflecting rapidly lord warburton stood there looking at her and she felt his eyes on her face she felt much inclined to ask him to remove them she didnt do so however she only said to him after a minute with her own raised please let me understand  understand what  you told me ten days ago that youd like to marry my stepdaughter youve not forgotten it  forgotten it i wrote to mr osmond about it this morning  ah said isabel he didnt mention to me that he had heard from you  lord warburton stammered a little ii didnt send my letter  perhaps you forgot that  no i wasnt satisfied with it its an awkward sort of letter to write you know but i shall send it tonight  at three oclock in the morning  i mean later in the course of the day  very good you still wish then to marry her  very much indeed  arent you afraid that youll bore her and as her companion stared at this enquiry isabel added if she cant dance with you for half an hour how will she be able to dance with you for life  ah said lord warburton readily ill let her dance with other people about the cotillion the fact is i thought that youthat you  that i would do it with you i told you id do nothing  exactly so that while its going on i might find some quiet corner where we may sit down and talk  oh said isabel gravely youre much too considerate of me  when the cotillion came pansy was found to have engaged herself thinking in perfect humility that lord warburton had no intentions isabel recommended him to seek another partner but he assured her that he would dance with no one but herself as however she had in spite of the remonstrances of her hostess declined other invitations on the ground that she was not dancing at all it was not possible for her to make an exception in lord warburtons favour  after all i dont care to dance he said its a barbarous amusement id much rather talk and he intimated that he had discovered exactly the corner he had been looking fora quiet nook in one of the smaller rooms where the music would come to them faintly and not interfere with conversation isabel had decided to let him carry out his idea she wished to be satisfied she wandered away from the ballroom with him though she knew her husband desired she should not lose sight of his daughter it was with his daughters pretendant however that would make it right for osmond on her way out of the ballroom she came upon edward rosier who was standing in a doorway with folded arms looking at the dance in the attitude of a young man without illusions she stopped a moment and asked him if he were not dancing  certainly not if i cant dance with her he answered  you had better go away then said isabel with the manner of good counsel  i shall not go till she does and he let lord warburton pass without giving him a look  this nobleman however had noticed the melancholy youth and he asked isabel who her dismal friend was remarking that he had seen him somewhere before  its the young man ive told you about whos in love with pansy  ah yes i remember he looks rather bad  he has reason my husband wont listen to him  whats the matter with him lord warburton enquired he seems very harmless  he hasnt money enough and he isnt very clever  lord warburton listened with interest he seemed struck with this account of edward rosier dear me he looked a wellsetup young fellow  so he is but my husbands very particular  oh i see and lord warburton paused a moment how much money has he got he then ventured to ask  some forty thousand francs a year  sixteen hundred pounds ah but thats very good you know  so i think my husband however has larger ideas  yes ive noticed that your husband has very large ideas is he really an idiot the young man  an idiot not in the least hes charming when he was twelve years old i myself was in love with him  he doesnt look much more than twelve today lord warburton rejoined vaguely looking about him then with more point dont you think we might sit here he asked  wherever you please the room was a sort of boudoir pervaded by a subdued rosecoloured light a lady and gentleman moved out of it as our friends came in its very kind of you to take such an interest in mr rosier isabel said  he seems to me rather illtreated he had a face a yard long i wondered what ailed him  youre a just man said isabel youve a kind thought even for a rival  lord warburton suddenly turned with a stare a rival do you call him my rival  surelyif you both wish to marry the same person  yesbut since he has no chance  i like you however that may be for putting your self in his place it shows imagination  you like me for it and lord warburton looked at her with an uncertain eye i think you mean youre laughing at me for it  yes im laughing at you a little but i like you as somebody to laugh at  ah well then let me enter into his situation a little more what do you suppose one could do for him  since i have been praising your imagination ill leave you to imagine that yourself isabel said pansy too would like you for that  miss osmond ah she i flatter myself likes me already  very much i think  he waited a little he was still questioning her face well then i dont understand you you dont mean that she cares for him  a quick blush sprang to his brow you told me she would have no wish apart from her fathers and as ive gathered that he would favour me he paused a little and then suggested dont you see through his blush  yes i told you she has an immense wish to please her father and that it would probably take her very far  that seems to me a very proper feeling said lord warburton  certainly its a very proper feeling isabel remained silent for some moments the room continued empty the sound of the music reached them with its richness softened by the interposing apartments then at last she said but it hardly strikes me as the sort of feeling to which a man would wish to be indebted for a wife  i dont know if the wifes a good one and he thinks she does well  yes of course you must think that  i do i cant help it you call that very british of course  no i dont i think pansy would do wonderfully well to marry you and i dont know who should know it better than you but youre not in love  ah yes i am mrs osmond  isabel shook her head you like to think you are while you sit here with me but thats not how you strike me  im not like the young man in the doorway i admit that but what makes it so unnatural could any one in the world be more loveable than miss osmond  no one possibly but love has nothing to do with good reasons  i dont agree with you im delighted to have good reasons  of course you are if you were really in love you wouldnt care a straw for them  ah really in lovereally in love lord warburton exclaimed folding his arms leaning back his head and stretching himself a little you must remember that im fortytwo years old i wont pretend im as i once was  well if youre sure said isabel its all right  he answered nothing he sat there with his head back looking before him abruptly however he changed his position he turned quickly to his friend why are you so unwilling so sceptical she met his eyes and for a moment they looked straight at each other if she wished to be satisfied she saw something that satisfied her she saw in his expression the gleam of an idea that she was uneasy on her own accountthat she was perhaps even in fear it showed a suspicion not a hope but such as it was it told her what she wanted to know not for an instant should he suspect her of detecting in his proposal of marrying her stepdaughter an implication of increased nearness to herself or of thinking it on such a betrayal ominous in that brief extremely personal gaze however deeper meanings passed between them than they were conscious of at the moment  my dear lord warburton she said smiling you may do so far as im concerned whatever comes into your head  and with this she got up and wandered into the adjoining room where within her companions view she was immediately addressed by a pair of gentlemen high personages in the roman world who met her as if they had been looking for her while she talked with them she found herself regretting she had moved it looked a little like running awayall the more as lord warburton didnt follow her she was glad of this however and at any rate she was satisfied she was so well satisfied that when in passing back into the ballroom she found edward rosier still planted in the doorway she stopped and spoke to him again you did right not to go away ive some comfort for you  i need it the young man softly wailed when i see you so awfully thick with him  dont speak of him ill do what i can for you im afraid it wont be much but what i can ill do  he looked at her with gloomy obliqueness what has suddenly brought you round  the sense that you are an inconvenience in doorways she answered smiling as she passed him half an hour later she took leave with pansy and at the foot of the staircase the two ladies with many other departing guests waited a while for their carriage just as it approached lord warburton came out of the house and assisted them to reach their vehicle he stood a moment at the door asking pansy if she had amused herself and she having answered him fell back with a little air of fatigue then isabel at the window detaining him by a movement of her finger murmured gently dont forget to send your letter to her father    chapter xliv  the countess gemini was often extremely boredbored in her own phrase to extinction she had not been extinguished however and she struggled bravely enough with her destiny which had been to marry an unaccommodating florentine who insisted upon living in his native town where he enjoyed such consideration as might attach to a gentleman whose talent for losing at cards had not the merit of being incidental to an obliging disposition the count gemini was not liked even by those who won from him and he bore a name which having a measurable value in florence was like the local coin of the old italian states without currency in other parts of the peninsula in rome he was simply a very dull florentine and it is not remarkable that he should not have cared to pay frequent visits to a place where to carry it off his dulness needed more explanation than was convenient the countess lived with her eyes upon rome and it was the constant grievance of her life that she had not an habitation there she was ashamed to say how seldom she had been allowed to visit that city it scarcely made the matter better that there were other members of the florentine nobility who never had been there at all she went whenever she could that was all she could say or rather not all but all she said she could say in fact she had much more to say about it and had often set forth the reasons why she hated florence and wished to end her days in the shadow of saint peters they are reasons however that do not closely concern us and were usually summed up in the declaration that rome in short was the eternal city and that florence was simply a pretty little place like any other the countess apparently needed to connect the idea of eternity with her amusements she was convinced that society was infinitely more interesting in rome where you met celebrities all winter at evening parties at florence there were no celebrities none at least that one had heard of since her brothers marriage her impatience had greatly increased she was so sure his wife had a more brilliant life than herself she was not so intellectual as isabel but she was intellectual enough to do justice to romenot to the ruins and the catacombs not even perhaps to the monuments and museums the church ceremonies and the scenery but certainly to all the rest she heard a great deal about her sisterinlaw and knew perfectly that isabel was having a beautiful time she had indeed seen it for herself on the only occasion on which she had enjoyed the hospitality of palazzo roccanera she had spent a week there during the first winter of her brothers marriage but she had not been encouraged to renew this satisfaction osmond didnt want herthat she was perfectly aware of but she would have gone all the same for after all she didnt care two straws about osmond it was her husband who wouldnt let her and the money question was always a trouble isabel had been very nice the countess who had liked her sisterinlaw from the first had not been blinded by envy to isabels personal merits she had always observed that she got on better with clever women than with silly ones like herself the silly ones could never understand her wisdom whereas the clever onesthe really clever onesalways understood her silliness it appeared to her that different as they were in appearance and general style isabel and she had somewhere a patch of common ground that they would set their feet upon at last it was not very large but it was firm and they should both know it when once they had really touched it and then she lived with mrs osmond under the influence of a pleasant surprise she was constantly expecting that isabel would look down on her and she as constantly saw this operation postponed she asked herself when it would begin like fireworks or lent or the opera season not that she cared much but she wondered what kept it in abeyance her sisterinlaw regarded her with none but level glances and expressed for the poor countess as little contempt as admiration in reality isabel would as soon have thought of despising her as of passing a moral judgement on a grasshopper she was not indifferent to her husbands sister however she was rather a little afraid of her she wondered at her she thought her very extraordinary the countess seemed to her to have no soul she was like a bright rare shell with a polished surface and a remarkably pink lip in which something would rattle when you shook it this rattle was apparently the countesss spiritual principle a little loose nut that tumbled about inside of her she was too odd for disdain too anomalous for comparisons isabel would have invited her again there was no question of inviting the count but osmond after his marriage had not scrupled to say frankly that amy was a fool of the worst speciesa fool whose folly had the irrepressibility of genius he said at another time that she had no heart and he added in a moment that she had given it all awayin small pieces like a frosted weddingcake the fact of not having been asked was of course another obstacle to the countesss going again to rome but at the period with which this history has now to deal she was in receipt of an invitation to spend several weeks at palazzo roccanera the proposal had come from osmond himself who wrote to his sister that she must be prepared to be very quiet whether or no she found in this phrase all the meaning he had put into it i am unable to say but she accepted the invitation on any terms she was curious moreover for one of the impressions of her former visit had been that her brother had found his match before the marriage she had been sorry for isabel so sorry as to have had serious thoughtsif any of the countesss thoughts were seriousof putting her on her guard but she had let that pass and after a little she was reassured osmond was as lofty as ever but his wife would not be an easy victim the countess was not very exact at measurements but it seemed to her that if isabel should draw herself up she would be the taller spirit of the two what she wanted to learn now was whether isabel had drawn herself up it would give her immense pleasure to see osmond overtopped  several days before she was to start for rome a servant brought her the card of a visitora card with the simple superscription henrietta c stackpole the countess pressed her fingertips to her forehead she didnt remember to have known any such henrietta as that the servant then remarked that the lady had requested him to say that if the countess should not recognise her name she would know her well enough on seeing her by the time she appeared before her visitor she had in fact reminded herself that there was once a literary lady at mrs touchetts the only woman of letters she had ever encounteredthat is the only modern one since she was the daughter of a defunct poetess she recognised miss stackpole immediately the more so that miss stackpole seemed perfectly unchanged and the countess who was thoroughly goodnatured thought it rather fine to be called on by a person of that sort of distinction she wondered if miss stackpole had come on account of her motherwhether she had heard of the american corinne her mother was not at all like isabels friend the countess could see at a glance that this lady was much more contemporary and she received an impression of the improvements that were taking placechiefly in distant countriesin the character the professional character of literary ladies her mother had been used to wear a roman scarf thrown over a pair of shoulders timorously bared of their tight black velvet oh the old clothes and a gold laurelwreath set upon a multitude of glossy ringlets she had spoken softly and vaguely with the accent of her creole ancestors as she always confessed she sighed a great deal and was not at all enterprising but henrietta the countess could see was always closely buttoned and compactly braided there was something brisk and businesslike in her appearance her manner was almost conscientiously familiar it was as impossible to imagine her ever vaguely sighing as to imagine a letter posted without its address the countess could not but feel that the correspondent of the interviewer was much more in the movement than the american corinne she explained that she had called on the countess because she was the only person she knew in florence and that when she visited a foreign city she liked to see something more than superficial travellers she knew mrs touchett but mrs touchett was in america and even if she had been in florence henrietta would not have put herself out for her since mrs touchett was not one of her admirations  do you mean by that that i am the countess graciously asked  well i like you better than i do her said miss stackpole i seem to remember that when i saw you before you were very interesting i dont know whether it was an accident or whether its your usual style at any rate i was a good deal struck with what you said i made use of it afterwards in print  dear me cried the countess staring and halfalarmed i had no idea i ever said anything remarkable i wish i had known it at the time  it was about the position of woman in this city miss stackpole remarked you threw a good deal of light upon it  the position of womans very uncomfortable is that what you mean and you wrote it down and published it the countess went on ah do let me see it  ill write to them to send you the paper if you like henrietta said i didnt mention your name i only said a lady of high rank and then i quoted your views  the countess threw herself hastily backward tossing up her clasped hands do you know im rather sorry you didnt mention my name i should have rather liked to see my name in the papers i forget what my views were i have so many but im not ashamed of them im not at all like my brotheri suppose you know my brother he thinks it a kind of scandal to be put in the papers if you were to quote him hed never forgive you  he neednt be afraid i shall never refer to him said miss stackpole with bland dryness thats another reason she added why i wanted to come to see you you know mr osmond married my dearest friend  ah yes you were a friend of isabels i was trying to think what i knew about you  im quite willing to be known by that henrietta declared but that isnt what your brother likes to know me by he has tried to break up my relations with isabel  dont permit it said the countess  thats what i want to talk about im going to rome  so am i the countess cried well go together  with great pleasure and when i write about my journey ill mention you by name as my companion  the countess sprang from her chair and came and sat on the sofa beside her visitor ah you must send me the paper my husband wont like it but he need never see it besides he doesnt know how to read  henriettas large eyes became immense doesnt know how to read may i put that into my letter  into your letter  in the interviewer thats my paper  oh yes if you like with his name are you going to stay with isabel  henrietta held up her head gazing a little in silence at her hostess she has not asked me i wrote to her i was coming and she answered that she would engage a room for me at a pension she gave no reason  the countess listened with extreme interest the reasons osmond she pregnantly remarked  isabel ought to make a stand said miss stackpole im afraid she has changed a great deal i told her she would  im sorry to hear it i hoped she would have her own way why doesnt my brother like you the countess ingenuously added  i dont know and i dont care hes perfectly welcome not to like me i dont want every one to like me i should think less of myself if some people did a journalist cant hope to do much good unless he gets a good deal hated thats the way he knows how his work goes on and its just the same for a lady but i didnt expect it of isabel  do you mean that she hates you the countess enquired  i dont know i want to see thats what im going to rome for  dear me what a tiresome errand the countess exclaimed  she doesnt write to me in the same way its easy to see theres a difference if you know anything miss stackpole went on i should like to hear it beforehand so as to decide on the line i shall take  the countess thrust out her under lip and gave a gradual shrug i know very little i see and hear very little of osmond he doesnt like me any better than he appears to like you  yet youre not a lady correspondent said henrietta pensively  oh he has plenty of reasons nevertheless theyve invited meim to stay in the house and the countess smiled almost fiercely her exultation for the moment took little account of miss stackpoles disappointment  this lady however regarded it very placidly i shouldnt have gone if she had asked me that is i think i shouldnt and im glad i hadnt to make up my mind it would have been a very difficult question i shouldnt have liked to turn away from her and yet i shouldnt have been happy under her roof a pension will suit me very well but thats not all  romes very good just now said the countess there are all sorts of brilliant people did you ever hear of lord warburton  hear of him i know him very well do you consider him very brilliant henrietta enquired  i dont know him but im told hes extremely grand seigneur hes making love to isabel  making love to her  so im told i dont know the details said the countess lightly but isabels pretty safe  henrietta gazed earnestly at her companion for a moment she said nothing when do you go to rome she enquired abruptly  not for a week im afraid  i shall go tomorrow henrietta said i think i had better not wait  dear me im sorry im having some dresses made im told isabel receives immensely but i shall see you there i shall call on you at your pension henrietta sat stillshe was lost in thought and suddenly the countess cried ah but if you dont go with me you cant describe our journey  miss stackpole seemed unmoved by this consideration she was thinking of something else and presently expressed it im not sure that i understand you about lord warburton  understand me i mean hes very nice thats all  do you consider it nice to make love to married women henrietta enquired with unprecedented distinctness  the countess stared and then with a little violent laugh its certain all the nice men do it get married and youll see she added  that idea would be enough to prevent me said miss stackpole i should want my own husband i shouldnt want any one elses do you mean that isabels guiltyguilty and she paused a little choosing her expression  do i mean shes guilty oh dear no not yet i hope i only mean that osmonds very tiresome and that lord warburton as i hear is a great deal at the house im afraid youre scandalised  no im just anxious henrietta said  ah youre not very complimentary to isabel you should have more confidence ill tell you the countess added quickly if it will be a comfort to you i engage to draw him off  miss stackpole answered at first only with the deeper solemnity of her gaze you dont understand me she said after a while i havent the idea you seem to suppose im not afraid for isabelin that way im only afraid shes unhappythats what i want to get at  the countess gave a dozen turns of the head she looked impatient and sarcastic that may very well be for my part i should like to know whether osmond is miss stackpole had begun a little to bore her  if shes really changed that must be at the bottom of it henrietta went on  youll see shell tell you said the countess  ah she may not tell methats what im afraid of  well if osmond isnt amusing himselfin his own old wayi flatter myself i shall discover it the countess rejoined  i dont care for that said henrietta  i do immensely if isabels unhappy im very sorry for her but i cant help it i might tell her something that would make her worse but i cant tell her anything that would console her what did she go and marry him for if she had listened to me shed have got rid of him ill forgive her however if i find she has made things hot for him if she has simply allowed him to trample upon her i dont know that i shall even pity her but i dont think thats very likely i count upon finding that if shes miserable she has at least made him so  henrietta got up these seemed to her naturally very dreadful expectations she honestly believed she had no desire to see mr osmond unhappy and indeed he could not be for her the subject of a flight of fancy she was on the whole rather disappointed in the countess whose mind moved in a narrower circle than she had imagined though with a capacity for coarseness even there it will be better if they love each other she said for edification  they cant he cant love any one  i presumed that was the case but it only aggravates my fear for isabel i shall positively start tomorrow  isabel certainly has devotees said the countess smiling very vividly i declare i dont pity her  it may be i cant assist her miss stackpole pursued as if it were well not to have illusions  you can have wanted to at any rate thats something i believe thats what you came from america for the countess suddenly added  yes i wanted to look after her henrietta said serenely  her hostess stood there smiling at her with small bright eyes and an eagerlooking nose with cheeks into each of which a flush had come ah thats very pretty cest bien gentil isnt it what they call friendship  i dont know what they call it i thought i had better come  shes very happyshes very fortunate the countess went on she has others besides and then she broke out passionately shes more fortunate than i im as unhappy as sheive a very bad husband hes a great deal worse than osmond and ive no friends i thought i had but theyre gone no one man or woman would do for me what youve done for her  henrietta was touched there was nature in this bitter effusion she gazed at her companion a moment and then look here countess ill do anything for you that you like ill wait over and travel with you  never mind the countess answered with a quick change of tone only describe me in the newspaper  henrietta before leaving her however was obliged to make her understand that she could give no fictitious representation of her journey to rome miss stackpole was a strictly veracious reporter on quitting her she took the way to the lung arno the sunny quay beside the yellow river where the brightfaced inns familiar to tourists stand all in a row she had learned her way before this through the streets of florence she was very quick in such matters and was therefore able to turn with great decision of step out of the little square which forms the approach to the bridge of the holy trinity she proceeded to the left toward the ponte vecchio and stopped in front of one of the hotels which overlook that delightful structure here she drew forth a small pocketbook took from it a card and a pencil and after meditating a moment wrote a few words it is our privilege to look over her shoulder and if we exercise it we may read the brief query could i see you this evening for a few moments on a very important matter henrietta added that she should start on the morrow for rome armed with this little document she approached the porter who now had taken up his station in the doorway and asked if mr goodwood were at home the porter replied as porters always reply that he had gone out about twenty minutes before whereupon henrietta presented her card and begged it might be handed him on his return she left the inn and pursued her course along the quay to the severe portico of the uffizi through which she presently reached the entrance of the famous gallery of paintings making her way in she ascended the high staircase which leads to the upper chambers the long corridor glazed on one side and decorated with antique busts which gives admission to these apartments presented an empty vista in which the bright winter light twinkled upon the marble floor the gallery is very cold and during the midwinter weeks but scantily visited miss stackpole may appear more ardent in her quest of artistic beauty than she has hitherto struck us as being but she had after all her preferences and admirations one of the latter was the little correggio of the tribunethe virgin kneeling down before the sacred infant who lies in a litter of straw and clapping her hands to him while he delightedly laughs and crows henrietta had a special devotion to this intimate sceneshe thought it the most beautiful picture in the world on her way at present from new york to rome she was spending but three days in florence and yet reminded herself that they must not elapse without her paying another visit to her favourite work of art she had a great sense of beauty in all ways and it involved a good many intellectual obligations she was about to turn into the tribune when a gentleman came out of it whereupon she gave a little exclamation and stood before caspar goodwood  ive just been at your hotel she said i left a card for you  im very much honoured caspar goodwood answered as if he really meant it  it was not to honour you i did it ive called on you before and i know you dont like it it was to talk to you a little about something  he looked for a moment at the buckle in her hat i shall be very glad to hear what you wish to say  you dont like to talk with me said henrietta but i dont care for that i dont talk for your amusement i wrote a word to ask you to come and see me but since ive met you here this will do as well  i was just going away goodwood stated but of course ill stop he was civil but not enthusiastic  henrietta however never looked for great professions and she was so much in earnest that she was thankful he would listen to her on any terms she asked him first none the less if he had seen all the pictures  all i want to ive been here an hour  i wonder if youve seen my correggio said henrietta i came up on purpose to have a look at it she went into the tribune and he slowly accompanied her  i suppose ive seen it but i didnt know it was yours i dont remember picturesespecially that sort she had pointed out her favourite work and he asked her if it was about correggio she wished to talk with him  no said henrietta its about something less harmonious they had the small brilliant room a splendid cabinet of treasures to themselves there was only a custode hovering about the medicean venus i want you to do me a favour miss stackpole went on  caspar goodwood frowned a little but he expressed no embarrassment at the sense of not looking eager his face was that of a much older man than our earlier friend im sure its something i shant like he said rather loudly  no i dont think youll like it if you did it would be no favour  well lets hear it he went on in the tone of a man quite conscious of his patience  you may say theres no particular reason why you should do me a favour indeed i only know of one the fact that if youd let me id gladly do you one her soft exact tone in which there was no attempt at effect had an extreme sincerity and her companion though he presented rather a hard surface couldnt help being touched by it when he was touched he rarely showed it however by the usual signs he neither blushed nor looked away nor looked conscious he only fixed his attention more directly he seemed to consider with added firmness henrietta continued therefore disinterestedly without the sense of an advantage i may say now indeedit seems a good timethat if ive ever annoyed you and i think sometimes i have its because i knew i was willing to suffer annoyance for you ive troubled youdoubtless but id take trouble for you  goodwood hesitated youre taking trouble now  yes i amsome i want you to consider whether its better on the whole that you should go to rome  i thought you were going to say that he answered rather artlessly  you have considered it then  of course i have very carefully ive looked all round it otherwise i shouldnt have come so far as this thats what i stayed in paris two months for i was thinking it over  im afraid you decided as you liked you decided it was best because you were so much attracted  best for whom do you mean goodwood demanded  well for yourself first for mrs osmond next  oh it wont do her any good i dont flatter myself that  wont it do her some harmthats the question  i dont see what it will matter to her im nothing to mrs osmond but if you want to know i do want to see her myself  yes and thats why you go  of course it is could there be a better reason  how will it help youthats what i want to know said miss stackpole  thats just what i cant tell you its just what i was thinking about in paris  it will make you more discontented  why do you say more so goodwood asked rather sternly how do you know im discontented  well said henrietta hesitating a little you seem never to have cared for another  how do you know what i care for he cried with a big blush just now i care to go to rome  henrietta looked at him in silence with a sad yet luminous expression well she observed at last i only wanted to tell you what i think i had it on my mind of course you think its none of my business but nothing is any ones business on that principle  its very kind of you im greatly obliged to you for your interest said caspar goodwood i shall go to rome and i shant hurt mrs osmond  you wont hurt her perhaps but will you help herthats the real issue  is she in need of help he asked slowly with a penetrating look  most women always are said henrietta with conscientious evasiveness and generalising less hopefully than usual if you go to rome she added i hope youll be a true friendnot a selfish one and she turned off and began to look at the pictures  caspar goodwood let her go and stood watching her while she wandered round the room but after a moment he rejoined her youve heard something about her here he then resumed i should like to know what youve heard  henrietta had never prevaricated in her life and though on this occasion there might have been a fitness in doing so she decided after thinking some minutes to make no superficial exception yes ive heard she answered but as i dont want you to go to rome i wont tell you  just as you please i shall see for myself he said then inconsistently for him youve heard shes unhappy he added  oh you wont see that henrietta exclaimed  i hope not when do you start  tomorrow by the evening train and you  goodwood hung back he had no desire to make his journey to rome in miss stackpoles company his indifference to this advantage was not of the same character as gilbert osmonds but it had at this moment an equal distinctness it was rather a tribute to miss stackpoles virtues than a reference to her faults he thought her very remarkable very brilliant and he had in theory no objection to the class to which she belonged lady correspondents appeared to him a part of the natural scheme of things in a progressive country and though he never read their letters he supposed that they ministered somehow to social prosperity but it was this very eminence of their position that made him wish miss stackpole didnt take so much for granted she took for granted that he was always ready for some allusion to mrs osmond she had done so when they met in paris six weeks after his arrival in europe and she had repeated the assumption with every successive opportunity he had no wish whatever to allude to mrs osmond he was not always thinking of her he was perfectly sure of that he was the most reserved the least colloquial of men and this enquiring authoress was constantly flashing her lantern into the quiet darkness of his soul he wished she didnt care so much he even wished though it might seem rather brutal of him that she would leave him alone in spite of this however he just now made other reflectionswhich show how widely different in effect his illhumour was from gilbert osmonds he desired to go immediately to rome he would have liked to go alone in the nighttrain he hated the european railwaycarriages in which one sat for hours in a vise knee to knee and nose to nose with a foreigner to whom one presently found ones self objecting with all the added vehemence of ones wish to have the window open and if they were worse at night even than by day at least at night one could sleep and dream of an american salooncar but he couldnt take a nighttrain when miss stackpole was starting in the morning it struck him that this would be an insult to an unprotected woman nor could he wait until after she had gone unless he should wait longer than he had patience for it wouldnt do to start the next day she worried him she oppressed him the idea of spending the day in a european railwaycarriage with her offered a complication of irritations still she was a lady travelling alone it was his duty to put himself out for her there could be no two questions about that it was a perfectly clear necessity he looked extremely grave for some moments and then said wholly without the flourish of gallantry but in a tone of extreme distinctness of course if youre going tomorrow ill go too as i may be of assistance to you  well mr goodwood i should hope so henrietta returned imperturbably    chapter xlv  i have already had reason to say that isabel knew her husband to be displeased by the continuance of ralphs visit to rome that knowledge was very present to her as she went to her cousins hotel the day after she had invited lord warburton to give a tangible proof of his sincerity and at this moment as at others she had a sufficient perception of the sources of osmonds opposition he wished her to have no freedom of mind and he knew perfectly well that ralph was an apostle of freedom it was just because he was this isabel said to herself that it was a refreshment to go and see him it will be perceived that she partook of this refreshment in spite of her husbands aversion to it that is partook of it as she flattered herself discreetly she had not as yet undertaken to act in direct opposition to his wishes he was her appointed and inscribed master she gazed at moments with a sort of incredulous blankness at this fact it weighed upon her imagination however constantly present to her mind were all the traditionary decencies and sanctities of marriage the idea of violating them filled her with shame as well as with dread for on giving herself away she had lost sight of this contingency in the perfect belief that her husbands intentions were as generous as her own she seemed to see none the less the rapid approach of the day when she should have to take back something she had solemnly bestown such a ceremony would be odious and monstrous she tried to shut her eyes to it meanwhile osmond would do nothing to help it by beginning first he would put that burden upon her to the end he had not yet formally forbidden her to call upon ralph but she felt sure that unless ralph should very soon depart this prohibition would come how could poor ralph depart the weather as yet made it impossible she could perfectly understand her husbands wish for the event she didnt to be just see how he could like her to be with her cousin ralph never said a word against him but osmonds sore mute protest was none the less founded if he should positively interpose if he should put forth his authority she would have to decide and that wouldnt be easy the prospect made her heart beat and her cheeks burn as i say in advance there were moments when in her wish to avoid an open rupture she found herself wishing ralph would start even at a risk and it was of no use that when catching herself in this state of mind she called herself a feeble spirit a coward it was not that she loved ralph less but that almost anything seemed preferable to repudiating the most serious actthe single sacred actof her life that appeared to make the whole future hideous to break with osmond once would be to break for ever any open acknowledgement of irreconcilable needs would be an admission that their whole attempt had proved a failure for them there could be no condonement no compromise no easy forgetfulness no formal readjustment they had attempted only one thing but that one thing was to have been exquisite once they missed it nothing else would do there was no conceivable substitute for that success for the moment isabel went to the hotel de paris as often as she thought well the measure of propriety was in the canon of taste and there couldnt have been a better proof that morality was so to speak a matter of earnest appreciation isabels application of that measure had been particularly free today for in addition to the general truth that she couldnt leave ralph to die alone she had something important to ask of him this indeed was gilberts business as well as her own  she came very soon to what she wished to speak of i want you to answer me a question its about lord warburton  i think i guess your question ralph answered from his armchair out of which his thin legs protruded at greater length than ever  very possibly you guess it please then answer it  oh i dont say i can do that  youre intimate with him she said youve a great deal of observation of him  very true but think how he must dissimulate  why should he dissimulate thats not his nature  ah you must remember that the circumstances are peculiar said ralph with an air of private amusement  to a certain extentyes but is he really in love  very much i think i can make that out  ah said isabel with a certain dryness  ralph looked at her as if his mild hilarity had been touched with mystification you say that as if you were disappointed  isabel got up slowly smoothing her gloves and eyeing them thoughtfully its after all no business of mine  youre very philosophic said her cousin and then in a moment may i enquire what youre talking about  isabel stared i thought you knew lord warburton tells me he wants of all things in the world to marry pansy ive told you that before without eliciting a comment from you you might risk one this morning i think is it your belief that he really cares for her  ah for pansy no cried ralph very positively  but you said just now he did  ralph waited a moment that he cared for you mrs osmond  isabel shook her head gravely thats nonsense you know  of course it is but the nonsense is warburtons not mine  that would be very tiresome she spoke as she flattered herself with much subtlety  i ought to tell you indeed ralph went on that to me he has denied it  its very good of you to talk about it together has he also told you that hes in love with pansy  he has spoken very well of hervery properly he has let me know of course that he thinks she would do very well at lockleigh  does he really think it  ah what warburton really thinks said ralph  isabel fell to smoothing her gloves again they were long loose gloves on which she could freely expend herself soon however she looked up and then ah ralph you give me no help she cried abruptly and passionately  it was the first time she had alluded to the need for help and the words shook her cousin with their violence he gave a long murmur of relief of pity of tenderness it seemed to him that at last the gulf between them had been bridged it was this that made him exclaim in a moment how unhappy you must be  he had no sooner spoken than she recovered her selfpossession and the first use she made of it was to pretend she had not heard him when i talk of your helping me i talk great nonsense she said with a quick smile the idea of my troubling you with my domestic embarrassments the matters very simple lord warburton must get on by himself i cant undertake to see him through  he ought to succeed easily said ralph  isabel debated yesbut he has not always succeeded  very true you know however how that always surprised me is miss osmond capable of giving us a surprise  it will come from him rather i seem to see that after all hell let the matter drop  hell do nothing dishonourable said ralph  im very sure of that nothing can be more honourable than for him to leave the poor child alone she cares for another person and its cruel to attempt to bribe her by magnificent offers to give him up  cruel to the other person perhapsthe one she cares for but warburton isnt obliged to mind that  no cruel to her said isabel she would be very unhappy if she were to allow herself to be persuaded to desert poor mr rosier that idea seems to amuse you of course youre not in love with him he has the meritfor pansyof being in love with pansy she can see at a glance that lord warburton isnt  hed be very good to her said ralph  he has been good to her already fortunately however he has not said a word to disturb her he could come and bid her goodbye tomorrow with perfect propriety  how would your husband like that  not at all and he may be right in not liking it only he must obtain satisfaction himself  has he commissioned you to obtain it ralph ventured to ask  it was natural that as an old friend of lord warburtonsan older friend that is than gilberti should take an interest in his intentions  take an interest in his renouncing them you mean  isabel hesitated frowning a little let me understand are you pleading his cause  not in the least im very glad he shouldnt become your stepdaughters husband it makes such a very queer relation to you said ralph smiling but im rather nervous lest your husband should think you havent pushed him enough  isabel found herself able to smile as well as he he knows me well enough not to have expected me to push he himself has no intention of pushing i presume im not afraid i shall not be able to justify myself she said lightly  her mask had dropped for an instant but she had put it on again to ralphs infinite disappointment he had caught a glimpse of her natural face and he wished immensely to look into it he had an almost savage desire to hear her complain of her husbandhear her say that she should be held accountable for lord warburtons defection ralph was certain that this was her situation he knew by instinct in advance the form that in such an event osmonds displeasure would take it could only take the meanest and cruellest he would have liked to warn isabel of itto let her see at least how he judged for her and how he knew it little mattered that isabel would know much better it was for his own satisfaction more than for hers that he longed to show her he was not deceived he tried and tried again to make her betray osmond he felt coldblooded cruel dishonourable almost in doing so but it scarcely mattered for he only failed what had she come for then and why did she seem almost to offer him a chance to violate their tacit convention why did she ask him his advice if she gave him no liberty to answer her how could they talk of her domestic embarrassments as it pleased her humorously to designate them if the principal factor was not to be mentioned these contradictions were themselves but an indication of her trouble and her cry for help just before was the only thing he was bound to consider youll be decidedly at variance all the same he said in a moment and as she answered nothing looking as if she scarce understood youll find yourselves thinking very differently he continued  that may easily happen among the most united couples she took up her parasol he saw she was nervous afraid of what he might say its a matter we can hardly quarrel about however she added for almost all the interest is on his side thats very natural pansys after all his daughternot mine and she put out her hand to wish him goodbye  ralph took an inward resolution that she shouldnt leave him without his letting her know that he knew everything it seemed too great an opportunity to lose do you know what his interest will make him say he asked as he took her hand she shook her head rather drylynot discouraginglyand he went on it will make him say that your want of zeal is owing to jealousy he stopped a moment her face made him afraid  to jealousy  to jealousy of his daughter  she blushed red and threw back her head youre not kind she said in a voice that he had never heard on her lips  be frank with me and youll see he answered  but she made no reply she only pulled her hand out of his own which he tried still to hold and rapidly withdrew from the room she made up her mind to speak to pansy and she took an occasion on the same day going to the girls room before dinner pansy was already dressed she was always in advance of the time it seemed to illustrate her pretty patience and the graceful stillness with which she could sit and wait at present she was seated in her fresh array before the bedroom fire she had blown out her candles on the completion of her toilet in accordance with the economical habits in which she had been brought up sand which she was now more careful than ever to observe so that the room was lighted only by a couple of logs the rooms in palazzo roccanera were as spacious as they were numerous and pansys virginal bower was an immense chamber with a dark heavilytimbered ceiling its diminutive mistress in the midst of it appeared but a speck of humanity and as she got up with quick deference to welcome isabel the latter was more than ever struck with her shy sincerity isabel had a difficult taskthe only thing was to perform it as simply as possible she felt bitter and angry but she warned herself against betraying this heat she was afraid even of looking too grave or at least too stern she was afraid of causing alarm put pansy seemed to have guessed she had come more or less as a confessor for after she had moved the chair in which she had been sitting a little nearer to the fire and isabel had taken her place in it she kneeled down on a cushion in front of her looking up and resting her clasped hands on her stepmothers knees what isabel wished to do was to hear from her own lips that her mind was not occupied with lord warburton but if she desired the assurance she felt herself by no means at liberty to provoke it the girls father would have qualified this as rank treachery and indeed isabel knew that if pansy should display the smallest germ of a disposition to encourage lord warburton her own duty was to hold her tongue it was difficult to interrogate without appearing to suggest pansys supreme simplicity an innocence even more complete than isabel had yet judged it gave to the most tentative enquiry something of the effect of an admonition as she knelt there in the vague firelight with her pretty dress dimly shining her hands folded half in appeal and half in submission her soft eyes raised and fixed full of the seriousness of the situation she looked to isabel like a childish martyr decked out for sacrifice and scarcely presuming even to hope to avert it when isabel said to her that she had never yet spoken to her of what might have been going on in relation to her getting married but that her silence had not been indifference or ignorance had only been the desire to leave her at liberty pansy bent forward raised her face nearer and nearer and with a little murmur which evidently expressed a deep longing answered that she had greatly wished her to speak and that she begged her to advise her now  its difficult for me to advise you isabel returned i dont know how i can undertake that thats for your father you must get his advice and above all you must act on it  at this pansy dropped her eyes for a moment she said nothing i think i should like your advice better than papas she presently remarked  thats not as it should be said isabel coldly i love you very much but your father loves you better  it isnt because you love meits because youre a lady pansy answered with the air of saying something very reasonable a lady can advise a young girl better than a man  i advise you then to pay the greatest respect to your fathers wishes  ah yes said the child eagerly i must do that  but if i speak to you now about your getting married its not for your own sake its for mine isabel went on if i try to learn from you what you expect what you desire its only that i may act accordingly  pansy stared and then very quickly will you do everything i want she asked  before i say yes i must know what such things are  pansy presently told her that the only thing she wanted in life was to marry mr rosier he had asked her and she had told him she would do so if her papa would allow it now her papa wouldnt allow it  very well then its impossible isabel pronounced  yes its impossible said pansy without a sigh and with the same extreme attention in her clear little face  you must think of something else then isabel went on but pansy sighing at this told her that she had attempted that feat without the least success  you think of those who think of you she said with a faint smile i know mr rosier thinks of me  he ought not to said isabel loftily your father has expressly requested he shouldnt  he cant help it because he knows i think of him  you shouldnt think of him theres some excuse for him perhaps but theres none for you  i wish you would try to find one the girl exclaimed as if she were praying to the madonna  i should be very sorry to attempt it said the madonna with unusual frigidity if you knew some one else was thinking of you would you think of him  no one can think of me as mr rosier does no one has the right  ah but i dont admit mr rosiers right isabel hypocritically cried  pansy only gazed at her evidently much puzzled and isabel taking advantage of it began to represent to her the wretched consequences of disobeying her father at this pansy stopped her with the assurance that she would never disobey him would never marry without his consent and she announced in the serenest simplest tone that though she might never marry mr rosier she would never cease to think of him she appeared to have accepted the idea of eternal singleness but isabel of course was free to reflect that she had no conception of its meaning she was perfectly sincere she was prepared to give up her lover this might seem an important step toward taking another but for pansy evidently it failed to lead in that direction she felt no bitterness toward her father there was no bitterness in her heart there was only the sweetness of fidelity to edward rosier and a strange exquisite intimation that she could prove it better by remaining single than even by marrying him  your father would like you to make a better marriage said isabel mr rosiers fortune is not at all large  how do you mean betterif that would be good enough and i have myself so little money why should i look for a fortune  your having so little is a reason for looking for more with which isabel was grateful for the dimness of the room she felt as if her face were hideously insincere it was what she was doing for osmond it was what one had to do for osmond pansys solemn eyes fixed on her own almost embarrassed her she was ashamed to think she had made so light of the girls preference  what should you like me to do her companion softly demanded  the question was a terrible one and isabel took refuge in timorous vagueness to remember all the pleasure its in your power to give your father  to marry some one else you meanif he should ask me  for a moment isabels answer caused itself to be waited for then she heard herself utter it in the stillness that pansys attention seemed to make yesto marry some one else  the childs eyes grew more penetrating isabel believed she was doubting her sincerity and the impression took force from her slowly getting up from her cushion she stood there a moment with her small hands unclasped and then quavered out well i hope no one will ask me  there has been a question of that some one else would have been ready to ask you  i dont think he can have been ready said pansy  it would appear so if he had been sure hed succeed  if he had been sure then he wasnt ready  isabel thought this rather sharp she also got up and stood a moment looking into the fire lord warburton has shown you great attention she resumed of course you know its of him i speak she found herself against her expectation almost placed in the position of justifying herself which led her to introduce this nobleman more crudely than she had intended  he has been very kind to me and i like him very much but if you mean that hell propose for me i think youre mistaken  perhaps i am but your father would like it extremely  pansy shook her head with a little wise smile lord warburton wont propose simply to please papa  your father would like you to encourage him isabel went on mechanically  how can i encourage him  i dont know your father must tell you that  pansy said nothing for a moment she only continued to smile as if she were in possession of a bright assurance theres no dangerno danger she declared at last  there was a conviction in the way she said this and a felicity in her believing it which conduced to isabels awkwardness she felt accused of dishonesty and the idea was disgusting to repair her selfrespect she was on the point of saying that lord warburton had let her know that there was a danger but she didnt she only saidin her embarrassment rather wide of the markthat he surely had been most kind most friendly  yes he has been very kind pansy answered thats what i like him for  why then is the difficulty so great  ive always felt sure of his knowing that i dont wantwhat did you say i should doto encourage him he knows i dont want to marry and he wants me to know that he therefore wont trouble me thats the meaning of his kindness its as if he said to me i like you very much but if it doesnt please you ill never say it again i think thats very kind very noble pansy went on with deepening positiveness that is all weve said to each other and he doesnt care for me either ah no theres no danger  isabel was touched with wonder at the depths of perception of which this submissive little person was capable she felt afraid of pansys wisdombegan almost to retreat before it you must tell your father that she remarked reservedly  i think id rather not pansy unreservedly answered  you oughtnt to let him have false hopes  perhaps not but it will be good for me that he should so long as he believes that lord warburton intends anything of the kind you say papa wont propose any one else and that will be an advantage for me said the child very lucidly  there was something brilliant in her lucidity and it made her companion draw a long breath it relieved this friend of a heavy responsibility pansy had a sufficient illumination of her own and isabel felt that she herself just now had no light to spare from her small stock nevertheless it still clung to her that she must be loyal to osmond that she was on her honour in dealing with his daughter under the influence of this sentiment she threw out another suggestion before she retireda suggestion with which it seemed to her that she should have done her utmost  your father takes for granted at least that you would like to marry a nobleman  pansy stood in the open doorway she had drawn back the curtain for isabel to pass i think mr rosier looks like one she remarked very gravely    chapter xlvi  lord warburton was not seen in mrs osmonds drawingroom for several days and isabel couldnt fail to observe that her husband said nothing to her about having received a letter from him she couldnt fail to observe either that osmond was in a state of expectancy and that though it was not agreeable to him to betray it he thought their distinguished friend kept him waiting quite too long at the end of four days he alluded to his absence  what has become of warburton what does he mean by treating one like a tradesman with a bill  i know nothing about him isabel said i saw him last friday at the german ball he told me then that he meant to write to you  he has never written to me  so i supposed from your not having told me  hes an odd fish said osmond comprehensively and on isabels making no rejoinder he went on to enquire whether it took his lordship five days to indite a letter does he form his words with such difficulty  i dont know isabel was reduced to replying ive never had a letter from him  never had a letter i had an idea that you were at one time in intimate correspondence  she answered that this had not been the case and let the conversation drop on the morrow however coming into the drawingroom late in the afternoon her husband took it up again  when lord warburton told you of his intention of writing what did you say to him he asked  she just faltered i think i told him not to forget it  did you believe there was a danger of that  as you say hes an odd fish  apparently he has forgotten it said osmond be so good as to remind him  should you like me to write to him she demanded  ive no objection whatever  you expect too much of me  ah yes i expect a great deal of you  im afraid i shall disappoint you said isabel  my expectations have survived a good deal of disappointment  of course i know that think how i must have disappointed myself if you really wish hands laid on lord warburton you must lay them yourself  for a couple of minutes osmond answered nothing then he said that wont be easy with you working against me  isabel started she felt herself beginning to tremble he had a way of looking at her through halfclosed eyelids as if he were thinking of her but scarcely saw her which seemed to her to have a wonderfully cruel intention it appeared to recognise her as a disagreeable necessity of thought but to ignore her for the time as a presence that effect had never been so marked as now i think you accuse me of something very base she returned  i accuse you of not being trustworthy if he doesnt after all come forward it will be because youve kept him off i dont know that its base it is the kind of thing a woman always thinks she may do ive no doubt youve the finest ideas about it  i told you i would do what i could she went on  yes that gained you time  it came over her after he had said this that she had once thought him beautiful how much you must want to make sure of him she exclaimed in a moment  she had no sooner spoken than she perceived the full reach of her words of which she had not been conscious in uttering them they made a comparison between osmond and herself recalled the fact that she had once held this coveted treasure in her hand and felt herself rich enough to let it fall a momentary exultation took possession of hera horrible delight in having wounded him for his face instantly told her that none of the force of her exclamation was lost he expressed nothing otherwise however he only said quickly yes i want it immensely  at this moment a servant came in to usher a visitor and he was followed the next by lord warburton who received a visible check on seeing osmond he looked rapidly from the master of the house to the mistress a movement that seemed to denote a reluctance to interrupt or even a perception of ominous conditions then he advanced with his english address in which a vague shyness seemed to offer itself as an element of goodbreeding in which the only defect was a difficulty in achieving transitions osmond was embarrassed he found nothing to say but isabel remarked promptly enough that they had been in the act of talking about their visitor upon this her husband added that they hadnt known what was become of himthey had been afraid he had gone away no he explained smiling and looking at osmond im only on the point of going and then he mentioned that he found himself suddenly recalled to england he should start on the morrow or the day after im awfully sorry to leave poor touchett he ended by exclaiming  for a moment neither of his companions spoke osmond only leaned back in his chair listening isabel didnt look at him she could only fancy how he looked her eyes were on their visitors face where they were the more free to rest that those of his lordship carefully avoided them yet isabel was sure that had she met his glance she would have found it expressive you had better take poor touchett with you she heard her husband say lightly enough in a moment  he had better wait for warmer weather lord warburton answered i shouldnt advise him to travel just now  he sat there a quarter of an hour talking as if he might not soon see them againunless indeed they should come to england a course he strongly recommended why shouldnt they come to england in the autumnthat struck him as a very happy thought it would give him such pleasure to do what he could for themto have them come and spend a month with him osmond by his own admission had been to england but once which was an absurd state of things for a man of his leisure and intelligence it was just the country for himhe would be sure to get on well there then lord warburton asked isabel if she remembered what a good time she had had there and if she didnt want to try it again didnt she want to see gardencourt once more gardencourt was really very good touchett didnt take proper care of it but it was the sort of place you could hardly spoil by letting it alone why didnt they come and pay touchett a visit he surely must have asked them hadnt asked them what an illmannered wretchand lord warburton promised to give the master of gardencourt a piece of his mind of course it was a mere accident he would be delighted to have them spending a month with touchett and a month with himself and seeing all the rest of the people they must know there they really wouldnt find it half bad lord warburton added that it would amuse miss osmond as well who had told him that she had never been to england and whom he had assured it was a country she deserved to see of course she didnt need to go to england to be admiredthat was her fate everywhere but she would be an immense success there she certainly would if that was any inducement he asked if she were not at home couldnt he say goodbye not that he liked goodbyeshe always funked them when he left england the other day he hadnt said goodbye to a twolegged creature he had had half a mind to leave rome without troubling mrs osmond for a final interview what could be more dreary than final interviews one never said the things one wantedone remembered them all an hour afterwards on the other hand one usually said a lot of things one shouldnt simply from a sense that one had to say something such a sense was upsetting it muddled ones wits he had it at present and that was the effect it produced on him if mrs osmond didnt think he spoke as he ought she must set it down to agitation it was no light thing to part with mrs osmond he was really very sorry to be going he had thought of writing to her instead of callingbut he would write to her at any rate to tell her a lot of things that would be sure to occur to him as soon as he had left the house they must think seriously about coming to lockleigh  if there was anything awkward in the conditions of his visit or in the announcement of his departure it failed to come to the surface lord warburton talked about his agitation but he showed it in no other manner and isabel saw that since he had determined on a retreat he was capable of executing it gallantly she was very glad for him she liked him quite well enough to wish him to appear to carry a thing off he would do that on any occasionnot from impudence but simply from the habit of success and isabel felt it out of her husbands power to frustrate this faculty a complex operation as she sat there went on in her mind on one side she listened to their visitor said what was proper to him read more or less between the lines of what he said himself and wondered how he would have spoken if he had found her alone on the other she had a perfect consciousness of osmonds emotion she felt almost sorry for him he was condemned to the sharp pain of loss without the relief of cursing he had had a great hope and now as he saw it vanish into smoke he was obliged to sit and smile and twirl his thumbs not that he troubled himself to smile very brightly he treated their friend on the whole to as vacant a countenance as so clever a man could very well wear it was indeed a part of osmonds cleverness that he could look consummately uncompromised his present appearance however was not a confession of disappointment it was simply a part of osmonds habitual system which was to be inexpressive exactly in proportion as he was really intent he had been intent on this prize from the first but he had never allowed his eagerness to irradiate his refined face he had treated his possible soninlaw as he treated every onewith an air of being interested in him only for his own advantage not for any profit to a person already so generally so perfectly provided as gilbert osmond he would give no sign now of an inward rage which was the result of a vanished prospect of gainnot the faintest nor subtlest isabel could be sure of that if it was any satisfaction to her strangely very strangely it was a satisfaction she wished lord warburton to triumph before her husband and at the same time she wished her husband to be very superior before lord warburton osmond in his way was admirable he had like their visitor the advantage of an acquired habit it was not that of succeeding but it was something almost as goodthat of not attempting as he leaned back in his place listening but vaguely to the others friendly offers and suppressed explanationsas if it were only proper to assume that they were addressed essentially to his wifehe had at least since so little else was left him the comfort of thinking how well he personally had kept out of it and how the air of indifference which he was now able to wear had the added beauty of consistency it was something to be able to look as if the leavetakers movements had no relation to his own mind the latter did well certainly but osmonds performance was in its very nature more finished lord warburtons position was after all an easy one there was no reason in the world why he shouldnt leave rome he had had beneficent inclinations but they had stopped short of fruition he had never committed himself and his honour was safe osmond appeared to take but a moderate interest in the proposal that they should go and stay with him and in his allusion to the success pansy might extract from their visit he murmured a recognition but left isabel to say that it was a matter requiring grave consideration isabel even while she made this remark could see the great vista which had suddenly opened out in her husbands mind with pansys little figure marching up the middle of it  lord warburton had asked leave to bid goodbye to pansy but neither isabel nor osmond had made any motion to send for her he had the air of giving out that his visit must be short he sat on a small chair as if it were only for a moment keeping his hat in his hand but he stayed and stayed isabel wondered what he was waiting for she believed it was not to see pansy she had an impression that on the whole he would rather not see pansy it was of course to see herself alonehe had something to say to her isabel had no great wish to hear it for she was afraid it would be an explanation and she could perfectly dispense with explanations osmond however presently got up like a man of good taste to whom it had occurred that so inveterate a visitor might wish to say just the last word of all to the ladies ive a letter to write before dinner he said you must excuse me ill see if my daughters disengaged and if she is she shall know youre here of course when you come to rome youll always look us up mrs osmond will talk to you about the english expedition she decides all those things  the nod with which instead of a handshake he wound up this little speech was perhaps rather a meagre form of salutation but on the whole it was all the occasion demanded isabel reflected that after he left the room lord warburton would have no pretext for saying your husbands very angry which would have been extremely disagreeable to her nevertheless if he had done so she would have said oh dont be anxious he doesnt hate you its me that he hates  it was only when they had been left alone together that her friend showed a certain vague awkwardnesssitting down in another chair handling two or three of the objects that were near him i hope hell make miss osmond come he presently remarked i want very much to see her  im glad its the last time said isabel  so am i she doesnt care for me  no she doesnt care for you  i dont wonder at it he returned then he added with inconsequence youll come to england wont you  i think we had better not  ah you owe me a visit dont you remember that you were to have come to lockleigh once and you never did  everythings changed since then said isabel  not changed for the worse surelyas far as were concerned to see you under my roofand he hung fire but an instantwould be a great satisfaction  she had feared an explanation but that was the only one that occurred they talked a little of ralph and in another moment pansy came in already dressed for dinner and with a little red spot in either cheek she shook hands with lord warburton and stood looking up into his face with a fixed smilea smile that isabel knew though his lordship probably never suspected it to be near akin to a burst of tears  im going away he said i want to bid you goodbye  goodbye lord warburton her voice perceptibly trembled  and i want to tell you how much i wish you may be very happy  thank you lord warburton pansy answered  he lingered a moment and gave a glance at isabel you ought to be very happyyouve got a guardian angel  im sure i shall be happy said pansy in the tone of a person whose certainties were always cheerful  such a conviction as that will take you a great way but if it should ever fail you rememberremember and her interlocutor stammered a little think of me sometimes you know he said with a vague laugh then he shook hands with isabel in silence and presently he was gone  when he had left the room she expected an effusion of tears from her stepdaughter but pansy in fact treated her to something very different  i think you are my guardian angel she exclaimed very sweetly  isabel shook her head im not an angel of any kind im at the most your good friend  youre a very good friend thento have asked papa to be gentle with me  ive asked your father nothing said isabel wondering  he told me just now to come to the drawingroom and then he gave me a very kind kiss  ah said isabel that was quite his own idea  she recognised the idea perfectly it was very characteristic and she was to see a great deal more of it even with pansy he couldnt put himself the least in the wrong they were dining out that day and after their dinner they went to another entertainment so that it was not till late in the evening that isabel saw him alone when pansy kissed him before going to bed he returned her embrace with even more than his usual munificence and isabel wondered if he meant it as a hint that his daughter had been injured by the machinations of her stepmother it was a partial expression at any rate of what he continued to expect of his wife she was about to follow pansy but he remarked that he wished she would remain he had something to say to her then he walked about the drawingroom a little while she stood waiting in her cloak  i dont understand what you wish to do he said in a moment i should like to knowso that i may know how to act  just now i wish to go to bed im very tired  sit down and rest i shall not keep you long not theretake a comfortable place and he arranged a multitude of cushions that were scattered in picturesque disorder upon a vast divan this was not however where she seated herself she dropped into the nearest chair the fire had gone out the lights in the great room were few she drew her cloak about her she felt mortally cold i think youre trying to humiliate me osmond went on its a most absurd undertaking  i havent the least idea what you mean she returned  youve played a very deep game youve managed it beautifully  what is it that ive managed  youve not quite settled it however we shall see him again and he stopped in front of her with his hands in his pockets looking down at her thoughtfully in his usual way which seemed meant to let her know that she was not an object but only a rather disagreeable incident of thought  if you mean that lord warburtons under an obligation to come back youre wrong isabel said hes under none whatever  thats just what i complain of but when i say hell come back i dont mean hell come from a sense of duty  theres nothing else to make him i think he has quite exhausted rome  ah no thats a shallow judgement romes inexhaustible and osmond began to walk about again however about that perhaps theres no hurry he added its rather a good idea of his that we should go to england if it were not for the fear of finding your cousin there i think i should try to persuade you  it may be that youll not find my cousin said isabel  i should like to be sure of it however i shall be as sure as possible at the same time i should like to see his house that you told me so much about at one time what do you call itgardencourt it must be a charming thing and then you know ive a devotion to the memory of your uncle you made me take a great fancy to him i should like to see where he lived and died that indeed is a detail your friend was right pansy ought to see england  ive no doubt she would enjoy it said isabel  but thats a long time hence next autumns far off osmond continued and meantime there are things that more nearly interest us do you think me so very proud he suddenly asked  i think you very strange  you dont understand me  no not even when you insult me  i dont insult you im incapable of it i merely speak of certain facts and if the allusions an injury to you the faults not mine its surely a fact that you have kept all this matter quite in your own hands  are you going back to lord warburton isabel asked im very tired of his name  you shall hear it again before weve done with it  she had spoken of his insulting her but it suddenly seemed to her that this ceased to be a pain he was going downdown the vision of such a fall made her almost giddy that was the only pain he was too strange too different he didnt touch her still the working of his morbid passion was extraordinary and she felt a rising curiosity to know in what light he saw himself justified i might say to you that i judge youve nothing to say to me thats worth hearing she returned in a moment but i should perhaps be wrong theres a thing that would be worth my hearingto know in the plainest words of what it is you accuse me  of having prevented pansys marriage to warburton are those words plain enough  on the contrary i took a great interest in it i told you so and when you told me that you counted on methat i think was what you saidi accepted the obligation i was a fool to do so but i did it  you pretended to do it and you even pretended reluctance to make me more willing to trust you then you began to use your ingenuity to get him out of the way  i think i see what you mean said isabel  wheres the letter you told me he had written me her husband demanded  i havent the least idea i havent asked him  you stopped it on the way said osmond  isabel slowly got up standing there in her white cloak which covered her to her feet she might have represented the angel of disdain first cousin to that of pity oh gilbert for a man who was so fine she exclaimed in a long murmur  i was never so fine as you youve done everything you wanted youve got him out of the say without appearing to do so and youve placed me in the position in which you wished to see methat of a man who has tried to marry his daughter to a lord but has grotesquely failed  pansy doesnt care for him shes very glad hes gone isabel said  that has nothing to do with the matter  and he doesnt care for pansy  that wont do you told me he did i dont know why you wanted this particular satisfaction osmond continued you might have taken some other it doesnt seem to me that ive been presumptuousthat i have taken too much for granted ive been very modest about it very quiet the idea didnt originate with me he began to show that he liked her before i ever thought of it i left it all to you  yes you were very glad to leave it to me after this you must attend to such things yourself  he looked at her a moment then he turned away i thought you were very fond of my daughter  ive never been more so than today  your affection is attended with immense limitations however that perhaps is natural  is this all you wished to say to me isabel asked taking a candle that stood on one of the tables  are you satisfied am i sufficiently disappointed  i dont think that on the whole youre disappointed youve had another opportunity to try to stupefy me  its not that its proved that pansy can aim high  poor little pansy said isabel as she turned away with her candle    chapter xlvii  it was from henrietta stackpole that she learned how caspar goodwood had come to rome an event that took place three days after lord warburtons departure this latter fact had been preceded by an incident of some importance to isabelthe temporary absence once again of madame merle who had gone to naples to stay with a friend the happy possessor of a villa at posilippo madame merle had ceased to minister to isabels happiness who found herself wondering whether the most discreet of women might not also by chance be the most dangerous sometimes at night she had strange visions she seemed to see her husband and her friendhis friendin dim indistinguishable combination it seemed to her that she had not done with her this lady had something in reserve isabels imagination applied itself actively to this elusive point but every now and then it was checked by a nameless dread so that when the charming woman was away from rome she had almost a consciousness of respite she had already learned from miss stackpole that caspar goodwood was in europe henrietta having written to make it known to her immediately after meeting him in paris he himself never wrote to isabel and though he was in europe she thought it very possible he might not desire to see her their last interview before her marriage had had quite the character of a complete rupture if she remembered rightly he had said he wished to take his last look at her since then he had been the most discordant survival of her earlier timethe only one in fact with which a permanent pain was associated he had left her that morning with a sense of the most superfluous of shocks it was like a collision between vessels in broad daylight there had been no mist no hidden current to excuse it and she herself had only wished to steer wide he had bumped against her prow however while her hand was on the tiller andto complete the metaphorhad given the lighter vessel a strain which still occasionally betrayed itself in a faint creaking it had been horrid to see him because he represented the only serious harm that to her belief she had ever done in the world he was the only person with an unsatisfied claim on her she had made him unhappy she couldnt help it and his unhappiness was a grim reality she had cried with rage after he had left her atshe hardly knew what she tried to think it had been at his want of consideration he had come to her with his unhappiness when her own bliss was so perfect he had done his best to darken the brightness of those pure rays he had not been violent and yet there had been a violence in the impression there had been a violence at any rate in something somewhere perhaps it was only in her own fit of weeping and in that aftersense of the same which had lasted three or four days  the effect of his final appeal had in short faded away and all the first year of her marriage he had dropped out of her books he was a thankless subject of reference it was disagreeable to have to think of a person who was sore and sombre about you and whom you could yet do nothing to relieve it would have been different if she had been able to doubt even a little of his unreconciled state as she doubted of lord warburtons unfortunately it was beyond question and this aggressive uncompromising look of it was just what made it unattractive she could never say to herself that here was a sufferer who had compensations as she was able to say in the case of her english suitor she had no faith in mr goodwoods compensations and no esteem for them a cotton factory was not a compensation for anythingleast of all for having failed to marry isabel archer and yet beyond that she hardly knew what he hadsave of course his intrinsic qualities oh he was intrinsic enough she never thought of his even looking for artificial aids if he extended his businessthat to the best of her belief was the only form exertion could take with himit would be because it was an enterprising thing or good for the business not in the least because he might hope it would overlay the past this gave his figure a kind of bareness and bleakness which made the accident of meeting it in memory or in apprehension a peculiar concussion it was deficient in the social drapery commonly muffling in an overcivilized age the sharpness of human contacts his perfect silence moreover the fact that she never heard from him and very seldom heard any mention of him deepened this impression of his loneliness she asked lily for news of him from time to time but lily knew nothing of bostonher imagination was all bounded on the east by madison avenue as time went on isabel had thought of him oftener and with fewer restrictions she had had more than once the idea of writing to him she had never told her husband about himnever let osmond know of his visits to her in florence a reserve not dictated in the early period by a want of confidence in osmond but simply by the consideration that the young mans disappointment was not her secret but his own it would be wrong of her she had believed to convey it to another and mr goodwoods affairs could have after all little interest for gilbert when it had come to the point she had never written to him it seemed to her that considering his grievance the least she could do was to let him alone nevertheless she would have been glad to be in some way nearer to him it was not that it ever occurred to her that she might have married him even after the consequences of her actual union had grown vivid to her that particular reflection though she indulged in so many had not had the assurance to present itself but on finding herself in trouble he had become a member of that circle of things with which she wished to set herself right i have mentioned how passionately she needed to feel that her unhappiness should not have come to her through her own fault she had no near prospect of dying and yet she wished to make her peace with the worldto put her spiritual affairs in order it came back to her from time to time that there was an account still to be settled with caspar and she saw herself disposed or able to settle it today on terms easier for him than ever before still when she learned he was coming to rome she felt all afraid it would be more disagreeable for him than for any one else to make outsince he would make it out as over a falsified balancesheet or something of that sortthe intimate disarray of her affairs deep in her breast she believed that he had invested his all in her happiness while the others had invested only a part he was one more person from whom she should have to conceal her stress she was reassured however after he arrived in rome for he spent several days without coming to see her  henrietta stackpole it may well be imagined was more punctual and isabel was largely favoured with the society of her friend she threw herself into it for now that she had made such a point of keeping her conscience clear that was one way of proving she had not been superficialthe more so as the years in their flight had rather enriched than blighted those peculiarities which had been humorously criticised by persons less interested than isabel and which were still marked enough to give loyalty a spice of heroism henrietta was as keen and quick and fresh as ever and as neat and bright and fair her remarkably open eyes lighted like great glazed railwaystations had put up no shutters her attire had lost none of its crispness her opinions none of their national reference she was by no means quite unchanged however it struck isabel she had grown vague of old she had never been vague though undertaking many enquiries at once she had managed to be entire and pointed about each she had a reason for everything she did she fairly bristled with motives formerly when she came to europe it was because she wished to see it but now having already seen it she had no such excuse she didnt for a moment pretend that the desire to examine decaying civilisations had anything to do with her present enterprise her journey was rather an expression of her independence of the old world than of a sense of further obligations to it its nothing to come to europe she said to isabel it doesnt seem to me one needs so many reasons for that it is something to stay at home this is much more important it was not therefore with a sense of doing anything very important that she treated herself to another pilgrimage to rome she had seen the place before and carefully inspected it her present act was simply a sign of familiarity of her knowing all about it of her having as good a right as any one else to be there this was all very well and henrietta was restless she had a perfect right to be restless too if one came to that but she had after all a better reason for coming to rome than that she cared for it so little her friend easily recognised it and with it the worth of the others fidelity she had crossed the stormy ocean in midwinter because she had guessed that isabel was sad henrietta guessed a great deal but she had never guessed so happily as that isabels satisfactions just now were few but even if they had been more numerous there would still have been something of individual joy in her sense of being justified in having always thought highly of henrietta she had made large concessions with regard to her and had yet insisted that with all abatements she was very valuable it was not her own triumph however that she found good it was simply the relief of confessing to this confidant the first person to whom she had owned it that she was not in the least at her ease henrietta had herself approached this point with the smallest possible delay and had accused her to her face of being wretched she was a woman she was a sister she was not ralph nor lord warburton nor caspar goodwood and isabel could speak  yes im wretched she said very mildly she hated to hear herself say it she tried to say it as judicially as possible  what does he do to you henrietta asked frowning as if she were enquiring into the operations of a quack doctor  he does nothing but he doesnt like me  hes very hard to please cried miss stackpole why dont you leave him  i cant change that way isabel said  why not i should like to know you wont confess that youve made a mistake youre too proud  i dont know whether im too proud but i cant publish my mistake i dont think thats decent id much rather die  you wont think so always said henrietta  i dont know what great unhappiness might bring me to but it seems to me i shall always be ashamed one must accept ones deeds i married him before all the world i was perfectly free it was impossible to do anything more deliberate one cant change that way isabel repeated  you have changed in spite of the impossibility i hope you dont mean to say you like him  isabel debated no i dont like him i can tell you because im weary of my secret but thats enough i cant announce it on the housetops  henrietta gave a laugh dont you think youre rather too considerate  its not of him that im considerateits of myself isabel answered  it was not surprising gilbert osmond should not have taken comfort in miss stackpole his instinct had naturally set him in opposition to a young lady capable of advising his wife to withdraw from the conjugal roof when she arrived in rome he had said to isabel that he hoped she would leave her friend the interviewer alone and isabel had answered that he at least had nothing to fear from her she said to henrietta that as osmond didnt like her she couldnt invite her to dine but they could easily see each other in other ways isabel received miss stackpole freely in her own sittingroom and took her repeatedly to drive face to face with pansy who bending a little forward on the opposite seat of the carriage gazed at the celebrated authoress with a respectful attention which henrietta occasionally found irritating she complained to isabel that miss osmond had a little look as if she should remember everything one said i dont want to be remembered that way miss stackpole declared i consider that my conversation refers only to the moment like the morning papers your stepdaughter as she sits there looks as if she kept all the back numbers and would bring them out some day against me she could not teach herself to think favourably of pansy whose absence of initiative of conversation of personal claims seemed to her in a girl of twenty unnatural and even uncanny isabel presently saw that osmond would have liked her to urge a little the cause of her friend insist a little upon his receiving her so that he might appear to suffer for good manners sake her immediate acceptance of his objections put him too much in the wrongit being in effect one of the disadvantages of expressing contempt that you cannot enjoy at the same time the credit of expressing sympathy osmond held to his credit and yet he held to his objectionsall of which were elements difficult to reconcile the right thing would have been that miss stackpole should come to dine at palazzo roccanera once or twice so that in spite of his superficial civility always so great she might judge for herself how little pleasure it gave him from the moment however that both the ladies were so unaccommodating there was nothing for osmond but to wish the lady from new york would take herself off it was surprising how little satisfaction he got from his wifes friends he took occasion to call isabels attention to it  youre certainly not fortunate in your intimates i wish you might make a new collection he said to her one morning in reference to nothing visible at the moment but in a tone of ripe reflection which deprived the remark of all brutal abruptness its as if you had taken the trouble to pick out the people in the world that i have least in common with your cousin i have always thought a conceited assbesides his being the most illfavoured animal i know then its insufferably tiresome that one cant tell him so one must spare him on account of his health his health seems to me the best part of him it gives him privileges enjoyed by no one else if hes so desperately ill theres only one way to prove it but he seems to have no mind for that i cant say much more for the great warburton when one really thinks of it the cool insolence of that performance was something rare he comes and looks at ones daughter as if she were a suite of apartments he tries the doorhandles and looks out of the windows raps on the walls and almost thinks hell take the place will you be so good as to draw up a lease then on the whole he decides that the rooms are too small he doesnt think he could live on a third floor he must look out for a piano nobile and he goes away after having got a months lodging in the poor little apartment for nothing miss stackpole however is your most wonderful invention she strikes me as a kind of monster one hasnt a nerve in ones body that she doesnt set quivering you know i never have admitted that shes a woman do you know what she reminds me of of a new steel penthe most odious thing in nature she talks as a steel pen writes arent her letters by the way on ruled paper she thinks and moves and walks and looks exactly as she talks you may say that she doesnt hurt me inasmuch as i dont see her i dont see her but i hear her i hear her all day long her voice is in my ears i cant get rid of it i know exactly what she says and every inflexion of the tone in which she says it she says charming things about me and they give you great comfort i dont like at all to think she talks about mei feel as i should feel if i knew the footman were wearing my hat  henrietta talked about gilbert osmond as his wife assured him rather less than he suspected she had plenty of other subjects in two of which the reader may be supposed to be especially interested she let her friend know that caspar goodwood had discovered for himself that she was unhappy though indeed her ingenuity was unable to suggest what comfort he hoped to give her by coming to rome and yet not calling on her they met him twice in the street but he had no appearance of seeing them they were driving and he had a habit of looking straight in front of him as if he proposed to take in but one object at a time isabel could have fancied she had seen him the day before it must have been with just that face and step that he had walked out of mrs touchetts door at the close of their last interview he was dressed just as he had been dressed on that day isabel remembered the colour of his cravat and yet in spite of this familiar look there was a strangeness in his figure too something that made her feel it afresh to be rather terrible he should have come to rome he looked bigger and more overtopping than of old and in those days he certainly reached high enough she noticed that the people whom he passed looked back after him but he went straight forward lifting above them a face like a february sky  miss stackpoles other topic was very different she gave isabel the latest news about mr bantling he had been out in the united states the year before and she was happy to say she had been able to show him considerable attention she didnt know how much he had enjoyed it but she would undertake to say it had done him good he wasnt the same man when he left as he had been when he came it had opened his eyes and shown him that england wasnt everything he had been very much liked in most places and thought extremely simplemore simple than the english were commonly supposed to be there were people who had thought him affected she didnt know whether they meant that his simplicity was an affectation some of his questions were too discouraging he thought all the chambermaids were farmers daughtersor all the farmers daughters were chambermaidsshe couldnt exactly remember which he hadnt seemed able to grasp the great school system it had been really too much for him on the whole he had behaved as if there were too much of everythingas if he could only take in a small part the part he had chosen was the hotel system and the river navigation he had seemed really fascinated with the hotels he had a photograph of every one he had visited but the river steamers were his principal interest he wanted to do nothing but sail on the big boats they had travelled together from new york to milwaukee stopping at the most interesting cities on the route and whenever they started afresh he had wanted to know if they could go by the steamer he seemed to have no idea of geographyhad an impression that baltimore was a western city and was perpetually expecting to arrive at the mississippi he appeared never to have heard of any river in america but the mississippi and was unprepared to recognise the existence of the hudson though obliged to confess at last that it was fully equal to the rhine they had spent some pleasant hours in the palacecars he was always ordering icecream from the coloured man he could never get used to that ideathat you could get icecream in the cars of course you couldnt nor fans nor candy nor anything in the english cars he found the heat quite overwhelming and she had told him she indeed expected it was the biggest he had ever experienced he was now in england huntinghunting round henrietta called it these amusements were those of the american red men we had left that behind long ago the pleasures of the chase it seemed to be generally believed in england that we wore tomahawks and feathers but such a costume was more in keeping with english habits mr bantling would not have time to join her in italy but when she should go to paris again he expected to come over he wanted very much to see versailles again he was very fond of the ancient regime they didnt agree about that but that was what she liked versailles for that you could see the ancient regime had been swept away there were no dukes and marquises there now she remembered on the contrary one day when there were five american families walking all round mr bantling was very anxious that she should take up the subject of england again and he thought she might get on better with it now england had changed a good deal within two or three years he was determined that if she went there he should go to see his sister lady pensil and that this time the invitation should come to her straight the mystery about that other one had never been explained  caspar goodwood came at last to palazzo roccanera he had written isabel a note beforehand to ask leave this was promptly granted she would be at home at six oclock that afternoon she spent the day wondering what he was coming forwhat good he expected to get of it he had presented himself hitherto as a person destitute of the faculty of compromise who would take what he had asked for or take nothing isabels hospitality however raised no questions and she found no great difficulty in appearing happy enough to deceive him it was her conviction at least that she deceived him made him say to himself that he had been misinformed but she also saw so she believed that he was not disappointed as some other men she was sure would have been he had not come to rome to look for an opportunity she never found out what he had come for he offered her no explanation there could be none but the very simple one that he wanted to see her in other words he had come for his amusement isabel followed up this induction with a good deal of eagerness and was delighted to have found a formula that would lay the ghost of this gentlemans ancient grievance if he had come to rome for his amusement this was exactly what she wanted for if he cared for amusement he had got over his heartache if he had got over his heartache everything was as it should be and her responsibilities were at an end it was true that he took his recreation a little stiffly but he had never been loose and easy and she had every reason to believe he was satisfied with what he saw henrietta was not in his confidence though he was in hers and isabel consequently received no sidelight upon his state of mind he was open to little conversation on general topics it came back to her that she had said of him once years before mr goodwood speaks a good deal but he doesnt talk he spoke a good deal now but he talked perhaps as little as ever considering that is how much there was in rome to talk about his arrival was not calculated to simplify her relations with her husband for if mr osmond didnt like her friends mr goodwood had no claim upon his attention save as having been one of the first of them there was nothing for her to say of him but that he was the very oldest this rather meagre synthesis exhausted the facts she had been obliged to introduce him to gilbert it was impossible she should not ask him to dinner to her thursday evenings of which she had grown very weary but to which her husband still held for the sake not so much of inviting people as of not inviting them  to the thursdays mr goodwood came regularly solemnly rather early he appeared to regard them with a good deal of gravity isabel every now and then had a moment of anger there was something so literal about him she thought he might know that she didnt know what to do with him but she couldnt call him stupid he was not that in the least he was only extraordinarily honest to be as honest as that made a man very different from most people one had to be almost equally honest with him she made this latter reflection at the very time she was flattering herself she had persuaded him that she was the most lighthearted of women he never threw any doubt on this point never asked her any personal questions he got on much better with osmond than had seemed probable osmond had a great dislike to being counted on in such a case he had an irresistible need of disappointing you it was in virtue of this principle that he gave himself the entertainment of taking a fancy to a perpendicular bostonian whom he had been depended upon to treat with coldness he asked isabel if mr goodwood also had wanted to marry her and expressed surprise at her not having accepted him it would have been an excellent thing like living under some tall belfry which would strike all the hours and make a queer vibration in the upper air he declared he liked to talk with the great goodwood it wasnt easy at first you had to climb up an interminable steep staircase up to the top of the tower but when you got there you had a big view and felt a little fresh breeze osmond as we know had delightful qualities and he gave caspar goodwood the benefit of them all isabel could see that mr goodwood thought better of her husband than he had ever wished to he had given her the impression that morning in florence of being inaccessible to a good impression gilbert asked him repeatedly to dinner and mr goodwood smoked a cigar with him afterwards and even desired to be shown his collections gilbert said to isabel that he was very original he was as strong and of as good a style as an english portmanteauhe had plenty of straps and buckles which would never wear out and a capital patent lock caspar goodwood took to riding on the campagna and devoted much time to this exercise it was therefore mainly in the evening that isabel saw him she bethought herself of saying to him one day that if he were willing he could render her a service and then she added smiling  i dont know however what right i have to ask a service of you  youre the person in the world who has most right he answered ive given you assurances that ive never given any one else  the service was that he should go and see her cousin ralph who was ill at the hotel de paris alone and be as kind to him as possible mr goodwood had never seen him but he would know who the poor fellow was if she was not mistaken ralph had once invited him to gardencourt caspar remembered the invitation perfectly and though he was not supposed to be a man of imagination had enough to put himself in the place of a poor gentleman who lay dying at a roman inn he called at the hotel de paris and on being shown into the presence of the master of gardencourt found miss stackpole sitting beside his sofa a singular change had in fact occurred in this ladys relations with ralph touchett she had not been asked by isabel to go and see him but on hearing that he was too ill to come out had immediately gone of her own motion after this she had paid him a daily visitalways under the conviction that they were great enemies oh yes were intimate enemies ralph used to say and he accused her freelyas freely as the humour of it would allowof coming to worry him to death in reality they became excellent friends henrietta much wondering that she should never have liked him before ralph liked her exactly as much as he had always done he had never doubted for a moment that she was an excellent fellow they talked about everything and always differed about everything that is but isabela topic as to which ralph always had a thin forefinger on his lips mr bantling on the other hand proved a great resource ralph was capable of discussing mr bantling with henrietta for hours discussion was stimulated of course by their inevitable difference of viewralph having amused himself with taking the ground that the genial exguardsman was a regular machiavelli caspar goodwood could contribute nothing to such a debate but after he had been left alone with his host he found there were various other matters they could take up it must be admitted that the lady who had just gone out was not one of these caspar granted all miss stackpoles merits in advance but had no further remark to make about her neither after the first allusions did the two men expatiate upon mrs osmonda theme in which goodwood perceived as many dangers as ralph he felt very sorry for that unclassable personage he couldnt bear to see a pleasant man so pleasant for all his queerness so beyond anything to be done there was always something to be done for goodwood and he did it in this case by repeating several times his visit to the hotel de paris it seemed to isabel that she had been very clever she had artfully disposed of the superfluous caspar she had given him an occupation she had converted him into a caretaker of ralph she had a plan of making him travel northward with her cousin as soon as the first mild weather should allow it lord warburton had brought ralph to rome and mr goodwood should take him away there seemed a happy symmetry in this and she was now intensely eager that ralph should depart she had a constant fear he would die there before her eyes and a horror of the occurrence of this event at an inn by her door which he had so rarely entered ralph must sink to his last rest in his own dear house in one of those deep dim chambers of gardencourt where the dark ivy would cluster round the edges of the glimmering window there seemed to isabel in these days something sacred in gardencourt no chapter of the past was more perfectly irrecoverable when she thought of the months she had spent there the tears rose to her eyes she flattered herself as i say upon her ingenuity but she had need of all she could muster for several events occurred which seemed to confront and defy her the countess gemini arrived from florencearrived with her trunks her dresses her chatter her falsehoods her frivolity the strange the unholy legend of the number of her lovers edward rosier who had been away somewhereno one not even pansy knew wherereappeared in rome and began to write her long letters which she never answered madame merle returned from naples and said to her with a strange smile what on earth did you do with lord warburton as if it were any business of hers     chapter xlviii  one day toward the end of february ralph touchett made up his mind to return to england he had his own reasons for this decision which he was not bound to communicate but henrietta stackpole to whom he mentioned his intention flattered herself that she guessed them she forbore to express them however she only said after a moment as she sat by his sofa i suppose you know you cant go alone  ive no idea of doing that ralph answered i shall have people with me  what do you mean by people servants whom you pay  ah said ralph jocosely after all theyre human beings  are there any women among them miss stackpole desired to know  you speak as if i had a dozen no i confess i havent a soubrette in my employment  well said henrietta calmly you cant go to england that way you must have a womans care  ive had so much of yours for the past fortnight that it will last me a good while  youve not had enough of it yet i guess ill go with you said henrietta  go with me ralph slowly raised himself from his sofa  yes i know you dont like me but ill go with you all the same it would be better for your health to lie down again  ralph looked at her a little then he slowly relapsed i like you very much he said in a moment  miss stackpole gave one of her infrequent laughs you neednt think that by saying that you can buy me off ill go with you and what is more ill take care of you  youre a very good woman said ralph  wait till i get you safely home before you say that it wont be easy but you had better go all the same  before she left him ralph said to her do you really mean to take care of me  well i mean to try  i notify you then that i submit oh i submit and it was perhaps a sign of submission that a few minutes after she had left him alone he burst into a loud fit of laughter it seemed to him so inconsequent such a conclusive proof of his having abdicated all functions and renounced all exercise that he should start on a journey across europe under the supervision of miss stackpole and the great oddity was that the prospect pleased him he was gratefully luxuriously passive he felt even impatient to start and indeed he had an immense longing to see his own house again the end of everything was at hand it seemed to him he could stretch out his arm and touch the goal but he wanted to die at home it was the only wish he had leftto extend himself in the large quiet room where he had last seen his father lie and close his eyes upon the summer dawn  that same day caspar goodwood came to see him and he informed his visitor that miss stackpole had taken him up and was to conduct him back to england ah then said caspar im afraid i shall be a fifth wheel to the coach mrs osmond has made me promise to go with you  good heavensits the golden age youre all too kind  the kindness on my part is to her its hardly to you  granting that shes kind smiled ralph  to get people to go with you yes thats a sort of kindness goodwood answered without lending himself to the joke for myself however he added ill go so far as to say that i would much rather travel with you and miss stackpole than with miss stackpole alone  and youd rather stay here than do either said ralph theres really no need of your coming henriettas extraordinarily efficient  im sure of that but ive promised mrs osmond  you can easily get her to let you off  she wouldnt let me off for the world she wants me to look after you but that isnt the principal thing the principal thing is that she wants me to leave rome  ah you see too much in it ralph suggested  i bore her goodwood went on she has nothing to say to me so she invented that  oh then if its a convenience to her i certainly will take you with me though i dont see why it should be a convenience ralph added in a moment  well said caspar goodwood simply she thinks im watching her  watching her  trying to make out if shes happy  thats easy to make out said ralph shes the most visibly happy woman i know  exactly so im satisfied goodwood answered dryly for all his dryness however he had more to say ive been watching her i was an old friend and it seemed to me i had the right she pretends to be happy that was what she undertook to be and i thought i should like to see for myself what it amounts to ive seen he continued with a harsh ring in his voice and i dont want to see any more im now quite ready to go  do you know it strikes me as about time you should ralph rejoined and this was the only conversation these gentlemen had about isabel osmond  henrietta made her preparations for departure and among them she found it proper to say a few words to the countess gemini who returned at miss stackpoles pension the visit which this lady had paid her in florence  you were very wrong about lord warburton she remarked to the countess i think it right you should know that  about his making love to isabel my poor lady he was at her house three times a day he has left traces of his passage the countess cried  he wished to marry your niece thats why he came to the house  the countess stared and then with an inconsiderate laugh is that the story that isabel tells it isnt bad as such things go if he wishes to marry my niece pray why doesnt he do it perhaps he has gone to buy the weddingring and will come back with it next month after im gone  no hell not come back miss osmond doesnt wish to marry him  shes very accommodating i knew she was fond of isabel but i didnt know she carried it so far  i dont understand you said henrietta coldly and reflecting that the countess was unpleasantly perverse i really must stick to my pointthat isabel never encouraged the attentions of lord warburton  my dear friend what do you and i know about it all we know is that my brothers capable of everything  i dont know what your brothers capable of said henrietta with dignity  its not her encouraging warburton that i complain of its her sending him away i want particularly to see him do you suppose she thought i would make him faithless the countess continued with audacious insistence however shes only keeping him one can feel that the house is full of him there hes quite in the air oh yes he has left traces im sure i shall see him yet  well said henrietta after a little with one of those inspirations which had made the fortune of her letters to the interviewer perhaps hell be more successful with you than with isabel  when she told her friend of the offer she had made ralph isabel replied that she could have done nothing that would have pleased her more it had always been her faith that at bottom ralph and this young woman were made to understand each other i dont care whether he understands me or not henrietta declared the great thing is that he shouldnt die in the cars  he wont do that isabel said shaking her head with an extension of faith  he wont if i can help it i see you want us all to go i dont know what you want to do  i want to be alone said isabel  you wont be that so long as youve so much company at home  ah theyre part of the comedy you others are spectators  do you call it a comedy isabel archer henrietta rather grimly asked  the tragedy then if you like youre all looking at me it makes me uncomfortable  henrietta engaged in this act for a while youre like the stricken deer seeking the innermost shade oh you do give me such a sense of helplessness she broke out  im not at all helpless there are many things i mean to do  its not you im speaking of its myself its too much having come on purpose to leave you just as i find you  you dont do that you leave me much refreshed isabel said  very mild refreshmentsour lemonade i want you to promise me something  i cant do that i shall never make another promise i made such a solemn one four years ago and ive succeeded so ill in keeping it  youve had no encouragement in this case i should give you the greatest leave your husband before the worst comes thats what i want you to promise  the worst what do you call the worst  before your character gets spoiled  do you mean my disposition it wont get spoiled isabel answered smiling im taking very good care of it im extremely struck she added turning away with the offhand way in which you speak of a womans leaving her husband its easy to see youve never had one  well said henrietta as if she were beginning an argument nothing is more common in our western cities and its to them after all that we must look in the future her argument however does not concern this history which has too many other threads to unwind she announced to ralph touchett that she was ready to leave rome by any train he might designate and ralph immediately pulled himself together for departure isabel went to see him at the last and he made the same remark that henrietta had made it struck him that isabel was uncommonly glad to get rid of them all  for all answer to this she gently laid her hand on his and said in a low tone with a quick smile my dear ralph  it was answer enough and he was quite contented but he went on in the same way jocosely ingenuously ive seen less of you than i might but its better than nothing and then ive heard a great deal about you  i dont know from whom leading the life youve done  from the voices of the air oh from no one else i never let other people speak of you they always say youre charming and thats so flat  i might have seen more of you certainly isabel said but when ones married one has so much occupation  fortunately im not married when you come to see me in england i shall be able to entertain you with all the freedom of a bachelor he continued to talk as if they should certainly meet again and succeeded in making the assumption appear almost just he made no allusion to his term being near to the probability that he should not outlast the summer if he preferred it so isabel was willing enough the reality was sufficiently distinct without their erecting fingerposts in conversation that had been well enough for the earlier time though about this as about his other affairs ralph had never been egotistic isabel spoke of his journey of the stages into which he should divide it of the precautions he should take henriettas my greatest precaution he went on the conscience of that womans sublime  certainly shell be very conscientious  will be she has been its only because she thinks its her duty that she goes with me theres a conception of duty for you  yes its a generous one said isabel and it makes me deeply ashamed i ought to go with you you know  your husband wouldnt like that  no he wouldnt like it but i might go all the same  im startled by the boldness of your imagination fancy my being a cause of disagreement between a lady and her husband  thats why i dont go said isabel simplyyet not very lucidly  ralph understood well enough however i should think so with all those occupations you speak of  it isnt that im afraid said isabel after a pause she repeated as if to make herself rather than him hear the words im afraid  ralph could hardly tell what her tone meant it was so strangely deliberateapparently so void of emotion did she wish to do public penance for a fault of which she had not been convicted or were her words simply an attempt at enlightened selfanalysis however this might be ralph could not resist so easy an opportunity afraid of your husband  afraid of myself she said getting up she stood there a moment and then added if i were afraid of my husband that would be simply my duty thats what women are expected to be  ah yes laughed ralph but to make up for it theres always some man awfully afraid of some woman  she gave no heed to this pleasantry but suddenly took a different turn with henrietta at the head of your little band she exclaimed abruptly there will be nothing left for mr goodwood  ah my dear isabel ralph answered hes used to that there is nothing left for mr goodwood  she coloured and then observed quickly that she must leave him they stood together a moment both her hands were in both of his youve been my best friend she said  it was for you that i wantedthat i wanted to live but im of no use to you  then it came over her more poignantly that she should not see him again she could not accept that she could not part with him that way if you should send for me id come she said at last  your husband wont consent to that  oh yes i can arrange it  i shall keep that for my last pleasure said ralph  in answer to which she simply kissed him it was a thursday and that evening caspar goodwood came to palazzo roccanera he was among the first to arrive and he spent some time in conversation with gilbert osmond who almost always was present when his wife received they sat down together and osmond talkative communicative expansive seemed possessed with a kind of intellectual gaiety he leaned back with his legs crossed lounging and chatting while goodwood more restless but not at all lively shifted his position played with his hat made the little sofa creak beneath him osmonds face wore a sharp aggressive smile he was as a man whose perceptions have been quickened by good news he remarked to goodwood that he was sorry they were to lose him he himself should particularly miss him he saw so few intelligent menthey were surprisingly scarce in rome he must be sure to come back there was something very refreshing to an inveterate italian like himself in talking with a genuine outsider  im very fond of rome you know osmond said but theres nothing i like better than to meet people who havent that superstition the modern worlds after all very fine now youre thoroughly modern and yet are not at all common so many of the moderns we see are such very poor stuff if theyre the children of the future were willing to die young of course the ancients too are often very tiresome my wife and i like everything thats really newnot the mere pretence of it theres nothing new unfortunately in ignorance and stupidity we see plenty of that in forms that offer themselves as a revelation of progress of light a revelation of vulgarity theres a certain kind of vulgarity which i believe is really new i dont think there ever was anything like it before indeed i dont find vulgarity at all before the present century you see a faint menace of it here and there in the last but today the air has grown so dense that delicate things are literally not recognised now weve liked you with which he hesitated a moment laying his hand gently on goodwoods knee and smiling with a mixture of assurance and embarrassment im going to say something extremely offensive and patronising but you must let me have the satisfaction of it weve liked you becausebecause youve reconciled us a little to the future if there are to be a certain number of people like youa la bonne heure im talking for my wife as well as for myself you see she speaks for me my wife why shouldnt i speak for her were as united you know as the candlestick and the snuffers am i assuming too much when i say that i think ive understood from you that your occupations have beenacommercial theres a danger in that you know but its the way you have escaped that strikes us excuse me if my little compliment seems in execrable taste fortunately my wife doesnt hear me what i mean is that you might have beenawhat i was mentioning just now the whole american world was in a conspiracy to make you so but you resisted youve something about you that saved you and yet youre so modern so modern the most modern man we know we shall always be delighted to see you again  i have said that osmond was in good humour and these remarks will give ample evidence of the fact they were infinitely more personal than he usually cared to be and if caspar goodwood had attended to them more closely he might have thought that the defence of delicacy was in rather odd hands we may believe however that osmond knew very well what he was about and that if he chose to use the tone of patronage with a grossness not in his habits he had an excellent reason for the escapade goodwood had only a vague sense that he was laying it on somehow he scarcely knew where the mixture was applied indeed he scarcely knew what osmond was talking about he wanted to be alone with isabel and that idea spoke louder to him than her husbands perfectlypitched voice he watched her talking with other people and wondered when she would be at liberty and whether he might ask her to go into one of the other rooms his humour was not like osmonds of the best there was an element of dull rage in his consciousness of things up to this time he had not disliked osmond personally he had only thought him very wellinformed and obliging and more than he had supposed like the person whom isabel archer would naturally marry his host had won in the open field a great advantage over him and goodwood had too strong a sense of fair play to have been moved to underrate him on that account he had not tried positively to think well of him this was a flight of sentimental benevolence of which even in the days when he came nearest to reconciling himself to what had happened goodwood was quite incapable he accepted him as rather a brilliant personage of the amateurish kind afflicted with a redundancy of leisure which it amused him to work off in little refinements of conversation but he only half trusted him he could never make out why the deuce osmond should lavish refinements of any sort upon him it made him suspect that he found some private entertainment in it and it ministered to a general impression that his triumphant rival had in his composition a streak of perversity he knew indeed that osmond could have no reason to wish him evil he had nothing to fear from him he had carried off a supreme advantage and could afford to be kind to a man who had lost everything it was true that goodwood had at times grimly wished he were dead and would have liked to kill him but osmond had no means of knowing this for practice had made the younger man perfect in the art of appearing inaccessible today to any violent emotion he cultivated this art in order to deceive himself but it was others that he deceived first he cultivated it moreover with very limited success of which there could be no better proof than the deep dumb irritation that reigned in his soul when he heard osmond speak of his wifes feelings as if he were commissioned to answer for them  that was all he had had an ear for in what his host said to him this evening he had been conscious that osmond made more of a point even than usual of referring to the conjugal harmony prevailing at palazzo roccanera he had been more careful than ever to speak as if he and his wife had all things in sweet community and it were as natural to each of them to say we as to say i in all this there was an air of intention that had puzzled and angered our poor bostonian who could only reflect for his comfort that mrs osmonds relations with her husband were none of his business he had no proof whatever that her husband misrepresented her and if he judged her by the surface of things was bound to believe that she liked her life she had never given him the faintest sign of discontent miss stackpole had told him that she had lost her illusions but writing for the papers had made miss stackpole sensational she was too fond of early news moreover since her arrival in rome she had been much on her guard she had pretty well ceased to flash her lantern at him this indeed it may be said for her would have been quite against her conscience she had now seen the reality of isabels situation and it had inspired her with a just reserve whatever could be done to improve it the most useful form of assistance would not be to inflame her former lovers with a sense of her wrongs miss stackpole continued to take a deep interest in the state of mr goodwoods feelings but she showed it at present only by sending him choice extracts humorous and other from the american journals of which she received several by every post and which she always perused with a pair of scissors in her hand the articles she cut out she placed in an envelope addressed to mr goodwood which she left with her own hand at his hotel he never asked her a question about isabel hadnt he come five thousand miles to see for himself he was thus not in the least authorised to think mrs osmond unhappy but the very absence of authorisation operated as an irritant ministered to the harshness with which in spite of his theory that he had ceased to care he now recognised that so far as she was concerned the future had nothing more for him he had not even the satisfaction of knowing the truth apparently he could not even be trusted to respect her if she were unhappy he was hopeless helpless useless to this last character she had called his attention by her ingenious plan for making him leave rome he had no objection whatever to doing what he could for her cousin but it made him grind his teeth to think that of all the services she might have asked of him this was the one she had been eager to select there had been no danger of her choosing one that would have kept him in rome  tonight what he was chiefly thinking of was that he was to leave her tomorrow and that he had gained nothing by coming but the knowledge that he was as little wanted as ever about herself he had gained no knowledge she was imperturbable inscrutable impenetrable he felt the old bitterness which he had tried so hard to swallow rise again in his throat and he knew there are disappointments that last as long as life osmond went on talking goodwood was vaguely aware that he was touching again upon his perfect intimacy with his wife it seemed to him for a moment that the man had a kind of demonic imagination it was impossible that without malice he should have selected so unusual a topic but what did it matter after all whether he were demonic or not and whether she loved him or hated him she might hate him to the death without ones gaining a straw ones self you travel by the by with ralph touchett osmond said i suppose that means youll move slowly  i dont know i shall do just as he likes  youre very accommodating were immensely obliged to you you must really let me say it my wife has probably expressed to you what we feel touchett has been on our minds all winter it has looked more than once as if he would never leave rome he ought never to have come its worse than an imprudence for people in that state to travel its a kind of indelicacy i wouldnt for the world be under such an obligation to touchett as he has been toto my wife and me other people inevitably have to look after him and every one isnt so generous as you  ive nothing else to do caspar said dryly  osmond looked at him a moment askance you ought to marry and then youd have plenty to do its true that in that case you wouldnt be quite so available for deeds of mercy  do you find that as a married man youre so much occupied the young man mechanically asked  ah you see being marrieds in itself an occupation it isnt always active its often passive but that takes even more attention then my wife and i do so many things together we read we study we make music we walk we drivewe talk even as when we first knew each other i delight to this hour in my wifes conversation if youre ever bored take my advice and get married your wife indeed may bore you in that case but youll never bore yourself youll always have something to say to yourselfalways have a subject of reflection  im not bored said goodwood ive plenty to think about and to say to myself  more than to say to others osmond exclaimed with a light laugh where shall you go next i mean after youve consigned touchett to his natural caretakersi believe his mothers at last coming back to look after him that little ladys superb she neglects her duties with a finish perhaps youll spend the summer in england  i dont know ive no plans  happy man thats a little bleak but its very free  oh yes im very free  free to come back to rome i hope said osmond as he saw a group of new visitors enter the room remember that when you do come we count on you  goodwood had meant to go away early but the evening elapsed without his having a chance to speak to isabel otherwise than as one of several associated interlocutors there was something perverse in the inveteracy with which she avoided him his unquenchable rancour discovered an intention where there was certainly no appearance of one there was absolutely no appearance of one she met his eyes with her clear hospitable smile which seemed almost to ask that he would come and help her to entertain some of her visitors to such suggestions however he opposed but a stiff impatience he wandered about and waited he talked to the few people he knew who found him for the first time rather selfcontradictory this was indeed rare with caspar goodwood though he often contradicted others there was often music at palazzo roccanera and it was usually very good under cover of the music he managed to contain himself but toward the end when he saw the people beginning to go he drew near to isabel and asked her in a low tone if he might not speak to her in one of the other rooms which he had just assured himself was empty she smiled as if she wished to oblige him but found her self absolutely prevented im afraid its impossible people are saying goodnight and i must be where they can see me  i shall wait till they are all gone then  she hesitated a moment ah that will be delightful she exclaimed  and he waited though it took a long time yet there were several people at the end who seemed tethered to the carpet the countess gemini who was never herself till midnight as she said displayed no consciousness that the entertainment was over she had still a little circle of gentlemen in front of the fire who every now and then broke into a united laugh osmond had disappearedhe never bade goodbye to people and as the countess was extending her range according to her custom at this period of the evening isabel had sent pansy to bed isabel sat a little apart she too appeared to wish her sisterinlaw would sound a lower note and let the last loiterers depart in peace  may i not say a word to you now goodwood presently asked her she got up immediately smiling certainly well go somewhere else if you like they went together leaving the countess with her little circle and for a moment after they had crossed the threshold neither of them spoke isabel would not sit down she stood in the middle of the room slowly fanning herself she had for him the same familiar grace she seemed to wait for him to speak now that he was alone with her all the passion he had never stifled surged into his senses it hummed in his eyes and made things swim round him the bright empty room grew dim and blurred and through the heaving veil he felt her hover before him with gleaming eyes and parted lips if he had seen more distinctly he would have perceived her smile was fixed and a trifle forcedthat she was frightened at what she saw in his own face i suppose you wish to bid me goodbye she said  yesbut i dont like it i dont want to leave rome he answered with almost plaintive honesty  i can well imagine its wonderfully good of you i cant tell you how kind i think you  for a moment more he said nothing with a few words like that you make me go  you must come back some day she brightly returned  some day you mean as long a time hence as possible  oh no i dont mean all that  what do you mean i dont understand but i said id go and ill go goodwood added  come back whenever you like said isabel with attempted lightness  i dont care a straw for your cousin caspar broke out  is that what you wished to tell me  no no i didnt want to tell you anything i wanted to ask you he paused a moment and thenwhat have you really made of your life he said in a low quick tone he paused again as if for an answer but she said nothing and he went on i cant understand i cant penetrate you what am i to believewhat do you want me to think still she said nothing she only stood looking at him now quite without pretending to ease im told youre unhappy and if you are i should like to know it that would be something for me but you yourself say youre happy and youre somehow so still so smooth so hard youre completely changed you conceal everything i havent really come near you  you come very near isabel said gently but in a tone of warning  and yet i dont touch you i want to know the truth have you done well  you ask a great deal  yesive always asked a great deal of course you wont tell me i shall never know if you can help it and then its none of my business he had spoken with a visible effort to control himself to give a considerate form to an inconsiderate state of mind but the sense that it was his last chance that he loved her and had lost her that she would think him a fool whatever he should say suddenly gave him a lash and added a deep vibration to his low voice youre perfectly inscrutable and thats what makes me think youve something to hide i tell you i dont care a straw for your cousin but i dont mean that i dont like him i mean that it isnt because i like him that i go away with him id go if he were an idiot and you should have asked me if you should ask me id go to siberia tomorrow why do you want me to leave the place you must have some reason for that if you were as contented as you pretend you are you wouldnt care id rather know the truth about you even if its damnable than have come here for nothing that isnt what i came for i thought i shouldnt care i came because i wanted to assure myself that i neednt think of you any more i havent thought of anything else and youre quite right to wish me to go away but if i must go theres no harm in my letting myself out for a single moment is there if youre really hurtif he hurts younothing i say will hurt you when i tell you i love you its simply what i came for i thought it was for something else but it was for that i shouldnt say it if i didnt believe i should never see you again its the last timelet me pluck a single flower ive no right to say that i know and youve no right to listen but you dont listen you never listen youre always thinking of something else after this i must go of course so i shall at least have a reason your asking me is no reason not a real one i cant judge by your husband he went on irrelevantly almost incoherently i dont understand him he tells me you adore each other why does he tell me that what business is it of mine when i say that to you you look strange but you always look strange yes youve something to hide its none of my businessvery true but i love you said caspar goodwood  as he said she looked strange she turned her eyes to the door by which they had entered and raised her fan as if in warning  youve behaved so well dont spoil it she uttered softly  no one hears me its wonderful what you tried to put me off with i love you as ive never loved you  i know it i knew it as soon as you consented to go  you cant help itof course not you would if you could but you cant unfortunately unfortunately for me i mean i ask nothingnothing that is i shouldnt but i do ask one sole satisfactionthat you tell methat you tell me  that i tell you what  whether i may pity you  should you like that isabel asked trying to smile again  to pity you most assuredly that at least would be doing something id give my life to it  she raised her fan to her face which it covered all except her eyes they rested a moment on his dont give your life to it but give a thought to it every now and then and with that she went back to the countess gemini    chapter xlix  madame merle had not made her appearance at palazzo roccanera on the evening of that thursday of which i have narrated some of the incidents and isabel though she observed her absence was not surprised by it things had passed between them which added no stimulus to sociability and to appreciate which we must glance a little backward it has been mentioned that madame merle returned from naples shortly after lord warburton had left rome and that on her first meeting with isabel whom to do her justice she came immediately to see her first utterance had been an enquiry as to the whereabouts of this nobleman for whom she appeared to hold her dear friend accountable  please dont talk of him said isabel for answer weve heard so much of him of late  madame merle bent her head on one side a little protestingly and smiled at the left corner of her mouth youve heard yes but you must remember that ive not in naples i hoped to find him here and to be able to congratulate pansy  you may congratulate pansy still but not on marrying lord warburton  how you say that dont you know i had set my heart on it madame merle asked with a great deal of spirit but still with the intonation of goodhumour  isabel was discomposed but she was determined to be goodhumoured too you shouldnt have gone to naples then you should have stayed here to watch the affair  i had too much confidence in you but do you think its too late  you had better ask pansy said isabel  i shall ask her what youve said to her  these words seemed to justify the impulse of selfdefence aroused on isabels part by her perceiving that her visitors attitude was a critical one madame merle as we know had been very discreet hitherto she had never criticised she had been markedly afraid of intermeddling but apparently she had only reserved herself for this occasion since she now had a dangerous quickness in her eye and an air of irritation which even her admirable ease was not able to transmute she had suffered a disappointment which excited isabels surpriseour heroine having no knowledge of her zealous interest in pansys marriage and she betrayed it in a manner which quickened mrs osmonds alarm more clearly than ever before isabel heard a cold mocking voice proceed from she knew not where in the dim void that surrounded her and declare that this bright strong definite worldly woman this incarnation of the practical the personal the immediate was a powerful agent in her destiny she was nearer to her than isabel had yet discovered and her nearness was not the charming accident she had so long supposed the sense of accident indeed had died within her that day when she happened to be struck with the manner in which the wonderful lady and her own husband sat together in private no definite suspicion had as yet taken its place but it was enough to make her view this friend with a different eye to have been led to reflect that there was more intention in her past behaviour than she had allowed for at the time ah yes there had been intention there had been intention isabel said to herself and she seemed to wake from a long pernicious dream what was it that brought home to her that madame merles intention had not been good nothing but the mistrust which had lately taken body and which married itself now to the fruitful wonder produced by her visitors challenge on behalf of poor pansy there was something in this challenge which had at the very outset excited an answering defiance a nameless vitality which she could see to have been absent from her friends professions of delicacy and caution madame merle had been unwilling to interfere certainly but only so long as there was nothing to interfere with it will perhaps seem to the reader that isabel went fast in casting doubt on mere suspicion on a sincerity proved by several years of good offices she moved quickly indeed and with reason for a strange truth was filtering into her soul madame merles interest was identical with osmonds that was enough i think pansy will tell you nothing that will make you more angry she said in answer to her companions last remark  im not in the least angry ive only a great desire to retrieve the situation do you consider that warburton has left us for ever  i cant tell you i dont understand you its all over please let it rest osmond has talked to me a great deal about it and ive nothing more to say or to hear ive no doubt isabel added that hell be very happy to discuss the subject with you  i know what he thinks he came to see me last evening  as soon as you had arrived then you know all about it and you neednt apply to me for information  it isnt information i want at bottom its sympathy i had set my heart on that marriage the idea did what so few things doit satisfied the imagination  your imagination yes but not that of the persons concerned  you mean by that of course that im not concerned of course not directly but when ones such an old friend one cant help having something at stake you forget how long ive known pansy you mean of course madame merle added that you are one of the persons concerned  no thats the last thing i mean im very weary of it all  madame merle hesitated a little ah yes your works done  take care what you say said isabel very gravely  oh i take care never perhaps more than when it appears least your husband judges you severely  isabel made for a moment no answer to this she felt choked with bitterness it was not the insolence of madame merles informing her that osmond had been taking her into his confidence as against his wife that struck her most for she was not quick to believe that this was meant for insolence madame merle was very rarely insolent and only when it was exactly right it was not right now or at least it was not right yet what touched isabel like a drop of corrosive acid upon an open wound was the knowledge that osmond dishonoured her in his words as well as in his thoughts should you like to know how i judge him she asked at last  no because youd never tell me and it would be painful for me to know  there was a pause and for the first time since she had known her isabel thought madame merle disagreeable she wished she would leave her remember how attractive pansy is and dont despair she said abruptly with a desire that this should close their interview  but madame merles expansive presence underwent no contraction she only gathered her mantle about her and with the movement scattered upon the air a faint agreeable fragrance i dont despair i feel encouraged and i didnt come to scold you i came if possible to learn the truth i know youll tell it if i ask you its an immense blessing with you that one can count upon that no you wont believe what a comfort i take in it  what truth do you speak of isabel asked wondering  just this whether lord warburton changed his mind quite of his own movement or because you recommended it to please himself i mean or to please you think of the confidence i must still have in you in spite of having lost a little of it madame merle continued with a smile to ask such a question as that she sat looking at her friend to judge the effect of her words and then went on now dont be heroic dont be unreasonable dont take offence it seems to me i do you an honour in speaking so i dont know another woman to whom i would do it i havent the least idea that any other woman would tell me the truth and dont you see how well it is that your husband should know it its true that he doesnt appear to have had any tact whatever in trying to extract it he has indulged in gratuitous suppositions but that doesnt alter the fact that it would make a difference in his view of his daughters prospects to know distinctly what really occurred if lord warburton simply got tired of the poor child thats one thing and its a pity if he gave her up to please you its another thats a pity too but in a different way then in the latter case youd perhaps resign yourself to not being pleasedto simply seeing your stepdaughter married let him offlet us have him  madame merle had proceeded very deliberately watching her companion and apparently thinking she could proceed safely as she went on isabel grew pale she clasped her hands more tightly in her lap it was not that her visitor had at last thought it the right time to be insolent for this was not what was most apparent it was a worse horror than that who are youwhat are you isabel murmured what have you to do with my husband it was strange that for the moment she drew as near to him as if she had loved him  ah then you take it heroically im very sorry dont think however that i shall do so  what have you to do with me isabel went on  madame merle slowly got up stroking her muff but not removing her eyes from isabels face everything she answered  isabel sat there looking up at her without rising her face was almost a prayer to be enlightened but the light of this womans eyes seemed only a darkness oh misery she murmured at last and she fell back covering her face with her hands it had come over her like a highsurging wave that mrs touchett was right madame merle had married her before she uncovered her face again that lady had left the room  isabel took a drive alone that afternoon she wished to be far away under the sky where she could descend from her carriage and tread upon the daisies she had long before this taken old rome into her confidence for in a world of ruins the ruin of her happiness seemed a less unnatural catastrophe she rested her weariness upon things that had crumbled for centuries and yet still were upright she dropped her secret sadness into the silence of lonely places where its very modern quality detached itself and grew objective so that as she sat in a sunwarmed angle on a winters day or stood in a mouldy church to which no one came she could almost smile at it and think of its smallness small it was in the large roman record and her haunting sense of the continuity of the human lot easily carried her from the less to the greater she had become deeply tenderly acquainted with rome it interfused and moderated her passion but she had grown to think of it chiefly as the place where people had suffered this was what came to her in the starved churches where the marble columns transferred from pagan ruins seemed to offer her a companionship in endurance and the musty incense to be a compound of longunanswered prayers there was no gentler nor less consistent heretic than isabel the firmest of worshippers gazing at dark altarpictures or clustered candles could not have felt more intimately the suggestiveness of these objects nor have been more liable at such moments to a spiritual visitation pansy as we know was almost always her companion and of late the countess gemini balancing a pink parasol had lent brilliancy to their equipage but she still occasionally found herself alone when it suited her mood and where it suited the place on such occasions she had several resorts the most accessible of which perhaps was a seat on the low parapet which edges the wide grassy space before the high cold front of saint john lateran whence you look across the campagna at the fartrailing outline of the alban mount and at that mighty plain between which is still so full of all that has passed from it after the departure of her cousin and his companions she roamed more than usual she carried her sombre spirit from one familiar shrine to the other even when pansy and the countess were with her she felt the touch of a vanished world the carriage leaving the walls of rome behind rolled through narrow lanes where the wild honeysuckle had begun to tangle itself in the hedges or waited for her in quiet places where the fields lay near while she strolled further and further over the flowerfreckled turf or sat on a stone that had once had a use and gazed through the veil of her personal sadness at the splendid sadness of the sceneat the dense warm light the far gradations and soft confusions of colour the motionless shepherds in lonely attitudes the hills where the cloudshadows had the lightness of a blush  on the afternoon i began with speaking of she had taken a resolution not to think of madame merle but the resolution proved vain and this ladys image hovered constantly before her she asked herself with an almost childlike horror of the supposition whether to this intimate friend of several years the great historical epithet of wicked were to be applied she knew the idea only by the bible and other literary works to the best of her belief she had had no personal acquaintance with wickedness she had desired a large acquaintance with human life and in spite of her having flattered herself that she cultivated it with some success this elementary privilege had been denied her perhaps it was not wickedin the historic senseto be even deeply false for that was what madame merle had beendeeply deeply deeply isabels aunt lydia had made this discovery long before and had mentioned it to her niece but isabel had flattered herself at this time that she had a much richer view of things especially of the spontaneity of her own career and the nobleness of her own interpretations than poor stifflyreasoning mrs touchett madame merle had done what she wanted she had brought about the union of her two friends a reflection which could not fail to make it a matter of wonder that she should so much have desired such an event there were people who had the matchmaking passion like the votaries of art for art but madame merle great artist as she was was scarcely one of these she thought too ill of marriage too ill even of life she had desired that particular marriage but had not desired others she had therefore had a conception of gain and isabel asked herself where she had found her profit it took her naturally a long time to discover and even then her discovery was imperfect it came back to her that madame merle though she had seemed to like her from their first meeting at gardencourt had been doubly affectionate after mr touchetts death and after learning that her young friend had been subject to the good old mans charity she had found her profit not in the gross device of borrowing money but in the more refined idea of introducing one of her intimates to the young womans fresh and ingenuous fortune she had naturally chosen her closest intimate and it was already vivid enough to isabel that gilbert occupied this position she found herself confronted in this manner with the conviction that the man in the world whom she had supposed to be the least sordid had married her like a vulgar adventurer for her money strange to say it had never before occurred to her if she had thought a good deal of harm of osmond she had not done him this particular injury this was the worst she could think of and she had been saying to herself that the worst was still to come a man might marry a woman for her money perfectly well the thing was often done but at least he should let her know she wondered whether since he had wanted her money her money would now satisfy him would he take her money and let her go ah if mr touchetts great charity would but help her today it would be blessed indeed it was not slow to occur to her that if madame merle had wished to do gilbert a service his recognition to her of the boon must have lost its warmth what must be his feelings today in regard to his too zealous benefactress and what expression must they have found on the part of such a master of irony it is a singular but a characteristic fact that before isabel returned from her silent drive she had broken its silence by the soft exclamation poor poor madame merle  her compassion would perhaps have been justified if on this same afternoon she had been concealed behind one of the valuable curtains of timesoftened damask which dressed the interesting little salon of the lady to whom it referred the carefullyarranged apartment to which we once paid a visit in company with the discreet mr rosier in that apartment towards six oclock gilbert osmond was seated and his hostess stood before him as isabel had seen her stand on an occasion commemorated in this history with an emphasis appropriate not so much to its apparent as to its real importance  i dont believe youre unhappy i believe you like it said madame merle  did i say i was unhappy osmond asked with a face grave enough to suggest that he might have been  no but you dont say the contrary as you ought in common gratitude  dont talk about gratitude he returned dryly and dont aggravate me he added in a moment  madame merle slowly seated herself with her arms folded and her white hands arranged as a support to one of them and an ornament as it were to the other she looked exquisitely calm but impressively sad on your side dont try to frighten me i wonder if you guess some of my thoughts  i trouble about them no more than i can help ive quite enough of my own  thats because theyre so delightful  osmond rested his head against the back of his chair and looked at his companion with a cynical directness which seemed also partly an expression of fatigue you do aggravate me he remarked in a moment im very tired  eh moi donc cried madame merle  with you its because you fatigue yourself with me its not my own fault  when i fatigue myself its for you ive given you an interest thats a great gift  do you call it an interest osmond enquired with detachment  certainly since it helps you to pass your time  the time has never seemed longer to me than this winter  youve never looked better youve never been so agreeable so brilliant  damn my brilliancy he thoughtfully murmured how little after all you know me  if i dont know you i know nothing smiled madame merle youve the feeling of complete success  no i shall not have that till ive made you stop judging me  i did that long ago i speak from old knowledge but you express yourself more too  osmond just hung fire i wish youd express yourself less  you wish to condemn me to silence remember that ive never been a chatterbox at any rate there are three or four things i should like to say to you first your wife doesnt know what to do with herself she went on with a change of tone  pardon me she knows perfectly she has a line sharply drawn she means to carry out her ideas  her ideas today must be remarkable  certainly they are she has more of them than ever  she was unable to show me any this morning said madame merle she seemed in a very simple almost in a stupid state of mind she was completely bewildered  you had better say at once that she was pathetic  ah no i dont want to encourage you too much  he still had his head against the cushion behind him the ankle of one foot rested on the other knee so he sat for a while i should like to know whats the matter with you he said at last  the matterthe matter and here madame merle stopped then she went on with a sudden outbreak of passion a burst of summer thunder in a clear sky the matter is that i would give my right hand to be able to weep and that i cant  what good would it do you to weep  it would make me feel as i felt before i knew you  if ive dried your tears thats something but ive seen you shed them  oh i believe youll make me cry still i mean make me howl like a wolf ive a great hope ive a great need of that i was vile this morning i was horrid she said  if isabel was in the stupid state of mind you mention she probably didnt perceive it osmond answered  it was precisely my deviltry that stupefied her i couldnt help it i was full of something bad perhaps it was something good i dont know youve not only dried up my tears youve dried up my soul  its not i then that am responsible for my wifes condition osmond said its pleasant to think that i shall get the benefit of your influence upon her dont you know the soul is an immortal principle how can it suffer alteration  i dont believe at all that its an immortal principle i believe it can perfectly be destroyed thats what has happened to mine which was a very good one to start with and its you i have to thank for it youre very bad she added with gravity in her emphasis  is this the way were to end osmond asked with the same studied coldness  i dont know how were to end i wish i didhow do bad people endespecially as to their common crimes you have made me as bad as yourself  i dont understand you you seem to me quite good enough said osmond his conscious indifference giving an extreme effect to the words  madame merles selfpossession tended on the contrary to diminish and she was nearer losing it than on any occasion on which we have had the pleasure of meeting her the glow of her eye turners sombre her smile betrayed a painful effort good enough for anything that ive done with myself i suppose thats what you mean  good enough to be always charming osmond exclaimed smiling too  oh god his companion murmured and sitting there in her ripe freshness she had recourse to the same gesture she had provoked on isabels part in the morning she bent her face and covered it with her hands  are you going to weep after all osmond asked and on her remaining motionless he went on have i ever complained to you  she dropped her hands quickly no youve taken your revenge otherwiseyou have taken it on her  osmond threw back his head further he looked a while at the ceiling and might have been supposed to be appealing in an informal way to the heavenly powers oh the imagination of women its always vulgar at bottom you talk of revenge like a thirdrate novelist  of course you havent complained youve enjoyed your triumph too much  im rather curious to know what you call my triumph  youve made your wife afraid of you  osmond changed his position he leaned forward resting his elbows on his knees and looking a while at a beautiful old persian rug at his feet he had an air of refusing to accept any ones valuation of anything even of time and of preferring to abide by his own a peculiarity which made him at moments an irritating person to converse with isabels not afraid of me and its not what i wish he said at last to what do you want to provoke me when you say such things as that  ive thought over all the harm you can do me madame merle answered your wife was afraid of me this morning but in me it was really you she feared  you may have said things that were in very bad taste im not responsible for that i didnt see the use of your going to see her at all youre capable of acting without her ive not made you afraid of me that i can see he went on how then should i have made her youre at least as brave i cant think where youve picked up such rubbish one might suppose you knew me by this time he got up as he spoke and walked to the chimney where he stood a moment bending his eye as if he had seen them for the first time on the delicate specimens of rare porcelain with which it was covered he took up a small cup and held it in his hand then still holding it and leaning his arm on the mantel he pursued you always see too much in everything you overdo it you lose sight of the real im much simpler than you think  i think youre very simple and madame merle kept her eye on her cup ive come to that with time i judged you as i say of old but its only since your marriage that ive understood you ive seen better what you have been to your wife than i ever saw what you were for me please be very careful of that precious object  it already has a wee bit of a tiny crack said osmond dryly as he put it down if you didnt understand me before i married it was cruelly rash of you to put me into such a box however i took a fancy to my box myself i thought it would be a comfortable fit i asked very little i only asked that she should like me  that she should like you so much  so much of course in such a case one asks the maximum that she should adore me if you will oh yes i wanted that  i never adored you said madame merle  ah but you pretended to  its true that you never accused me of being a comfortable fit madame merle went on  my wife has declineddeclined to do anything of the sort said osmond if youre determined to make a tragedy of that the tragedys hardly for her  the tragedys for me madame merle exclaimed rising with a long low sigh but having a glance at the same time for the contents of her mantelshelf  it appears that im to be severely taught the disadvantages of a false position  you express yourself like a sentence in a copybook we must look for our comfort where we can find it if my wife doesnt like me at least my child does i shall look for compensations in pansy fortunately i havent a fault to find with her  ah she said softly if i had a child  osmond waited and then with a little formal air the children of others may be a great interest he announced  youre more like a copybook than i theres something after all that holds us together  is it the idea of the harm i may do you osmond asked  no its the idea of the good i may do for you its that madame merle pursued that made me so jealous of isabel i want it to be my work she added with her face which had grown hard and bitter relaxing to its habit of smoothness  her friend took up his hat and his umbrella and after giving the former article two or three strokes with his coatcuff on the whole i think he said you had better leave it to me  after he had left her she went the first thing and lifted from the mantelshelf the attenuated coffeecup in which he had mentioned the existence of a crack but she looked at it rather abstractedly have i been so vile all for nothing she vaguely wailed    chapter l  as the countess gemini was not acquainted with the ancient monuments isabel occasionally offered to introduce her to these interesting relics and to give their afternoon drive an antiquarian aim the countess who professed to think her sisterinlaw a prodigy of learning never made an objection and gazed at masses of roman brickwork as patiently as if they had been mounds of modern drapery she had not the historic sense though she had in some directions the anecdotic and as regards herself the apologetic but she was so delighted to be in rome that she only desired to float with the current she would gladly have passed an hour every day in the damp darkness of the baths of titus if it had been a condition of her remaining at palazzo roccanera isabel however was not a severe cicerone she used to visit the ruins chiefly because they offered an excuse for talking about other matters than the love affairs of the ladies of florence as to which her companion was never weary of offering information it must be added that during these visits the countess forbade herself every form of active research her preference was to sit in the carriage and exclaim that everything was most interesting it was in this manner that she had hitherto examined the coliseum to the infinite regret of her niece whowith all the respect that she owed hercould not see why she should not descend from the vehicle and enter the building pansy had so little chance to ramble that her view of the case was not wholly disinterested it may be divined that she had a secret hope that once inside her parents guest might be induced to climb to the upper tiers there came a day when the countess announced her willingness to undertake this feata mild afternoon in march when the windy month expressed itself in occasional puffs of spring the three ladies went into the coliseum together but isabel left her companions to wander over the place she had often ascended to those desolate ledges from which the roman crowd used to bellow applause and where now the wild flowers when they are allowed bloom in the deep crevices and today she felt weary and disposed to sit in the despoiled arena it made an intermission too for the countess often asked more from ones attention than she gave in return and isabel believed that when she was alone with her niece she let the dust gather for a moment on the ancient scandals of the arnide she so remained below therefore while pansy guided her undiscriminating aunt to the steep brick staircase at the foot of which the custodian unlocks the tall wooden gate the great enclosure was half in shadow the western sun brought out the pale red tone of the great blocks of travertinethe latent colour that is the only living element in the immense ruin here and there wandered a peasant or a tourist looking up at the far skyline where in the clear stillness a multitude of swallows kept circling and plunging isabel presently became aware that one of the other visitors planted in the middle of the arena had turned his attention to her own person and was looking at her with a certain little poise of the head which she had some weeks before perceived to be characteristic of baffled but indestructible purpose such an attitude today could belong only to mr edward rosier and this gentleman proved in fact to have been considering the question of speaking to her when he had assured himself that she was unaccompanied he drew near remarking that though she would not answer his letters she would perhaps not wholly close her ears to his spoken eloquence she replied that her stepdaughter was close at hand and that she could only give him five minutes whereupon he took out his watch and sat down upon a broken block  its very soon told said edward rosier ive sold all my bibelots isabel gave instinctively an exclamation of horror it was as if he had told her he had had all his teeth drawn ive sold them by auction at the hotel drouot he went on the sale took place three days ago and theyve telegraphed me the result its magnificent  im glad to hear it but i wish you had kept your pretty things  i have the money insteadfifty thousand dollars will mr osmond think me rich enough now  is it for that you did it isabel asked gently  for what else in the world could it be thats the only thing i think of i went to paris and made my arrangements i couldnt stop for the sale i couldnt have seen them going off i think it would have killed me but i put them into good hands and they brought high prices i should tell you i have kept my enamels now i have the money in my pocket and he cant say im poor the young man exclaimed defiantly  hell say now that youre not wise said isabel as if gilbert osmond had never said this before  rosier gave her a sharp look do you mean that without my bibelots im nothing do you mean they were the best thing about me thats what they told me in paris oh they were very frank about it but they hadnt seen her  my dear friend you deserve to succeed said isabel very kindly  you say that so sadly that its the same as if you said i shouldnt and he questioned her eyes with the clear trepidation of his own he had the air of a man who knows he has been the talk of paris for a week and is full half a head taller in consequence but who also has a painful suspicion that in spite of this increase of stature one or two persons still have the perversity to think him diminutive i know what happened here while i was away he went on what does mr osmond expect after she has refused lord warburton  isabel debated that shell marry another nobleman  what other nobleman  one that hell pick out  rosier slowly got up putting his watch into his waistcoatpocket youre laughing at some one but this time i dont think its at me  i didnt mean to laugh said isabel i laugh very seldom now you had better go away  i feel very safe rosier declared without moving this might be but it evidently made him feel more so to make the announcement in rather a loud voice balancing himself a little complacently on his toes and looking all round the coliseum as if it were filled with an audience suddenly isabel saw him change colour there was more of an audience than he had suspected she turned and perceived that her two companions had returned from their excursion you must really go away she said quickly ah my dear lady pity me edward rosier murmured in a voice strangely at variance with the announcement i have just quoted and then he added eagerly like a man who in the midst of his misery is seized by a happy thought is that lady the countess gemini ive a great desire to be presented to her  isabel looked at him a moment she has no influence with her brother  ah what a monster you make him out and rosier faced the countess who advanced in front of pansy with an animation partly due perhaps to the fact that she perceived her sisterinlaw to be engaged in conversation with a very pretty young man  im glad youve kept your enamels isabel called as she left him she went straight to pansy who on seeing edward rosier had stopped short with lowered eyes well go back to the carriage she said gently  yes its getting late pansy returned more gently still and she went on without a murmur without faltering or glancing back isabel however allowing herself this last liberty saw that a meeting had immediately taken place between the countess and mr rosier he had removed his hat and was bowing and smiling he had evidently introduced himself while the countesss expressive back displayed to isabels eye a gracious inclination these facts none the less were presently lost to sight for isabel and pansy took their places again in the carriage pansy who faced her stepmother at first kept her eyes fixed on her lap then she raised them and rested them on isabels there shone out of each of them a little melancholy raya spark of timid passion which touched isabel to the heart at the same time a wave of envy passed over her soul as she compared the tremulous longing the definite ideal of the child with her own dry despair poor little pansy she affectionately said  oh never mind pansy answered in the tone of eager apology and then there was a silence the countess was a long time coming did you show your aunt everything and did she enjoy it isabel asked at last  yes i showed her everything i think she was very much pleased  and youre not tired i hope  oh no thank you im not tired  the countess still remained behind so that isabel requested the footman to go into the coliseum and tell her they were waiting he presently returned with the announcement that the signora contessa begged them not to waitshe would come home in a cab  about a week after this ladys quick sympathies had enlisted themselves with mr rosier isabel going rather late to dress for dinner found pansy sitting in her room the girl seemed to have been awaiting her she got up from her low chair pardon my taking the liberty she said in a small voice it will be the lastfor some time  her voice was strange and her eyes widely opened had an excited frightened look youre not going away isabel exclaimed  im going to the convent  to the convent  pansy drew nearer till she was near enough to put her arms round isabel and rest her head on her shoulder she stood this way a moment perfectly still but her companion could feel her tremble the quiver of her little body expressed everything she was unable to say isabel nevertheless pressed her why are you going to the convent  because papa thinks it best he says a young girls better every now and then for making a little retreat he says the world always the world is very bad for a young girl this is just a chance for a little seclusiona little reflexion pansy spoke in short detached sentences as if she could scarce trust herself and then she added with a triumph of selfcontrol i think papas right ive been so much in the world this winter  her announcement had a strange effect on isabel it seemed to carry a larger meaning than the girl herself knew when was this decided she asked ive heard nothing of it  papa told me half an hour ago he thought it better it shouldnt be too much talked about in advance madame catherines to come for me at a quarter past seven and im only to take two frocks its only for a few weeks im sure it will be very good i shall find all those ladies who used to be so kind to me and i shall see the little girls who are being educated im very fond of little girls said pansy with an effect of diminutive grandeur and im also very fond of mother catherine i shall be very quiet and think a great deal  isabel listened to her holding her breath she was almost awestruck think of me sometimes  ah come and see me soon cried pansy and the cry was very different from the heroic remarks of which she had just delivered herself  isabel could say nothing more she understood nothing she only felt how little she yet knew her husband her answer to his daughter was a long tender kiss  half an hour later she learned from her maid that madame catherine had arrived in a cab and had departed again with the signorina on going to the drawingroom before dinner she found the countess gemini alone and this lady characterised the incident by exclaiming with a wonderful toss of the head en voila ma chere une pose but if it was an affectation she was at a loss to see what her husband affected she could only dimly perceive that he had more traditions than she supposed it had become her habit to be so careful as to what she said to him that strange as it may appear she hesitated for several minutes after he had come in to allude to his daughters sudden departure she spoke of it only after they were seated at table but she had forbidden herself ever to ask osmond a question all she could do was to make a declaration and there was one that came very naturally i shall miss pansy very much  he looked a while with his head inclined a little at the basket of flowers in the middle of the table ah yes he said at last i had thought of that you must go and see her you know but not too often i dare say you wonder why i sent her to the good sisters but i doubt if i can make you understand it doesnt matter dont trouble yourself about it thats why i had not spoken of it i didnt believe you would enter into it but ive always had the idea ive always thought it a part of the education of ones daughter ones daughter should be fresh and fair she should be innocent and gentle with the manners of the present time she is liable to become so dusty and crumpled pansys a little dusty a little dishevelled she has knocked about too much this bustling pushing rabble that calls itself societyone should take her out of it occasionally convents are very quiet very convenient very salutary i like to think of her there in the old garden under the arcade among those tranquil virtuous women many of them are gentlewomen born several of them are noble she will have her books and her drawing she will have her piano ive made the most liberal arrangements there is to be nothing ascetic theres just to be a certain little sense of sequestration shell have time to think and theres something i want her to think about osmond spoke deliberately reasonably still with his head on one side as if he were looking at the basket of flowers his tone however was that of a man not so much offering an explanation as putting a thing into wordsalmost into picturesto see himself how it would look he considered a while the picture he had evoked and seemed greatly pleased with it and then he went on the catholics are very wise after all the convent is a great institution we cant do without it it corresponds to an essential need in families in society its a school of good manners its a school of repose oh i dont want to detach my daughter from the world he added i dont want to make her fix her thoughts on any other this ones very well as she should take it and she may think of it as much as she likes only she must think of it in the right way  isabel gave an extreme attention to this little sketch she found it indeed intensely interesting it seemed to show her how far her husbands desire to be effective was capable of goingto the point of playing theoretic tricks on the delicate organism of his daughter she could not understand his purpose nonot wholly but she understood it better than he supposed or desired inasmuch as she was convinced that the whole proceeding was an elaborate mystification addressed to herself and destined to act upon her imagination he had wanted to do something sudden and arbitrary something unexpected and refined to mark the difference between his sympathies and her own and show that if he regarded his daughter as a precious work of art it was natural he should be more and more careful about the finishing touches if he wished to be effective he had succeeded the incident struck a chill into isabels heart pansy had known the convent in her childhood and had found a happy home there she was fond of the good sisters who were very fond of her and there was therefore for the moment no definite hardship in her lot but all the same the girl had taken fright the impression her father desired to make would evidently be sharp enough the old protestant tradition had never faded from isabels imagination and as her thoughts attached themselves to this striking example of her husbands geniusshe sat looking like him at the basket of flowerspoor little pansy became the heroine of a tragedy osmond wished it to be known that he shrank from nothing and his wife found it hard to pretend to eat her dinner there was a certain relief presently in hearing the high strained voice of her sisterinlaw the countess too apparently had been thinking the thing out but had arrived at a different conclusion from isabel  its very absurd my dear osmond she said to invent so many pretty reasons for poor pansys banishment why dont you say at once that you want to get her out of my way havent you discovered that i think very well of mr rosier i do indeed he seems to me simpaticissimo he has made me believe in true love i never did before of course youve made up your mind that with those convictions im dreadful company for pansy  osmond took a sip of a glass of wine he looked perfectly goodhumoured my dear amy he answered smiling as if he were uttering a piece of gallantry i dont know anything about your convictions but if i suspected that they interfere with mine it would be much simpler to banish you    chapter li  the countess was not banished but she felt the insecurity of her tenure of her brothers hospitality a week after this incident isabel received a telegram from england dated from gardencourt and bearing the stamp of mrs touchetts authorship ralph cannot last many days it ran and if convenient would like to see you wishes me to say that you must come only if youve not other duties say for myself that you used to talk a good deal about your duty and to wonder what it was shall be curious to see whether youve found it out ralph is really dying and theres no other company isabel was prepared for this news having received from henrietta stackpole a detailed account of her journey to england with her appreciative patient ralph had arrived more dead than alive but she had managed to convey him to gardencourt where he had taken to his bed which as miss stackpole wrote he evidently would never leave again she added that she had really had two patients on her hands instead of one inasmuch as mr goodwood who had been of no earthly use was quite as ailing in a different way as mr touchett afterwards she wrote that she had been obliged to surrender the field to mrs touchett who had just returned from america and had promptly given her to understand that she didnt wish any interviewing at gardencourt isabel had written to her aunt shortly after ralph came to rome letting her know of his critical condition and suggesting that she should lose no time in returning to europe mrs touchett had telegraphed an acknowledgement of this admonition and the only further news isabel received from her was the second telegram i have just quoted  isabel stood a moment looking at the latter missive then thrusting it into her pocket she went straight to the door of her husbands study here she again paused an instant after which she opened the door and went in osmond was seated at the table near the window with a folio volume before him propped against a pile of books this volume was open at a page of small coloured plates and isabel presently saw that he had been copying from it the drawing of an antique coin a box of watercolours and fine brushes lay before him and he had already transferred to a sheet of immaculate paper the delicate finelytinted disk his back was turned toward the door but he recognised his wife without looking round  excuse me for disturbing you she said  when i come to your room i always knock he answered going on with his work  i forgot i had something else to think of my cousins dying  ah i dont believe that said osmond looking at his drawing through a magnifying glass he was dying when we married hell outlive us all  isabel gave herself no time no thought to appreciate the careful cynicism of this declaration she simply went on quickly full of her own intention my aunt has telegraphed for me i must go to gardencourt  why must you go to gardencourt osmond asked in the tone of impartial curiosity  to see ralph before he dies  to this for some time he made no rejoinder he continued to give his chief attention to his work which was of a sort that would brook no negligence i dont see the need of it he said at last he came to see you here i didnt like that i thought his being in rome a great mistake but i tolerated it because it was to be the last time you should see him now you tell me its not to have been the last ah youre not grateful  what am i to be grateful for  gilbert osmond laid down his little implements blew a speck of dust from his drawing slowly got up and for the first time looked at his wife for my not having interfered while he was here  oh yes i am i remember perfectly how distinctly you let me know you didnt like it i was very glad when he went away  leave him alone then dont run after him  isabel turned her eyes away from him they rested upon his little drawing i must go to england she said with a full consciousness that her tone might strike an irritable man of taste as stupidly obstinate  i shall not like it if you do osmond remarked  why should i mind that you wont like it if i dont you like nothing i do or dont do you pretend to think i lie  osmond turned slightly pale he gave a cold smile thats why you must go then not to see your cousin but to take a revenge on me  i know nothing about revenge  i do said osmond dont give me an occasion  youre only too eager to take one you wish immensely that i would commit some folly  i should be gratified in that case if you disobeyed me  if i disobeyed you said isabel in a low tone which had the effect of mildness  let it be clear if you leave rome today it will be a piece of the most deliberate the most calculated opposition  how can you call it calculated i received my aunts telegram but three minutes ago  you calculate rapidly its a great accomplishment i dont see why we should prolong our discussion you know my wish and he stood there as if he expected to see her withdraw  but she never moved she couldnt move strange as it may seem she still wished to justify herself he had the power in an extraordinary degree of making her feel this need there was something in her imagination he could always appeal to against her judgement youve no reason for such a wish said isabel and ive every reason for going i cant tell you how unjust you seem to me but i think you know its your own opposition thats calculated its malignant  she had never uttered her worst thought to her husband before and the sensation of hearing it was evidently new to osmond but he showed no surprise and his coolness was apparently a proof that he had believed his wife would in fact be unable to resist for ever his ingenious endeavour to draw her out its all the more intense then he answered and he added almost as if he were giving her a friendly counsel this is a very important matter she recognised that she was fully conscious of the weight of the occasion she knew that between them they had arrived at a crisis its gravity made her careful she said nothing and he went on you say ive no reason i have the very best i dislike from the bottom of my soul what you intend to do its dishonourable its indelicate its indecent your cousin is nothing whatever to me and im under no obligation to make concessions to him ive already made the very handsomest your relations with him while he was here kept me on pins and needles but i let that pass because from week to week i expected him to go ive never liked him and he has never liked me thats why you like himbecause he hates me said osmond with a quick barely audible tremor in his voice ive an ideal of what my wife should do and should not do she should not travel across europe alone in defiance of my deepest desire to sit at the bedside of other men your cousins nothing to you hes nothing to us you smile most expressively when i talk about us but i assure you that we we mrs osmond is all i know i take our marriage seriously you appear to have found a way of not doing so im not aware that were divorced or separated for me were indissolubly united you are nearer to me than any human creature and im nearer to you it may be a disagreeable proximity its one at any rate of our own deliberate making you dont like to be reminded of that i know but im perfectly willing becausebecause and he paused a moment looking as if he had something to say which would be very much to the point because i think we should accept the consequences of our actions and what i value most in life is the honour of a thing  he spoke gravely and almost gently the accent of sarcasm had dropped out of his tone it had a gravity which checked his wifes quick emotion the resolution with which she had entered the room found itself caught in a mesh of fine threads his last words were not a command they constituted a kind of appeal and though she felt that any expression of respect on his part could only be a refinement of egotism they represented something transcendent and absolute like the sign of the cross or the flag of ones country he spoke in the name of something sacred and preciousthe observance of a magnificent form they were as perfectly apart in feeling as two disillusioned lovers had ever been but they had never yet separated in act isabel had not changed her old passion for justice still abode within her and now in the very thick of her sense of her husbands blasphemous sophistry it began to throb to a tune which for a moment promised him the victory it came over her that in his wish to preserve appearances he was after all sincere and that this as far as it went was a merit ten minutes before she had felt all the joy of irreflective actiona joy to which she had so long been a stranger but action had been suddenly changed to slow renunciation transformed by the blight of osmonds touch if she must renounce however she would let him know she was a victim rather than a dupe i know youre a master of the art of mockery she said how can you speak of an indissoluble unionhow can you speak of your being contented wheres our union when you accuse me of falsity wheres your contentment when you have nothing but hideous suspicion in your heart  it is in our living decently together in spite of such drawbacks  we dont live decently together cried isabel  indeed we dont if you go to england  thats very little thats nothing i might do much more  he raised his eyebrows and even his shoulders a little he had lived long enough in italy to catch this trick ah if youve come to threaten me i prefer my drawing and he walked back to his table where he took up the sheet of paper on which he had been working and stood studying it  i suppose that if i go youll not expect me to come back said isabel  he turned quickly round and she could see this movement at least was not designed he looked at her a little and then are you out of your mind he enquired  how can it be anything but a rupture she went on especially if all you say is true she was unable to see how it could be anything but a rupture she sincerely wished to know what else it might be  he sat down before his table i really cant argue with you on the hypothesis of your defying me he said and he took up one of his little brushes again  she lingered but a moment longer long enough to embrace with her eye his whole deliberately indifferent yet most expressive figure after which she quickly left the room her faculties her energy her passion were all dispersed again she felt as if a cold dark mist had suddenly encompassed her osmond possessed in a supreme degree the art of eliciting any weakness on her way back to her room she found the countess gemini standing in the open doorway of a little parlour in which a small collection of heterogeneous books had been arranged the countess had an open volume in her hand she appeared to have been glancing down a page which failed to strike her as interesting at the sound of isabels step she raised her head  ah my dear she said you who are so literary do tell me some amusing book to read everything heres of a dreariness do you think this would do me any good  isabel glanced at the title of the volume she held out but without reading or understanding it im afraid i cant advise you ive had bad news my cousin ralph touchett is dying  the countess threw down her book ah he was so simpatico im awfully sorry for you  you would be sorrier still if you knew  what is there to know you look very badly the countess added you must have been with osmond  half an hour before isabel would have listened very coldly to an intimation that she should ever feel a desire for the sympathy of her sisterinlaw and there can be no better proof of her present embarrassment than the fact that she almost clutched at this ladys fluttering attention ive been with osmond she said while the countesss bright eyes glittered at her  im sure then he has been odious the countess cried did he say he was glad poor mr touchetts dying  he said its impossible i should go to england  the countesss mind when her interests were concerned was agile she already foresaw the extinction of any further brightness in her visit to rome ralph touchett would die isabel would go into mourning and then there would be no more dinnerparties such a prospect produced for a moment in her countenance an expressive grimace but this rapid picturesque play of feature was her only tribute to disappointment after all she reflected the game was almost played out she had already overstayed her invitation and then she cared enough for isabels trouble to forget her own and she saw that isabels trouble was deep  it seemed deeper than the mere death of a cousin and the countess had no hesitation in connecting her exasperating brother with the expression of her sisterinlaws eyes her heart beat with an almost joyous expectation for if she had wished to see osmond overtopped the conditions looked favourable now of course if isabel should go to england she herself would immediately leave palazzo roccanera nothing would induce her to remain there with osmond nevertheless she felt an immense desire to hear that isabel would go to england nothings impossible for you my dear she said caressingly why else are you rich and clever and good  why indeed i feel stupidly weak  why does osmond say its impossible the countess asked in a tone which sufficiently declared that she couldnt imagine  from the moment she thus began to question her however isabel drew back she disengaged her hand which the countess had affectionately taken but she answered this enquiry with frank bitterness because were so happy together that we cant separate even for a fortnight  ah cried the countess while isabel turned away when i want to make a journey my husband simply tells me i can have no money  isabel went to her room where she walked up and down for an hour it may appear to some readers that she gave herself much trouble and it is certain that for a woman of a high spirit she had allowed herself easily to be arrested it seemed to her that only now she fully measured the great undertaking of matrimony marriage meant that in such a case as this when one had to choose one chose as a matter of course for ones husband im afraidyes im afraid she said to herself more than once stopping short in her walk but what she was afraid of was not her husbandhis displeasure his hatred his revenge it was not even her own later judgement of her conduct a consideration which had often held her in check it was simply the violence there would be in going when osmond wished her to remain a gulf of difference had opened between them but nevertheless it was his desire that she should stay it was a horror to him that she should go she knew the nervous fineness with which he could feel an objection what he thought of her she knew what he was capable of saying to her she had felt yet they were married for all that and marriage meant that a woman should cleave to the man with whom uttering tremendous vows she had stood at the altar she sank down on her sofa at last and buried her head in a pile of cushions  when she raised her head again the countess gemini hovered before her she had come in all unperceived she had a strange smile on her thin lips and her whole face had grown in an hour a shining intimation she lived assuredly it might be said at the window of her spirit but now she was leaning far out i knocked she began but you didnt answer me so i ventured in ive been looking at you for the past five minutes youre very unhappy  yes but i dont think you can comfort me  will you give me leave to try and the countess sat down on the sofa beside her she continued to smile and there was something communicative and exultant in her expression she appeared to have a deal to say and it occurred to isabel for the first time that her sisterinlaw might say something really human she made play with her glittering eyes in which there was an unpleasant fascination after all she soon resumed i must tell you to begin with that i dont understand your state of mind you seem to have so many scruples so many reasons so many ties when i discovered ten years ago that my husbands dearest wish was to make me miserableof late he has simply let me aloneah it was a wonderful simplification my poor isabel youre not simple enough  no im not simple enough said isabel  theres something i want you to know the countess declaredbecause i think you ought to know it perhaps you do perhaps youve guessed it but if you have all i can say is that i understand still less why you shouldnt do as you like  what do you wish me to know isabel felt a foreboding that made her heart beat faster the countess was about to justify herself and this alone was portentous  but she was nevertheless disposed to play a little with her subject in your place i should have guessed it ages ago have you never really suspected  ive guessed nothing what should i have suspected i dont know what you mean  thats because youve such a beastly pure mind i never saw a woman with such a pure mind cried the countess  isabel slowly got up youre going to tell me something horrible  you can call it by whatever name you will and the countess rose also while her gathered perversity grew vivid and dreadful she stood a moment in a sort of glare of intention and as seemed to isabel even then of ugliness after which she said my first sisterinlaw had no children  isabel stared back at her the announcement was an anticlimax your first sisterinlaw  i suppose you know at least if one may mention it that osmond has been married before ive never spoken to you of his wife i thought it mightnt be decent or respectful but others less particular must have done so the poor little woman lived hardly three years and died childless it wasnt till after her death that pansy arrived  isabels brow had contracted to a frown her lips were parted in pale vague wonder she was trying to follow there seemed so much more to follow than she could see pansys not my husbands child then  your husbandsin perfection but no one elses husbands some one elses wifes ah my good isabel cried the countess with you one must dot ones is  i dont understand whose wifes isabel asked  the wife of a horrid little swiss who diedhow longa dozen more than fifteen years ago he never recognised miss pansy nor knowing what he was about would have anything to say to her and there was no reason why he should osmond did and that was better though he had to fit on afterwards the whole rigmarole of his own wifes having died in childbirth and of his having in grief and horror banished the little girl from his sight for as long as possible before taking her home from nurse his wife had really died you know of quite another matter and in quite another place in the piedmontese mountains where they had gone one august because her health appeared to require the air but where she was suddenly taken worsefatally ill the story passed sufficiently it was covered by the appearances so long as nobody heeded as nobody cared to look into it but of course i knewwithout researches the countess lucidly proceeded as also youll understand without a word said between usi mean between osmond and me dont you see him looking at me in silence that way to settle itthat is to settle me if i should say anything i said nothing right or leftnever a word to a creature if you can believe that of me on my honour my dear i speak of the thing to you now after all this time as ive never never spoken it was to be enough for me from the first that the child was my niecefrom the moment she was my brothers daughter as for her veritable mother but with this pansys wonderful aunt droppedas involuntarily from the impression of her sisterinlaws face out of which more eyes might have seemed to look at her than she had ever had to meet  she had spoken no name yet isabel could but check on her own lips an echo of the unspoken she sank to her seat again hanging her head why have you told me this she asked in a voice the countess hardly recognised  because ive been so bored with your not knowing ive been bored frankly my dear with not having told you as if stupidly all this time i couldnt have managed ca me depasse if you dont mind my saying so the things all round you that youve appeared to succeed in not knowing its a sort of assistanceaid to innocent ignorancethat ive always been a bad hand at rendering and in this connexion that of keeping quiet for my brother my virtue has at any rate finally found itself exhausted its not a black lie moreover you know the countess inimitably added the facts are exactly what i tell you  i had no idea said isabel presently and looked up at her in a manner that doubtless matched the apparent witlessness of this confession  so i believedthough it was hard to believe had it never occurred to you that he was for six or seven years her lover  i dont know things have occurred to me and perhaps that was what they all meant  she has been wonderfully clever she has been magnificent about pansy the countess before all this view of it cried  oh no idea for me isabel went on ever definitely took that form she appeared to be making out to herself what had been and what hadnt and as it isi dont understand  she spoke as one troubled and puzzled yet the poor countess seemed to have seen her revelation fall below its possibilities of effect she had expected to kindle some responsive blaze but had barely extracted a spark isabel showed as scarce more impressed than she might have been as a young woman of approved imagination with some fine sinister passage of public history dont you recognise how the child could never pass for her husbandsthat is with m merle himself her companion resumed they had been separated too long for that and he had gone to some far countryi think to south america if she had ever had childrenwhich im not sure ofshe had lost them the conditions happened to make it workable under stress i mean at so awkward a pinch that osmond should acknowledge the little girl his wife was deadvery true but she had not been dead too long to put a certain accommodation of dates out of the questionfrom the moment i mean that suspicion wasnt started which was what they had to take care of what was more natural than that poor mrs osmond at a distance and for a world not troubling about trifles should have left behind her poverina the pledge of her brief happiness that had cost her her life with the aid of a change of residenceosmond had been living with her at naples at the time of their stay in the alps and he in due course left it for everthe whole history was successfully set going my poor sisterinlaw in her grave couldnt help herself and the real mother to save her skin renounced all visible property in the child  ah poor poor woman cried isabel who herewith burst into tears it was a long time since she had shed any she had suffered a high reaction from weeping but now they flowed with an abundance in which the countess gemini found only another discomfiture  its very kind of you to pity her she discordantly laughed yes indeed you have a way of your own  he must have been false to his wifeand so very soon said isabel with a sudden check  thats all thats wantingthat you should take up her cause the countess went on i quite agree with you however that it was much too soon  but to me to me and isabel hesitated as if she had not heard as if her questionthough it was sufficiently there in her eyeswere all for herself  to you he has been faithful well it depends my dear on what you call faithful when he married you he was no longer the lover of another womansuch a lover as he had been cara mia between their risks and their precautions while the thing lasted that state of affairs had passed away the lady had repented or at all events for reasons of her own drawn back she had always had too a worship of appearances so intense that even osmond himself had got bored with it you may therefore imagine what it waswhen he couldnt patch it on conveniently to any of those he goes in for but the whole past was between them  yes isabel mechanically echoed the whole past is between them  ah this later past is nothing but for six or seven years as i say they had kept it up  she was silent a little why then did she want him to marry me  ah my dear thats her superiority because you had money and because she believed you would be good to pansy  poor womanand pansy who doesnt like her cried isabel  thats the reason she wanted some one whom pansy would like she knows it she knows everything  will she know that youve told me this  that will depend upon whether you tell her shes prepared for it and do you know what she counts upon for her defence on your believing that i lie perhaps you do dont make yourself uncomfortable to hide it only as it happens this time i dont ive told plenty of little idiotic fibs but theyve never hurt any one but myself  isabel sat staring at her companions story as at a bale of fantastic wares some strolling gypsy might have unpacked on the carpet at her feet why did osmond never marry her she finally asked  because she had no money the countess had an answer for everything and if she lied she lied well no one knows no one has ever known what she lives on or how she has got all those beautiful things i dont believe osmond himself knows besides she wouldnt have married him  how can she have loved him then  she doesnt love him in that way she did at first and then i suppose she would have married him but at that time her husband was living by the time m merle had rejoinedi wont say his ancestors because he never had anyher relations with osmond had changed and she had grown more ambitious besides she has never had about him the countess went on leaving isabel to wince for it so tragically afterwardsshe had never had what you might call any illusions of intelligence she hoped she might marry a great man that has always been her idea she has waited and watched and plotted and prayed but she has never succeeded i dont call madame merle a success you know i dont know what she may accomplish yet but at present she has very little to show the only tangible result she has ever achievedexcept of course getting to know every one and staying with them free of expensehas been her bringing you and osmond together oh she did that my dear you neednt look as if you doubted it ive watched them for years i know everythingeverything im thought a great scatterbrain but ive had enough application of mind to follow up those two she hates me and her way of showing it is to pretend to be for ever defending me when people say ive had fifteen lovers she looks horrified and declares that quite half of them were never proved she has been afraid of me for years and she has taken great comfort in the vile false things people have said about me she has been afraid id expose her and she threatened me one day when osmond began to pay his court to you it was at his house in florence do you remember that afternoon when she brought you there and we had tea in the garden she let me know then that if i should tell tales two could play at that game she pretends theres a good deal more to tell about me than about her it would be an interesting comparison i dont care a fig what she may say simply because i know you dont care a fig you cant trouble your head about me less than you do already so she may take her revenge as she chooses i dont think shell frighten you very much her great idea has been to be tremendously irreproachablea kind of fullblown lilythe incarnation of propriety she has always worshipped that god there should be no scandal about caesars wife you know and as i say she has always hoped to marry caesar that was one reason she wouldnt marry osmond the fear that on seeing her with pansy people would put things togetherwould even see a resemblance she has had a terror lest the mother should betray herself she has been awfully careful the mother has never done so  yes yes the mother has done so said isabel who had listened to all this with a face more and more wan she betrayed herself to me the other day though i didnt recognise her there appeared to have been a chance of pansys making a great marriage and in her disappointment at its not coming off she almost dropped the mask  ah thats where shed dish herself cried the countess she has failed so dreadfully that shes determined her daughter shall make it up  isabel started at the words her daughter which her guest threw off so familiarly it seems very wonderful she murmured and in this bewildering impression she had almost lost her sense of being personally touched by the story  now dont go and turn against the poor innocent child the countess went on shes very nice in spite of her deplorable origin i myself have liked pansy not naturally because she was hers but because she had become yours  yes she has become mine and how the poor woman must have suffered at seeing me isabel exclaimed while she flushed at the thought  i dont believe she has suffered on the contrary she has enjoyed osmonds marriage has given his daughter a great little lift before that she lived in a hole and do you know what the mother thought that you might take such a fancy to the child that youd do something for her osmond of course could never give her a portion osmond was really extremely poor but of course you know all about that ah my dear cried the countess why did you ever inherit money she stopped a moment as if she saw something singular in isabels face dont tell me now that youll give her a dot youre capable of that but i would refuse to believe it dont try to be too good be a little easy and natural and nasty feel a little wicked for the comfort of it once in your life  its very strange i suppose i ought to know but im sorry isabel said im much obliged to you  yes you seem to be cried the countess with a mocking laugh perhaps you areperhaps youre not you dont take it as i should have thought  how should i take it isabel asked  well i should say as a woman who has been made use of isabel made no answer to this she only listened and the countess went on theyve always been bound to each other they remained so even after she broke offor he did but he has always been more for her than she has been for him when their little carnival was over they made a bargain that each should give the other complete liberty but that each should also do everything possible to help the other on you may ask me how i know such a thing as that i know it by the way theyve behaved now see how much better women are than men she has found a wife for osmond but osmond has never lifted a little finger for her she has worked for him plotted for him suffered for him she has even more than once found money for him and the end of it is that hes tired of her shes an old habit there are moments when he needs her but on the whole he wouldnt miss her if she were removed and whats more today she knows it so you neednt be jealous the countess added humorously  isabel rose from her sofa again she felt bruised and scant of breath her head was humming with new knowledge im much obliged to you she repeated and then she added abruptly in quite a different tone how do you know all this  this enquiry appeared to ruffle the countess more than isabels expression of gratitude pleased her she gave her companion a bold stare with which let us assume that ive invented it she cried she too however suddenly changed her tone and laying her hand on isabels arm said with the penetration of her sharp bright smile now will you give up your journey  isabel started a little she turned away but she felt weak and in a moment had to lay her arm upon the mantelshelf for support she stood a minute so and then upon her arm she dropped her dizzy head with closed eyes and pale lips  ive done wrong to speakive made you ill the countess cried  ah i must see ralph isabel wailed not in resentment not in the quick passion her companion had looked for but in a tone of farreaching infinite sadness    chapter lii  there was a train for turin and paris that evening and after the countess had left her isabel had a rapid and decisive conference with her maid who was discreet devoted and active after this she thought except of her journey only of one thing she must go and see pansy from her she couldnt turn away she had not seen her yet as osmond had given her to understand that it was too soon to begin she drove at five oclock to a high floor in a narrow street in the quarter of the piazza navona and was admitted by the portress of the convent a genial and obsequious person isabel had been at this institution before she had come with pansy to see the sisters she knew they were good women and she saw that the large rooms were clean and cheerful and that the wellused garden had sun for winter and shade for spring but she disliked the place which affronted and almost frightened her not for the world would she have spent a night there it produced today more than before the impression of a wellappointed prison for it was not possible to pretend pansy was free to leave it this innocent creature had been presented to her in a new and violent light but the secondary effect of the revelation was to make her reach out a hand  the portress left her to wait in the parlour of the convent while she went to make it known that there was a visitor for the dear young lady the parlour was a vast cold apartment with newlooking furniture a large clean stove of white porcelain unlighted a collection of wax flowers under glass and a series of engravings from religious pictures on the walls on the other occasion isabel had thought it less like rome than like philadelphia but today she made no reflexions the apartment only seemed to her very empty and very soundless the portress returned at the end of some five minutes ushering in another person isabel got up expecting to see one of the ladies of the sisterhood but to her extreme surprise found herself confronted with madame merle the effect was strange for madame merle was already so present to her vision that her appearance in the flesh was like suddenly and rather awfully seeing a painted picture move isabel had been thinking all day of her falsity her audacity her ability her probable suffering and these dark things seemed to flash with a sudden light as she entered the room her being there at all had the character of ugly evidence of handwritings of profaned relics of grim things produced in court it made isabel feel faint if it had been necessary to speak on the spot she would have been quite unable but no such necessity was distinct to her it seemed to her indeed that she had absolutely nothing to say to madame merle in ones relations with this lady however there were never any absolute necessities she had a manner which carried off not only her own deficiencies but those of other people but she was different from usual she came in slowly behind the portress and isabel instantly perceived that she was not likely to depend upon her habitual resources for her too the occasion was exceptional and she had undertaken to treat it by the light of the moment this gave her a peculiar gravity she pretended not even to smile and though isabel saw that she was more than ever playing a part it seemed to her that on the whole the wonderful woman had never been so natural she looked at her young friend from head to foot but not harshly nor defiantly with a cold gentleness rather and an absence of any air of allusion to their last meeting it was as if she had wished to mark a distinction she had been irritated then she was reconciled now  you can leave us alone she said to the portress in five minutes this lady will ring for you and then she turned to isabel who after noting what has just been mentioned had ceased to notice and had let her eyes wander as far as the limits of the room would allow she wished never to look at madame merle again youre surprised to find me here and im afraid youre not pleased this lady went on you dont see why i should have come its as if i had anticipated you i confess ive been rather indiscreeti ought to have asked your permission there was none of the oblique movement of irony in this it was said simply and mildly but isabel far afloat on a sea of wonder and pain could not have told herself with what intention it was uttered but ive not been sitting long madame merle continued that is ive not been long with pansy i came to see her because it occurred to me this afternoon that she must be rather lonely and perhaps even a little miserable it may be good for a small girl i know so little about small girls i cant tell at any rate its a little dismal therefore i cameon the chance i knew of course that youd come and her father as well still i had not been told other visitors were forbidden the good womanwhats her name madame catherinemade no objection whatever i stayed twenty minutes with pansy she has a charming little room not in the least conventual with a piano and flowers she has arranged it delightfully she has so much taste of course its all none of my business but i feel happier since ive seen her she may even have a maid if she likes but of course she has no occasion to dress she wears a little black frock she looks so charming i went afterwards to see mother catherine who has a very good room too i assure you i dont find the poor sisters at all monastic mother catherine has a most coquettish little toilettable with something that looked uncommonly like a bottle of eaudecologne she speaks delightfully of pansy says its a great happiness for them to have her shes a little saint of heaven and a model to the oldest of them just as i was leaving madame catherine the portress came to say to her that there was a lady for the signorina of course i knew it must be you and i asked her to let me go and receive you in her place she demurred greatlyi must tell you thatand said it was her duty to notify the mother superior it was of such high importance that you should be treated with respect i requested her to let the mother superior alone and asked her how she supposed i would treat you  so madame merle went on with much of the brilliancy of a woman who had long been a mistress of the art of conversation but there were phases and gradations in her speech not one of which was lost upon isabels ear though her eyes were absent from her companions face she had not proceeded far before isabel noted a sudden break in her voice a lapse in her continuity which was in itself a complete drama this subtle modulation marked a momentous discoverythe perception of an entirely new attitude on the part of her listener madame merle had guessed in the space of an instant that everything was at end between them and in the space of another instant she had guessed the reason why the person who stood there was not the same one she had seen hitherto but was a very different persona person who knew her secret this discovery was tremendous and from the moment she made it the most accomplished of women faltered and lost her courage but only for that moment then the conscious stream of her perfect manner gathered itself again and flowed on as smoothly as might be to the end but it was only because she had the end in view that she was able to proceed she had been touched with a point that made her quiver and she needed all the alertness of her will to repress her agitation her only safety was in her not betraying herself she resisted this but the startled quality of her voice refused to improveshe couldnt help itwhile she heard herself say she hardly knew what the tide of her confidence ebbed and she was able only just to glide into port faintly grazing the bottom  isabel saw it all as distinctly as if it had been reflected in a large clear glass it might have been a great moment for her for it might have been a moment of triumph that madame merle had lost her pluck and saw before her the phantom of exposurethis in itself was a revenge this in itself was almost the promise of a brighter day and for a moment during which she stood apparently looking out of the window with her back halfturned isabel enjoyed that knowledge on the other side of the window lay the garden of the convent but this is not what she saw she saw nothing of the budding plants and the glowing afternoon she saw in the crude light of that revelation which had already become a part of experience and to which the very frailty of the vessel in which it had been offered her only gave an intrinsic price the dry staring fact that she had been an applied handled hungup tool as senseless and convenient as mere shaped wood and iron all the bitterness of this knowledge surged into her soul again it was as if she felt on her lips the taste of dishonour there was a moment during which if she had turned and spoken she would have said something that would hiss like a lash but she closed her eyes and then the hideous vision dropped what remained was the cleverest woman in the world standing there within a few feet of her and knowing as little what to think as the meanest isabels only revenge was to be silent stillto leave madame merle in this unprecedented situation she left her there for a period that must have seemed long to this lady who at last seated herself with a movement which was in itself a confession of helplessness then isabel turned slow eyes looking down at her madame merle was very pale her own eyes covered isabels face she might see what she would but her danger was over isabel would never accuse her never reproach her perhaps because she never would give her the opportunity to defend herself  im come to bid pansy goodbye our young woman said at last i go to england tonight  go to england tonight madame merle repeated sitting there and looking up at her  im going to gardencourt ralph touchetts dying  ah youll feel that madame merle recovered herself she had a chance to express sympathy do you go alone  yes without my husband  madame merle gave a low vague murmur a sort of recognition of the general sadness of things mr touchett never liked me but im sorry hes dying shall you see his mother  yes she has returned from america  she used to be very kind to me but she has changed others too have changed said madame merle with a quiet noble pathos she paused a moment then added and youll see dear old gardencourt again  i shall not enjoy it much isabel answered  naturallyin your grief but its on the whole of all the houses i know and i know many the one i should have liked best to live in i dont venture to send a message to the people madame merle added but i should like to give my love to the place  isabel turned away i had better go to pansy ive not much time  while she looked about her for the proper egress the door opened and admitted one of the ladies of the house who advanced with a discreet smile gently rubbing under her long loose sleeves a pair of plump white hands isabel recognised madame catherine whose acquaintance she had already made and begged that she would immediately let her see miss osmond madame catherine looked doubly discreet but smiled very blandly and said it will be good for her to see you ill take you to her myself then she directed her pleased guarded vision to madame merle  will you let me remain a little this lady asked its so good to be here  you may remain always if you like and the good sister gave a knowing laugh  she led isabel out of the room through several corridors and up a long staircase all these departments were solid and bare light and clean so thought isabel are the great penal establishments madame catherine gently pushed open the door of pansys room and ushered in the visitor then stood smiling with folded hands while the two others met and embraced  shes glad to see you she repeated it will do her good and she placed the best chair carefully for isabel but she made no movement to seat herself she seemed ready to retire how does this dear child look she asked of isabel lingering a moment  she looks pale isabel answered  thats the pleasure of seeing you shes very happy elle eclaire la maison said the good sister  pansy wore as madame merle had said a little black dress it was perhaps this that made her look pale theyre very good to methey think of everything she exclaimed with all her customary eagerness to accommodate  we think of you alwaysyoure a precious charge madame catherine remarked in the tone of a woman with whom benevolence was a habit and whose conception of duty was the acceptance of every care it fell with a leaden weight on isabels ears it seemed to represent the surrender of a personality the authority of the church  when madame catherine had left them together pansy kneeled down and hid her head in her stepmothers lap so she remained some moments while isabel gently stroked her hair then she got up averting her face and looking about the room dont you think ive arranged it well ive everything i have at home  its very pretty youre very comfortable isabel scarcely knew what she could say to her on the one hand she couldnt let her think she had come to pity her and on the other it would be a dull mockery to pretend to rejoice with her so she simply added after a moment ive come to bid you goodbye im going to england  pansys white little face turned red to england not to come back  i dont know when i shall come back  ah im sorry pansy breathed with faintness she spoke as if she had no right to criticise but her tone expressed a depth of disappointment  my cousin mr touchett is very ill hell probably die i wish to see him isabel said  ah yes you told me he would die of course you must go and will papa go  no i shall go alone  for a moment the girl said nothing isabel had often wondered what she thought of the apparent relations of her father with his wife but never by a glance by an intimation had she let it be seen that she deemed them deficient in an air of intimacy she made her reflexions isabel was sure and she must have had a conviction that there were husbands and wives who were more intimate than that but pansy was not indiscreet even in thought she would as little have ventured to judge her gentle stepmother as to criticise her magnificent father her heart may have stood almost as still as it would have done had she seen two of the saints in the great picture in the convent chapel turn their painted heads and shake them at each other but as in this latter case she would for very solemnitys sake never have mentioned the awful phenomenon so she put away all knowledge of the secrets of larger lives than her own youll be very far away she presently went on  yes i shall be far away but it will scarcely matter isabel explained since so long as youre here i cant be called near you  yes but you can come and see me though youve not come very often  ive not come because your father forbade it today i bring nothing with me i cant amuse you  im not to be amused thats not what papa wishes  then it hardly matters whether im in rome or in england  youre not happy mrs osmond said pansy  not very but it doesnt matter  thats what i say to myself what does it matter but i should like to come out  i wish indeed you might  dont leave me here pansy went on gently  isabel said nothing for a minute her heart beat fast will you come away with me now she asked  pansy looked at her pleadingly did papa tell you to bring me  no its my own proposal  i think i had better wait then did papa send me no message  i dont think he knew i was coming  he thinks ive not had enough said pansy but i have the ladies are very kind to me and the little girls come to see me there are some very little onessuch charming children then my roomyou can see for yourself all thats very delightful but ive had enough papa wished me to think a littleand ive thought a great deal  what have you thought  well that i must never displease papa  you knew that before  yes but i know it better ill do anythingill do anything said pansy then as she heard her own words a deep pure blush came into her face isabel read the meaning of it she saw the poor girl had been vanquished it was well that mr edward rosier had kept his enamels isabel looked into her eyes and saw there mainly a prayer to be treated easily she laid her hand on pansys as if to let her know that her look conveyed no diminution of esteem for the collapse of the girls momentary resistance mute and modest thought it had been seemed only her tribute to the truth of things she didnt presume to judge others but she had judged herself she had seen the reality she had no vocation for struggling with combinations in the solemnity of sequestration there was something that overwhelmed her she bowed her pretty head to authority and only asked of authority to be merciful yes it was very well that edward rosier had reserved a few articles  isabel got up her time was rapidly shortening goodbye then i leave rome tonight  pansy took hold of her dress there was a sudden change in the childs face you look strange you frighten me  oh im very harmless said isabel  perhaps you wont come back  perhaps not i cant tell  ah mrs osmond you wont leave me  isabel now saw she had guessed everything my dear child what can i do for you she asked  i dont knowbut im happier when i think of you  you can always think of me  not when youre so far im a little afraid said pansy  what are you afraid of  of papaa little and of madame merle she has just been to see me  you must not say that isabel observed  oh ill do everything they want only if youre here i shall do it more easily  isabel considered i wont desert you she said at last goodbye my child  then they held each other a moment in a silent embrace like two sisters and afterwards pansy walked along the corridor with her visitor to the top of the staircase madame merle has been here she remarked as they went and as isabel answered nothing she added abruptly i dont like madame merle  isabel hesitated then stopped you must never say thatthat you dont like madame merle  pansy looked at her in wonder but wonder with pansy had never been a reason for noncompliance i never will again she said with exquisite gentleness at the top of the staircase they had to separate as it appeared to be part of the mild but very definite discipline under which pansy lived that she should not go down isabel descended and when she reached the bottom the girl was standing above youll come back she called out in a voice that isabel remembered afterwards  yesill come back  madame catherine met mrs osmond below and conducted her to the door of the parlour outside of which the two stood talking a minute i wont go in said the good sister madame merles waiting for you  at this announcement isabel stiffened she was on the point of asking if there were no other egress from the convent but a moments reflexion assured her that she would do well not to betray to the worthy nun her desire to avoid pansys other friend her companion grasped her arm very gently and fixing her a moment with wise benevolent eyes said in french and almost familiarly eh bien chere madame quen pensezvous  about my stepdaughter oh it would take long to tell you  we think its enough madame catherine distinctly observed and she pushed open the door of the parlour  madame merle was sitting just as isabel had left her like a woman so absorbed in thought that she had not moved a little finger as madame catherine closed the door she got up and isabel saw that she had been thinking to some purpose she had recovered her balance she was in full possession of her resources i found i wished to wait for you she said urbanely but its not to talk about pansy  isabel wondered what it could be to talk about and in spite of madame merles declaration she answered after a moment madame catherine says its enough  yes it also seems to me enough i wanted to ask you another word about poor mr touchett madame merle added have you reason to believe that hes really at his last  ive no information but a telegram unfortunately it only confirms a probability  im going to ask you a strange question said madame merle are you very fond of your cousin and she gave a smile as strange as her utterance  yes im very fond of him but i dont understand you  she just hung fire its rather hard to explain something has occurred to me which may not have occurred to you and i give you the benefit of my idea your cousin did you once a great service have you never guessed it  he has done me many services  yes but one was much above the rest he made you a rich woman  he made me  madame merle appearing to see herself successful she went on more triumphantly he imparted to you that extra lustre which was required to make you a brilliant match at bottom its him youve to thank she stopped there was something in isabels eyes  i dont understand you it was my uncles money  yes it was your uncles money but it was your cousins idea he brought his father over to it ah my dear the sum was large  isabel stood staring she seemed today to live in a world illumined by lurid flashes i dont know why you say such things i dont know what you know  i know nothing but what ive guessed but ive guessed that  isabel went to the door and when she had opened it stood a moment with her hand on the latch then she saidit was her only revenge i believed it was you i had to thank  madame merle dropped her eyes she stood there in a kind of proud penance youre very unhappy i know but im more so  yes i can believe that i think i should like never to see you again  madame merle raised her eyes i shall go to america she quietly remarked while isabel passed out    chapter liii  it was not with surprise it was with a feeling which in other circumstances would have had much of the effect of joy that as isabel descended from the paris mail at charing cross she stepped into the arms as it wereor at any rate into the handsof henrietta stackpole she had telegraphed to her friend from turin and though she had not definitely said to herself that henrietta would meet her she had felt her telegram would produce some helpful result on her long journey from rome her mind had been given up to vagueness she was unable to question the future she performed this journey with sightless eyes and took little pleasure in the countries she traversed decked out though they were in the richest freshness of spring her thoughts followed their course through other countriesstrangelooking dimlylighted pathless lands in which there was no change of seasons but only as it seemed a perpetual dreariness of winter she had plenty to think about but it was neither reflexion nor conscious purpose that filled her mind disconnected visions passed through it and sudden dull gleams of memory of expectation the past and the future came and went at their will but she saw them only in fitful images which rose and fell by a logic of their own it was extraordinary the things she remembered now that she was in the secret now that she knew something that so much concerned her and the eclipse of which had made life resemble an attempt to play whist with an imperfect pack of cards the truth of things their mutual relations their meaning and for the most part their horror rose before her with a kind of architectural vastness she remembered a thousand trifles they started to life with the spontaneity of a shiver she had thought them trifles at the time now she saw that they had been weighted with lead yet even now they were trifles after all for of what use was it to her to understand them nothing seemed of use to her today all purpose all intention was suspended all desire too save the single desire to reach her muchembracing refuge gardencourt had been her startingpoint and to those muffled chambers it was at least a temporary solution to return she had gone forth in her strength she would come back in her weakness and if the place had been a rest to her before it would be a sanctuary now she envied ralph his dying for if one were thinking of rest that was the most perfect of all to cease utterly to give it all up and not know anything morethis idea was as sweet as the vision of a cool bath in a marble tank in a darkened chamber in a hot land  she had moments indeed in her journey from rome which were almost as good as being dead she sat in her corner so motionless so passive simply with the sense of being carried so detached from hope and regret that she recalled to herself one of those etruscan figures couched upon the receptacle of their ashes there was nothing to regret nowthat was all over not only the time of her folly but the time of her repentance was far the only thing to regret was that madame merle had been sowell so unimaginable just here her intelligence dropped from literal inability to say what it was that madame merle had been whatever it was it was for madame merle herself to regret it and doubtless she would do so in america where she had announced she was going it concerned isabel no more she only had an impression that she should never again see madame merle this impression carried her into the future of which from time to time she had a mutilated glimpse she saw herself in the distant years still in the attitude of a woman who had her life to live and these intimations contradicted the spirit of the present hour it might be desirable to get quite away really away further away than little greygreen england but this privilege was evidently to be denied her deep in her souldeeper than any appetite for renunciationwas the sense that life would be her business for a long time to come and at moments there was something inspiring almost enlivening in the conviction it was a proof of strengthit was a proof she should some day be happy again it couldnt be she was to live only to suffer she was still young after all and a great many things might happen to her yet to live only to sufferonly to feel the injury of life repeated and enlargedit seemed to her she was too valuable too capable for that then she wondered if it were vain and stupid to think so well of herself when had it even been a guarantee to be valuable wasnt all history full of the destruction of precious things wasnt it much more probable that if one were fine one would suffer it involved then perhaps an admission that one had a certain grossness but isabel recognised as it passed before her eyes the quick vague shadow of a long future she should never escape she should last to the end then the middle years wrapped her about again and the grey curtain of her indifference closed her in  henrietta kissed her as henrietta usually kissed as if she were afraid she should be caught doing it and then isabel stood there in the crowd looking about her looking for her servant she asked nothing she wished to wait she had a sudden perception that she should be helped she rejoiced henrietta had come there was something terrible in an arrival in london the dusky smoky fararching vault of the station the strange livid light the dense dark pushing crowd filled her with a nervous fear and made her put her arm into her friends she remembered she had once liked these things they seemed part of a mighty spectacle in which there was something that touched her she remembered how she walked away from euston in the winter dusk in the crowded streets five years before she could not have done that today and the incident came before her as the deed of another person  its too beautiful that you should have come said henrietta looking at her as if she thought isabel might be prepared to challenge the proposition if you hadntif you hadnt well i dont know remarked miss stackpole hinting ominously at her powers of disapproval  isabel looked about without seeing her maid her eyes rested on another figure however which she felt she had seen before and in a moment she recognised the genial countenance of mr bantling he stood a little apart and it was not in the power of the multitude that pressed about him to make him yield an inch of the ground he had takenthat of abstracting himself discreetly while the two ladies performed their embraces  theres mr bantling said isabel gently irrelevantly scarcely caring much now whether she should find her maid or not  oh yes he goes everywhere with me come here mr bantling henrietta exclaimed whereupon the gallant bachelor advanced with a smilea smile tempered however by the gravity of the occasion isnt it lovely she has come henrietta asked he knows all about it she added we had quite a discussion he said you wouldnt i said you would  i thought you always agreed isabel smiled in return she felt she could smile now she had seen in an instant in mr bantlings brave eyes that he had good news for her they seemed to say he wished her to remember he was an old friend of her cousinthat he understood that it was all right isabel gave him her hand she thought of him extravagantly as a beautiful blameless knight  oh i always agree said mr bantling but she doesnt you know  didnt i tell you that a maid was a nuisance henrietta enquired your young lady has probably remained at calais  i dont care said isabel looking at mr bantling whom she had never found so interesting  stay with her while i go and see henrietta commanded leaving the two for a moment together  they stood there at first in silence and then mr bantling asked isabel how it had been on the channel  very fine no i believe it was very rough she said to her companions obvious surprise after which she added youve been to gardencourt i know  now how do you know that  i cant tell youexcept that you look like a person who has been to gardencourt  do you think i look awfully sad its awfully sad there you know  i dont believe you ever look awfully sad you look awfully kind said isabel with a breadth that cost her no effort it seemed to her she should never again feel a superficial embarrassment  poor mr bantling however was still in this inferior stage he blushed a good deal and laughed he assured her that he was often very blue and that when he was blue he was awfully fierce you can ask miss stackpole you know i was at gardencourt two days ago  did you see my cousin  only for a little but he had been seeing people warburton had been there the day before ralph was just the same as usual except that he was in bed and that he looks tremendously ill and that he cant speak mr bantling pursued he was awfully jolly and funny all the same he was just as clever as ever its awfully wretched  even in the crowded noisy station this simple picture was vivid was that late in the day  yes i went on purpose we thought youd like to know  im greatly obliged to you can i go down tonight  ah i dont think shell let you go said mr bantling she wants you to stop with her i made touchetts man promise to telegraph me today and i found the telegram an hour ago at my club quiet and easy thats what it says and its dated two oclock so you see you can wait till tomorrow you must be awfully tired  yes im awfully tired and i thank you again  oh said mr bantling we were certain you would like the last news on which isabel vaguely noted that he and henrietta seemed after all to agree miss stackpole came back with isabels maid whom she had caught in the act of proving her utility this excellent person instead of losing herself in the crowd had simply attended to her mistresss luggage so that the latter was now at liberty to leave the station you know youre not to think of going to the country tonight henrietta remarked to her it doesnt matter whether theres a train or not youre to come straight to me in wimpole street there isnt a corner to be had in london but ive got you one all the same it isnt a roman palace but it will do for a night  ill do whatever you wish isabel said  youll come and answer a few questions thats what i wish  she doesnt say anything about dinner does she mrs osmond mr bantling enquired jocosely  henrietta fixed him a moment with her speculative gaze i see youre in a great hurry to get your own youll be at the paddington station tomorrow morning at ten  dont come for my sake mr bantling said isabel  hell come for mine henrietta declared as she ushered her friend into a cab and later in a large dusky parlour in wimpole streetto do her justice there had been dinner enoughshe asked those questions to which she had alluded at the station did your husband make you a scene about your coming that was miss stackpoles first enquiry  no i cant say he made a scene  he didnt object then  yes he objected very much but it was not what youd call a scene  what was it then  it was a very quiet conversation  henrietta for a moment regarded her guest it must have been hellish she then remarked and isabel didnt deny that it had been hellish but she confined herself to answering henriettas questions which was easy as they were tolerably definite for the present she offered her no new information well said miss stackpole at last ive only one criticism to make i dont see why you promised little miss osmond to go back  im not sure i myself see now isabel replied but i did then  if youve forgotten your reason perhaps you wont return  isabel waited a moment perhaps i shall find another  youll certainly never find a good one  in default of a better my having promised will do isabel suggested  yes thats why i hate it  dont speak of it now ive a little time coming away was a complication but what will going back be  you must remember after all that he wont make you a scene said henrietta with much intention  he will though isabel answered gravely it wont be the scene of a moment it will be a scene of the rest of my life  for some minutes the two women sat and considered this remainder and then miss stackpole to change the subject as isabel had requested announced abruptly ive been to stay with lady pensil  ah the invitation came at last  yes it took five years but this time she wanted to see me  naturally enough  it was more natural than i think you know said henrietta who fixed her eyes on a distant point and then she added turning suddenly isabel archer i beg your pardon you dont know why because i criticised you and yet ive gone further than you mr osmond at least was born on the other side  it was a moment before isabel grasped her meaning this sense was so modestly or at least so ingeniously veiled isabels mind was not possessed at present with the comicality of things but she greeted with a quick laugh the image that her companion had raised she immediately recovered herself however and with the right excess of intensity henrietta stackpole she asked are you going to give up your country  yes my poor isabel i am i wont pretend to deny it i look the fact in the face im going to marry mr bantling and locate right here in london  it seems very strange said isabel smiling now  well yes i suppose it does ive come to it little by little i think i know what im doing but i dont know as i can explain  one cant explain ones marriage isabel answered and yours doesnt need to be explained mr bantling isnt a riddle  no he isnt a bad punor even a high flight of american humour he has a beautiful nature henrietta went on ive studied him for many years and i see right through him hes as clear as the style of a good prospectus hes not intellectual but he appreciates intellect on the other hand he doesnt exaggerate its claims i sometimes think we do in the united states  ah said isabel youre changed indeed its the first time ive ever heard you say anything against your native land  i only say that were too infatuated with mere brainpower that after all isnt a vulgar fault but i am changed a woman has to change a good deal to marry  i hope youll be very happy you will at lastover heresee something of the inner life  henrietta gave a little significant sigh thats the key to the mystery i believe i couldnt endure to be kept off now ive as good a right as any one she added with artless elation isabel was duly diverted but there was a certain melancholy in her view henrietta after all had confessed herself human and feminine henrietta whom she had hitherto regarded as a light keen flame a disembodied voice it was a disappointment to find she had personal susceptibilities that she was subject to common passions and that her intimacy with mr bantling had not been completely original there was a want of originality in her marrying himthere was even a kind of stupidity and for a moment to isabels sense the dreariness of the world took on a deeper tinge a little later indeed she reflected that mr bantling himself at least was original but she didnt see how henrietta could give up her country she herself had relaxed her hold of it but it had never been her country as it had been henriettas she presently asked her if she had enjoyed her visit to lady pensil  oh yes said henrietta she didnt know what to make of me  and was that very enjoyable  very much so because shes supposed to be a master mind she thinks she knows everything but she doesnt understand a woman of my modern type it would be so much easier for her if i were only a little better or a little worse shes so puzzled i believe she thinks its my duty to go and do something immoral she thinks its immoral that i should marry her brother but after all that isnt immoral enough and shell never understand my mixturenever  shes not so intelligent as her brother then said isabel he appears to have understood  oh no he hasnt cried miss stackpole with decision i really believe thats what he wants to marry me forjust to find out the mystery and the proportions of it thats a fixed ideaa kind of fascination  its very good in you to humour it  oh well said henrietta ive something to find out too and isabel saw that she had not renounced an allegiance but planned an attack she was at last about to grapple in earnest with england  isabel also perceived however on the morrow at the paddington station where she found herself at ten oclock in the company both of miss stackpole and mr bantling that the gentleman bore his perplexities lightly if he had not found out everything he had found out at least the great pointthat miss stackpole would not be wanting in initiative it was evident that in the selection of a wife he had been on his guard against this deficiency  henrietta has told me and im very glad isabel said as she gave him her hand  i dare say you think it awfully odd mr bantling replied resting on his neat umbrella  yes i think it awfully odd  you cant think it so awfully odd as i do but ive always rather liked striking out a line said mr bantling serenely     chapter liv  isabels arrival at gardencourt on this second occasion was even quieter than it had been on the first ralph touchett kept but a small household and to the new servants mrs osmond was a stranger so that instead of being conducted to her own apartment she was coldly shown into the drawingroom and left to wait while her name was carried up to her aunt she waited a long time mrs touchett appeared in no hurry to come to her she grew impatient at last she grew nervous and scaredas scared as if the objects about her had begun to show for conscious things watching her trouble with grotesque grimaces the day was dark and cold the dusk was thick in the corners of the wide brown rooms the house was perfectly stillwith a stillness that isabel remembered it had filled all the place for days before the death of her uncle she left the drawingroom and wandered aboutstrolled into the library and along the gallery of pictures where in the deep silence her footstep made an echo nothing was changed she recognised everything she had seen years before it might have been only yesterday she had stood there she envied the security of valuable pieces which change by no hairs breadth only grow in value while their owners lose inch by inch youth happiness beauty and she became aware that she was walking about as her aunt had done on the day she had come to see her in albany she was changed enough since thenthat had been the beginning it suddenly struck her that if her aunt lydia had not come that day in just that way and found her alone everything might have been different she might have had another life and she might have been a woman more blest she stopped in the gallery in front of a small picturea charming and precious boningtonupon which her eyes rested a long time but she was not looking at the picture she was wondering whether if her aunt had not come that day in albany she would have married caspar goodwood  mrs touchett appeared at last just after isabel had returned to the big uninhabited drawingroom she looked a good deal older but her eye was as bright as ever and her head as erect her thin lips seemed a repository of latent meanings she wore a little grey dress of the most undecorated fashion and isabel wondered as she had wondered the first time if her remarkable kinswoman resembled more a queenregent or the matron of a gaol her lips felt very thin indeed on isabels hot cheek  ive kept you waiting because ive been sitting with ralph mrs touchett said the nurse had gone to luncheon and i had taken her place he has a man whos supposed to look after him but the mans good for nothing hes always looking out of the windowas if there were anything to see i didnt wish to move because ralph seemed to be sleeping and i was afraid the sound would disturb him i waited till the nurse came back i remembered you knew the house  i find i know it better even than i thought ive been walking everywhere isabel answered and then she asked if ralph slept much  he lies with his eyes closed he doesnt move but im not sure that its always sleep  will he see me can he speak to me  mrs touchett declined the office of saying you can try him was the limit of her extravagance and then she offered to conduct isabel to her room i thought they had taken you there but its not my house its ralphs and i dont know what they do they must at least have taken your luggage i dont suppose youve brought much not that i care however i believe theyve given you the same room you had before when ralph heard you were coming he said you must have that one  did he say anything else  ah my dear he doesnt chatter as he used cried mrs touchett as she preceded her niece up the staircase  it was the same room and something told isabel it had not been slept in since she occupied it her luggage was there and was not voluminous mrs touchett sat down a moment with her eyes upon it is there really no hope our young woman asked as she stood before her  none whatever there never has been it has not been a successful life  noit has only been a beautiful one isabel found herself already contradicting her aunt she was irritated by her dryness  i dont know what you mean by that theres no beauty without health that is a very odd dress to travel in  isabel glanced at her garment i left rome at an hours notice i took the first that came  your sisters in america wished to know how you dress that seemed to be their principal interest i wasnt able to tell thembut they seemed to have the right idea that you never wear anything less than black brocade  they think im more brilliant than i am im afraid to tell them the truth said isabel lily wrote me you had dined with her  she invited me four times and i went once after the second time she should have let me alone the dinner was very good it must have been expensive her husband has a very bad manner did i enjoy my visit to america why should i have enjoyed it i didnt go for my pleasure  these were interesting items but mrs touchett soon left her niece whom she was to meet in half an hour at the midday meal for this repast the two ladies faced each other at an abbreviated table in the melancholy diningroom here after a little isabel saw her aunt not to be so dry as she appeared and her old pity for the poor womans inexpressiveness her want of regret of disappointment came back to her unmistakeably she would have found it a blessing today to be able to feel a defeat a mistake even a shame or two she wondered if she were not even missing those enrichments of consciousness and privately tryingreaching out for some aftertaste of life dregs of the banquet the testimony of pain or the cold recreation of remorse on the other hand perhaps she was afraid if she should begin to know remorse at all it might take her too far isabel could perceive however how it had come over her dimly that she had failed of something that she saw herself in the future as an old woman without memories her little sharp face looked tragical she told her niece that ralph had as yet not moved but that he probably would be able to see her before dinner and then in a moment she added that he had seen lord warburton the day before an announcement which startled isabel a little as it seemed an intimation that this personage was in the neighbourhood and that an accident might bring them together such an accident would not be happy she had not come to england to struggle again with lord warburton she none the less presently said to her aunt that he had been very kind to ralph she had seen something of that in rome  he has something else to think of now mrs touchett returned and she paused with a gaze like a gimlet  isabel saw she meant something and instantly guessed what she meant but her reply concealed her guess her heart beat faster and she wished to gain a moment ah yesthe house of lords and all that  hes not thinking of the lords hes thinking of the ladies at least hes thinking of one of them he told ralph hes engaged to be married  ah to be married isabel mildly exclaimed  unless he breaks it off he seemed to think ralph would like to know poor ralph cant go to the wedding though i believe its to take place very soon  and whos the young lady  a member of the aristocracy lady flora lady feliciasomething of that sort  im very glad isabel said it must be a sudden decision  sudden enough i believe a courtship of three weeks it has only just been made public  im very glad isabel repeated with a larger emphasis she knew her aunt was watching herlooking for the signs of some imputed soreness and the desire to prevent her companion from seeing anything of this kind enabled her to speak in the tone of quick satisfaction the tone almost of relief mrs touchett of course followed the tradition that ladies even married ones regard the marriage of their old lovers as an offence to themselves isabels first care therefore was to show that however that might be in general she was not offended now but meanwhile as i say her heart beat faster and if she sat for some moments thoughtfulshe presently forgot mrs touchetts observationit was not because she had lost an admirer her imagination had traversed half europe it halted panting and even trembling a little in the city of rome she figured herself announcing to her husband that lord warburton was to lead a bride to the altar and she was of course not aware how extremely wan she must have looked while she made this intellectual effort but at last she collected herself and said to her aunt he was sure to do it some time or other  mrs touchett was silent then she gave a sharp little shake of the head ah my dear youre beyond me she cried suddenly they went on with their luncheon in silence isabel felt as if she had heard of lord warburtons death she had known him only as a suitor and now that was all over he was dead for poor pansy by pansy he might have lived a servant had been hovering about at last mrs touchett requested him to leave them alone she had finished her meal she sat with her hands folded on the edge of the table i should like to ask you three questions she observed when the servant had gone  three are a great many  i cant do with less ive been thinking theyre all very good ones  thats what im afraid of the best questions are the worst isabel answered mrs touchett had pushed back her chair and as her niece left the table and walked rather consciously to one of the deep windows she felt herself followed by her eyes  have you ever been sorry you didnt marry lord warburton mrs touchett enquired  isabel shook her head slowly but not heavily no dear aunt  good i ought to tell you that i propose to believe what you say  your believing mes an immense temptation she declared smiling still  a temptation to lie i dont recommend you to do that for when im misinformed im as dangerous as a poisoned rat i dont mean to crow over you  its my husband who doesnt get on with me said isabel  i could have told him he wouldnt i dont call that crowing over you mrs touchett added do you still like serena merle she went on  not as i once did but it doesnt matter for shes going to america  to america she must have done something very bad  yesvery bad  may i ask what it is  she made a convenience of me  ah cried mrs touchett so she did of me she does of every one  shell make a convenience of america said isabel smiling again and glad that her aunts questions were over  it was not till the evening that she was able to see ralph he had been dozing all day at least he had been lying unconscious the doctor was there but after a while went awaythe local doctor who had attended his father and whom ralph liked he came three or four times a day he was deeply interested in his patient ralph had had sir matthew hope but he had got tired of this celebrated man to whom he had asked his mother to send word he was now dead and was therefore without further need of medical advice mrs touchett had simply written to sir matthew that her son disliked him on the day of isabels arrival ralph gave no sign as i have related for many hours but toward evening he raised himself and said he knew that she had come  how he knew was not apparent inasmuch as for fear of exciting him no one had offered the information isabel came in and sat by his bed in the dim light there was only a shaded candle in a corner of the room she told the nurse she might goshe herself would sit with him for the rest of the evening he had opened his eyes and recognised her and had moved his hand which lay helpless beside him so that she might take it but he was unable to speak he closed his eyes again and remained perfectly still only keeping her hand in his own she sat with him a long timetill the nurse came back but he gave no further sign he might have passed away while she looked at him he was already the figure and pattern of death she had thought him far gone in rome and this was worse there was but one change possible now there was a strange tranquillity in his face it was as still as the lid of a box with this he was a mere lattice of bones when he opened his eyes to greet her it was as if she were looking into immeasurable space it was not till midnight that the nurse came back but the hours to isabel had not seemed long it was exactly what she had come for if she had come simply to wait she found ample occasion for he lay three days in a kind of grateful silence he recognised her and at moments seemed to wish to speak but he found no voice then he closed his eyes again as if he too were waiting for somethingfor something that certainly would come he was so absolutely quiet that it seemed to her what was coming had already arrived and yet she never lost the sense that they were still together but they were not always together there were other hours that she passed in wandering through the empty house and listening for a voice that was not poor ralphs she had a constant fear she thought it possible her husband would write to her but he remained silent and she only got a letter from florence and from the countess gemini ralph however spoke at laston the evening of the third day  i feel better tonight he murmured abruptly in the soundless dimness of her vigil i think i can say something she sank upon her knees beside his pillow took his thin hand in her own begged him not to make an effortnot to tire himself his face was of necessity seriousit was incapable of the muscular play of a smile but its owner apparently had not lost a perception of incongruities what does it matter if im tired when ive all eternity to rest theres no harm in making an effort when its the very last of all dont people always feel better just before the end ive often heard of that its what i was waiting for ever since youve been here i thought it would come i tried two or three times i was afraid youd get tired of sitting there he spoke slowly with painful breaks and long pauses his voice seemed to come from a distance when he ceased he lay with his face turned to isabel and his large unwinking eyes open into her own it was very good of you to come he went on i thought you would but i wasnt sure  i was not sure either till i came said isabel  youve been like an angel beside my bed you know they talk about the angel of death its the most beautiful of all youve been like that as if you were waiting for me  i was not waiting for your death i was waiting forfor this this is not death dear ralph  not for youno theres nothing makes us feel so much alive as to see others die thats the sensation of lifethe sense that we remain ive had iteven i but now im of no use but to give it to others with me its all over and then he paused isabel bowed her head further till it rested on the two hands that were clasped upon his own she couldnt see him now but his faraway voice was close to her ear isabel he went on suddenly i wish it were over for you she answered nothing she had burst into sobs she remained so with her buried face he lay silent listening to her sobs at last he gave a long groan ah what is it you have done for me  what is it you did for me she cried her now extreme agitation half smothered by her attitude she had lost all her shame all wish to hide things now he must know she wished him to know for it brought them supremely together and he was beyond the reach of pain you did something onceyou know it o ralph youve been everything what have i done for youwhat can i do today i would die if you could live but i dont wish you to live i would die myself not to lose you her voice was as broken as his own and full of tears and anguish  you wont lose meyoull keep me keep me in your heart i shall be nearer to you than ive ever been dear isabel life is better for in life theres love death is goodbut theres no love  i never thanked youi never spokei never was what i should be isabel went on she felt a passionate need to cry out and accuse herself to let her sorrow possess her all her troubles for the moment became single and melted together into this present pain what must you have thought of me yet how could i know i never knew and i only know today because there are people less stupid than i  dont mind people said ralph i think im glad to leave people  she raised her head and her clasped hands she seemed for a moment to pray to him is it trueis it true she asked  true that youve been stupid oh no said ralph with a sensible intention of wit  that you made me richthat all i have is yours  he turned away his head and for some time said nothing then at last ah dont speak of thatthat was not happy slowly he moved his face toward her again and they once more saw each other but for thatbut for that and he paused i believe i ruined you he wailed  she was full of the sense that he was beyond the reach of pain he seemed already so little of this world but even if she had not had it she would still have spoken for nothing mattered now but the only knowledge that was not pure anguishthe knowledge that they were looking at the truth together  he married me for the money she said she wished to say everything she was afraid he might die before she had done so he gazed at her a little and for the first time his fixed eyes lowered their lids but he raised them in a moment and then he was greatly in love with you he answered  yes he was in love with me but he wouldnt have married me if i had been poor i dont hurt you in saying that how can i i only want you to understand i always tried to keep you from understanding but thats all over  i always understood said ralph  i thought you did and i didnt like it but now i like it  you dont hurt meyou make me very happy and as ralph said this there was an extraordinary gladness in his voice she bent her head again and pressed her lips to the back of his hand i always understood he continued though it was so strangeso pitiful you wanted to look at life for yourselfbut you were not allowed you were punished for your wish you were ground in the very mill of the conventional  oh yes ive been punished isabel sobbed  he listened to her a little and then continued was he very bad about your coming  he made it very hard for me but i dont care  it is all over then between you  oh no i dont think anythings over  are you going back to him ralph gasped  i dont knowi cant tell i shall stay here as long as i may i dont want to thinki neednt think i dont care for anything but you and thats enough for the present it will last a little yet here on my knees with you dying in my arms im happier than i have been for a long time and i want you to be happynot to think of anything sad only to feel that im near you and i love you why should there be pain in such hours as this what have we to do with pain thats not the deepest thing theres something deeper  ralph evidently found from moment to moment greater difficulty in speaking he had to wait longer to collect himself at first he appeared to make no response to these last words he let a long time elapse then he murmured simply you must stay here  i should like to stayas long as seems right  as seems rightas seems right he repeated her words yes you think a great deal about that  of course one must youre very tired said isabel  im very tired you said just now that pains not the deepest thing nono but its very deep if i could stay  for me youll always be here she softly interrupted it was easy to interrupt him  but he went on after a moment it passes after all its passing now but love remains i dont know why we should suffer so much perhaps i shall find out there are many things in life youre very young  i feel very old said isabel  youll grow young again thats how i see you i dont believei dont believe but he stopped again his strength failed him  she begged him to be quiet now we neednt speak to understand each other she said  i dont believe that such a generous mistake as yours can hurt you for more than a little  oh ralph im very happy now she cried through her tears  and remember this he continued that if youve been hated youve also been loved ah but isabeladored he just audibly and lingeringly breathed  oh my brother she cried with a movement of still deeper prostration    chapter lv  he had told her the first evening she ever spent at gardencourt that if she should live to suffer enough she might some day see the ghost with which the old house was duly provided she apparently had fulfilled the necessary condition for the next morning in the cold faint dawn she knew that a spirit was standing by her bed she had lain down without undressing it being her belief that ralph would not outlast the night she had no inclination to sleep she was waiting and such waiting was wakeful but she closed her eyes she believed that as the night wore on she should hear a knock at her door she heard no knock but at the time the darkness began vaguely to grow grey she started up from her pillow as abruptly as if she had received a summons it seemed to her for an instant that he was standing therea vague hovering figure in the vagueness of the room she stared a moment she saw his white facehis kind eyes then she saw there was nothing she was not afraid she was only sure she quitted the place and in her certainty passed through dark corridors and down a flight of oaken steps that shone in the vague light of a hallwindow outside ralphs door she stopped a moment listening but she seemed to hear only the hush that filled it she opened the door with a hand as gentle as if she were lifting a veil from the face of the dead and saw mrs touchett sitting motionless and upright beside the couch of her son with one of his hands in her own the doctor was on the other side with poor ralphs further wrist resting in his professional fingers the two nurses were at the foot between them mrs touchett took no notice of isabel but the doctor looked at her very hard then he gently placed ralphs hand in a proper position close beside him the nurse looked at her very hard too and no one said a word but isabel only looked at what she had come to see it was fairer than ralph had ever been in life and there was a strange resemblance to the face of his father which six years before she had seen lying on the same pillow she went to her aunt and put her arm around her and mrs touchett who as a general thing neither invited nor enjoyed caresses submitted for a moment to this one rising as might be to take it but she was stiff and dryeyed her acute white face was terrible  dear aunt lydia isabel murmured  go and thank god youve no child said mrs touchett disengaging herself  three days after this a considerable number of people found time at the height of the london season to take a morning train down to a quiet station in berkshire and spend half an hour in a small grey church which stood within an easy walk it was in the green burialplace of this edifice that mrs touchett consigned her son to earth she stood herself at the edge of the grave and isabel stood beside her the sexton himself had not a more practical interest in the scene than mrs touchett it was a solemn occasion but neither a harsh nor a heavy one there was a certain geniality in the appearance of things the weather had changed to fair the day one of the last of the treacherous maytime was warm and windless and the air had the brightness of the hawthorn and the blackbird if it was sad to think of poor touchett it was not too sad since death for him had had no violence he had been dying so long he was so ready everything had been so expected and prepared there were tears in isabels eyes but they were not tears that blinded she looked through them at the beauty of the day the splendour of nature the sweetness of the old english churchyard the bowed heads of good friends lord warburton was there and a group of gentlemen all unknown to her several of whom as she afterwards learned were connected with the bank and there were others whom she knew miss stackpole was among the first with honest mr bantling beside her and caspar goodwood lifting his head higher than the restbowing it rather less during much of the time isabel was conscious of mr goodwoods gaze he looked at her somewhat harder than he usually looked in public while the others had fixed their eyes upon the churchyard turf but she never let him see that she saw him she thought of him only to wonder that he was still in england she found she had taken for granted that after accompanying ralph to gardencourt he had gone away she remembered how little it was a country that pleased him he was there however very distinctly there and something in his attitude seemed to say that he was there with a complex intention she wouldnt meet his eyes though there was doubtless sympathy in them he made her rather uneasy with the dispersal of the little group he disappeared and the only person who came to speak to herthough several spoke to mrs touchettwas henrietta stackpole henrietta had been crying  ralph had said to isabel that he hoped she would remain at gardencourt and she made no immediate motion to leave the place she said to herself that it was but common charity to stay a little with her aunt it was fortunate she had so good a formula otherwise she might have been greatly in want of one her errand was over she had done what she had left her husband to do she had a husband in a foreign city counting the hours of her absence in such a case one needed an excellent motive he was not one of the best husbands but that didnt alter the case certain obligations were involved in the very fact of marriage and were quite independent of the quantity of enjoyment extracted from it isabel thought of her husband as little as might be but now that she was at a distance beyond its spell she thought with a kind of spiritual shudder of rome there was a penetrating chill in the image and she drew back into the deepest shade of gardencourt she lived from day to day postponing closing her eyes trying not to think she knew she must decide but she decided nothing her coming itself had not been a decision on that occasion she had simply started osmond gave no sound and now evidently would give none he would leave it all to her from pansy she heard nothing but that was very simple her father had told her not to write  mrs touchett accepted isabels company but offered her no assistance she appeared to be absorbed in considering without enthusiasm but with perfect lucidity the new conveniences of her own situation mrs touchett was not an optimist but even from painful occurrences she managed to extract a certain utility this consisted in the reflexion that after all such things happened to other people and not to herself death was disagreeable but in this case it was her sons death not her own she had never flattered herself that her own would be disagreeable to any one but mrs touchett she was better off than poor ralph who had left all the commodities of life behind him and indeed all the security since the worst of dying was to mrs touchetts mind that it exposed one to be taken advantage of for herself she was on the spot there was nothing so good as that she made known to isabel very punctuallyit was the evening her son was buriedseveral of ralphs testamentary arrangements he had told her everything had consulted her about everything he left her no money of course she had no need of money he left her the furniture of gardencourt exclusive of the pictures and books and the use of the place for a year after which it was to be sold the money produced by the sale was to constitute an endowment for a hospital for poor persons suffering from the malady of which he died and of this portion of the will lord warburton was appointed executor the rest of his property which was to be withdrawn from the bank was disposed of in various bequests several of them to those cousins in vermont to whom his father had already been so bountiful then there were a number of small legacies  some of them are extremely peculiar said mrs touchett he has left considerable sums to persons i never heard of he gave me a list and i asked then who some of them were and he told me they were people who at various times had seemed to like him apparently he thought you didnt like him for he hasnt left you a penny it was his opinion that you had been handsomely treated by his father which im bound to say i think you werethough i dont mean that i ever heard him complain of it the pictures are to be dispersed he has distributed them about one by one as little keepsakes the most valuable of the collection goes to lord warburton and what do you think he has done with his library it sounds like a practical joke he has left it to your friend miss stackpolein recognition of her services to literature does he mean her following him up from rome was that a service to literature it contains a great many rare and valuable books and as she cant carry it about the world in her trunk he recommends her to sell it at auction she will sell it of course at christies and with the proceeds shell set up a newspaper will that be a service to literature  this question isabel forbore to answer as it exceeded the little interrogatory to which she had deemed it necessary to submit on her arrival besides she had never been less interested in literature than today as she found when she occasionally took down from the shelf one of the rare and valuable volumes of which mrs touchett had spoken she was quite unable to read her attention had never been so little at her command one afternoon in the library about a week after the ceremony in the churchyard she was trying to fix it for an hour but her eyes often wandered from the book in her hand to the open window which looked down the long avenue it was in this way that she saw a modest vehicle approach the door and perceived lord warburton sitting in rather an uncomfortable attitude in a corner of it he had always had a high standard of courtesy and it was therefore not remarkable under the circumstances that he should have taken the trouble to come down from london to call on mrs touchett it was of course mrs touchett he had come to see and not mrs osmond and to prove to herself the validity of this thesis isabel presently stepped out of the house and wandered away into the park since her arrival at gardencourt she had been but little out of doors the weather being unfavourable for visiting the grounds this evening however was fine and at first it struck her as a happy thought to have come out the theory i have just mentioned was plausible enough but it brought her little rest and if you had seen her pacing about you would have said she had a bad conscience she was not pacified when at the end of a quarter of an hour finding herself in view of the house she saw mrs touchett emerge from the portico accompanied by her visitor her aunt had evidently proposed to lord warburton that they should come in search of her she was in no humour for visitors and if she had had a chance would have drawn back behind one of the great trees but she saw she had been seen and that nothing was left her but to advance as the lawn at gardencourt was a vast expanse this took some time during which she observed that as he walked beside his hostess lord warburton kept his hands rather stiffly behind him and his eyes upon the ground both persons apparently were silent but mrs touchetts thin little glance as she directed it toward isabel had even at a distance an expression it seemed to say with cutting sharpness heres the eminently amenable nobleman you might have married when lord warburton lifted his own eyes however that was not what they said they only said this is rather awkward you know and i depend upon you to help me he was very grave very proper and for the first time since isabel had known him greeted her without a smile even in his days of distress he had always begun with a smile he looked extremely selfconscious  lord warburton has been so good as to come out to see me said mrs touchett he tells me he didnt know you were still here i know hes an old friend of yours and as i was told you were not in the house i brought him out to see for himself  oh i saw there was a good train at 640 that would get me back in time for dinner mrs touchetts companion rather irrelevantly explained im so glad to find youve not gone  im not here for long you know isabel said with a certain eagerness  i suppose not but i hope its for some weeks you came to england sooner thanathan you thought  yes i came very suddenly  mrs touchett turned away as if she were looking at the condition of the grounds which indeed was not what it should be while lord warburton hesitated a little isabel fancied he had been on the point of asking about her husbandrather confusedlyand then had checked himself he continued immitigably grave either because he thought it becoming in a place over which death had just passed or for more personal reasons if he was conscious of personal reasons it was very fortunate that he had the cover of the former motive he could make the most of that isabel thought of all this it was not that his face was sad for that was another matter but it was strangely inexpressive  my sisters would have been so glad to come if they had known you were still hereif they had thought you would see them lord warburton went on do kindly let them see you before you leave england  it would give me great pleasure i have such a friendly recollection of them  i dont know whether you would come to lockleigh for a day or two you know theres always that old promise and his lordship coloured a little as he made this suggestion which gave his face a somewhat more familiar air perhaps im not right in saying that just now of course youre not thinking of visiting but i meant what would hardly be a visit my sisters are to be at lockleigh at whitsuntide for five days and if you could come thenas you say youre not to be very long in englandi would see that there should be literally no one else  isabel wondered if not even the young lady he was to marry would be there with her mamma but she did not express this idea  thank you extremely she contented herself with saying im afraid i hardly know about whitsuntide  but i have your promisehavent ifor some other time  there was an interrogation in this but isabel let it pass she looked at her interlocutor a moment and the result of her observation was thatas had happened beforeshe felt sorry for him take care you dont miss your train she said and then she added i wish you every happiness  he blushed again more than before and he looked at his watch ah yes 640 i havent much time but ive a fly at the door thank you very much it was not apparent whether the thanks applied to her having reminded him of his train or to the more sentimental remark goodbye mrs osmond goodbye he shook hands with her without meeting her eyes and then he turned to mrs touchett who had wandered back to them with her his parting was equally brief and in a moment the two ladies saw him move with long steps across the lawn  are you very sure hes to be married isabel asked of her aunt  i cant be surer than he but he seems sure i congratulated him and he accepted it  ah said isabel i give it upwhile her aunt returned to the house and to those avocations which the visitor had interrupted  she gave it up but she still thought of itthought of it while she strolled again under the great oaks whose shadows were long upon the acres of turf at the end of a few minutes she found herself near a rustic bench which a moment after she had looked at it struck her as an object recognised it was not simply that she had seen it before nor even that she had sat upon it it was that on this spot something important had happened to herthat the place had an air of association then she remembered that she had been sitting there six years before when a servant brought her from the house the letter in which caspar goodwood informed her that he had followed her to europe and that when she had read the letter she looked up to hear lord warburton announcing that he should like to marry her it was indeed an historical an interesting bench she stood and looked at it as if it might have something to say to her she wouldnt sit down on it nowshe felt rather afraid of it she only stood before it and while she stood the past came back to her in one of those rushing waves of emotion by which persons of sensibility are visited at odd hours the effect of this agitation was a sudden sense of being very tired under the influence of which she overcame her scruples and sank into the rustic seat i have said that she was restless and unable to occupy herself and whether or no if you had seen her there you would have admired the justice of the former epithet you would at least have allowed that at this moment she was the image of a victim of idleness her attitude had a singular absence of purpose her hands hanging at her sides lost themselves in the folds of her black dress her eyes gazed vaguely before her there was nothing to recall her to the house the two ladies in their seclusion dined early and had tea at an indefinite hour how long she had sat in this position she could not have told you but the twilight had grown thick when she became aware that she was not alone she quickly straightened herself glancing about and then saw what had become of her solitude she was sharing it with caspar goodwood who stood looking at her a few yards off and whose footfall on the unresonant turf as he came near she had not heard it occurred to her in the midst of this that it was just so lord warburton had surprised her of old  she instantly rose and as soon as goodwood saw he was seen he started forward she had had time only to rise when with a motion that looked like violence but felt likeshe knew not what he grasped her by the wrist and made her sink again into the seat she closed her eyes he had not hurt her it was only a touch which she had obeyed but there was something in his face that she wished not to see that was the way he had looked at her the other day in the churchyard only at present it was worse he said nothing at first she only felt him close to herbeside her on the bench and pressingly turned to her it almost seemed to her that no one had ever been so close to her as that all this however took but an instant at the end of which she had disengaged her wrist turning her eyes upon her visitant youve frightened me she said  i didnt mean to he answered but if i did a little no matter i came from london a while ago by the train but i couldnt come here directly there was a man at the station who got ahead of me he took a fly that was there and i heard him give the order to drive here i dont know who he was but i didnt want to come with him i wanted to see you alone so ive been waiting and walking about ive walked all over and i was just coming to the house when i saw you here there was a keeper or someone who met me but that was all right because i had made his acquaintance when i came here with your cousin is that gentleman gone are you really alone i want to speak to you goodwood spoke very fast he was as excited as when they had parted in rome isabel had hoped that condition would subside and she shrank into herself as she perceived that on the contrary he had only let out sail she had a new sensation he had never produced it before it was a feeling of danger there was indeed something really formidable in his resolution she gazed straight before her he with a hand on each knee leaned forward looking deeply into her face the twilight seemed to darken round them i want to speak to you he repeated ive something particular to say i dont want to trouble youas i did the other day in rome that was of no use it only distressed you i couldnt help it i knew i was wrong but im not wrong now please dont think i am he went on with his hard deep voice melting a moment into entreaty i came here today for a purpose its very different it was vain for me to speak to you then but now i can help you  she couldnt have told you whether it was because she was afraid or because such a voice in the darkness seemed of necessity a boon but she listened to him as she had never listened before his words dropped deep into her soul they produced a sort of stillness in all her being and it was with an effort in a moment that she answered him how can you help me she asked in a low tone as if she were taking what he had said seriously enough to make the enquiry in confidence  by inducing you to trust me now i knowtoday i know do you remember what i asked you in rome then i was quite in the dark but today i know on good authority everythings clear to me today it was a good thing when you made me come away with your cousin he was a good man a fine man one of the best he told me how the case stands for you he explained everything he guessed my sentiments he was a member of your family and he left youso long as you should be in englandto my care said goodwood as if he were making a great point do you know what he said to me the last time i saw himas he lay there where he died he said do everything you can for her do everything shell let you  isabel suddenly got up you had no business to talk about me  why notwhy not when we talked in that way he demanded following her fast and he was dyingwhen a mans dying its different she checked the movement she had made to leave him she was listening more than ever it was true that he was not the same as that last time that had been aimless fruitless passion but at present he had an idea which she scented in all her being but it doesnt matter he exclaimed pressing her still harder though now without touching a hem of her garment if touchett had never opened his mouth i should have known all the same i had only to look at you at your cousins funeral to see whats the matter with you you cant deceive me any more for gods sake be honest with a man whos so honest with you youre the most unhappy of women and your husbands the deadliest of fiends  she turned on him as if he had struck her are you mad she cried  ive never been so sane i see the whole thing dont think its necessary to defend him but i wont say another word against him ill speak only of you goodwood added quickly how can you pretend youre not heartbroken you dont know what to doyou dont know where to turn its too late to play a part didnt you leave all that behind you in rome touchett knew all about it and i knew it toowhat it would cost you to come here it will have cost you your life say it willand he flared almost into anger give me one word of truth when i know such a horror as that how can i keep myself from wishing to save you what would you think of me if i should stand still and see you go back to your reward its awful what shell have to pay for itthats what touchett said to me i may tell you that maynt i he was such a near relation cried goodwood making his queer grim point again id sooner have been shot than let another man say those things to me but he was different he seemed to me to have the right it was after he got homewhen he saw he was dying and when i saw it too i understand all about it youre afraid to go back youre perfectly alone you dont know where to turn you cant turn anywhere you know that perfectly now it is therefore that i want you to think of me  to think of you isabel said standing before him in the dusk the idea of which she had caught a glimpse a few moments before now loomed large she threw back her head a little she stared at it as if it had been a comet in the sky  you dont know where to turn turn straight to me i want to persuade you to trust me goodwood repeated and then he paused with his shining eyes why should you go backwhy should you go through that ghastly form  to get away from you she answered but this expressed only a little of what she felt the rest was that she had never been loved before she had believed it but this was different this was the hot wind of the desert at the approach of which the others dropped dead like mere sweet airs of the garden it wrapped her about it lifted her off her feet while the very taste of it as of something potent acrid and strange forced open her set teeth  at first in rejoinder to what she had said it seemed to her that he would break out into greater violence but after an instant he was perfectly quiet he wished to prove he was sane that he had reasoned it all out i want to prevent that and i think i may if youll only for once listen to me its too monstrous of you to think of sinking back into that misery of going to open your mouth to that poisoned air its you that are out of your mind trust me as if i had the care of you why shouldnt we be happywhen its here before us when its so easy im yours for everfor ever and ever here i stand im as firm as a rock what have you to care about youve no children that perhaps would be an obstacle as it is youve nothing to consider you must save what you can of your life you mustnt lose it all simply because youve lost a part it would be an insult to you to assume that you care for the look of the thing for what people will say for the bottomless idiocy of the world weve nothing to do with all that were quite out of it we look at things as they are you took the great step in coming away the next is nothing its the natural one i swear as i stand here that a woman deliberately made to suffer is justified in anything in lifein going down into the streets if that will help her i know how you suffer and thats why im here we can do absolutely as we please to whom under the sun do we owe anything what is it that holds us what is it that has the smallest right to interfere in such a question as this such a question is between ourselvesand to say that is to settle it were we born to rot in our miserywere we born to be afraid i never knew you afraid if youll only trust me how little you will be disappointed the worlds all before usand the worlds very big i know something about that  isabel gave a long murmur like a creature in pain it was as if he were pressing something that hurt her  the worlds very small she said at random she had an immense desire to appear to resist she said it at random to hear herself say something but it was not what she meant the world in truth had never seemed so large it seemed to open out all round her to take the form of a mighty sea where she floated in fathomless waters she had wanted help and here was help it had come in a rushing torrent i know not whether she believed everything he said but she believed just then that to let him take her in his arms would be the next best thing to her dying this belief for a moment was a kind of rapture in which she felt herself sink and sink in the movement she seemed to beat with her feet in order to catch herself to feel something to rest on  ah be mine as im yours she heard her companion cry he had suddenly given up argument and his voice seemed to come harsh and terrible through a confusion of vaguer sounds  this however of course was but a subjective fact as the metaphysicians say the confusion the noise of waters all the rest of it were in her own swimming head in an instant she became aware of this do me the greatest kindness of all she panted i beseech you to go away  ah dont say that dont kill me he cried  she clasped her hands her eyes were streaming with tears as you love me as you pity me leave me alone  he glared at her a moment through the dusk and the next instant she felt his arms about her and his lips on her own lips his kiss was like white lightning a flash that spread and spread again and stayed and it was extraordinarily as if while she took it she felt each thing in his hard manhood that had least pleased her each aggressive fact of his face his figure his presence justified of its intense identity and made one with this act of possession so had she heard of those wrecked and under water following a train of images before they sink but when darkness returned she was free she never looked about her she only darted from the spot there were lights in the windows of the house they shone far across the lawn in an extraordinarily short timefor the distance was considerableshe had moved through the darkness for she saw nothing and reached the door here only she paused she looked all about her she listened a little then she put her hand on the latch she had not known where to turn but she knew now there was a very straight path  two days afterwards caspar goodwood knocked at the door of the house in wimpole street in which henrietta stackpole occupied furnished lodgings he had hardly removed his hand from the knocker when the door was opened and miss stackpole herself stood before him she had on her hat and jacket she was on the point of going out oh goodmorning he said i was in hopes i should find mrs osmond  henrietta kept him waiting a moment for her reply but there was a good deal of expression about miss stackpole even when she was silent pray what led you to suppose she was here  i went down to gardencourt this morning and the servant told me she had come to london he believed she was to come to you  again miss stackpole held himwith an intention of perfect kindnessin suspense she came here yesterday and spent the night but this morning she started for rome  caspar goodwood was not looking at her his eyes were fastened on the doorstep oh she started he stammered and without finishing his phrase or looking up he stiffly averted himself but he couldnt otherwise move  henrietta had come out closing the door behind her and now she put out her hand and grasped his arm look here mr goodwood she said just you wait  on which he looked up at herbut only to guess from her face with a revulsion that she simply meant he was young she stood shining at him with that cheap comfort and it added on the spot thirty years to his life she walked him away with her however as if she had given him now the key to patience
