 part i  uncle ethans speculation in patent medicines    a certain guileless trust in human kind   too often leads them into nets   spread by some wandering trader   smooth and deft and sure   uncle ethan ripley   uncle ethan had a theory that a mans character could be told by the way he sat in a wagon seat  a mean man sets right plumb in the middle o the seat as much as to say walk gol darn yeh who cares but a man that sets in one corner o the seat much as to say jump incheaper t ride n to walk you can jest tie to  uncle ripley was prejudiced in favor of the stranger therefore before he came opposite the potato patch where the old man was bugging his vines the stranger drove a jadedlooking pair of calico ponies hitched to a clattering democrat wagon and he sat on the extreme end of the seat with the lines in his right hand while his left rested on his thigh with his little finger gracefully crooked and his elbows akimbo he wore a blue shirt with gaycolored armlets just above the elbows and his vest hung unbuttoned down his lank ribs it was plain he was well pleased with himself  as he pulled up and threw one leg over the end of the seat uncle ethan observed that the left spring was much more worn than the other which proved that it was not accidental but that it was the drivers habit to sit on that end of the seat  good afternoon said the stranger pleasantly  good afternoon sir  bugs purty plenty  plenty enough i gol i dont see where they all come fum  early rose inquired the man as if referring to the bugs  no peachblows an carter reds my early rose is over near the house the old woman wants em near see the darned things he pursued rapping savagely on the edge of the pan to rattle the bugs back  how do yeh kill emscald em  mostly sometimes i  good piece of oats yawned the stranger listlessly  thats barley  so tis didnt notice  uncle ethan was wondering what the man was he had some pots of black paint in the wagon and two or three square boxes  what do yeh think o clevelands chances for a second term continued the man as if they had been talking politics all the while  uncle ripley scratched his head waali dunnobein a republicani think   thats soits a purty scaly outlook i dont believe in second terms myself the man hastened to say  is that your new barn acrost there pointing with his whip  yes sir it is replied the old man proudly after years of planning and hard work he had managed to erect a little wooden barn costing possibly three hundred dollars it was plain to be seen he took a childish pride in the fact of its newness  the stranger mused a lovely place for a sign he said as his eyes wandered across its shining yellow broadside  uncle ethan stared unmindful of the bugs crawling over the edge of his pan his interest in the pots of paint deepened  couldnt think o lettin me paint a sign on that barn the stranger continued putting his locked hands around one knee and gazing away across the pigpen at the building  what kind of a sign gol darn your skins uncle ethan pounded the pan with his paddle and scraped two or three crawling abominations off his leathery wrist  it was a beautiful day and the man in the wagon seemed unusually loath to attend to business the tired ponies slept in the shade of the lombardies the plain was draped in a warm mist and shadowed by vast vaguely defined masses of cloudsa lazy june day  dodds family bitters said the man waking out of his abstraction with a start and resuming his working manner the best bitter in the market he alluded to it in the singular like to look at it no trouble to show goods as the fellah says he went on hastily seeing uncle ethans hesitation  he produced a large bottle of triangular shape like a bottle for pickled onions it had a red seal on top and a strenuous caution in red letters on the neck none genuine unless dodds family bitters is blown in the bottom  heres what it cures pursued the agent pointing at the side where in an inverted pyramid the names of several hundred diseases were arranged running from gout to pulmonary complaints etc  i gol she cuts a wide swath dont she exclaimed uncle ethan profoundly impressed with the list  they aint no better bitter in the world said the agent with a conclusive inflection  whats its speshyality most of em have some speshyality  wellsummer complaintsananspring an fall troublestones ye up sort of  uncle ethans forgotten pan was empty of his gathered bugs he was deeply interested in this man there was something he liked about him  what does it sell fur he asked after a pause  same price as them cheap medicinesdollar a bottlebig bottles too want one  wal mother aint to home an i dont know as shed like this kind we aint been sick fr years still theys no tellin he added seeing the answer to his objection in the agents eyes times is purty close too with us y see weve jest built that stable   say ill tell yeh what ill do said the stranger waking up and speaking in a warmly generous tone ill give you ten bottles of the bitter if youll let me paint a sign on that barn it wont hurt the barn a bit and if you want o you can paint it out a year from date come what d ye say  i guess i hadnt better  the agent thought that uncle ethan was after more pay but in reality he was thinking of what his little old wife would say  it simply puts a family bitter in your home that may save you fifty dollars this comin fall you cant tell  just what the man said after that uncle ethan didnt follow his voice had a confidential purring sound as he stretched across the wagonseat and talked on eyes half shut he straightened up at last and concluded in the tone of one who has carried his point  so if you didnt want to use the whole twentyfive bottles yrself why sell it to your neighbors you can get twenty dollars out of it easy and still have five bottles of the best family bitter that ever went into a bottle  it was the thought of this opportunity to get a buffaloskin coat that consoled uncle ethan as he saw the hideous black letters appearing under the agents lazy brush  it was the hot side of the barn and painting was no light work the agent was forced to mop his forehead with his sleeve  say haint got a cooky or anything and a cup o milk handy he said at the end of the first enormous word which ran the whole length of the barn  uncle ethan got him the milk and cooky which he ate with an exaggeratedly dainty action of his fingers seated meanwhile on the staging which uncle ripley had helped him to build this lunch infused new energy into him and in a short time dodds family bitters best in the market disfigured the sweetsmelling pine boards                                       ethan was eating his selfobtained supper of bread and milk when his wife came home  whos been apaintin on that barn she demanded her beadlike eyes flashing her withered little face set in an ominous frown ethan ripley what you been doin  nawthin he replied feebly  who painted that sign on there  a man come along an he wanted to paint that on there and i let im and its my barn anyway i guess i can do what im a min to with it he ended defiantly but his eyes wavered  mrs ripley ignored the defiance what under the sun psessed you to do such a thing as that ethan ripley i declare i dont see you git fooler an fooler evry day you live i do believe  uncle ethan attempted a defense  well he paid me twentyfive dollars fr it anyway  did e she was visibly affected by this news  well anyhow it amounts to that he give me twentyfive bottles  mrs ripley sank back in her chair well i swan to bungay ethan ripleywal you beat all i ever see she added in despair of expression i thought you had some sense left but you haint not one blessed scimpton where is the stuff  down cellar an you neednt take on no airs ol woman ive known you to buy things you didnt need time an time n agin tins and things an i guess you wish you had back that ten dollars you paid for that illustrated bible  go long an bring that stuff up here i never see such a man in my life its a wonder he didnt do it fr two bottles she glared out at the sign which faced directly upon the kitchen window  uncle ethan tugged the two cases up and set them down on the floor of the kitchen mrs ripley opened a bottle and smelled of it like a cautious cat  ugh merciful sakes what stuff it aint fit fr a hog to take whatd you think you was gointo do with it she asked in poignant disgust  i expected to take itif i was sick whaddy ye spose he defiantly stood his ground towering above her like a leaning tower  the hull cartload of it  no im goin to sell part of it an git me an overcoat  sell it she shouted nobuddyll buy that sicknin stuff but an old numbskull like you take that slop out o the house this minute take it right down to the sinkhole an smash every bottle on the stones  uncle ethan and the cases of medicine disappeared and the old woman addressed her concluding remarks to little tewksbury her grandson who stood timidly on one leg in the doorway like an intruding pullet  everything around this place ud go to rack an ruin if i didnt keep a watch on that softpated old dummy i thought that lighteninrod man had give him a lesson hed remember but no he must go an make a reglar  she subsided in a tumult of banging pans which helped her out in the matter of expression and reduced her to a grim sort of quiet uncle ethan went about the house like a convict on shipboard once she caught him looking out of the window  i should think youd feel proud o that  uncle ethan had never been sick a day in his life he was bent and bruised with neverending toil but he had nothing especial the matter with him  he did not smash the medicine as mrs ripley commanded because he had determined to sell it the next sunday morning after his chores were done he put on his best coat of faded diagonal and was brushing his hair into a ridge across the center of his high narrow head when mrs ripley came in from feeding the calves  where you goin now  none o your business he replied its darn funny if i cant stir without you wantin to know all about it wheres tewky  feedin the chickens you aint goin to take him off this mornin now i dont care where you go  whos agoin to take him off i aint said nothin about takin him off  wall take yrself off an if y aint here fr dinner i aint goin to get no supper  ripley took a waterpail and put four bottles of the bitter into it and trudged away up the road with it in a pleasant glow of hope all nature seemed to declare the day a time of rest and invited men to disassociate ideas of toil from the rustling green wheat shining grass and tossing blooms something of the sweetness and buoyancy of all nature permeated the old mans workcalloused body and he whistled little snatches of the dance tunes he played on his fiddle  but he found neighbor johnson to be supplied with another variety of bitter which was all he needed for the present he qualified his refusal to buy with a cordial invitation to go out and see his shotes in which he took infinite pride but uncle ripley said i guess ill haf t be goin i want o git up to jennings before dinner  he couldnt help feeling a little depressed when he found jennings away the next house along the pleasant lane was inhabited by a newcomer he was sitting on the horsetrough holding a horses halter while his hired man dashed cold water upon the galled spot on the animals shoulder  after some preliminary talk ripley presented his medicine  hell no what do i want of such stuff when theys anything the matter with me i take a lunkin ol swig of popplebark and bourbon that fixes me  uncle ethan moved off up the lane he hardly felt like whistling now at the next house he set his pail down in the weeds beside the fence and went in without it doudney came to the door in his bare feet buttoning his suspenders over a clean boiled shirt he was dressing to go out  hello ripley i was just goin down your way jest wait a minute an ill be out  when he came out fully dressed uncle ethan grappled him say what d you think o paytent med  some of em are boss but y want o know what yre gittn  what d ye think o dodds  best in the market  uncle ethan straightened up and his face lighted doudney went on  yes sir best bitter that ever went into a bottle i know ive tried it i dont go much on patent medicines but when i get a good  dont want o buy a bottle  doudney turned and faced him  buy no ive got nineteen bottles i want o sell ripley glanced up at doudneys new granary and there read dodds family bitters he was stricken dumb doudney saw it all and roared  wal thats a good one we two tryin to sell each other bitters hohohohar whoop wal this is rich how many bottles did you git  none o your business said uncle ethan as he turned and made off while doudney screamed with merriment  on his way home uncle ethan grew ashamed of his burden doudney had canvassed the whole neighborhood and he practically gave up the struggle everybody he met seemed determined to find out what he had been doing and at last he began lying about it  hello uncle ripley what y got there in that pail  goose eggs fr settin  he disposed of one bottle to old gus peterson gus never paid his debts and he would only promise fifty cents on tick for the bottle and yet so desperate was ripley that this quasi sale cheered him up not a little  as he came down the road tired dusty and hungry he climbed over the fence in order to avoid seeing that sign on the barn and slunk into the house without looking back  he couldnt have felt meaner about it if he had allowed a democratic poster to be pasted there  the evening passed in grim silence and in sleep he saw that sign wriggling across the side of the barn like boaconstrictors hung on rails he tried to paint them out but every time he tried it the man seemed to come back with a sheriff and savagely warned him to let it stay till the year was up in some mysterious way the agent seemed to know every time he brought out the paintpot and he was no longer the pleasantvoiced individual who drove the calico ponies  as he stepped out into the yard next morning that abominable sickening scrawling advertisement was the first thing that claimed his glanceit blotted out the beauty of the morning  mrs ripley came to the window buttoning her dress at the throat a whisp of her hair sticking assertively from the little knob at the back of her head  lovely aint it an ive got to see it all day long i cant look out the winder but that things right in my face it seemed to make her savage she hadnt been in such a temper since her visit to new york i hope you feel satisfied with it  ripley walked off to the barn his pride in its clean sweet newness was gone he slyly tried the paint to see if it couldnt be scraped off but it was dried in thoroughly whereas before he had taken delight in having his neighbors turn and look at the building now he kept out of sight whenever he saw a team coming he hoed corn away in the back of the field when he should have been bugging potatoes by the roadside  mrs ripley was in a frightful mood about it but she held herself in check for several days at last she burst forth  ethan ripley i cant stand that thing any longer and i aint goin to thats all youve got to go and paint that thing out or i will im just about crazy with it  but mother i promised   i dont care what you promised its got to be painted out ive got the nightmare now seem it im goin to send fr a pail o red paint and im goin to paint that out if it takes the last breath ive got to do it  ill tend to it mother if you wont hurry me  i cant stand it another day it makes me boil every time i look out the winder  uncle ethan hitched up his team and drove gloomily off to town where he tried to find the agent he lived in some other part of the county however and so the old man gave up and bought a pot of red paint not daring to go back to his desperate wife without it  goin to paint yr new barn inquired the merchant with friendly interest  uncle ethan turned with guilty sharpness but the merchants face was grave and kindly  yes i thought id touch it up a littledont cost much  it paysalways the merchant said emphatically  will itstick jest as well put on evenings inquired uncle ethan hesitatingly  yeswont make any difference why aint goin to have  waali kind o thought id do it odd times night an morninkind o odd times  he seemed oddly confused about it and the merchant looked after him anxiously as he drove away  after supper that night he went out to the barn and mrs ripley heard him sawing and hammering then the noise ceased and he came in and sat down in his usual place  what y ben makin she inquired tewksbury had gone to bed she sat darning a stocking  i jest thought id git the stagin ready fr paintin he said evasively  waal ill be glad when its covered up when she got ready for bed he was still seated in his chair and after she had dozed off two or three times she began to wonder why he didnt come when the clock struck ten and she realized that he had not stirred she began to get impatient come are y goin to sit there all night there was no reply she rose up in bed and looked about the room the broad moon flooded it with light so that she could see he was not asleep in his chair as she had supposed there was something ominous in his disappearance  ethan ethan ripley where are yeh there was no reply to her sharp call she rose and distractedly looked about among the furniture as if he might somehow be a cat and be hiding in a corner somewhere then she went upstairs where the boy slept her hard little heels making a curious tunking noise on the bare boards the moon fell across the sleeping boy like a robe of silver he was alone  she began to be alarmed her eyes widened in fear all sorts of vague horrors sprang unbidden into her brain she still had the mist of sleep in her brain  she hurried down the stairs and out into the fragrant night the katydids were singing in infinite peace under the solemn splendor of the moon the cattle sniffed and sighed jangling their bells now and then and the chickens in the coops stirred uneasily as if overheated the old woman stood there in her bare feet and long nightgown horrorstricken the ghastly story of a man who had hung himself in his barn because his wife deserted him came into her mind and stayed there with frightful persistency her throat filled chokingly  she felt a wild rush of loneliness she had a sudden realization of how dear that gaunt old figure was with its grizzled face and ready smile her breath came quick and quicker and she was at the point of bursting into a wild cry to tewksbury when she heard a strange noise it came from the barn a creaking noise she looked that way and saw in the shadowed side a deeper shadow moving to and fro a revulsion to astonishment and anger took place in her  land o bungay if he aint paintin that barn like a perfect old idiot in the night  uncle ethan working desperately did not hear her feet pattering down the path and was startled by her shrill voice  well ethan ripley whaddy y think youre doin now  he made two or three slapping passes with the brush and then snapped im apaintin this barnwhaddy ye spose if ye had eyes y wouldnt ask  well you come right straight to bed what dyou mean by actin so  you go back into the house an let me be i know what im adoin youve pestered me about this sign jest about enough he dabbed his brush to and fro as he spoke his gaunt figure towered above her in shadow his slapping brush had a vicious sound  neither spoke for some time at length she said more gently aint you comin in  nonot till i get aready you go long an tend to yr own business dont stan there an ketch cold  she moved off slowly toward the house his voice subdued her working alone out there had rendered him savage he was not to be pushed any farther she knew by the tone of his voice that he must not be assaulted she slipped on her shoes and a shawl and came back where he was working and took a seat on a sawhorse  im agoin to set right here till you come in ethan ripley she said in a firm voice but gentler than usual  waal youll set a good while was his ungracious reply but each felt a furtive tenderness for the other he worked on in silence the boards creaked heavily as he walked to and fro and the slapping sound of the paintbrush sounded loud in the sweet harmony of the night the majestic moon swung slowly round the corner of the barn and fell upon the old mans grizzled head and bent shoulders the horses inside could be heard stamping the mosquitoes away and chewing their hay in pleasant chorus  the little figure seated on the sawhorse drew the shawl closer about her thin shoulders her eyes were in shadow and her hands were wrapped in her shawl at last she spoke in a curious tone  well i dont know as you was so very much to blame i didnt want that bible myselfi held out i did but i didnt  ethan worked on until the full meaning of this unprecedented surrender penetrated his head and then he threw down his brush  waal i guess ill let er go at that ive covered up the most of it anyhow guess wed better go in       part ii  the test of elder pill the country preacher    the lonely center of their social life   the low square schoolhouse stands     upon the windswept plain   hacked by thoughtless boyish hands   and gray and worn and warped with strife     of sleet and autumn rain   elder pill preacher  i   old man bacon was pinching forked barbs on a wire fence one rainy day in july when his neighbor jennings came along the road on his way to town jennings never went to town except when it rained too hard to work outdoors his neighbors said and of old man bacon it was said he never rested nights nor sundays  jennings pulled up good morning neighbor bacon  mornin rumbled the old man without looking up  taking it easy as usual i see think its going to clear up  may an may not dont make much differunce t me growled bacon discouragingly  heard about the plan for a church  naw  well were goin to hire elder pill from douglass to come over and preach every sunday afternoon at the schoolhouse an we want help t pay himthe laborer is worthy of his hire  sometimes he is an then agin he aint y neednt look t me fr a dollar i aint got no intrust in yr church  oh yes you havebesides yr wife   she aint got no more time n i have t go t church were obleeged to do bout all we cn stand t pay our debts let alone tryun to support a preacher and the old man shut the pinchers up on a barb with a vicious grip  easygoing mr jennings laughed in his silent way i guess youll help when the time comes he said and clucking to his team drove off  i guess i wont muttered the grizzled old giant as he went on with his work bacon was what is called landpoor in the west that is he had more land than money still he was able to give if he felt disposed it remains to say that he was not disposed being a sceptic and a scoffer it angered him to have jennings predict so confidently that he would help  the sun was striking redly through a rift in the clouds about three oclock in the afternoon when he saw a man coming up the lane walking on the grass at the side of the road and whistling merrily the old man looked at him from under his huge eyebrows with some curiosity as he drew near the pedestrian ceased to whistle and just as the farmer expected him to pass he stopped and said in a free and easy style  how de do give me a chaw tbaccer im pill the new minister i take finecut when i can get it he said as bacon put his hand into his pocket much obliged how goes it  tollable tollable said the astounded farmer looking hard at pill as he flung a handful of tobacco into his mouth  yes im the new minister sent around here to keep you fellows in the traces and out of hellfire have y fled from the wrath he asked in a perfunctory way  you are eh said bacon referring back to his profession  i am just how do you like that style of barb fence aint the twisted wire better  i spose they be but they cost more  yes costs more to go to heaven than to hell youll think so after i board with you a week narrow the road that leads to light and broad the way that leadshows your soul anyway brother  souls all right i find more trouble to keep m body gon  give us your hand so do i all the same we must prepare for the next world were gettin old lay not up your treasures where moth and rust corrupt and thieves break through and steal  bacon was thoroughly interested in the preacher and was studying him carefully he was tall straight and superbly proportioned broadshouldered widelunged and thewed like a greek racer his rather small steelblue eyes twinkled and his shrewd face and small head set well back completed a remarkable figure he wore his reddish beard in the usual way of western clergymen with mustache chopped close  bacon spoke slowly  you look like a good husky man to pitch in the barnyard youve too much muscle fr preachun  come and hear me next sunday and if you say so then ill quit replied mr pill quietly i give ye my word for it i believe in preachers havin a little of the flesh and the devil they can sympathize better with the rest of ye the sarcasm was lost on bacon who continued to look at him suddenly he said as if with an involuntary determination  where ye gon to stay tnight  i don know do you was the quick reply  i reckon ye can hang out with me f ye feel like ut we aint very purty ol woman an me but we eat you go along down the road and tell er i sent yeh yll find an ol dusty bible round somersi spose ye spend yr spare time readn about joshua an danl  i spend more time reading men well im off im hungrier n a gray wolf in a beartrap  and off he went as he came but he did not whistle he chewed  bacon felt as if he had made too much of a concession and had a strong inclination to shout after him and retract his invitation but he did not only worked on with an occasional bearlike grin there was something captivating in this fellows free and easy way  when he came up to the house an hour or two later in singular good humor for him he found the elder in the creamery with the old woman and marietta marietta was not more won by him than was jane bacon he was so genial and put on so few religious frills  mrs bacon never put on frills of any kind she was a most frightful toiler only excelled if excelled at all by her husband she was still muscular in her age and shapelessness unlovely at her best when about her work in her faded calico gown and flat shoes hair wisped into a slovenly knot she was depressing but she was a good woman of sterling integrity and ambitious for her girl  marietta was as attractive as her mother was depressing she was very young at this time and had the physical perfectionat least as regards bodythat her parents must have had in youth she was above the average height of woman with strong swell of bosom and glorious erect carriage of head her features were coarse but regular and pleasing and her manner boyish  elder pill was on the best of terms with them as he watched the milk being skimmed out of the submerged cans ready for the caaves and hawgs as mrs bacon called them  dad told you t come here nd stay t supper did he whats come over him said the girl with a sort of audacious humor  dad has an awful grutch agin preachers said mrs bacon as she wiped her hands on her apron i declare i dont see how   some preachers not all preachers laughed pill in his mellow nasal there are preachers and then again preachers im one o the tother kind  i shd think y was laughed the girl  now merry etty you run right t the pigpen with that milk whilst i go in an set the tea on  mr pill seized the can of milk saying with a twang show me the way that i may walk therein and accompanied by the laughing girl made rapid way to the pigpen just as the old man set up a ferocious shout to call the hired hand out of the cornfield  howd y come to send him here asked mrs bacon nodding toward pill  damfino i kind o liked himno nonsense about him answered bacon going into temporary eclipse behind his hands as he washed his face at the cistern  at the supper table pill was easy as an old shoe ate with his knife talked on fatting hogs suggested a few points on raising clover told of pioneer experiences in michigan and soon won themhired man and allto a most favorable opinion of himself but he did not trench on religious matters at all  the hired man in his shirtsleeves and smelling frightfully of tobacco and sweat as did bacon sat with open month at times forgetting to eat in his absorbing interest in the ministers yarns  yes ive got a family too much of a family in factthat is i think so sometimes when im pinched our western people are so indigentin plain terms poorthey cant do any better than they do but we pull throughwe pull through john you look like a stout fellow but ill bet a hat i can down you three out of five  i bet you cant grinned the hired man it was the climax of all that bet  ill take y in hand an flop y both roared bacon from his lionlike throat his eyes glistening with rare goodnature from the shadow of his gray brows but he admired the ministers broad shoulders at the same time if this fellow panned out as he promised he was a rare specimen  after supper the elder played a masterly game of croquet with marietta beating her with ease then he wandered out to the barn and talked horses with the hired man and finished by stripping off his coat and putting on one of mrs bacons aprons to help milk the cows                                       but at breakfast the next morning when the family were about pitching into their food as usual without ceremony wait said the visitor in an imperious tone and with lifted hand let us look to the lord for his blessing  they waited till the grace was said but it threw a depressing atmosphere over the meal evidently they considered the trouble begun at the end of the meal the minister asked  have you a bible in the house  i reckon theres one in the house somewhere merry go n see f y cant raise one said mrs bacon indifferently  have you any objection to family devotion asked pill as the book was placed in his hands by the girl  no have all you want said bacon as he rose from the table and passed out the door  i guess ill see the thing through said the hand it aint just square to leave the women folks to bear the brunt of it  it was shortly after breakfast that the elder concluded hed walk up to brother jennings and see about church matters  i shall expect you brother bacon to be at the service at 230  all right go ahead expectun responded bacon with an inscrutable sidewise glance  you promised you remember  thedevili did the old man snarled  the elder looked back with a smile and went off whistling in the warm bright morning     ii   the schoolhouse down on the creek was known as hells corners all through the county because of the frequent rows that took place therein at corkuses and the like and also because of the number of teachers that had been ousted by the boys in fact it was one of those places still to be found occasionally in the west far from railroads and schools where the primitive ignorance and ferocity of men still prowl like the panthers which are also found sometimes in the deeps of the iowa timber lands  the most of this ignorance and ferocity however was centered in the family of dixons a darkskinned unsavory group of missourians it consisted of old man dixon and wife and six sons all mangrown great gaunt sinewy fellows with no education but superstitious as savages if anything went wrong in hells corners everybody knew that the dixons were on the rampage again the schoolteachers were warned against the dixons and the preachers were besought to convert the dixons  in fact john jennings as he drove pill to the schoolhouse next day said  if you can convert the dixon boys elder ill give you the best horse in my barn  i work not for such hire said mr pill with a look of deep solemnity on his face belied indeed by a twinkle in his small keen eyea twinkle which made milton jennings laugh candidly  there was considerable curiosity expressed by a murmur of lips and voices as the ministers tall figure entered the door and stood for a moment in a study of the scene before him it was a characteristically western scene the women were rigidly on one side of the schoolroom the men as rigidly on the other the front seats were occupied by squirming boys and girls in their sunday splendor  on the back to the right were the young men in their best vests with paper collars and butterfly neckties with their coats unbuttoned their hair plastered down in a fascinating wave on their brown foreheads not a few were in their shirtsleeves the older men sat immediately between the youths and boys talking in hoarse whispers across the aisles about the state of the crops and the county ticket while the women in much the same way conversed about children and raising onions and strawberries it was their main recreation this sunday meeting  brethren rang out the imperious voice of the minister let us pray  the audience thoroughly enjoyed the elders prayer he was certainly gifted in that direction and his petition grew genuinely eloquent as his desires embraced the ends of the earth and the uttermst parts of the seas thereof but in the midst of it a clatter was heard and five or six strapping fellows filed in with loud thumpings of their brogans  shortly after they had settled themselves with elaborate impudence on the back seat the singing began just as they were singing the last verse every individual voice wavered and all but died out in astonishment to see william bacon come inan unheardof thing and with a clean shirt too bacon to tell the truth was feeling as much out of place as a cat in a bathtub and looked uncomfortable even shamefaced as he sidled in his shapeless hat gripped nervously in both hands coatless and collarless his shirt open at his massive throat the girls tittered of course and the boys hammered each others ribs moved by the unusual sight milton jennings sitting beside marietta said  well may i jump straight up and never come down  and shep watson said may i never see the back o my neck which pleased marietta so much that she grew purple with efforts to conceal her laughter she always enjoyed a joke on her father  but all things have an end and at last the room became quiet as mr pill began to read the scripture wondering a little at the commotion he suspected that those darkskinned grinning fellows on the back seat were the dixon boys and knew they were bent on fun the physique of the minister being carefully studied the boys began whispering among themselves and at last just as the sermon opened they began to push the line of young men on the long seat over toward the girls side squeezing milton against marietta this pleasantry encouraged one of them to whack his neighbor over the head with his soft hat causing great laughter and disturbance the preacher stopped his cool penetrating voice sounded strangely unclerical as he said  there are some fellows here today to have fun with me if they dont keep quiet theyll have more fun than they can hold at this point a green crabapple bounded up the aisle im not to be bulldozed  he pulled off his coat and laid it on the table before him and amid a wondering silence took off his cuffs and collar saying  i can preach the word of the lord just as well without my coat and i can throw rowdies out the door a little better in my shirtsleeves  had the dixon boys been a little shrewder as readers of human character or if they had known why old william bacon was there they would have kept quiet but it was not long before they began to push again and at last one of them gave a squeak and a tussle took place the preacher was in the midst of a sentence  an evil deed brethren is like unto a grain of mustard seed it is small but it grows steadily absorbing its like from the earth and air sending out roots and branches till at last  there was a scuffle and a snicker mr pill paused and gazed intently at tom dixon who was the most impudent and strongest of the gang then he moved slowly down on the astonished young savage as he came his eyes seemed to expand like those of an eagle in battle steady remorseless unwavering at the same time that his brows shut down over thema glance that hushed every breath the awed and astounded ruffians sat as if paralyzed by the unuttered yet terribly ferocious determination of the preachers eyes his right hand was raised the other was clenched at his waist there was a sort of solemnity in his approach like a tiger creeping upon a foe  at last after what seemed minutes to the silent motionless congregation his raised hand came down on the shoulder of the leader with the exact resistless precision of the tigers paw and the ruffian was snatched from his seat to the floor sprawling before he could rise the steellike grip of the roused preacher sent him half way to the door and then out into the dirt of the road  turning pill came back down the aisle as he came the halfrisen congregation made way for him curiously when he came within reach of dick the fellow struck savagely out at the preacher only to have his blow avoided by a lithe lightningswift movement of the body above the hips a trained boxers trick and to find himself also lying bruised and dazed on the floor  by this time the rest of the brothers had recovered from their stupor and with wild curses leaped over the benches toward the fearless pill  but now a new voice was heard in the sudden uproara new but familiar voice it was the raucous snarl of william bacon known far and wide as a terrible antagonist a man who had never been whipped he was like a wild beast excited to primitive savagery by the smell of blood  stand back you hellhounds he said leaping between them and the preacher you know me lay another hand on that man an by the livun god you answer t me back thear  some of the men cheered most stood irresolute the women crowded together the children began to scream with terror while through it all pill was dragging his last assailant toward the door  bacon made his way down to where the dixons had halted undecided what to do if the preacher had the air and action of the tiger bacon looked the grizzly bearhis eyebrows working up and down his hands clenched into frightful bludgeons his breath rushing through his hairy nostrils  git out o hyare he growled youve run things here jest about long enough git out  his hands were now on the necks of two of the boys and he was hustling them toward the door  if you want o whip the preacher meet him in the public roadone at a time hell take care o himself out with ye he ended kicking them out show your faces here agin an ill break ye in two  the noncombative farmers now began to see the humor of the whole transaction and began to laugh but they were cut short by the calm voice of the preacher at his desk  but a good deed brethren is like unto a grain of wheat planted in good earth that bringeth forth fruit in due season an hundred fold     iii   mr pill with all his seeming levity was a powerful hand at revivals as was developed at the protracted meetings held at the corners during december indeed such was the pitiless intensity of his zeal that a gloom was cast over the whole township the ordinary festivities stopped or did not begin at all  the lyceum which usually began by the first week in december was put entirely out of the question as were the spellingschools and exhibitions the boys it is true still drove the girls to meeting in the usual manner but they all wore a furtive uneasy air and their laughter was not quite genuine at its best and died away altogether when they came near the schoolhouse and they hardly recovered from the effects of the preaching till a mile or two had been spun behind the shining runners it took all the magic of the jingle of the bells and the musical creak of the polished steel on the snow to win them back to laughter  as for elder pill he was as a man transformed he grew more intense each night and strode back forth behind his desk and pounded the bible like an assassin no more games with the boys no more poking the girls under the chin when he asked for a chew of tobacco now it was with an air which said i ask it as sustenance that will give me strength for the lords service as if the demands of the flesh had weakened the spirit  old man bacon overtook milton jennings early one monday morning as milton was marching down toward the seminary at rock river it was intensely cold and still so cold and still that the ring of the cold steel of the heavy sleigh the snort of the horses and the old mans voice came with astonishing distinctness to the ears of the hurrying youth and it seemed a very long time before the old man came up  climb on he yelled out of his frosty beard he was seated on the hind bob of a woodsleigh on a couple of blankets milton clambered on knowing well hed freeze to death there  reckon i heerd you prowlun around the front door with my girl last night bacon said at length the way you both tend out t meetun ought o sanctify yeh must a stayed to the aftermeetun didnt yeh  nope the front part was enough for  danged if i was any more fooled with a man in m life i blieve the whole thing is a little scheme on the bretheren t raise a dollar  why so  waal y see pill aint got much out o the appintment thus fur and he aint likely to if he dont shake em up a leetle borrud ten dollars o me tother day  well thought milton whatever his real motive is elder pill is earning all he gets standing for two or three hours in his place night after night arguing pleading but mainly commanding them to be saved  milton was describing the scenes of the meeting to bradley talcott and douglas radbourn the next day and radbourn a young law student said  id like to see him he must be a character  lets make up a party and go out said milton eagerly  all right ill speak to lily graham  accordingly that evening a party of students in a large sleigh drove out toward the schoolhouse along the drifted lanes and through the beautiful aisles of the snowy woods a merry party of young people who had no sense of sin to weigh them down even radbourn and lily joined in the songs which they sang to the swift clanging of the bells until the lights of the schoolhouse burned redly through the frosty air  not a few of the older people present felt scandalized by the singing and by the dancing of the town girls who could not for the life of them take the thing seriously the room was so little and hot and smoky and the men looked so queer in their rough coats and hair everywhichway  but they took their seats demurely on the back seat and joined in the opening songs and listened to the halting prayers of the brethren and the sonorous prayers of the elder with commendable gravity miss graham was a devout congregationalist and hushed the others into gravity when their eyes began to dance dangerously  however as mr pill warmed to his work the girls grew sober enough he awed them and frightened them with the savagery of his voice and manner his small gray eyes were like daggers unsheathed and his small round head took on a catlike ferocity as he strode to and fro hurling out his warnings and commands in a hoarse howl that terrified the sinner and drew amens of admiration from the saints  atavism he has gone back to the era of the medicine man radbourn murmured  as the speaker went on foam came upon his thin lips his lifted hand had prophecy and threatening in it his eyes reflected flames his voice had now the tone of the implacable vindictive judge he gloated on the pictures that his words called up by the power of his imagination the walls widened the floor was no longer felt the crowded room grew still as death every eye fixed on the speakers face  i tell you you must repent or die i can see the great judgment angel now he said stopping suddenly and pointing above the stovepipe i can see him as he stands weighing your souls as a man ud weigh wheat and chaff wheat goes into the fathers garner chaff is blown to hells devouring flame i can see him now he seizes a poor damned struggling soul by the neck he holds him over the flaming forge of hell till his bones melt like wax he shrivels like thread in a flame of a candle he is nothing but a charred husk and the angel flings him back into outer darkness life was not in him  it was this astonishing figure powerfully acted that scared poor tom dixon into crying out for mercy the effect on the rest was awful to see so great a sinner fall terrorstricken seemed like a providential stroke of confirmatory evidence and nearly a dozen other young people fell crying whereat the old people burst out into amens with unspeakable fervor but the preacher the wild light still in his eyes tore up and down crying above the tumult  the lord is come with power his hand is visible here shout aloud and spare not fall before him as dust to his feet hypocrites vipers scoffers the lash o the lord is on ye  in the intense pause which followed as he waited with expectant uplifted facea pause so deep even the sobbing sinners held their breatha dry drawling utterly matteroffact voice broke the tense hush  say pill aint you a bearun down on the boys a leetle too hard  the preachers extended arm fell as if life had gone out of it his face flushed and paled the people laughed hysterically some of them the tears of terror still on their cheeks but radbourn said bravo bacon  pill recovered himself  not hard enough for you neighbor bacon  bacon rose retaining the same dry prosaic tone  i aint bitin that kind of a hook an i aint goin to be yanked into heaven when i cn slide into hell waal i must be goin ive got a newmilks cow that needs tendin to  the effect of all this was indescribable from being at the very mouth of the furnace quivering with fear and captive to morbid imaginings bacons dry intonation had brought them all back to earth again they saw a little of the absurdity of the whole situation  pill was beaten for the first time in his life he had been struck below the belt by a goodnatured giant the best he could do as bacon shuffled calmly out was to stammer will some one please sing and while they sang he stood in deep thought just as the last verse was quivering into silence the full deep tones of radbourns voice rose above the bustle of feet and clatter of seats  and all that he preaches in the name of him who came bringing peace and goodwill to men  radbourns tone had in it reproach and a noble suggestion the people looked at him curiously the deacons nodded their heads together in counsel and when they turned to the desk pill was gone  gee whittaker that was tough said milton to radbourn knocked the wind out o him like a cannonball whatll he do now  he cant do anything but acknowledge his foolishness  you no business t come here an sturb the lords meetin cried old daddy brown to radbourn youre a sinner and a scoffer  i thought bacon was the disturbing ele  youre just as bad  hes all right said william councill ive got sick mself of bein scared into religion i never was so fooled in a man in my life if id tell you what pill said to me the other day when we was in robies store youd fall in a fit an to hear him talkin here tnight is enough to make a horse laugh  youre all in league with the devil said the old man wildly and so the battle raged on  milton and radbourn escaped from it and got out into the clear cold untainted night  the heat of the furnace dont reach as far as the horses radbourn moralized as he aided in unhitching the shivering team in the vast calm spaces of the stars among the animals such scenes as we have just seen are impossible he lifted his hand in a lofty gesture the light fell on his pale face and dark eyes  the girls were a little indignant and disposed to take the preachers part they thought bacon had no right to speak out that way and miss graham uttered her protest as they whirled away on the homeward ride with pleasant jangle of bells  but the secret of it all was said radbourn in answer pill knew he was acting a part i dont mean that he meant to deceive but he got excited and his audience responded as an audience does to an actor of the first class and he was for the time in earnest his imagination did see those horrorshe was swept away by his own words but when bacon spoke his dry tone and homely words brought everybody preacher and all back to the earth with a thump every body saw that after weeping and wailing there for an hour theyd go home feed the calves hang up the lantern put out the cat wind the clock and go to bed in other words they all came back out of their barbaric powwow to their natural modern selves  this explanation had palpable truth but lily had a dim feeling that it had wider application than to the meeting they had just left  theyll be music around this clearing tomorrow said milton with a sigh wish i was at home this week  but whatll become of mr pill  oh hell come out all right radbourn assured her and miltons clear tenor rang out as he drew eileen closer to his side    o silver moon o silver moon   you set you set too soon   the morrow day is far away   the night is but begun     iv   the news grotesquely exaggerated flew about the next day and at night though it was very cold and windy the house was jammed to suffocation on these lonely prairies life is so devoid of anything but work dramatic entertainments are so few and appetite so keen that a temperature of twenty degrees below zero is no bar to a trip of ten miles the protracted meeting was the only recreation for many of them the gossip before and after service was a delight not to be lost and this last sensation was dramatic enough to bring out old men and women who had not dared to go to church in winter for ten years  long before seven oclock the schoolhouse blazed with light and buzzed with curious speech team after team drove up to the door and as the drivers leaped out to receive the women they said in low but eager tones to the bystanders  meeting begun yet  nope  what kind of a time y havin over here any way  a mighty solumn time somebody would reply to a low laugh  by seven oclock every inch of space was occupied the air was frightful the kerosene lamps gave off gas and smoke the huge stove roared itself into an angry red on its jackoak grubs and still people crowded in at the door  discussion waxed hot as the stove two or three universalists boldly attacked everybody who came their way a tall man stood on a bench in the corner and thumping his bible wildly with his fist exclaimed at the top of his voice  there is no hell at all the bible says the wicked perish utterly they are consumed as ashes when they die they perish as dogs  what kind o docterin is that asked a short man of councill  i dknow its ol sam richards calls himself a christianchristadelphian r some newfangled name  at last people began to inquire well aint he comin  most time fr the elder to come aint it  oh i guess hes preparin a sermon  john jennings pushed anxiously to daddy brown  aint the elder comin  i dknow he didnt stay at my house  he didnt  no thought he went home with you  i aint see im t all ill ask councill brother councill seen anything of the elder  no didnt he go home with bensen  i dn know ill see  this was enough to start the news that pill had skipped  this the deacons denied saying hed come or send word  outside on the leeward side of the house the young men who couldnt get in stood restlessly now dancing a jig now kicking their huge boots against the underpinning to warm their toes they talked spasmodically as they swung their arms about their chests speaking from behind their huge buffalocoat collars  the wind roared through the creaking oaks the horses stirred complainingly the bells on their backs crying out querulously the heads of the fortunates inside were shadowed outside on the snow and the restless young men amused themselves betting on which head was bensen and which councill  at last some one pounded on the desk inside the suffocating but lively crowd turned with painful adjustment toward the desk from whence deacon bensons high smooth voice sounded  brethren an sisters elder pill haint comeand as its about eight oclock he probably wont come tonight after the disturbances last night itsaawere all the more determined totheaneed of reforming grace is more felt than ever let us hope nothing has happened to the elder ill go see tomorrow and if he is unable to comeill see brother wheat of cresco after prayer by brother jennings we will adjourn till tomorrow night brother jennings will you lead us in prayer some one snickered i hope the disgracefulascenes of last night will not be repeated  wheres pill demanded a voice in the back part of the room thats what i want to know  hes a bad pill said another repeating a pun already old  i guess so he borrowed twenty dollars o me last week said the first voice  he owes me for a pig shouted a short man excitedly i believe hes skipped to get rid o his debts  so do i i allus said he was a mighty queer preacher  hed bear watchin was my idee fust time i ever see him  careful brethrencareful he may come at any minute  i dont care if he does id bone him fr pay fr that shote preacher r no preacher said bartlett a little nervously  high words followed this and there was prospect of a fight the pressure of the crowd however was so great it was wellnigh impossible for two belligerents to get at each other the meeting broke up at last and the people chilly soured and disappointed at the lack of developments went home saying pill was scaly no preacher who chawed terbacker was to be trusted and when it was learned that the horse and buggy he drove he owed jennings and bensen for everybody said hes a fraud     v   in the meantime andrew pill was undergoing the most singular and awful mental revolution  when he leaped blindly into his cutter and gave his horse the rein he was wild with rage and shame and a sort of fear as he sat with bent head he did not hear the tread of the horse and did not see the trees glide past the rabbit leaped away under the shadow of the thick groves of young oaks the owl scared from its perch went fluttering off into the cold crisp air but he saw only the contemptuous quizzical face of old william baconone shaggy eyebrow lifted a smile showing through his shapeless beard  he saw the colorless handsome face of radbourn with a look of reproach and a note of suggestionradbourn one of the best thinkers and speakers in rock river and the most generally admired young man in rock county  when he saw and heard bacon his hurt pride flamed up in wrath but the calm voice of radbourn and the look in his stern accusing eyes made his head fall in thought as he rode things grew clearer as a matter of fact his whole system of religious thought was like the side of a shelving sandbankin unstable equilibriumneeding only a touch to send it slipping into a shapeless pile at the rivers edge that touch had been given and he was now in the midst of the motion of his falling faith he didnt know how much would stand when the sloughing ended  andrew pill had been a variety of things a farmer a drygoods merchant and a traveling salesman but in a revival quite like this of his own he had been converted and his life changed he now desired to help his fellowmen to a better life and willingly went out among the farmers where pay was small it was not true therefore that he had gone into it because there was little work and good pay he was really an able man and would have been a success in almost anything he undertook but his reading and thought his easy intercourse with men like bacon and radbourn had long since undermined any real faith in the current doctrine of retribution and tonight as he rode into the night he was feeling it all and suffering it all forced to acknowledge at last what had been long moving  the horse took the wrong road and plodded along steadily carrying him away from his home but he did not know it for a long time when at last he looked up and saw the road leading out upon the wide plain between the belts of timber leading away to rock river he gave a sigh of relief he could not meet his wife then he must have a chance to think  over him the glittering infinite sky of winter midnight soared passionless yet accusing in its calmness sweetness and majesty what was he that he could dogmatize on eternal life and the will of the being who stood behind that veil and then would come rushing back that scene in the schoolhouse the smell of the steaming garments the gases from the lamps the roar of the stove the sound of his own voice strident dominating so alien to his present mood he could only shudder at it  he was worn out with the thinking when he drove into the stable at the merchants house and roused up the sleeping hostler who looked at him suspiciously and demanded pay in advance this seemed right in his present mood he was not to be trusted  when he flung himself face downward on his bed the turmoil in his brain was still going on he couldnt hold one thought or feeling long all seemed slipping like water from his hands  he had in him great capacity for change for growth circumstances had been against his development thus far but the time had come when growth seemed to be defeat and failure     vi   radbourn was thinking about him two days after as he sat in his friend judge browns law office poring over a volume of law he saw that bacons treatment had been heroic he couldnt get that pitiful confusion of the preachers face out of his mind but after all bacons seizing of just that instant was a stroke of genius  some one touched him on the arm  whyeldermr pill how de do sit down draw up a chair  there was trouble in the preachers face can i see you radbourn alone  certainly come right into this room no one will disturb us there  now what can i do for you he said as they sat down  i want to talk with you aboutabout religion said pill with a little timid pause in his voice  radbourn looked grave im afraid youve come to a dangerous man  i want you to tell me what you think i know youre a student i want to talk about my case pursued the preacher with a curious hesitancy i want to ask a few questions on things  very well sail in ill do the best i can said radbourn  ive been thinking a good deal since that night ive come to the conclusion that i dont believe what ive been preaching i thought i did but i didnt i dont know what i believe seems as if the land had slid from under my feet what am i to do  say so replied radbourn his eyes kindling say so and get out of it theres nothing worse than staying where you are what have you saved from the general landslide  pill smiled a little i dont know  want me to crossexamine you and see eh very well here goes he settled back with a smile you believe in square dealing between man and man  certainly  you believe in good deeds candor and steadfastness  i do  you believe in justice equality of opportunity and in liberty  certainly i do  you believe in short that a man should do unto others as hed have others do unto him think right and live out his thoughts  all that i steadfastly believe  well i guess your landslide was mostly imaginary the face of the eternal rock is laid bare you didnt recognize it at first thats all one question more you believe in truth  certainly  well truth is only found from the generalizations of facts before calling a thing true study carefully all accessible facts make your religion practical the matteroffact tone of bacon would have had no force if you had been preaching an earnest morality in place of an antiquated terrorism  i know it i know it sighed pill looking down  well now go back and tell em so and then if you cant keep your place preaching what you do believe get into something else for the sake of all morality and manhood dont go on cursing yourself with hypocrisy  mr pill took a chew of tobacco rather distractedly and said  id like to ask you a few questions  no not now you think out your present position yourself find out just what you have saved from your landslide  the elder man rose he hardly seemed the same man who had dominated his people a few days before he turned with still greater embarrassment  i want to ask a favor im going back to my family im going to say something of what youve said to my congregationbutim in debtand the moment they know im a backslider theyre going to bear down on me pretty heavy id like to be independent  i see how much do you need mused radbourn  i guess two hundred would stave off the worst of them  i guess brown and i can fix that come in again tonight or no ill bring it round to you  the two men parted with a silent pressure of the hand that meant more than any words  when mr pill told his wife that he could preach no more she cried and gasped and scolded till she was in danger of losing her breath entirely a guineahen sort of a woman councill called her she can talk more an say lessn any woman i ever see was bacons verdict after she had been at dinner at his house she was a perpetual irritant  mr pill silenced her at last with a note of impatience approaching a threat and he drove away to the corners to make his confession without her it was saturday night and elder wheat was preaching as he entered the crowded room a buzz and mumble of surprise stopped the orator for a few moments and he shook hands with mr pill dubiously not knowing what to think of it all but as he was in the midst of a very effective oratorical scene he went on  the silent man at his side felt as if he were witnessing a burlesque of himself as he listened to the pitiless and lurid description of torment which elder wheat poured forththe same figures and threats he had used a hundred times he stirred uneasily in his seat while the audience paid so little attention that the perspiring little orator finally called for a hymn saying  elder pill has returned from his unexpected absence and will exhort in his proper place  when the singing ended mr pill rose looking more like himself than since the previous sunday a quiet resolution was in his eyes and voice as he said  elder wheat has more right here than i have i want o say that im going to give up my church in douglass and a murmur broke out which he silenced with his raised hand i find i dont believe any longer what ive been believing and preaching hold on let me go on i dont quite know where ill bring up but i think my religion will simmer down finally to about this a full halfbushel to the halfbushel and sixteen ounces to the pound here two or three cheered do unto others as youd have others do unto you applause from several quickly suppressed as the speaker went on elder wheat listening as if petrified with his mouth open  im going out of preaching at least for the present after things get into shape with me again i may set up to teach people how to live but just now i cant do it ive got all i can do to instruct myself just one thing more i owe two or three of you here ive got the money for william bacon james bartlett and john jennings i turn the mare and cutter over to jacob bensen for the note he holds i haint got much religion left but ive got some morality thats all i want to say now  when he sat down there was a profound hush then bacon arose  thats mans talk that is an i jest want o say andrew pill that you kin jest forgit you owe me anything an if ye want any help come to me yre jest gittun ready to preach n im ready to give ye my support  thats the talk said councill im with ye on that  pill shook his head the painful silence which followed was broken by the effusive voice of wheat  let us prayand remember our lost brother                                       the urgings of the people were of no avail mr pill settled up his affairs and moved to cresco where he went back into trade with a friend and for three years attended silently to his customers lived down their curiosity and studied anew the problem of life then he moved away and no one knew whither  one day last year bacon met jennings on the road  heerd anything o pill lately  no have you  waal yes brown told me he ran acrost him down in eelinoy doun well too  in dry goods  no preachun  preachun  so brown said kind of a freefrall church i reckon from what jedge told me built a new church fills it twice a sunday id like to hear him but hes got t be too big a gun fr us ben studyun they say went t school  jennings drove sadly and thoughtfully on  rather stumps brother jennings laughed bacon in his leonine fashion       part iii   william bacons hired man and daughter marietta     love and youth pass swiftly love sings   and aprils sun fans warmer sunlight from his wings   william bacons man  i   the yellow march sun lay powerfully on the bare iowa prairie where the plowed fields were already turning warm and brown and only here and there in a corner or on the north side of the fence did the sullen drifts remain and they were so dark and low that they hardly appeared to break the mellow brown of the fields  there passed also an occasional flock of geese cheerful harbingers of spring and the prairiechickens had set up their morning symphony wideswelling wonderful with its prophecy of the new birth of grass and grain and the springing life of all breathing things the crow passed now and then uttering his resonant croak but the crane had not yet sent forth his bugle note  lyman gilman rested on his axhelve at the woodpile of farmer bacon to listen to the music around him in a vague way he was powerfully moved by it he heard the hens singing their weird raucous monotonous song and saw them burrowing in the dry chipdust near him he saw the young colts and cattle frisking in the sunny space around the strawstacks absorbed through his bare arms and uncovered head the heat of the sun and felt the soft wooing of the air so deeply that he broke into an unwonted exclamation  glory well be seeding by friday sure  this short and disappointing soliloquy was after all an expression of deep emotion to the western farmer the very word seeding is a poem and these few words coming from lyman gilman meant more and expressed more than many a large and ambitious springtime song  but the glory of all the slumbrous landscape the stately beauty of the sky with its masses of fleecy vapor were swept away by the sound of a girls voice humming come to the savior while she bustled about the kitchen near by the windows were open ah what suggestion to these dwellers in a rigorous climate was in the first unsealing of the windows how sweet it was to the pale and weary women after their long imprisonment  as lyman sat down on his maple log to hear better a plump face appeared at the window and a clear girlvoice said  smell anything lime  he snuffed the air cookies by the great horn spoons he yelled leaping up bring me some an see me eat itll do ye good  come an get m laughed the face at the window  oh its nicer out here merry etty whats the rush bring me out some an set down on this log  with a nod marietta disappeared and soon came out with a plate of cookies in one hand and a cup of milk in the other  poor little man hes all tired out aint he  lime taking the cue collapsed in a heap and said feebly bread bread  wont milk an cookies do as well  he brushed off the log and motioned her to sit down beside him but she hesitated a little and colored a little  o lime spose somebody should see us  let em what in thunder do we care sit down an gimme a holt o them cakes im just about done up i couldnt a stood it another minute  she sat down beside him with a laugh and a pretty blush she was in her apron and the sleeves of her dress were rolled to her elbows displaying the strong round arms wholesome and sweet she looked and smelled the scent of the cooking round her lyman munched a couple of the cookies and gulped a pint of milk before he spoke  whadda we care who sees us sittin side b side aint we goin t be married soon  oh them cookies in the oven she shrieked leaping up and running to the house she looked back as she reached the kitchen door however and smiled with a flushed face lime slapped his knee and roared with laughter at his bold stroke  ho ho he laughed didnt i do it slick aint nothin green in my eye i guess in an intense and pleasurable abstraction he finished the cookies and the milk then he yelled  hey merrymerry etty  whadda ye want sang the girl from the window her face still rosy with confusion  come out here and git these things  the girl shook her head with a laugh  come out an git m r by jingo ill throw em at ye come on now  the girl looked at the huge handsome fellow the sun falling on his golden hair and beard and came slowly out to himcame creeping along with her hand outstretched for the plate which lime with a laugh in his sunny blue eyes extended at the full length of his bare arm the girl made a snatch at it but his left hand caught her by the wrist and away went cup and plate as he drew her to him and kissed her in spite of her struggles  my aint you strong she said halfruefully and halfadmiringly as she shrugged her shoulders if youd use a little more o that choppin wood dad wouldnt a lost s much money by yeh  lime grew grave  theres the hog in the fence merry whats yer dad goin t say  about what  about our gittn married this spring  i guess youd better find out what im agoin t say lime gilman fore you pitch into dad  i know what youre agoin t say  no y dont  yes but i do though  well ask me and see if you think youre so smart jest as like s not youll slip up  all right here goes marietty bacon aint you an lime gilman goin t be married  no sir we aint laughed the girl snatching up the plate and darting away to the house where she struck up weevily wheat and went busily on about her cooking lime threw a kiss at her and fell to work on his log with startling energy  lyman looked forward to his interview with the old man with as much trepidation as he had ever known though commonly he had little fear of anythingbut a girl  marietta was not only the old mans only child his housekeeper his wife having at last succumbed to the ferocious toil of the farm it was reasonable to suppose therefore that he would surrender his claim on the girl reluctantly rough as he was he loved marietta strongly and would find it exceedingly hard to get along without her  lyman mused on these things as he drove the gleaming ax into the huge maple logs he was something more than the usual hired man being a lumberman from the wisconsin pineries where he had sold out his interest in a camp not three weeks before the day he began work for bacon he had a nice little wad o money when he left the camp and started for la crosse but he had been robbed in his hotel the first night in the city and was left nearly penniless it was a great blow to him for as he said every cent of that money stood fer hard knocks an poor feed when i smelt of it i could jest see the cold frosty mornins and the late nights i could feel the hot sun on my back like it was when i worked in the harvestfield by jingo it kind o made my toes curl up  but he went resolutely out to work again and here he was chopping wood in old man bacons yard thinking busily on the talk which had just passed between him and marietta  by jingo he said all at once stopping short with the ax on his shoulder if i hadnt a been robbed i wouldnt a come herei neverd met merry thunder and jimson root wasnt that a narrow escape  and then he laughed so heartily that the girl looked out of the window again to see what in the world he was doing he had his hat in his hand and was whacking his thigh with it  lyman gilman what in the world ails you today its perfectly ridiculous the way you yell and talk t yrself out there on the chips you beat the hens i declare if you dont  lime put on his hat and walked up to the window and resting his great bare arms on the sill and his chin on his arms said  merry im goin to tackle dad this afternoon hell be settin up the new seeder and im goin t climb right on the back of his neck hes jest got t give me a chance  marietta looked sober in sympathy  well praps its best to have it over with lime but someway i feel kind o scary about it  lime stood for a long time looking in at the window watching the lightfooted girl as she set the table in the middle of the sunlighted kitchen floor the kettle hissed the meat sizzled sending up a delicious odor a hen stood in the open door and sang a sort of cheery halfhuman song while to and fro moved the sweetfaced lithe and powerful girl followed by the smiling eyes at the window  merry you look purty as a picture you look just like the wife i ben ahuntin for all these years sure s shootin  marietta colored with pleasure  does dad pay you to stand an look at me an say pretty things t the cook  no he dont but im willin t do it without pay i could jest stand here till kingdom come an look at you hello i hear a wagon i guess i better hump into that woodpile  i think so too dinners most ready and dadll be here soon  lime was driving away furiously at a tough elm log when farmer bacon drove into the yard with a new seeder in his wagon lime whacked away busily while bacon stabled the team and in a short time marietta called in a longdrawn musical fashion  dinnerrr  after sozzling their faces at the well the two men went in and sat down at the table bacon was not much of a talker at any time and at mealtime in seeding eating was the main business in hand therefore the meal was a silent one marietta and lime not caring to talk on general topics the hour was an anxious one for her and an important one for him  wal now lime seedun s the nex thing said bacon as he shoved back his chair and glared around from under his bushy eyebrows we cant do too much this afternoon that seeders got t be set up an a lot o seedwheat cleaned up you unload the machine while i feed the pigs  lime sat still till the old man was heard outside calling ooee pooee to the pigs in the yard then he smiled at marietta but she said  hes got on one of his fits lime i dont blieve youd better tackle him tday  dont you worry ill fix him come now give me a kiss  why you great thing youtook  i know but i want you to give em to me just walk right up to me an give me a smack t bind the bargain  i aint made any bargain laughed the girl then feeling the force of his tender tone she added will you behave and go right off to your work  jest like a little manhope t die  lime roared the old man from the barn  hello replied lime grinning joyously and winking at the girl as much as to say this would paralyze the old man if he saw it  he went out to the shed where bacon was at work as serene as if he had not a fearful task on hand he was apprehensive that the father might gig back unless rightly approached and so he awaited a good opportunity  the right moment seemed to present itself along about the middle of the afternoon bacon was down on the ground under the machine tightening some burrs this was a good chance for two reasons in the first place the keen almost savage eyes of bacon were no longer where they could glare on him and in spite of his cool exterior lime had just as soon not have the old man looking at him  besides the old farmer had been telling about his river eighty which was without a tenant the man who had taken it having lost his wife had grown disheartened and had given it up  its an almighty good chance for a man with a small family good house an barn good land a likely young feller with a team an a woman could do tiptop on that eighty if he wanted more id let him have an eighty jinun  id like t try that mself said lime as a feeler the old fellow said nothing in reply for a moment  ef you had a team an tools an a woman id jest as lief youd have it as anybody  sell me your blacks and ill pay half downthe balance in the fall i can pick up some tools and as for a woman merry etty an me have talked that over today shes ready toready to marry me whenever you say go  there was an ominous silence under the seeder as if the father could not believe his ears  whatswhats that he stuttered whod you say what about merry etty  shes agreed to marry me  the hell you say roared bacon as the truth burst upon him so thats what you do when i go off to town and leave you to chop wood so youre goun to git married hey  he was now where lime could see him glaring up into his smiling blue eyes lime stood his ground  yes sir thats the calculation  well i guess ill have somethin t say about that nodding his head violently  i rather expected y would blaze away your privilegemy bad luck sail in ol man whats yr objection to me fer a soninlaw  dont you worry young feller ill come at it soon enough went on bacon as he turned up another burr in a very awkward corner in his nervous excitement the wrench slipped banging his knuckle  ouch thundermmm howled and snarled the wounded man  whats the matter bark yr knuckle queried lime feeling a mighty impulse to laugh but when he saw the old savage straighten up and glare at him he sobered bacon was now in a frightful temper the veins in his great bare weatherbeaten neck swelled dangerously  jest let me say right here that ive had enough o you you cant live on the same acre with my girl another day  what makes ye think i cant it was now the young mans turn to draw himself up and as he faced the old man his arms folded and each vast hand grasping an elbow he looked like a statue of red granite and the hands resembled the paws of a crouching lion but his eyes smiled  i dont think i know ye wont  whats the objection to me  objection hell whats the inducement my hired man an not three shirts to yer back  thats another ive got four say old man did you ever work out for a living  thats none o your business growled bacon a little taken down ive worked an scraped an got tgether a little propty here an they aint no sucker like you goun to come long here an live off me an spend my propty after im dead you can jest bet high on that  whos goin t live on ye  youre aimun to  i aint neither  yes yare youve loafed on me ever since i hired ye  thats a lime checked himself for mariettas sake and the enraged father went on  i hired ye t cut wood an youve gone an fooled my daughter away from me now you jest figger up what i owe ye and git out o here ye cant go too soon t suit me  bacon was renowned as the hardest man in cedar county to handle and though he was getting old he was still a terror to his neighbors when roused he was honest temperate and a good neighbor until something carried him off his balance then he became as cruel as a panther and as savage as a grizzly all this lime knew but it did not keep his anger down so much as did the thought of marietta his silence infuriated bacon who yelled hoarsely  git out o this  dont be in a rush ol man  bacon hurled himself upon lime who threw out one hand and stopped him while he said in a low voice  stay right where you are ol man im dangerous its for merrys sake  the infuriated old man struck at him lime warded off the blow and with a sudden wrench and twist threw him to the ground with frightful force before bacon could rise marietta who had witnessed the scene came flying from the house  lime father what are you doing  icouldnt help it merry it was him r me said lime almost sadly  dad aint you got no sense what re you thinking of you jest stop right now i wont have it  he rose while she clung to him he seemed a little dazed it was the first time he had ever been thrown and he could not but feel a certain respect for his opponent but he could not give way  pack up yer duds he snarled an git offn my land ill have the money fer ye when ye come back ill give ye jest five minutes to git clear o here merry you stay here  the young man saw it was useless to remain as it would only excite the old man and so with a look of apology not without humor at marietta he went to the house to get his valise the girl wept silently while the father raged up and down his mood frightened her  i thought you had more sense than t take up with such a dirty houn  he aint a houn she blazed forth and hes just as good and clean as you are  shut up dont let me hear another word out o your head im boss here yet i reckon  lime came out with his valise in his hand  goodby merry he said cheerily she started to go to him but her fathers rough grasp held her  set down an stay there  lime was going out of the gate  here come and get yr money yelled the old man extending some bills heres twenty  go to thunder with your money retorted lime ive had my pay for my months work as he said that he thought of the sunny kitchen and the merry girl and his throat choked goodby to the sweet girl whose smile was so much to him and to the happy noons and nights her eyes had made for him he waved his hat at her as he stood in the open gate and the sun lighted his handsome head into a sort of glory in her eyes then he turned and walked rapidly off down the road not looking back  the girl when she could no longer see him dashed away and sobbing violently entered the house     ii   there was just a suspicion of light in the east a mere hint of a glow when lyman walked cautiously around the corner of the house and tapped at mariettas window she was sleeping soundly and did not hear for she had been restless during the first part of the night he tapped again and the girl woke without knowing what woke her  lyman put the blade of his pocketknife under the window and raised it a little and then placed his lips to the crack and spoke in a sepulchral tone half groan half whisper  merry merry etty  the dazed girl sat up in bed and listened while her heart almost stood still  merry its melime come to the winder the girl hesitated and lyman spoke again  come i haint got much time this is your last chance t see me its now r never  the girl slipped out of bed and wrapping herself in a shawl crept to the window  boost on that winder commanded lyman she raised it enough to admit his head which came just above the sill then she knelt on the floor by the window  her eyes stared wide and dark lime what in the world do you mean  i mean business he replied i aint no last years chicken i know when the old man sleeps the soundest he chuckled pleasantly  howd y fool old rove  never mind about that now theys something more important on hand youve got t go with me  she drew back oh lime i cant  he thrust a great arm in and caught her by the wrist  yes y can this is yr last chance if i go off without ye tnight i never come back what make ye gig back are ye fraid o me  nno butbut  but what merry etty  it aint right to go an leave dad all alone where y goin t take me anyhow  milt jennings let me have his horse an buggy theyre down the road a piece an well go right down to rock river and be married by sunup  the girl still hesitated her firm boyish will unwontedly befogged resolute as she was she could not at once accede to his demand  come make up your mind soon the old man ll fill me with buckshot if he catches sight o me he drew her arm out of the window and laid his bearded cheek to it come little one were made for each other god knows it come its him r me  the girls head dropped consented  thats right now a kiss to bind the bargain there what cryin no more o that little one now ill give you jest five minutes to git on your sundaygotmeetin cloes quick there goes a rooster its gittin white in the east  the man turned his back to the window and gazed at the western sky with a wealth of unuttered and unutterable exultation in his heart far off a rooster gave a long clear blastwould it be answered in the barn yes some wakeful ear had caught it and now came the answer but faint muffled and drowsy the dog at his feet whined uneasily as if suspecting something wrong the wind from the south was full of the wonderful odor of springing grass warm brown earth and oozing sap overhead to the west the stars were shining in the cloudless sky dimmed a little in brightness by the faint silvery veil of moisture in the air the mans soul grew very tender as he stood waiting for his bride he was rough illiterate yet there was something fine about him after all a kind of simplicity and a gigantic leonine tenderness  he heard his sweetheart moving about inside and thought the old man wont hold out when he finds were married he cant get along without her if he does why ill rent a farm here and well go to work housekeepin i can git the money she shant always be poor he ended with a vow  the window was raised again and the girls voice was heard low and tremulous lime im ready but i wish we didnt  he put his arm around her waist and helped her out and did not put her down till they reached the road she was completely dressed even to her hat and shoes but she mourned  my hair is everywhichway lime how can i be married so  they were nearing the horse and buggy now and lime laughed oh well stop at jenningss and fix up milt knows whats up and has told his mother by this time so just laugh as jolly as you can  soon they were in the buggy the impatient horse swung into the road at a rattling pace and as marietta leaned back in the seat thinking of what she had done she cried lamentably in spite of all the caresses and pleadings of her lover  but the sun burst up from the plain the prairiechickens took up their mighty chorus on the hills robins met them on the way flocks of wild geese honking cheerily drove far overhead toward the north and with these sounds of a golden spring day in her ears the bride grew cheerful and laughed   iii  at about the time the sun was rising farmer bacon roused from his sleep by the crowing of the chickens on the dry knolls in the fields as well as by those in the barnyard rolled out of bed wearily wondering why he should feel so drowsy then he remembered the row with lime and his subsequent inability to sleep with thinking over it there was a dull pain in his breast which made him uncomfortable  as was his usual custom he went out into the kitchen and built the fire for marietta filled the teakettle with water and filled the waterbucket in the sink then he went to her bedroom door and knocked with his knuckles as he had done for years in precisely the same fashion  rapraprap hello merry time t git up broad daylight an birds asingun  without waiting for an answer he went out to the barn and worked away at his chores he took such delight in the glorious morning and the turbulent life of the farmyard that his heart grew light and he hummed a tune which sounded like the merry growl of a lion pooee pooee he called to the pigs as they swarmed across the yard  ahrr you big fat rascals them hams o yourn is clear money one of ye shall go t buy merry a new dress he said as he glanced at the house and saw the smoke pouring out the stovepipe merry s a good girl shes stood by her old pap when other girls ud a gone back on im  while currying horses he went all over the ground of the quarrel yesterday and he began to see it in a different light he began to see that lyman was a good man and an able man and that his own course was a foolish one  when i git mad he confessed to himself i dont know anythin but i wont give her up she aint old nough t marry yetand besides i need her  after finishing his chores as usual he went to the well and washed his face and hands then entered the kitchento find the teakettle boiling over and no signs of breakfast anywhere and no sign of the girl  well i guess she felt sleepy this mornin poor gal mebbe she cried half the night  merry he called gently at the door merry m gal pap needs his breakfast  there was no reply and the old mans face stiffened into a wild surprise he knocked heavily again and got no reply and with a white face and shaking hand he flung the door open and gazed at the empty bed his hand dropped to his side his head turned slowly from the bed to the open window he rushed forward and looked out on the ground where he saw the tracks of a man  he fell heavily into the chair by the bed while a deep groan broke from his stiff and twitching lips  shes left me shes left me  for a long halfhour the ironmuscled old man sat there motionless hearing not the songs of the hens or the birds far out in the brilliant sunshine he had lost sight of his farm his days work and felt no hunger for food he did not doubt that her going was final he felt that she was gone from him forever if she ever came back it would not be as his daughter but as the wife of gilman she had deserted him fled in the night like a thief his heart began to harden again and he rose stiffly his native stubbornness began to assert itself the first great shock over and he went out to the kitchen and prepared as best he could a breakfast and sat down to it in some way his appetite failed him and he fell to thinking over his past life of the death of his wife and the early death of his only boy he was still trying to think what his life would be in the future without his girl when two carriages drove into the yard it was about the middle of the forenoon and the prairiechickens had ceased to boom and squawk in fact that was why he knew that he had been sitting two hours at the table before he could rise he heard swift feet and a merry voice then marietta burst through the door  hello pap how you makin out with break she saw a look on his face that went to her heart like a knife she saw a lonely and deserted old man sitting at his cold and cheerless breakfast and with a remorseful cry she ran across the floor and took him in her arms kissing him again and again while mr john jennings and his wife stood in the door  poor ol pap merry couldnt leave you shes come back to stay as long as he lives  the old man remained cold and stern his deep voice had a raucous note in it as he pushed her away from him noticing no one else  but how do you come back t me  the girl grew rosy but she stood proudly up  i come back a wife of a man pap a wife like my mother an this t hang beside hers and she laid down a rolled piece of parchment  take it an go growled he take yer lazy lubber an git out o my sight i raised ye

now why do you talk so t me when i want t gitwhen lime comes and asks for me  the old man was staggered he looked at the smiling face of john jennings and the tearful face of mrs jennings who had returned with lyman but his face hardened again as he caught sight of lime looking in at him his absurd pride would not let him relent lime saw it and stepped forward  ol man i want t take a little inning now im a fair square man i asked ye fer merry as a man should i told you id had hard luck when i first came here i had five thousand dollars in clean cash stole from me i haint got a thing now

stood they were married in my housei thought that ud be best you cant live without your girl he went on any more n i could without my boy youd better  the figure at the table straightened up under his tufted eyebrows his keen gray eyes flashed from one to the other his hands knotted  go slow went on the smooth voice of jennings known all the country through as a peacemaker take time t think it over stand out an youll live here alone without chick r child give in and this house ll bubble over with noise and young ones now is short and forevers a long time to feel sorry in  the old man at the table knitted his eyebrows and a distorted quivering ghastly smile broke out on his face his chest heaved then he burst forth  gal yank them gloves off an git me something to eatbreakfus r dinner i dont care which lime you infernal idiot git out there and gear up them horses what in thunder you foolun around about hyere in seedn come hustle all o ye  and then they shouted in laughter while the cause of it all strode unsteadily but resolutely out toward the barn followed by the bridegroom who was laughingsilently       part iv  sim burnss wife a prairie heroine    a tale of toil thats never done i tell   of life where loves a fleeting wing   above the womans hopeless hell   of ceaseless yearround journeying   sim burnss wife  i   lucretia burns had never been handsome even in her days of early girlhood and now she was middleaged distorted with work and childbearing and looking faded and worn as one of the boulders that lay beside the pasture fence near where she sat milking a large white cow  she had no shawl or hat and no shoes for it was still muddy in the little yard where the cattle stood patiently fighting the flies and mosquitoes swarming into their skins already wet with blood the evening was oppressive with its heat and a ring of justseen thunderheads gave premonitions of an approaching storm  she rose from the cows side at last and taking her pails of foaming milk staggered toward the gate the two pails hung from her lean arms her bare feet slipped on the filthy ground her greasy and faded calico dress showed her tired swollen ankles and the mosquitoes swarmed mercilessly on her neck and bedded themselves in her colorless hair  the children were quarreling at the well and the sound of blows could be heard calves were querulously calling for their milk and little turkeys lost in a tangle of grass were piping plaintively  the sun just setting struck through a long low rift like a boy peeping beneath the eaves of a huge roof its light brought out lucretias face as she leaned her sallow forehead on the top bar of the gate and looked toward the west  it was a pitifully worn almost tragic facelong thin sallow holloweyed the mouth had long since lost the power to shape itself into a kiss and had a droop at the corners which seemed to announce a breakingdown at any moment into a despairing wail the collarless neck and sharp shoulders showed painfully  she felt vaguely that the night was beautiful the setting sun the noise of frogs the nocturnal insects beginning to pipeall in some way called her girlhood back to her though there was little in her girlhood to give her pleasure her large gray eyes grew round deep and wistful as she saw the illimitable craggy clouds grow crimson roll slowly up and fire at the top a childish scream recalled her  oh my soul she half groaned half swore as she lifted her milk and hurried to the well arriving there she cuffed the children right and left with all her remaining strength saying in justification  my soul cant youyou young uns give me a minutes peace land knows im almost gone up washin an milkin six cows and tendin you and cookin fr him ought o be enough fr one day sadie you let him drink now r ill slap your head off you hateful thing why cant you behave when you know im jest about dead she was weeping now with nervous weakness wheres yr pa she asked after a moment wiping her eyes with her apron  one of the group the one cuffed last sniffed out in rage and grief  hes in the cornfield whered ye spose he was  good land why dont the man work all night sile you put that dipper in that milk agin an ill whack you till your headll swim sadie le go pet an go n get them turkeys out of the grass fore it gits dark bob you go tell yr dad if he wants the rest o them cows milked hes got o do it himself i jest cant and whats more i wont she ended rebelliously  having strained the milk and fed the children she took some skimmed milk from the cans and started to feed the calves bawling strenuously behind the barn the eager and unruly brutes pushed and struggled to get into the pails all at once and in consequence spilt nearly all of the milk on the ground this was the last trial the woman fell down on the damp grass and moaned and sobbed like a crazed thing the children came to seek her and stood around like little partridges looking at her in scared silence till at last the little one began to wail then the mother rose wearily to her feet and walked slowly back toward the house  she heard burns threshing his team at the well with the sound of oaths he was tired hungry and illtempered but she was too desperate to care his poor overworked team did not move quickly enough for him and his extra long turn in the corn had made him dangerous his eyes gleamed wrathfully from his dustlaid face  supper ready he growled  yes two hours ago  well i cant help it he said understanding her reproach that devilish corn is gettin too tall to plow again and ive got o go through it tomorrow or not at all cows milked  part of em  how many left  three  hell which three  spot and brin and cherry  of course left the three worst ones ill be damned if i milk a cow tonight i dont see why you play out jest the nights i need ye most here he kicked a child out of the way git out o that haint you got no sense ill learn ye  stop that sim burns cried the woman snatching up the child youre a reglar ol hyenythats what you are she added defiantly roused at last from her lethargy  youre abeauty thats what you are he said pitilessly keep your brats out fum under my feet and he strode off to a barn after his team leaving her with a fierce hate in her heart she heard him yelling at his team in their stalls git around there damn yeh  the children had had their supper so she took them to bed she was unusually tender to them for she wanted to make up in some way for her previous harshness the ferocity of her husband had shown up her own petulant temper hideously and she sat and sobbed in the darkness a long time beside the cradle where little pet slept  she heard burns come growling in and tramp about but she did not rise the supper was on the table he could wait on himself there was an awful feeling at her heart as she sat there and the house grew quiet she thought of suicide in a vague way of somehow taking her children in her arms and sinking into a lake somewhere where she would never more be troubled where she could sleep forever without toil or hunger  then she thought of the little turkeys wandering in the grass of the children sleeping at last of the quiet wonderful stars then she thought of the cows left unmilked and listened to them stirring uneasily in the yard she rose at last and stole forth she could not rid herself of the thought that they would suffer she knew what the dull ache in the full breasts of a mother was and she could not let them stand at the bars all night moaning for relief  the mosquitoes had gone but the frogs and katydids still sang while over in the west venus shone she was a long time milking the cows her hands were so tired she had often to stop and rest them while the tears fell unheeded into the pail she saw and felt little of the external as she sat there she thought in vague retrospect of how sweet it seemed the first time sim came to see her of the many rides to town with him when he was an accepted lover of the few things he had given hera coral breastpin and a ring  she felt no shame at her present miserable appearance she was past personal pride she hardly felt as if the tall strong girl attractive with health and hope could be the same soul as the woman who now sat in utter despair listening to the heavy breathing of the happy cows grateful for the relief from their burden of milk  she contrasted her lot with that of two or three women that she knew not a very high standard who kept hired help and who had fine houses of four or five rooms even the neighbors were better off than she for they didnt have such quarrels but she wasnt to blamesim didnt then her mind changed to a dull resentment against things everything seemed against her  she rose at last and carried her second load of milk to the well strained it washed out the pails and after bathing her tired feet in a tub that stood there she put on a pair of horrible shoes without stockings and crept stealthily into the house sim did not hear her as she slipped up the stairs to the little low unfinished chamber beside her oldest children she could not bear to sleep near him that nightshe wanted a chance to sob herself to quiet  as for sim he was a little disturbed but would as soon have cut off his head as acknowledge himself in the wrong as he went to bed and found her still away he yelled up the stairway  say o woman aint ye comin to bed upon receiving no answer he rolled his aching body into the creaking bed do as y damn please about it if y want to sulk y can and in such wise the family grew quiet in sleep while the moist warm air pulsed with the ceaseless chime of the crickets     ii   when sim burns woke the next morning he felt a sharper twinge of remorse it was not a broad or welldefined feelingjust a sense that ho had been unduly irritable not that on the whole he was not in the right little pet lay with the warm june sunshine filling his baby eyes curiously content in striking at flies that buzzed around his little mouth  the man thrust his dirty naked feet into his huge boots and without washing his face or combing his hair went out to the barn to do his chores  he was a type of the average prairie farmer and his whole surrounding was typical of the time he had a quartersection of fine level land bought with incredible toil but his house was a little boxlike structure costing perhaps five hundred dollars it had three rooms and the everpresent summer kitchen attached to the back it was unpainted and had no touch of beautya mere box  his stable was built of slabs and banked and covered with straw it looked like a den was low and long and had but one door in the end the cowyard held ten or fifteen cattle of various kinds while a few calves were bawling from a pen near by behind the barn on the west and north was a fringe of willows forming a windbreak a few broken and discouraged fruit trees standing here and there among the weeds formed the garden in short he was spoken of by his neighbors as a hardworking cuss and tolably well fixed  no grace had come or ever could come into his life back of him were generations of men like himself whose main business had been to work hard live miserably and beget children to take their places when they died  his courtship had been delayed so long on account of poverty that it brought little of humanizing emotion into his life he never mentioned his lovelife now or if he did it was only to sneer obscenely at it he had long since ceased to kiss his wife or even speak kindly to her there was no longer any sanctity to life or love he chewed tobacco and toiled on from year to year without any very clearly defined idea of the future his life was mainly regulated from without  he was tall dark and strong in a flatchested slouching sort of way and had grown neglectful of even decency in his dress he wore the american farmers customary outfit of rough brown pants hickory shirt and greasy wool hat it differed from his neighbors mainly in being a little dirtier and more ragged his grimy hands were broad and strong as the clutch of a bear and he was a terrible feller to turn off work as councill said i druther have sim burns work for me one day than some men three hes a linger he worked with unusual speed this morning and ended by milking all the cows himself as a sort of savage penance for his misdeeds the previous evening muttering in selfdefense  seems s if ever cussid thing piles on to me at once that corn the roadtax and hayin comin on and now she gits her back up  when he went back to the well he sloshed himself thoroughly in the horsetrough and went to the house he found breakfast ready but his wife was not in sight the older children were clamoring around the uninviting breakfast table spread with cheap ware and with boiled potatoes and fried salt pork as the principal dishes  wheres yr ma he asked with a threatening note in his voice as he sat down by the table  shes in the bedroom  he rose and pushed open the door the mother sat with the babe in her lap looking out of the window down across the superb field of timothy moving like a lake of purple water she did not look around she only grew rigid her thin neck throbbed with the pulsing of blood to her head  whats got into you now he said brutally dont be a fool come out and eat breakfast with me an take care o yr young ones  she neither moved nor made a sound with an oath he turned on his heel and went out to the table eating his breakfast in his usual wolfish fashion he went out into the hot sun with his team and ridingplow not a little disturbed by this new phase of his wifes cantankerousness he plowed steadily and sullenly all the forenoon in the terrific heat and dust the air was full of tempestuous threats still and sultry one of those days when work is a punishment when he came in at noon he found things the samedinner on the table but his wife out in the garden with the youngest child  i cn stand it as long as she can he said to himself in the hearing of the children as he pushed back from the table and went back to work  when he had finished the field of corn it was after sundown and he came up to the house hot dusty his shirt wringing wet with sweat and his neck aching with the work of looking down all day at the cornrows his mood was still stern the multitudinous lift and stir and sheen of the wide green field had been lost upon him  i wonder if shes milked them cows he muttered to himself he gave a sigh of relief to find she had but she had done so not for his sake but for the sake of the poor patient dumb brutes  when he went to the bedroom after supper he found that the cradle and his wifes few little boxes and parcelspoor pathetic propertieshad been removed to the garret which they called a chamber and he knew he was to sleep alone again  shell git over it i guess he was very tired but he didnt feel quite comfortable enough to sleep the air was oppressive his shirt wet in places and stiff with dust in other places oppressed him more than usual so he rose and removed it getting a clean one out of a drawer this was an unusual thing for him for he usually slept in the same shirt which he wore in his days work but it was saturday night and he felt justified in the extravagance  in the meanwhile poor lucretia was brooding over her life in a most dangerous fashion all she had done and suffered for simeon burns came back to her till she wondered how she had endured it all all day long in the midst of the glorious summer landscape she brooded  i hate him she thought with a fierce blazing up through the murk of her musing i hate t live but they aint no hope im tied down i cant leave the children and i aint got no money i couldnt make a living out in the world i aint never seen anything an dont know anything  she was too simple and too unknowing to speculate on the loss of her beauty which would have brought her competency onceif sold in the right market as she lay in her little attic bed she was still sullenly thinking wearily thinking of her life she thought of a poor old horse which sim had bought once years before and put to the plough when it was too old and weak to work she could see her again as in a vision that poor old mare with sad head drooping toiling toiling till at last she could no longer move and lying down under the harness in the furrow groaned under the whipand died  then she wondered if her own numbness and despair meant death and she held her breath to think harder upon it she concluded at last grimly that she didnt careonly for the children  the air was frightfully close in the little attic and she heard the low mutter of the rising storm in the west she forgot her troubles a little listening to the faroff gigantic footsteps of the tempest  boom boom boom it broke nearer and nearer as if a vast cordon of cannon was being drawn around the horizon yet she was conscious only of pleasure she had no fear at last came the sweep of cool fragrant stormwind a short and sudden dash of rain and then in the cool sweet hush which followed the worn and weary woman fell into a deep sleep     iii   when she woke the younger children were playing about on the floor in their nightclothes and little pet was sitting in a square of sunshine intent on one of his shoes he was too young to know how poor and squalid his surroundings werethe patch of sunshine flung on the floor glorified it all helittle animalwas happy  the poor of the western prairies lie almost as unhealthily close together as do the poor of the city tenements in the small hut of the peasant there is as little chance to escape close and tainting contact as in the coops and dens of the north end of proud boston in the midst of oceans of land floods of sunshine and gulfs of verdure the farmer lives in two or three small rooms povertys eternal cordon is ever round the poor  ma why didnt you sleep with pap last night asked bob the sevenyearold when he saw she was awake at last she flushed a dull red  you hush will yeh becauseiit was too warmand there was a storm comin you never mind askin such questions is he gone out  yup i heerd him callin the pigs its sunday aint it ma  the fact seemed to startle her  why yes so it is wal now sadie you jump up an dress quick s ycan an bob an sile you run down an bring sm water she commanded in nervous haste beginning to dress in the middle of the room there was scarce space to stand beneath the rafters  when sim came in for his breakfast he found it on the table but his wife was absent  wheres yr ma he asked with a little less of the growl in his voice  shes upstairs with pet  the man ate his breakfast in dead silence till at last bob ventured to say  what makes ma ac so  shut up was the brutal reply the children began to take sides with the motherall but the oldest girl who was ten years old to her the father turned now for certain things to be done treating her in his rough fashion as a housekeeper and the girl felt flattered and docile accordingly  they wore pitiably clad like many farmchildren indeed they could hardly be said to be clad at all sadie had on but two garments a sort of undershirt of cotton and a faded calico dress out of which her bare yellow little legs protruded lamentably dirty and covered with scratches  the boys also had two garments a hickory shirt and a pair of pants like their fathers made out of browndenims by the mothers neverresting handshands that in sleep still sewed and skimmed and baked and churned the boys had gone to bed without washing their feet which now looked like toads calloused brown and chapped  part of this the mother saw with her dull eyes as she came down after seeing the departure of sim up the road with the cows it was a beautiful sunday morning and the woman might have sung like a bird if men had been as kind to her as nature but she looked dully out upon the seas of ripe grasses tangled and flashing with dew out of which the bobolinks and larks sprang the glorious winds brought her no melody no perfume no respite from toil and care  she thought of the children she saw in the townchildren of the merchant and banker clean as little dolls the boys in knickerbocker suits the girls in dainty white dressesand a vengeful bitterness sprang up in her heart she soon put the dishes away but felt too tired and listless to do more  tawbaywies pet want taawbaywies cried the little one tugging at her dress  listlessly mechanically she took him in her arms and went out into the garden which was fragrant and sweet with dew and sun after picking some berries for him she sat down on the grass under the row of cottonwoods and sank into a kind of lethargy a kingbird chattered and shrieked overhead the grasshoppers buzzed in the grasses strange insects with ventriloquistic voices sang all about hershe could not tell where  ma cant i put on my clean dress insisted sadie  i dont care said the brooding woman darkly leave me alone  oh if she could only lie here forever escaping all pain and weariness the wind sang in her ears the great clouds beautiful as heavenly ships floated far above in the vast dazzling deeps of blue sky the birds rustled and chirped around her leaping insects buzzed and clattered in the grass and in the vines and bushes the goodness and glory of god was in the very air the bitterness and oppression of man in every line of her face  but her quiet was broken by sadie who came leaping like a fawn down through the grass  o ma aunt maria and uncle william are coming theyve jest turned in  i dont care if they be she answered in the same dullyirritated way whatre they comin here today for i wan to know she stayed there immovably till mrs councill came down to see her piloted by two or three of the children mrs councill a jolly largeframed woman smiled brightly and greeted her in a loud jovial voice she made the mistake of taking the whole matter lightly her tone amounted to ridicule  sim says youve been having a tantrum creeshy dont know what for he says  he dont said the wife with a sullen flash in her eyes he dont know why well then you just tell him what i say ive lived in hell long enough im done ive slaved here day in and day out fr twelve years without paynot even a decent word ive worked like no nigger ever worked r could work and live ive given him all i had r ever expect to have im wore out my strength is gone my patience is gone im done with itthats a part of whats the matter  my sakes lucreeshy you mustnt talk that way  but i will said the woman as she supported herself on one palm and raised the other ive got to talk that way she was ripe for an explosion like this she seized upon it with eagerness they aint no use o livin this way anyway id take poison if it want fr the young ones  lucreeshy burns  oh i mean it  land sakes alive i blieve youre goin crazy  i shouldnt wonder if i was ive had enough t drive an indian crazy now you jest go off an leave me lone i aint no mind to visitthey aint no way out of it an im tired o tryin to find a way go off an let me be  her tone was so bitterly hopeless that the great jolly face of mrs councill stiffened into a look of horror such as she had not known for years the children in two separate groups could be heard rioting bees were humming around the clover in the grass and the kingbird chattered ceaselessly from the lombardy poplar tip both women felt all this peace and beauty of the morning dimly and it disturbed mrs councill because the other was so impassive under it all at last after a long and thoughtful pause mrs councill asked a question whose answer she knew would decide it allasked it very kindly and softly  creeshy are you comin in  no was the short and sullenly decisive answer mrs councill knew that was the end and so rose with a sigh and went away  wal goodby she said simply  looking back she saw lucretia lying at length with closed eyes and hollow cheeks she seemed to be sleeping halfburied in the grass she did not look up nor reply to her sisterinlaw whose life was one of toil and trouble also but not so hard and helpless as lucretias by contrast with most of her neighbors she seemed comfortable  sim burns what you ben doin to that woman she burst out as she waddled up to where the two men were sitting under a cottonwood tree talking and whittling after the manner of farmers  nawthin s fur s i know answered burns not quite honestly and looking uneasy  you neednt try t git out of it like that sim burns replied his sister that woman never got into that fit fr nawthin  wall if you know more about it than i do whadgy ask me fur he replied angrily  tut tut put in councill hold yr horses dont git on yr ear children keep cool and dont spile yr shirts most likely youre all t blame keep cool an swear less  wai ill bet sims more to blame than she is why they aint a harderworkin woman in the hull state of ioway than she is  except marm councill  except nobody look at her jest skin and bones  councill chuckled in his vast way thats so mother measured in that way she leads over you you git fat on it  she smiled a little her indignation oozing away she never could stay mad her children were accustomed to tell her burns refused to talk any more about the matter and the visitors gave it up and got out their team and started for home mrs councill firing this parting shot  the best thing you can do today is t let her alone mebbe the children ll bring her round agin if she does come round you see t you treat her a little more s y did when you was acourtin her  this way roared councill putting his arm around his wifes waist she boxed his ears while he guffawed and clucked at his team  burns took a measure of salt and went out into the pasture to salt the cows on the sunlit slope of the field where the cattle came running and bawling to meet him he threw down the salt in handfuls and then lay down to watch them as they eagerly licked it up even gnawing a bare spot in the sod in their eagerness to get it all  burns was not a drinking man he was hardworking frugal in fact he had no extravagances except his tobacco his clothes he wore until they all but dropped from him and he worked in rain and mud as well as dust and sun it was this suffering and toiling all to no purpose that made him sour and irritable he didnt see why he should have so little after so much hard work  he was puzzled to account for it all his mindthe average mindwas weary with trying to solve an insoluble problem his neighbors who had got along a little better than himself were free with advice and suggestion as to the cause of his persistent poverty  old man bacon the hardestworking man in the county laid it to burnss lack of management jim butler who owned a dozen farms which he had taken on mortgages and who had got rich by buying land at government price and holding for a rise laid all such cases as burnss to lack of enterprise foresight  but the larger number feeling themselves in the same boat with burns said  i d know seems as if things get worse an worse corn an wheat gittin cheaper n cheaper machinery eatin up profitsgot to have machinery to harvest the cheap grain an then the machinery eats up profits taxes goin up devil to pay all round i d know what in thunder is the matter  the democrats said protection was killing the farmers the republicans said no the grangers growled about the middlemen the greenbackers said there wasnt circulating medium enough and in the midst of it all hardworking discouraged farmers like simeon burns worked on unable to find out what really was the matter  and there on this beautiful sabbath morning sim sat and thought and thought till he rose with an oath and gave it up     iv   it was hot and brilliant again the next morning as douglass radbourn drove up the road with lily graham the teacher of the school in the little white schoolhouse it was blazing hot even though not yet nine oclock and the young farmers plowing beside the fence looked longingly and somewhat bitterly at radbourn seated in a fine topbuggy beside a beautiful creature in lace and cambric  very beautiful the townbred schoolmaam looked to those grimy sweaty fellows superb fellows too physically with bare red arms and leathercolored faces she was as if builded of the pink and white clouds soaring far up there in the morning sky so cool and sweet and dainty  as she came in sight their dusty and sweaty shirts grew biting as the poisoned shirt of the norse myth their bare feet in the brown dirt grew distressingly flat and hooflike and their huge dirty brown chapped and swollen hands grew so repulsive that the mere remote possibility of some time in the far future standing a chance of having an introduction to her caused them to wipe their palms on their trousers legs stealthily  lycurgus banks swore when he saw radbourn that cuss thinks hes ol hell this morning he dont earn his living but hes just the kind of cuss to get holt of all the purty girls  others gazed with simple sad wistfulness upon the slender figure pale sweet face and dark eyes of the young girl feeling that to have talk with such a fairylike creature was a happiness too great to ever be their lot and when she had passed they went back to work with a sigh and feeling of loss  as for lily she felt a pang of pity for these people she looked at this peculiar form of poverty and hardship much as the fragile tender girl of the city looks upon the men laying a gasmain in the streets she felt sympathetically the heat and grime and though but the faintest idea of what it meant to wear such clothing came to her she shuddered her eyes had been opened to these things by radbourn a classmate at the seminary  the young fellow knew that lily was in love with him and he made distinct effort to keep the talk upon impersonal subjects he liked her very much probably because she listened so well  poor fellows sighed lily almost unconsciously i hate to see them working there in the dirt and hot sun it seems a hopeless sort of life doesnt it  oh but this is the most beautiful part of the year said radbourn think of them in the mud in the sleet think of them husking corn in the snow a bitter wind blowing think of them a month later in the harvest think of them imprisoned here in winter  yes its dreadful but i never felt it so keenly before you have opened my eyes to it of course ive been on a farm but not to live there  writers and orators have lied so long about the idyllic in farm life and said so much about the independent american farmer that he himself has remained blind to the fact that hes one of the hardestworking and poorestpaid men in america see the houses they live inhovels  yes yes i know said lily a look of deeper pain swept over her face and the fate of the poor women oh the fate of the women  yes its a matter of statistics went on radbourn pitilessly that the wives of the american farmers fill our insane asylums see what a life they lead most of them no music no books seventeen hours a day in a couple of small roomsdens now there is sim burns what a travesty of a home yet there are a dozen just as bad in sight he works like a fiendso does his wifeand what is their reward simply a hole to hibernate in and to sleep and eat in in summer a dreary present and a wellnigh hopeless future no they have a future if they knew it and we must tell them  i know mrs burns lily said after a pause she sends several children to my school poor pathetic little things halfclad and wistfuleyed they make my heart ache they are so hungry for love and so quick to learn  as they passed the burns farm they looked for the wife but she was not to be seen the children had evidently gone up to the little white schoolhouse at the head of the lane radbourn let the reins fall slack as he talked on he did not look at the girl his eyebrows were drawn into a look of gloomy pain  it aint so much the grime that i abhor nor the labor that crooks their backs and makes their hands bludgeons its the horrible waste of life involved in it all i dont believe god intended a man to be bent to plowhandles like that but that aint the worst of it the worst of it is these people live lives approaching automata they become machines to serve others more lucky or more unscrupulous than themselves what is the world of art of music of literature to these poor devilsto sim burns and his wife there for example or even to the best of these farmers  the girl looked away over the shimmering lake of yellowgreen corn a choking came into her throat her gloved hand trembled  what is such a life worth its all very comfortable for us to say they dont feel it how do we know what they feel what do we know of their capacity for enjoyment of art and music they never have leisure or opportunity the master is very glad to be taught by preacher and lawyer and novelist that his slaves are contented and never feel any longings for a higher life these people live lives but little higher than their cattleare forced to live so their hopes and aspirations are crushed out their souls are twisted and deformed just as toil twists and deforms their bodies they are on the same level as the city laborer the very religion they hear is a soporific they are taught to be content here that they may be happy hereafter suppose there isnt any hereafter  oh dont say that please lily cried  but i dont know that there is he went on remorselessly and i do know that these people are being robbed of something more than money of all that makes life worth living the promise of milk and honey in canaan is all very well but i prefer to have mine here then im sure of it  what can we do murmured the girl  do rouse these people for one thing preach discontent a noble discontent  it will only make them unhappy  no it wont not if you show them the way out if it does its better to be unhappy striving for higher things like a man than to be content in a wallow like swine  but what is the way out  this was sufficient to set radbourn upon his hobbyhorse he outlined his plan of actionthe abolition of all indirect taxes the state control of all privileges the private ownership of which interfered with the equal rights of all he would utterly destroy speculative holdings of the earth he would have land everywhere brought to its best use by appropriating all ground rents to the use of the state etc etc to which the girl listened with eager interest but with only partial comprehension  as they neared the little schoolhouse a swarm of midgets in pink dresses pink sunbonnets and brown legs came rushing to meet their teacher with that peculiar devotion the children in the country develop for a refined teacher  radbourn helped lily out into the midst of the eager little scholars who swarmed upon her like bees on a lump of sugar till even radbourns gravity gave way and he smiled into her lifted eyesan unusual smile that strangely enough stopped the smile on her own lips filling her face with a wistful shadow and her breath came hard for a moment and she trembled  she loved that cold stern face oh so much and to have him smile was a pleasure that made her heart leap till she suffered a smothering pain she turned to him to say  i am very thankful mr radbourn for another pleasant ride adding in a lower tone it was a very great pleasure you always give me so much i feel stronger and more hopeful  im glad you feel so i was afraid i was prosy with my landdoctrine  oh no indeed no you have given me a new hope i am exalted with the thought i shall try to think it all out and apply it  and so they parted the children looking on and slyly whispering among themselves radbourn looked back after awhile but the bare little hive had absorbed its little group and was standing bleak as a tombstone and hot as a furnace on the naked plain in the blazing sun  americas pitiful boast said the young radical looking back at it only a miserable hint of what it might be  all that forenoon as lily faced her little group of barefooted children she was thinking of radbourn of his almost fierce sympathy for these poor supine farmers hopeless and in some cases content in their narrow lives the children almost worshiped the beautiful girl who came to them as a revelation of exquisite neatness and tastewhose very voice and intonation awed them  they noted unconsciously of course every detail snowy linen touches of soft color graceful lines of bust and sidethe slender fingers that could almost speak so beautifully flexile were they lily herself sometimes when she shook the calloused knotted stiffened hands of the women shuddered with sympathetic pain to think that the crowning wonder and beauty of gods world should be so maimed and distorted from its true purpose  even in the children before her she could see the inherited results of fruitless laborand more pitiful yet in the bent shoulders of the older ones she could see the beginnings of deformity that would soon be permanent and as these things came to her she clasped the poor wondering things to her side with a convulsive wish to make life a little brighter for them  how is your mother today she asked of sadie burns as she was eating her luncheon on the drabcolored table near the open window  purty well said sadie in a hesitating way  lily was looking out and listening to the gophers whistling as they raced to and fro she could see bob burns lying at length on the grass in the pasture over the fence his heels waving in the air his hands holding a string which formed a snare it was like fishing to young izaak walton  it was very still and hot and the cheep and trill of the gophers and the chatter of the kingbirds alone broke the silence a cloud of butterflies were fluttering about a pool near a couple of big flies buzzed and mumbled on the pane  what ails your mother lily asked recovering herself and looking at sadie who was distinctly ill at ease  oh i dunno sadie replied putting one bare foot across the other  lily insisted she n pas had an awful row  sadie said the teacher warningly what language  i mean they quarreled an she dont speak to him any more  why how dreadful  an pa hes awful cross and she wont eat when he does an i haf to wait on table  i believe ill go down and see her this noon said lily to herself as she divined a little of the state of affairs in the burns family     v   sim was mending the pasture fence as lily came down the road toward him he had delayed going to dinner to finish his task and was just about ready to go when lily spoke to him  good morning mr burns i am just going down to see mrs burns it must be time to go to dinnerarent you ready to go i want to talk with you  ordinarily he would have been delighted with the idea of walking down the road with the schoolmaam but there was something in her look which seemed to tell him that she knew all about his trouble and besides he was not in good humor  yes in a minnitsoons i fix up this hole them shoats i blieve would go through a keyhole if they could once get their snoots in  he expanded on this idea as he nailed away anxious to gain time he foresaw trouble for himself he couldnt be rude to this sweet and fragile girl if a man had dared to attack him on his domestic shortcomings he could have fought the girl stood waiting for him her large steady eyes full of thought gazing down at him from the shadow of her broadbrimmed hat  the world is so full of misery anyway that we ought to do the best we can to make it less she said at last in a musing tone as if her thoughts had unconsciously taken on speech she had always appealed to him strongly and never more so than in this softlyuttered abstractionthat it was an abstraction added to its power with him  he could find no words for reply but picked up his hammer and nailbox and slouched along the road by her side listening without a word to her talk  christ was patient and bore with his enemies surely we ought to bear with ourfriends she went on adapting her steps to his he took off his torn straw hat and wiped his face on his sleeve being much embarrassed and ashamed not knowing how to meet such argument he kept silent  how is mrs burns said lily at length determined to make him speak the delicate meaning in the emphasis laid on is did not escape him  oh shes all righti mean shes done her work jest the same as ever i dont see her much  i didnt knowi was afraid she was sick sadie said she was acting strangely  no shes well enoughbut  but what is the trouble wont you let me help you wont you she pleaded  cant anybody help us weve got o fight it out i spose he replied a gloomy note of resentment creeping into his voice shes ben in a devil of a temper fr a week  havent you been in the same kind of a temper too demanded lily firmly but kindly i think most troubles of this kind come from bad temper on both sides dont you have you done your share at being kind and patient  they had reached the gate now and she laid her hand on his arm to stop him he looked down at the slender gloved hand on his arm feeling as if a giant had grasped him then he raised his eyes to her face flushing a purplish red as he remembered his grossness it seemed monstrous in the presence of this girladvocate her face was like silver her eyes seemed pools of tears  i dont spose i have he said at last pushing by her he could not have faced her glance another moment his whole air conveyed the impression of destructive admission lily did not comprehend the extent of her advantage or she would have pursued it further as it was she felt a little hurt as she entered the house the table was set but mrs burns was nowhere to be seen calling her softly the young girl passed through the shabby little livingroom to the ovenlike bedroom which opened off it but no one was about she stood for a moment shuddering at the wretchedness of the room  going back to the kitchen she found sim about beginning on his dinner little pet was with him the rest of the children were at the schoolhouse  where is she  i d know out in the garden i expect she dont eat with me now i never see her she dont come near me i aint seen her since saturday  lily was shocked inexpressibly and began to see more clearly the magnitude of the task she had set herself to do but it must be done she felt that a tragedy was not far off it must be averted  mr burns what have you done what have you done she asked in terror and horror  dont lay it all to me she haint done nawthin but complain fr ten years i couldnt do nothin to suit her she was always naggin me  i dont think lucretia burns would nag anybody i dont say youre all to blame but im afraid you havent acknowledged you were any to blame im afraid youve not been patient with her im going out to bring her in if she comes will you say you were part to blame you neednt beg her pardonjust say youll try to be better will you do it think how much she has done for you will you  he remained silent and looked discouragingly rude his sweaty dirty shirt was open at the neck his arms were bare his scraggly teeth were yellow with tobacco and his uncombed hair lay tumbled about on his high narrow head his clumsy unsteady hands played with the dishes on the table his pride was struggling with his sense of justice he knew he ought to consent and yet it was so hard to acknowledge himself to blame the girl went on in a voice piercingly sweet trembling with pity and pleading  what word can i carry to her from you im going to go and see her if i could take a word from you i know she would come back to the table shall i tell her you feel to blame  the answer was a long time coming at last the man nodded an assent the sweat pouring from his purple face she had set him thinking her victory was sure  lily almost ran out into the garden and to the strawberry patch where she found lucretia in her familiar colorless shapeless dress picking berries in the hot sun the mosquitoes biting her neck and hands  poor pathetic dumb sufferer the girl thought as she ran up to her  she dropped her dish as she heard lily coming and gazed up into the tender pitying face not a word was spoken but something she saw there made her eyes fill with tears and her throat swell it was pure sympathy she put her arms around the girls neck and sobbed for the first time since friday night then they sat down on the grass under the hedge and she told her story interspersed with lilys horrified comments  when it was all told the girl still sat listening she heard radbourns calm slow voice again it helped her not to hate burns it helped her to pity and understand him  you must remember that such toil brutalizes a man it makes him callous selfish unfeeling necessarily a fine nature must either adapt itself to its hard surroundings or die men who toil terribly in filthy garments day after day and year after year cannot easily keep gentle the frost and grime the heat and cold will soon or late enter into their souls the case is not all in favor of the suffering wives and against the brutal husbands if the farmers wife is dulled and crazed by her routine the farmer himself is degraded and brutalized  as well as she could lily explained all this to the woman who lay with her face buried in the girls lap lilys arms were about her thin shoulders in an agony of pity  its hard lucretia i knowmore than you can bearbut you mustnt forget what sim endures too he goes out in the storms and in the heat and dust his boots are hard and see how his hands are all bruised and broken by his work he was tired and hungry when he said thathe didnt really mean it  the wife remained silent  mr radbourn says work as things go now does degrade a man in spite of himself he says men get coarse and violent in spite of themselves just as women do when everything goes wrong in the housewhen the flies are thick and the fire wont burn and the irons stick to the clothes you see you both suffer dont lay up this fit of temper against simwill you  the wife lifted her head and looked away her face was full of hopeless weariness  it aint this once it aint that t all its having no letup just doin the same thing right over n overno hope of anything better  if you had a hope of another world  dont talk that i dont want that kind o comfert i want a decent chance here i want o rest an be happy now lilys big eyes were streaming with tears what should she say to the desperate woman whats the use we might jest as well dieall of us  the womans livid face appalled the girl she was gaunt heavyeyed nerveless her faded dress settled down over her limbs showing the swollen knees and thin calves her hands with distorted joints protruded painfully from her sleeves and all about was the everrecurring wealth and cheer of nature that knows no fear or favorthe bees and flies buzzing in the sun the jay and kingbird in the poplars the smell of strawberries the motion of lush grass the shimmer of cornblades tossed gayly as banners in a conquering army  like a flash of keener light a sentence shot across the girls mind nature knows no titledeed the bounty of her mighty hands falls as the sunlight falls copious impartial her seas carry all ships her air is for all lips her lands for all feet  poverty and suffering such as yours will not last there was something in the girls voice that roused the woman she turned her dull eyes upon the youthful face  lily took her hand in both hers as if by a caress she could impart her own faith  look up dear when nature is so good and generous man must come to be better surely come go in the house again sim is there he expects you he told me to tell you he was sorry lucretias face twitched a little at that but her head was bent come you cant live this way there isnt any other place to go to  no that was the bitterest truth where on this wide earth with its forthshooting fruits and grains its fragrant lands and shining seas could this dwarfed bent broken middleaged woman go nobody wanted her nobody cared for her but the wind kissed her drawn lips as readily as those of the girl and the blooms of clover nodded to her as if to a queen  lily had said all she could her heart ached with unspeakable pity and a sort of terror  dont give up lucretia this may be the worst hour of your life live and bear with it all for christs sakefor your childrens sake sim told me to tell you he was to blame if you will only see that you are both to blame and yet neither to blame then you can rise above it try dear  something that was in the girl imparted itself to the wife electrically she pulled herself together rose silently and started toward the house her face was rigid but no longer sullen lily followed her slowly wonderingly  as she neared the kitchen door she saw sim still sitting at the table his face was unusually grave and soft she saw him start and shove back his chairsaw lucretia go to the stove and lift the teapot and heard her say as she took her seat beside the baby  want some more tea  she had become a wife and mother again but in what spirit the puzzled girl could not say       part v  saturday night on the farm boys and harvest hands    in mystery of town and play   the splendid lady lives alway   inwrought with starlight winds and streams   saturday night on the farm   a group of men were gathered in farmer grahams barn one rainy day in september the rain had stopped the stacking and the men were amusing themselves with feats of skill and strength steve nagle was the champion no matter what came up whether shouldering a sack of wheat or raising weights or suspending himself with one hand he left the others out of the race  aw its no good foolun with such puny little men as you he swaggered at last throwing himself down upon a pile of sacks  if our hired man was here i bet hed beat you all holler piped a boys voice from the doorway  steve raised himself up and glared  whats that thing talkun  the boy held his ground you can brag when he aint around but i bet he can lick you with one hand tied behind him dont you frank  frank was doubtful and kept a little out of sight he was afraid of steve as were indeed all the other men for he had terrorized the saloons of the county for years johnny went on about his hero  why he can take a sack of wheat by the corners and snap every kernel of it clean out he can lift a separator just as easy youd better brag when hes around  steves anger rose for he saw the rest laughing he glared around at them all like a hyena bring on this whelp lets see how he looks i aint seen him yit  pa says if lime went to a saloon where youd meet him once you wouldnt clean out that saloon johnny went on in a calm voice with a sort of undercurrent of glee in it he saw steves anger and was delighted  bring on this feller ill knock the everlasting spots offen im fr two cents  ill tell im that  tell him and be damned roared steve with a wolfish gleam in his eyes that drove the boys away whooping with mingled terror and delight  steve saw that the men about him held johnnys opinion of lime and it made him furious for several years he had held undisputed sovereignty over the saloons of rock county and when with both sleeves rolled up and eyes flaming with madness he had leaped into the center of a barroom floor with a wild shout everybody got out by doors windows or any other way sometimes taking sash and all and left him roaring with maniacal delight  no one used a revolver in those days shooting was almost unknown fights were tests of physical strength and savagery  harvest brought into iowa at that time a flood of rough and hardy men who drifted north with the moving line of ripening wheat and on saturday nights the saloons of the county were filled with them and steve found many chances to show his power among these strangers as they gathered in some saloon to make a night of it he loved to burst with his assertion of individual sovereignty                                       lime was out mending fence when johnny came home to tell him what steve had said johnny was anxious to see his faith in his hero justified and watched lime carefully as he pounded away without looking up his dress always had an easy slouch about his vast limbs and his pantaloons usually of some dark stuff he wore invariably tucked into his boottops his vest swinging unbuttoned his hat carelessly awry  being a quiet sober man he had never been in a saloon when steve entered to swing his hat to the floor and yell  im jack robinson i am i am the man that bunted the bull off the bridge im the best man in northern iowa he had met him of course but steve kept a check upon himself when sober  he says he can knock the spots off of you johnny said in conclusion watching lime roguishly  the giant finished nailing up the fence and at last said now run along sonny and git the cows there was a laugh in his voice that showed his amusement at johnnys disappointment i aint got any spots  on the following saturday night at dusk as lime was smoking his pipe out on the horseblock with the boys around him there came a swiftlydriven wagon down the road filled with a noisy load of men they pulled up at the gate with a prodigious shouting  hello lime  hello the house  hurrah for the show  its al crandall cried johnny running down to the gate lime followed slowly and asked whats up boys  all goin down to the show climb in  all right wait till i git my coat  lime was working one of grahams farms on shares in the summer in the winter he went to the pinery  oh cant we go lime pleaded the boys  if your dadll let you ill pay for the tickets  the boys rushed wildly to the house and as wildly back again and the team resumed its swift course for it was getting late it was a beautiful night the full moon poured down a cataract of silent white light like spray and the dew almost frost lay on the grass and reflected the glory of the autumn sky the air was still and had that peculiar property common to the prairie air of carrying sound to a great distance  the road was hard and smooth and the spirited little team bowled the heavy wagon along at a swift pace were late crandall said as he snapped his long whip over the heads of his horses and weve got to make it in twentyfive minutes or miss part of the show this caused johnny great anxiety he had never seen a play and wanted to see it all he looked at the flying legs of the horses and pushed on the dashboard chirping at them slyly  rock falls was the county town and the only town where plays could be produced it was a place of about 3000 inhabitants at that time and to johnnys childish eyes it was a very great place indeed to go to town was an event but to go with the men at night and to a show was something to remember a lifetime  there was little talk as they rushed along only some singing of a dubious sort by bill young on the back seat at intervals bill stopped singing and leaned over to say in exactly the same tone of voice each time al i hope t god we wont be late then he resumed his monotonous singing or said something coarse to rice who laughed immoderately  the play had begun when they climbed the narrow precarious stairway which led to the door of the hall every seat of the room was filled but as for the boys after getting their eyes upon the players they did not think of sitting or of moving for that matter they were literally all eyes and ears  the hall seated about 400 persons and the stage was a contrivance striking as to coloring as well as variety of pieces it added no little to the sport of the evening by the squeaks it gave out as the heavy man walked across and by the falling down of the calico wings and by the persistent refusal of the curtain to go down at the proper moment on the tableau at the back of the room the benches rose one above the other until the one at the rear was near the grimy ceiling these benches were occupied by the toughs of the town who treated each other to peanuts and slapped one another over the head with their soft shapeless hats and laughed inordinately when some fellows hat was thrown out of his reach into the crowd  the play was wilkie collins new magdalen and the part of mercy was taken by a large and magnificently proportioned woman a blonde and in johnnys eyes she seemed something divine with her grace and majesty of motion he took a personal pride in her at once and wanted her to come out triumphant in the end regardless of any conventional morality  true his admiration for the dark little womans tragic utterance at times drew him away from his breathless study of the queenly mercy but such moments were few within a half hour he was deeply in love with the heroine and wondered how she could possibly endure the fat man who played the part of horace and who pitched into the practicable supper of cold ham biscuit and currant wine with a gusto that suggested gluttony as the reason for his growing burden of flesh  and so the play went on the wonderful old lady in the cap and spectacles the mysterious dark little woman who popped in at short intervals to say beware in a very deep contralto voice the tender and repentant mercy all were new and wonderful beautiful things to the boys and though they stood up the whole evening through it passed so swiftly that the curtains fall drew from them long sighs of regret from that time on they were to dream of that wonderful play and that beautiful repentant woman so securely was she enthroned in their regard that no rude and senseless jest could ever unseat her of course the men as they went out laughed and joked in the manner of such men and swore in their disappointment because it was a serious drama in place of the comedy and the farce which they had expected  its a regular sell bill said i wanted to hear old plunket stid of all that stuff about nothin that was a lunkin goodlookin woman though he added with a coarse suggestion in his voice which exasperated johnny to the pitch of giving him a kick on the heel as he walked in front hyare young feller look where youre puttin your hoofs bill growled looking about  john was comforted by seeing in the face of his brother the same rapt expression which he felt was on his own he walked along almost mechanically scarcely feeling the sidewalk his thoughts still dwelling on the lady and the play it was after ten oclock and the stores were all shut the frost lay thick and white on the plank walk and the moon was shining as only a moon can shine through the rarefied air on the western prairies and overhead the stars in innumerable hosts swam in the absolutely cloudless sky  john stumbled along keeping hold of limes hand till they reached the team standing at the sidewalk shivering with cold the impatient horses stretched their stiffened limbs with pleasure and made off with a rearing plunge the men were noisy bill sang another song at the top of his voice as they rattled by the sleeping houses but as he came to an objectionable part of the song lime turned suddenly and said shut up on that will you and he became silent  rock falls after the most extraordinary agitation had just prohibited the sale of liquor at any point within two miles of the schoolhouse in the town this after strenuous opposition was enforced the immediate effect of the law was to establish saloons at the limit of the two miles and to throw a large increase of business into the hands of hank swartz in the retail part of his brewery which was situated about two miles from the town on the bank of the river he had immediately built a barroom and made himself ready for the increase of his trade which had previously been confined to supplying picnic parties with halfkegs of beer or an occasional glass to teamsters passing by hank had an eye to the main chance and boasted if the public gits ahead of me its got to be up and acomin  the road along which crandall was driving did not lead to hanks place but the river road which branched off a little farther on went by the brewery though it was a longer way around the men grew silent at last and the steady roll and rumble of the wagon over the smooth road was soothing and john laid his head in limes lap and fell asleep while looking at the moon and wondering why it always seemed to go just as fast as the team  he was awakened by a series of wild yells the snapping of whips and the furious rush of horses it was another team filled with harvesters trying to pass and not succeeding the fellows in the other wagon hooted and howled and cracked the whip but als little bays kept them behind until lime protested oh let em go al and then with a shout of glee the team went by and left them in a cloud of dust  say boys said bill that was pat sheehan and the nagle boys theyve turned off theyre goin down to hanks lets go too come on fellers what dyou say im allfired dry aint you  im willun said frank rice what dyou say lime john looked up into limes face and said to him in a low voice lets go home that was steve adrivin lime nodded and made a sign to john to keep still but john saw his head lift he had heard and recognized steves voice  it was pat sheehan sure repeated bill an i shouldnt wonder if the others was the nagle boys and eth cole  yes it was steve said al i saw his old hat as he went by  it was perfectly intelligible to lime that they were all anxious to have a meeting between steve and himself johnny saw also that if lime refused to go to the brewery he would be called a coward bill would tell it all over the neighborhood and his hero would be shamed at last lime nodded his head in consent and al turned off into the river road  when they drew up at the brewery by the river the other fellows had all entered and the door was shut there were two or three other teams hitched about under the trees the men sprang out and bill danced a jig in anticipation of the fun to follow if steve starts to lam lime therell be a circus  as they stood for a moment before the door al spoke to lime about steves probable attack i aint goin to hunt around for no row replied lime placidly and i dont believe steve is you lads he said to the boys watch the team for a little while cuddle down under the blankets if you git cold it aint no place for you in the inside we wont stop long he ended cheerily  the door opened and let out a dull red light closed again and all was still except an occasional burst of laughter and noise of heavy feet within the scene made an indelible impress upon john child though he was fifty feet away the river sang over its shallows broad and whitened with foam which gleamed like frosted silver in the brilliant moonlight the trees were dark and tall about him and loomed overhead against the starlit sky and the broad high moon threw a thick tracery of shadows on the dusty white road where the horses stood only the rhythmic flow of the broad swift river with the occasional uneasy movement of the horses under their creaking harnesses or the dull noise of the shouting men within the shanty was to be heard  john nestled down into the robes and took to dreaming of the lovely lady he had seen and wondered if when he became a man he should have a wife like her he was awakened by frank who was rousing him to serve a purpose of his own john was ten and frank fifteen he rubbed his sleepy eyes and rose under orders  say johnny what dyeh spose them fellers are doen in there you said steve was goin to lick lime you did it dont sound much like it in there hear um laugh he said viciously and regretfully say john you sly along and peek in and see what theyre up to an come an tell me while i hold the horses he said to hide the fact that john was doing a good deal for his benefit  john got slowly off the wagon and hobbled on toward the saloon stiff with the cold as he neared the door he could hear some one talking in a loud voice while the rest laughed at intervals in the manner of those who are listening to the good points in a story not daring to open the door johnny stood around the front trying to find a crevice to look in at the speaker inside had finished his joke and some one had begun singing  the building was a leanto attached to the brewery and was a rude and hastily constructed affair it had only two windows one was on the side and the other on the back the window on the side was out of johns reach so he went to the back of the shanty it was built partly into the hill and the window was at the top of the bank john found that by lying down on the ground on the outside he had a good view of the interior the window while level with the ground on the outside was about as high as the face of a man on the inside he was extremely wideawake now and peered in at the scene with round unblinking eyes  steve was making sport for the rest and stood leaning his elbow on the bar he was in rare good humor for him his hat was lying beside him and he was in his shirtsleeves and his cruel gray eyes pockmarked face and broken nose were lighted up with a frightful smile he was goodnatured now but the next drink might set him wild hank stood behind the high pine bar a broad but nervous grin on his round red face two big kerosene lamps through a couple of smoky chimneys sent a dull red glare upon the company which half filled the room  if steves face was unpleasant to look upon the nonchalant tigerlike poise and flex of his body was not he had been dancing it seemed and had thrown off his coat and as he talked he repeatedly rolled his blue shirtsleeves up and down as though the motion were habitual to him most of the men were sitting around the room looking on and laughing at steves antics and the antics of one or two others who were just drunk enough to make fools of themselves two or three sat on an old billiard table under the window through which john was peering  lime sat in his characteristic attitude his elbows upon his knees and his thumbs under his chin his eyes were lazily raised now and then with a lionlike action of the muscles of his forehead but he seemed to take little interest in the ribaldry of the other fellows john measured both champions critically and exulted in the feeling that steve was not so ready for the row with lime as he thought he was  after steve had finished his story there was a chorus of roars bully for you steve give us another etc steve much flattered nodded to the alert saloonkeeper and said give us another hank as the rest all sprang up he added pull out that brandy kaig this time hank trot her out you whitelivered dutchman he roared as swartz hesitated  the brewer fetched it up from beneath the bar but he did it reluctantly in the midst of the hubbub thus produced an abnormally tall and lanky fellow known as high bedloe pushed up to the bar and made an effort to speak and finally did say solemnly  genlmun steve say genlmun don less mix our drinks  this was received with boisterous delight in which bedloe could not see the joke and looked feebly astonished  just at this point john received such a fright as entirely took away his powers of moving or breathing for something laid hold of his heels with deadly grip he was getting his breath to yell when a familiar voice at his ear said in a tone somewhere between a whisper and a groan  say what they up to all this while im sick o waitn out there  frank had become impatient as for john he had been so absorbed by the scenes within he had not noticed how the frosty ground was slowly stiffening his limbs and setting his teeth chattering they were both now looking in at the window john had simply pointed with his mittened stubby thumb toward the interior and frank had crawled along to a place beside him  mixing the drinks had produced the disastrous effect which hank and bedloe had anticipated the fun became uproarious there were songs and dances by various members of the nagle gang but limes crowd being in the minority kept quiet occasionally standing treat as was the proper thing to do  but steve grew wilder and more irritable every moment he seemed to have drunk just enough to let loose the terrible force that slept in his muscles he had tugged at his throat until the strings of his woolen shirt loosened displaying the great sloping muscles of his neck and shoulders white as milk and hard as iron his eyes rolled restlessly to and fro as he paced the floor his pantherlike step was full of a terrible suggestiveness the breath of the boys at the window came quicker and quicker they saw he was working himself into a rage that threatened momentarily to break forth into a violence he realized that this was a crisis in his career his reputation was at stake  young as john was he understood the whole matter as he studied the restless steve and compared him with his impassive hero sitting immovable  you see lime cant go away he explained breathlessly to frank in a whisper cause theyd tell it all over the country that he backed down for steve he daresnt leave  steve aint no durn fool returned the superior wisdom of frank in the same cautious whisper keeping his eyes on the barroom see lime there cool as a cucumber hes from the pineries he is he ended in a tone of voice intended to convey that fighting was the principal study of the pineries and that lime had graduated with the highest honors steve aint agon to pitch into him yet awhile you bet yr bottom dollar he aint drunk enough for that  each time the invitation for another drink was given they noticed that lime kept on the outside of the crowd and some one helped him to his glass dont you see he aint drinkin hes throwin it away said frank there see hes foolun em he aint agon to be drunk when steve tackles him oh therell be music in a minute or two  steve now walked the floor pouring forth a flood of profanity and challenges against men who were not present he had not brought himself to the point of attacking the unmoved and silent giant some of the younger men and especially the pleader against mixed drinks had succumbed and were sleeping heavily on the back end of the bar and on the billiard table hank was getting anxious and the forced smile on his face was painful to see over the whole group there was a singular air of waiting no one was enjoying himself and all wished that they were on the road home but there was no way out of it now it was evident that lime purposed forcing the beginning of the battle on steve he sat in statuesque repose  steve had got his hat in his hand and held it doubled up like a club and every time that he turned in his restless walk he struck the bar a resounding blow his eyes seemed to see nothing although they moved wildly from side to side  he lifted up his voice in a raucous snarl im the man that struck billy patterson im the man that bunted the bull off the bridge anybody got anything to say nows his time im here bring on your champion  foam came into the corners of his mouth and the veins stood out on his neck his red face shone with its swollen veins he smashed his fists together threw his hat on the floor tramped on it snarling out curses nothing kept him in check save the imperturbability of the seated figure everybody expected him to clear the saloon to prove his power  bedloe who was asleep on the table precipitated matters by rolling off with a prodigious noise amid a pandemonium of howls and laughter in his anxiety to see what was going on frank thrust his head violently against the window and it crashed in sending the glass rattling down on the table  steve looked up a red sheen in his eyes like that of a wild beast instantly his fury burst out against this new object of attentiona wild unreasoning rage  what you doen there who air ye ye mangy little dog  both boys sank back in tumultuous shuddering haste and rolled down the embankment while they heard the voice of steve thundering fetch the little whelp here  there was a rush from the inside a sudden outpouring and the next moment john felt a hand touch his shoulder steve dragged him around to the front of the saloon before he could draw his breath or utter a sound the rest crowded around  what are y doen there said steve shaking him with insane vindictiveness  drop that boy said the voice of lime and voice never sounded sweeter drop that boy he repeated and his voice had a peculiar sound as if it came through his teeth  steve dropped him and turned with a grating snarl upon lime who opened his way through the excited crowd while johnny stumbled leaped and crawled out of the ring and joined frank oh its you is it you whiteliveredhe did not finish for the arm of the blond giant shot out against his face like a beetle and down he rolled on the grass the sound of the blow made johnny give an involuntary quick cry  no human bein could have stood up agin that blow crandall said afterwards it was like a mule akickin  as steve slowly gained his feet the silence was so great that johnny could hear the thumping of his heart and the fierce almost articulate breathing of steve the chatter and roar of the drunken crowd had been silenced by this encounter of the giants the open door where hank stood sent a reddish bar of light upon the two men as they faced each other with a sort of terrific calm in his swift gaze in search of his brother john noticed the dark wood the river murmuring drowsily over its foamwreathed pebbles and saw his brothers face white with excitement but not fear  limes blow had dazed steve for a moment but at the same time it had sobered him he came to his feet with a rising mutter that sounded like the swelling snarl of a tiger he had been taken by surprise before and he now came forward with his hands in position to vindicate his terrible reputation the two men met in a frightful struggle blows that meant murder were dealt by each each slapping thud seemed to carry the cracking of bones in it steve was the more agile of the two and circled rapidly around striking like a boxer  every time his face came into view with set teeth and ferocious scowl the boys spirits fell but when they saw the calm determined eyes of lime his watchful confident look they grew assured all depended upon him the nagle gang were like wolves in their growing ferocity and as they outnumbered the other party two to one it was a critical quarter of an hour in a swift retrospect they remembered the frightful tales told of this very spotof the killing of lars peterson and his brother nels and the brutal hammering a crowd of drunken men had given to big ole of the wapsy  the blood was trickling down limes face from a cut on his cheek but steves face was swollen and ghastly from the three blows which he had received lime was saving himself for a supreme effort the nagle party encouraged by the sound of the blows which steve struck began to yell and to show that they were ready to take a hand in the contest  go it steve well back yeh give it to im were with yeh well tend to the rest they began to pull off their coats  rice also threw off his coat never mind these cowards lime hold on fair play he yelled as he saw young nagle about to strike lime from behind  his cry startled lime and with a sudden leap he dealt steve a terrible blow full in the face and as he went reeling back made another leaping lunge and struck him to the grounda motion that seemed impossible to one of his bulk but as he did so one of the crowd tripped him and sent him rolling upon the prostrate steve whose friends leaped like a pack of snarling wolves upon limes back there came into the giants heart a terrible blind desperate resolution with a hoarse inarticulate cry he gathered himself for one supreme effort and rose from the heap like a bear shaking off a pack of dogs and holding the stunned and nerveless steve in his great hands with one swift incredible effort literally swept his opponents body in the faces of the infuriated men rushing down upon him  come on you red hellions he shouted in a voice like a lion at bay the light streamed on his bared head his hands were clinched his chest heaved in great gasps there was no movement the crowd waited with their hands lowered before such a man they could not stand for a moment they could not meet the blaze of his eyes for a moment it seemed as if no one breathed  in the silence that followed bill who had kept gut of sight up to this moment piped out in a high weak falsetto with a comically questioning accent all quiet along the potomac boys  lime unbraced wiped his face and laughed the others joined in cautiously no thank yez none in mine said sheehan in answer to the challenge of lime whan oi take to fightin stameingins oill lit you knaw  well i should say so said another lime youre the best man that walks this state  git out of the way you whitelivered hound or ill blow hell out o yeh said steve who had recovered himself sufficiently to know what it all meant he lay upon the grass behind the rest and was weakly trying to get his revolver sighted upon lime one of the men caught him by the shoulder and the rest yelled  hyare steve no shootin it was a fair go and youre whipped  steve only repeated his warnings to get out of the way lime turned upon him and kicked the weapon from his outstretched hand breaking his arm at the wrist the bullet went flying harmlessly into the air and the revolver hurtled away into the shadows  walking through the ring lime took john by the hand and said come boy this is no place for you lets go home fellers he drawled in his customary lazy way when y want me you know where to find me come boys the circus is over the last dog is hung  for the first mile or two there was a good deal of talk and bill said he knew that lime could whip the whole crowd  but where was you bill about the time they had me down i dont remember hearin anything of you long about that time bill  bill had nothing to say  made me think somehow of daniel in the lions den said johnny  what do you mean by that johnny said bill it made me think of a circus the circus therell be when limes woman finds out what hes been adoin  great scott boys you mustnt tell on me said lime in genuine alarm  as for john he lay with his head in limes lap looking up at the glory of the starlit night and with a confused mingling of the play of the voice of the lovely woman of the shouts and blows at the brewery in his mind and with the murmur of the river and the roll and rumble of the wagon blending in his ears he fell into a sleep which the rhythmic beat of the horses hoofs did not interrupt       part vi   village cronies a game of checkers at the grocery    the village life abounds with jokers   shiftless conscienceless and shrewd   some village cronies   colonel peavy had just begun the rubber with squire gordon of cerro gordo county they were seated in robies grocery behind the rusty old cannon stove the checkerboard spread out on their knees the colonel was grinning in great glee wringing his bony yellow hands in nervous excitement in strong contrast to the stolid calm of the fat squire  the colonel had won the last game by a large margin and was sure he had his opponents dodges well in hand it was early in the evening and the grocery was comparatively empty robie was figuring at a desk and old judge brown stood in legal gravity warming his legs at the redhot stove and swaying gently back and forth in speechless content it was a tough night outside one of the toughest for years the frost had completely shut the window panes as with thick blankets of snow the streets were silent  i dont know said the judge reflectively to robie breaking the silence in his rasping judicial bass i dont know as there has been such a night as this since the night of february 2d 59 that was the night james kirk went underhonorable kirk you rememberknew him well brilliant fellow ornament to western bar but whisky downed him itll beat the oldest mani wonder where the boys all are tonight dont seem to be any one stirring on the street aint frightened out by the cold  shouldnt wonder robie was busy at his desk and not in humor for conversation on reminiscent lines the two old wardogs at the board had settled down to one of those long silent struggles which ensue when two champions meet in the silence which followed the judge was looking attentively at the back of the colonel and thinking that the old thief was getting about down to skin and bone he turned with a yawn to robie saying  this cold weather must take hold of the old colonel terribly hes so damnably thin and bald you knowbald as a babe the fact is the old colonel aint long for this world anyway think so hank robie making no reply the judge relapsed into silence for awhile watching the cat perilously walking along the edge of the upper shelf and listening to the occasional hurrying footsteps outside i dont know when ive seen the windows closed up so hank go down to thirty below tonight devilish strong wind blowing too tough night on the prairies hank  you bet replied hank briefly  the colonel was plainly getting excited his razorlike back curved sharper than ever as he peered into the intricacies of the board to spy the trap which the fat squire had set for him at this point the squeal of boots on the icy walk outside paused and a moment later amos ridings entered with whiskers covered with ice and looking like a huge bear in his buffalo coat  by josephus its cold he roared as he took off his gloves and began to warm his face and hands at the fire  is it asked the judge comfortably rising on his tiptoes only to fall back into his usual attitude legal legs well spread shoulders thrown back  you bet it is replied amos i dknow when ive felt the cold moren i have tday its jest snifty doubles me up like a jackknife judge how do you stand it  tolerble tolerble amos but were agin we aint what we were once cold takes hold of us  thats a fact answered amos to the retrospective musings of the judge time was you an me would go t singingschool or sleighriding with the girls on a night like this and never notice it  yes sir yes sir said the judge with a sigh it was a little uncertain in robies mind whether the judge was regretting the lost ability to stand the cold or the lost pleasure of riding with the girls  great days those gentlemen lived in vermont then hotbloodedlungs like an ox i remember sallie dearborn and i used to go afoot to singingschool down the valley four miles but now wouldnt go riding tonight with the handsomest woman in america and the best cutter in rock river  oh youve got both feet in the grave up t the ankles anyway said robie from his desk but the judge immovably gazed at the upper shelf on the other side of the room where the boilers and pans and washboards were stored  the judge is a little on the sentimental order tonight said amos  hold on colonel hold on youve goto jump hah hah roared gordon from the checkerboard thats right thats right he ended as the colonel complied reluctantly  sock it to the old cuss commented amos what i was going to say he resumed rolling down the collar of his coat was that when my wife helped me bundle up tnight she said i was gittn t be an old granny we are agin judge thes no denyin that were both gray as norway rats now an speaking of us agin reminds mehave y noticed how bald the old kyernels gittn  i have amos answered the judge mournfully the old mans head is showing age showing age getting thin up there aint it  the old colonel bent to his work with studied abstraction and even when amos said judicially after long scrutiny yes hell soon be as bald as a plate he only lifted one yellow freckled bony hand and brushed his carroty growth of hair across the spot under discussion gordon shook his fat paunch in silent laughter nearly displacing the board  i was just telling robie pursued brown still retaining his reminiscent intonation that this storm takes the cake over anything  at this point steve roach and another fellow entered steve was ridings hired hand a herculean fellow with a drawl and a liability for taking offense quite as remarkable  say gents im no spring rooster but this jest gits away with anything in line of cold i ever see  while this communication was being received in ruminative silence steve was holding his ears in his hand and gazing at the intent champions at the board there they sat the old squire panting and wheezing in his excitement for he was planning a great snap on the colonel whose red and freckled nose almost touched the board it was a solemn battle hour the wind howled mournfully outside the timbers of the store creaked in the cold and the huge cannon stove roared in steady bass  speaking about ears said steve after a silence dummed if id like t be quite s bare round the ears as kernel there i wonder if any o you fellers has noticed how the ol fellers lost hair this last summer hes gittin bald theys no coverin it upgittin bald as a plate  youre right stephen said the judge as he gravely took his stand behind his brother advocate and studied with the eye of an adept the field of battle we were noticing it when you came in its a sad thing but it must be admitted  its the kyernels brains wearin up through his hair i take it commented amos as he helped himself to a handful of peanuts out of the bag behind the counter say steve did y stuff up that hole in front of ol barney  a shout was heard outside and then a rush against the door and immediately two young fellows burst in followed by a fierce gust of snow one was professor knapp the other editor foster of the morning call  well gents hows this for high said foster in a peculiar tone of voice at which all began to smile he was a slender fellow with closeclipped assertive red hair in this company we now have the majesty of the law the power of the press and the underpinning of the american civilization all represented hello there are a couple of old roosters with their heads together gordon my old enemy how are you  gordon waved him off with a smile and a wheeze dont bother me now ive got im im laying fr the old dog whist  got nothing snarled the colonel you try that on if you want to just swing that man in there if you think its healthy for him just as like as not youll slip up on that little trick  ha say you so old true penny the kunnel has met a foeman worthy of his steel said foster in great glee as he bent above the colonel i know how do i know quotha by the curve on the kunnels back the size of the parabola described by that backbone accurately gauges his adversarys skill but by the way gentlemen have youbut thats a nice point and i refer all nice points to professor knapp professor is it in good taste to make remarks concerning the dress or features of another  certainly not answered knapp a handsome young fellow with a yellow mustache  not when the person is an esteemed public character like the colonel here what i was about to remark if it had been proper was that the old fellow is getting wofully bald hell soon be bald as an egg  say asked the colonel i want to know how long youre going to keep this thing up somebodys dummed sure t get hurt soon  there there colonel said brown soothingly dont get excited youll lose the rubber dont mind em keep cool  yes keep cool kunnel its only our solicitude for your welfare chipped in foster then addressing the crowd in a general sort of way he speculated curious how a man a plain american citizen like colonel peavy wins a place in the innermost affections of a whole people  thats so murmured the rest  he cant grow bald without deep sympathy from his fellowcitizens it amounts to a public calamity  the old colonel glared in speechless wrath  say gents pleaded gordon let up on the old man for the present hes going to need all of himself if he gets out o the trap hes in now he waved his fat hand over the colonels head and smiled blandly at the crowd hugging the stove  my head may be bald grated the old man with a deathshead grin indescribably ferocious but its got brains enough in it to skunk any man in this crowd three games out o five  the ol man rather gits the laugh on y there gents called robie from the other side of the counter i haint seen the old skeesix play bettern he did last night in years  not since his return from canada after the war i reckon said amos from the kerosene barrel  hold on amos put in the judge warningly thats outlawed talking about being bald and the war reminds me of the night walters and i by the way where is walters tonight  sick put in the colonel straightening up exultantly i waxed him three straight games last night you wont see him again till spring skunked him once and beat him twice  oh git out  hear the old seed twitter  did you ever notice gentlemen how lying and baldness go together queried foster reflectively  no do they  invariably ive known many colossal liars and they were all as bald as apples  the colonel was getting nervous and was so slow that even gordon who could sit and stare at the board a full half hour without moving began to be impatient  come colonel marshal your forces a little more promptly if youre going at me echelon sound yr bugle im ready  dont worry answered the colonel in his calmest nasal ill accommodate you with all the fight you want  did it ever occur to you began the judge again addressing the crowd generally as he moved back to the stove and lit another cigar did it ever occur to you that it is a little singular a man should get bald on the top of his head first curious fact so accustomed to it we no longer wonder at it now see the colonel there quite a growth of hair on his clapboarding as it were but devilish thin on his roof  here the colonel looked up and tried to say something but the judge went on imperturbably  now i take it that its strictly providential that a man gets bald on top of his head first because if he must get bald it is best to get bald where it can be covered up  by jinks thats a fact said foster in high admiration of the judges ratiocination steve was specially pleased and drawing a neckyoke from a barrel standing near pounded the floor vigorously  talking about being bald put in foster reminds me of a scheme of mine which is to send no one out to fight indians but bald men think how powerless theyd be in  the talk now drifted off to indians politics and religion edged round to the war when the grave judge began telling ridings and robie just how kilpatrick charged along the granny white turnpike and on a sheet of wrappingpaper was showing where major john dilrigg fell i was on his left about thirty yards when i saw him throw up his hand  foster in a low voice was telling something to the professor and two or three others which made them whoop with uncontrollable merriment when the roaring voice of big sam walters was heard outside and a moment later he rolled into the room filling it with his noise lottridge the watchmaker and erlberg the german baker came in with him  hello hello hello all here are yeh  all here waiting for youand the turnkey said foster  well here i am always on hand like a sore thumb in huskin season whats goin on here a game hey hello gordon its you is it colonel i owe you several for last night but what the devil yo got your cap on fur colonel aint it warm enough here for yeh  the desperate colonel who had snatched up his cap when he heard walters coming grinned painfully pulling his straggly red and white beard nervously the strain was beginning to tell on his iron nerves he removed the cap and with a few muttered words went back to the game but there was a dangerous gleam in his fishy blue eyes and the grizzled tufts of red hair above his eyes lowered threateningly a man who is getting swamped in a game of checkers is not in a mood to bear pleasantly any remarks on his bald head  oh dont take it off colonel went on his tormentor hospitably when a man gets as old as you are hes privileged to wear his cap i wonder if any of you fellers have noticed how the colonel is shedding his hair  the old man leaped up scattering the men on the checkerboard which flew up and struck squire gordon in the face knocking him off his stool the old colonel was ashy pale and his eyes glared out from under his huge brow like sapphires lit by flame his spare form clothed in a seedy prince albert frock towered with a singular dignity his features worked convulsively a moment then he burst forth like the explosion of a safety valve  shuttup damyeh  and then the crowd whooped roared and rolled on the counters and barrels and roared and whooped again they stamped and yelled and ran around like fiends kicking the boxes and banging the coal scuttle in a perfect pandemonium of mirth leaving the old man standing there helpless in his wrath mad enough to shoot steve was just preparing to seize the old man from behind when squire gordon struggling to his feet among the spittoons cried out in the voice of a colonel of fourth of july militia  hold  silence was restored and all stood around in expectant attitudes to hear the squires explanation he squared his elbows shoved up his sleeves puffed out his fat cheeks moistened his lips and began pompously gentlemen  youve hit it thats us said some of the crowd in applause  gentlemen of rock river when in the course of human events rumor had blowd to my ears the history of the checkerplaying of rock river and when i had waxed cerro gordo and claiborne and mower then when i say to my ears was borne the clash of resounding arms in rock river the emporium of rock county then did i yearn for more worlds to conquer and behold i buckled on my armor and i am here  behold he is here said foster in confirmation of the statement good for you squire git breath and go for us some more  hurrah for the squire etc  i came seekin whom i might devour like a raging lion i sought foeman worthy of my steel i leaped into the arena and blew my challenge to the four quarters of rock  good fr you settemupagin go it you old balloon they all applauded  knowing my prowess i sought a fair fout and no favors i met the enemy and he was mine champion after champion went down before me likewent down likeahem went down before me like grass before the mighty cyclone of the andes  listen to the old blowhard said steve  put him out said the speaker imperturbably gentlemen have i the floor  you have replied brown but come to the point the colonel is anxious to begin shooting the colonel who began to suspect himself victimized stood wondering what under heaven they were going to do next  i am agittn there said the orator with a broad and sunny condescension i found your champions an laid em low i waxed walters and then i tackled the colonel i tried the echelon the general advance then the give away and flank movements but the colonel was there till this last game it was a fair field and no favor and now gentlemen of rock i desire t state to my deeply respected opponent that he is still champion of rock and im not sure but of northern iowa  three cheers for the kunnel  and while they were being given the colonels brows relaxed and the champion of cerro gordo continued earnestly  and now i wish to state to colonel the solemn fact that i had nothing to do with the job put up on him tonight i scorn to use such means in a battle colonel you may be as bald as an apple or an egg yes or a plate but you can play more checkers than any man i ever met more checkers than any other man on gods green footstool with one single lone exceptionmyself  at this moment somebody hit the squire from cerro gordo with a decayed apple and as the crowd shouted and groaned robie turned down the lights on the tumult the old colonel seized the opportunity for putting a handful of salt down walters neck and slipped out of the door like a ghost as the crowd swarmed out on the icy walk editor foster yelled  gents let me give you a pointer keep your eye peeled for the next edition of the rock river morning call  and the bitter wind swept away the answering shouts of the pitiless gang       part vii   drifting crane the indian and the pioneer    before them surely sullenly and slow   the desperate and cheated indians go   drifting crane   the people of boomtown invariably spoke of henry wilson as the oldest settler in the jim valley as he was of buster county but the eastern man with his ideas of an old settler was surprised as he met the short silent middleaged man who was very loath to tell anything about himself and about whom many strange and thrilling stories were told by good storytellers in 1879 he was the only settler in the upper part of the valley living alone on the banks of the elm a slow tortuous stream pulsing lazily down the valley too small to be called a river and too long to be called a creek for two years it is said wilson had only the company of his cattle especially during the wintertime and now and then a visit from an indian or a trapper after mink and muskrats  between his ranch and the settlements in eastern dakota there was the wedgeshaped reservation known as the sisseton indian reserve on which were stationed the customary agency and company of soldiers but of course at that time the indians were not restricted closely to the bounds of the reserve but ranged freely over the vast and beautiful prairie lying between the coteaux or ranges of low hills which mark out the jim valley the valley was unsurveyed for the most part and the indians naturally felt a sort of proprietorship in it and when wilson drove his cattle down into the valley and squatted the chief drifting crane welcomed him as a host might to an abundant feast whose hospitality was presumed upon but who felt the need of sustaining his reputation as a host and submitted graciously  the indians during the first summer got to know wilson and liked him for his silence his courage his generosity but the older men pondered upon the matter a great deal and watched with grave faces to see him ploughing up the sod for his garden there was something strange in this solitary man thus deserting his kindred coming here to live alone with his cattle they could not understand it what they said in those pathetic dimly lighted lodges will never be known but when winter came and the newcomer did not drive his cattle back over the hills as they thought he would then the old chieftains took long counsel upon it night after night they smoked upon it and at last drifting crane said to two of his young men go ask this cattleman why he remains in the cold and snow with his cattle ask him why he does not drive his cattle home  this was in march and one evening a couple of days later as wilson was about reentering his shanty at the close of his days work he was confronted by two stalwart indians who greeted him pleasantly  how de do how de do he said in reply come in come in and take a snack  the indians entered and sat silently while he put some food on the table they hardly spoke till after they had eaten the indian is always hungry for the reason that his food supply is insufficient and his clothing poor when they sat on the crackerboxes and soapboxes which served as seats they spoke they told him of the chieftains message they said they had come to assist him in driving his cattle back across the hills that he must go  to all this talk in the indians epigrammatic way and in the dialect which has never been written the rancher replied almost as briefly you go back and tell drifting crane that i like this place that im here to stay that i dont want any help to drive my cattle im on the lands of the great father at washington and drifting crane aint got any say about it now that sizes the whole thing up i aint got anything against you nor against him but im a settler thats my constitution and now im settled im going to stay  while the indians discussed his words between themselves he made a bed of blankets on the floor and said i never turn anybody out a white man is just as good as an indian as long as he behaves himself as well you can bunk here  the indians didnt understand his words fully but they did understand his gesture and they smiled and accepted the courtesy so like their own rude hospitality then they all smoked a pipe of tobacco in silence and at last wilson turned in and went serenely off to sleep hearing the mutter of the indians lying before the fire  in the morning he gave them as good a breakfast as he hadbacon and potatoes with coffee and crackers then he shook hands saying come again i aint got anything against you youve done yr duty now go back and tell your chief what ive said im at home every day good day  the indians smiled kindly and drawing their blankets over their arms went away toward the east  during april and may two or three reconnoitering parties of landhunters drifted over the hills and found him out he was glad to see them for to tell the truth the solitude of his life was telling on him the winter had been severe and he had hardly caught a glimpse of a white face during the three midwinter months and his provisions were scanty  these parties brought great news one of them was the advance surveying party for a great northern railroad and they said a line of road was to be surveyed during the summer if their report was favorable  well what dye think of it wilson asked with a smile  think its immense said a small man in the party whom the rest called judge balser why theyll be a town of four thousand inhabitants in this valley before snow flies well send the surveyors right over the divide next month  they sent some papers to wilson a few weeks later which he devoured as a hungry dog might devour a plate of bacon the papers were full of the wonderful resources of the jim valley it spoke of the nutritious grasses for stock it spoke of the successful venture of the lonely settler wilson how his stock fattened upon the winter grasses without shelter etc what vegetables he grew etc etc  wilson was reading this paper for the sixth time one evening in may he had laid off his boots his pipe was freshly filled and he sat in the doorway in vast content unmindful of the glory of color that filled the western sky and the superb evening chorus of the prairiechickens holding conventions on every hillock he felt something touch him on the shoulder and looked up to see a tall indian gazing down upon him with a look of strange pride and gravity wilson sprang to his feet and held out his hand  drifting crane how de do  the indian bowed but did not take the settlers hand drifting crane would have been called old if he had been a white man and there was a look of age in the fixed lines of his powerful strongly modeled face but no suspicion of weakness in the splendid poise of his broad muscular body there was a smileless gravity about his lips and eyes which was very impressive  im glad to see you come in and get something to eat said wilson after a moments pause  the chief entered the cabin and took a seat near the door he took a cup of milk and some meat and bread silently and ate while listening to the talk of the settler  i dont brag on my biscuits chief but they eat if a man is hungry enough an the milks all right i suppose youve come to see why i aint moseying back over the divide  the chief after a long pause began to speak in a low slow voice as if choosing his words he spoke in broken english of course but his speech was very direct and plain and had none of those absurd figures of rhetoric which romancers invariably put into the mouths of indians his voice was almost lionlike in its depth and yet was not unpleasant it was easy to see that he was a chief by virtue of his own personality  cattleman my young men brought me bad message from you they brought your words to me saying he will not go away  thats about the way the thing stands replied wilson in response to the question that was in the old chiefs steady eyes im here to stay this aint your land this is uncle sams land and part of itll be mine as soon as the surveyors come to measure it off  who gave it away asked the chief my people were cheated out of it they didnt know what they were doing  i cant help that thats for congress to say thats the business of the great father at washington wilsons voice changed he knew and liked the chief he didnt want to offend him they aint no use making a fuss chief you wont gain anything  there was a look of deep sorrow in the old mans face at last he spoke again the cattleman is welcome but he must go because whenever one white man goes and calls it good the others come drifting crane has seen it far in the east twice the white men come thick as the grass they tear up the sod they build houses they scare the buffalo away they spoil my young men with whisky already they begin to climb the eastern hills soon they will fill the valley and drifting crane and his people will be surrounded the sod will all be black  i hope youre right was the ranchers grim reply  but they will not come if the cattleman go back to say the water is not good there is no grass and the indians own the land  wilson smiled at the childish faith of the chief wont do chiefwont do that wont do any good i might as well stay  the chief rose he was touched by the settlers laugh his eyes flashed his voice took on a sterner note the white man must go  wilson rose also he was not a large man but he was a very resolute one i shant go he said through his clinched teeth each man understood the tones of the other perfectly  it was a thrilling a significant scene it was in absolute truth the meeting of the modern vidette of civilization with one of the rearguard of retreating barbarism each man was a type each was wrong and each was right the indian as true and noble from the barbaric point of view as the white man he was a warrior and huntermade so by circumstances over which he had no control guiltless as the panther because war to a savage is the necessity of life  the settler represented the unflagging energy and fearless heart of the american pioneer narrowminded partly brutalized by hard labor and a lonely life yet an admirable figure for all that as he looked into the indians face he seemed to grow in height he felt behind him all the weight of the millions of westwardmoving settlers he stood the representative of an unborn state he took down a rifle from the wallthe magazine rifle most modern of guns he patted the stock pulled the crank throwing a shell into view  you know this thing chief  the indian nodded slightly  well ill go whenthisisempty  but my young men are many  so are the white menmy brothers  the chiefs head dropped forward wilson ashamed of his boasting put the rifle back on the wall  im not here to fight you can kill me any time you could a killed me tonight but it wouldnt do any good it ud only make it worse for you why theyll be a town in here biggern all your tribe before two grass from now it aint no use drifting crane its got to be you an i cant help nr hinder it i know just how you feel about it but i tell yeh it aint no use to fight  drifting crane turned his head and gazed out on the western sky still red with the light of the fallen sun his face was rigid as bronze but there was a dreaming prophetic look in his eyes a lump came into the settlers throat for the first time in his life he got a glimpse of the infinite despair of the indian he forgot that drifting crane was the representative of a vagabond race he saw in him or rather felt in him something almost magnetic he was a man and a man of sorrows the settlers voice was husky when he spoke again and his lips trembled  chief id go tomorrow if it ud do any good but it wontnot a particle you know that when you stop to think a minute what good did it do to massacree all them settlers at new ulm what good will it do to murder me and a hundred others not a bit a thousand others would take our places so i might just as well stay and we might just as well keep good friends killin is out o fashion dont do any good  there was a twitching about the stern mouth of the indian chief he understood all too well the irresistible logic of the pioneer he kept his martial attitude but his broad chest heaved painfully and his eyes grew dim at last he said goodby cattleman right drifting crane wrong shake hands goodby he turned and strode away  the rancher watched him till he mounted his pony picketed down by the river watched him as with drooping head and rein flung loose upon the neck of his horse he rode away into the dusk hungry weary and despairing to face his problem alone again for the thousandth time the impotence of the indians arm and the hopelessness of his fate were shown as perfectly as if two armies had met and soaked the beautiful prairie sod with blood  this is all wrong muttered the settler theres land enough for us all or ought to be i dont understand well ill leave it to uncle sam anyway he ended with a sigh       part viii   old daddy deering the country fiddler      like scotlands harper   or irish piper with his droning lays   before the spread of modern life and light   the country fiddler slowly disappears   daddy deering  i   they were threshing on farmer jennings place when daddy made his very characteristic appearance milton a boy of thirteen was gloomily holding sacks for the measurer and the glory of the october day was dimmed by the suffocating dust and poisoned by the smarting beards and chaff which had worked their way down his neck the bitterness of the dreaded task was deepened also by contrast with the gambols of his cousin billy who was hunting rats with growler amid the last sheaves of the stack bottom the piercing shrieks of billy as he clapped his hands in murderous glee mingled now and again with the barking of the dog  the machine seemed to fill the world with its snarling boom which became a deafening yell when the cylinder ran empty for a moment it was nearly noon and the men were working silently with occasional glances toward the sun to see how near dinnertime it was the horses dripping with sweat and with patches of foam under their harness moved round and round steadily to the cheery whistle of the driver  the wild imperious song of the bellmetal cogwheel had sung into miltons ears till it had become a torture and every time he lifted his eyes to the beautiful faroff sky where the clouds floated like ships a lump of rebellious anger rose in his throat why should he work in this choking dust and deafening noise while the hawks could sail and sweep from hill to hill with nothing to do but play  occasionally his uncle the feeder smiled down upon him his face black as a negro great goggles of glass and wirecloth covering his merry eyes his great goodnature shone out in the flash of his white teeth behind his dusky beard and he tried to encourage milton with his smile he seemed tireless to the other hands he was so big and strong he had always been miltons boyish hero so milton crowded back the tears that came into his eyes and would not let his uncle see how childish he was  a spectator riding along the road would have remarked upon the lovely setting for this picturesque scenethe low swells of prairie shrouded with faint misty light from the unclouded sky the flaming colors of the trees the faint sound of cowbells and the cheery sound of the machine but to be a tourist and to be a toiler in a scene like this are quite different things  they were anxious to finish the setting by noon and so the feeder was crowding the cylinder to its limit rolling the grain in with slow and apparently effortless swaying from side to side halfburied in the loose yellow straw but about eleven oclock the machine came to a stand to wait while a broken tooth was being replaced and milton fled from the terrible dust beside the measuringspout and was shaking the chaff out of his clothing when he heard a high snappy nasal voice call down from the strawpile a tall man with a face completely masked in dust was speaking to mr jennings  say young man i guess youll haf to send another man up here its poorty stiff work fr two yes sir poorty stiff  there there i thought youd cry cavy laughed mr jennings i told you it wasnt the place for an old man  old man snarled the figure in the straw i aint so old but i can daown you siryessir condemmit yessir  im your man replied jennings smiling up at him  the man rolled down the side of the stack disappearing in a cloud of dust and chaff when he came to light milton saw a tall gaunt old man of sixty years of age or older nothing could be seen but a dusty expanse of face ragged beard and twinkling sharp little eyes his color was lost his eyes half hid without waiting for ceremony the men clinched the crowd roared with laughter for though jennings was the younger the older man was a giant still and the struggle lasted for some time he made a gallant fight but his breath gave out and he lay at last flat on his back  i wish i was your age young man he said ruefully as he rose id knock the heads o these young scamps tgetheryessiri could do it too  talks a good dog uncle said a young man  the old man turned on him so ferociously that he fled  run condemn yeh i own y can beat me at that  his face was not unpleasant though his teeth were mainly gone and his skin the color of leather and wrinkled as a pan of cream his eyes had a certain sparkle of fun that belied his rasping voice which seemed to have the power to lift a boy clean off his feet his frame was bent and thin but of great height and breadth bony and tough as hickory at some far time vast muscles must have rolled on those giant limbs but toil had bent and stiffened him  never been sick a day n my life no sir he said in his rapid rasping emphatic way as they were riding across the stubble to dinner and by gol i cn stand as long at the tail of a stacker as any man sir dummed if i turn my hand for any man in the state no sir no sir but if i do two mens works i am goin to have two mens paythats all sir  jennings laughed and said all right uncle ill send another man up there this afternoon  the old man seemed to take a morbid delight in the hard and dirty places and his endurance was marvelous he could stand all day at the tail of a stacker tirelessly pushing the straw away with an indifferent air as if it were all mere play  he measured the grain the next day because it promised to be a noisier and dustier job than working in the straw and it was in this capacity that milton came to know and to hate him and to associate him with that most hated of all tasks the holding of sacks to a twelveyearold boy it seems to be the worst job in the world  all day while the hawks wheel and dip in the glorious air and the trees glow like banks of roses all day while the younger boys are tumbling about the sunlit straw to be forced to stand holding sacks like a convict was maddening daddy whose rugged features bent shoulders and ragged cap loomed through the suffocating blinding dust necessarily came to seem like the jailer who held the door to freedom  and when the dust and noise and monotony seemed the very hardest to bear the old mans cackling laugh was sure to rise above the howl of the cylinder  nem mind sonny chaff aint pizen dust wont hurt ye a mite and when milton was unable to laugh the old man tweaked his ear with his leathery thumb and finger  then he shouted long disconnected yarns to which milton could make neither head nor tail and which grew at last to be inaudible to him just as the steady boom and snarl of the great machine did then he fell to studying the old mans clothes which were a wonder to him he spent a good deal of time trying to discover which were the original sections of the coat and especially of the vest which was ragged and yellow with age with the cottonbatting working out and yet daddy took the greatest care of it folding it carefully and putting it away during the heat of the day out of reach of the crickets  one of his peculiarities as mrs jennings learned on the second day was his habit of coming to breakfast but he always earned all he got and more too and as it was probable that his living at home was frugal mrs jennings smiled at his thrift and quietly gave him his breakfast if he arrived late which was not often  he had bought a little farm not far away and settled down into a mode of life which he never afterward changed as he was leaving at the end of the third day he said  now sir if you want any bootcherin done im yr man i dont turn m hand over fr any man in the state no sir i cn git a hawg on the gambrils jest a leetle quickern any other man i ever see yes sir by gum  all right uncle ill send for you when im ready to kill     ii   hogkilling was one of the events of a boys life on a western farm and daddy was destined to be associated in the minds of shep and milton with another disagreeable job that of building the fire and carrying water  it was very early on a keen biting morning in november when daddy came driving into the yard with his rude longrunnered sled one horse half his length behind the other in spite of the drivers clucking he was delighted to catch the boys behind in the preparation  aahhrrhh he rasped out you lazy vagabons why aint you got that fire blazin what the devil do y mean you rascals here it is broad daylight and that fire not built i vum sir you need a thrashin the whole kit an bilun of ye yessir come come come hustle now stir your boots hustle yr bootsha ha ha  it was of no use to plead cold weather and damp chips  what has that got to do with it sir i vum sir when i was your age i could make a fire of green redoak yessir dont talk to me of colds stir your stumps and get warm sir  the old man put up his horses and fed them generously with oats and then went to the house to ask for a leetle something hotmince pie or sassidge his request was very modest but as a matter of fact he sat down and ate a very hearty breakfast while the boys worked away at the fire under the big kettle  the hired man under daddys direction drew the bobsleighs into position on the sunny side of the corncrib and arranged the barrel at the proper slant while the old man ground his knives milton turning the grindstoneanother hateful task which daddys stories could not alleviate  daddy never finished a story if he started in to tell about a horsetrade it infallibly reminded him of a cattle trade and talking of cattle switched him off upon logging and logging reminded him of some heavy snowstorms he had known each parenthesis outgrew its proper limits till he forgot what should have been the main story his stories had some compensation for when he stopped to try to recollect where he was the pressure on the grindstone was released  at last the water was hot and the time came to seize the hogs this was the old mans great moment he stood in the pen and shrieked with laughter while the hired men went rolling one after the other upon the ground or were bruised against the fence by the rush of the burly swine  youre a fine lot he laughed now then sir grab im why dont ye nail im i vum sir if i couldnt do bettern that sir id sell out i would sir by gol get out o the way  with a lofty scorn he waved aside all help and stalked like a gladiator toward the pigs huddled in one corner of the pen and when the selected victim was rushing by him his long arm and great bony hand swept out caught him by the ear and flung him upon his side squealing with deafening shrillness but in spite of his smiling concealment of effort daddy had to lean against the fence and catch his breath even while he boasted  im an old codger sir but im wortha dozen o youspindlelegged chaps dum me if i aint sir  his pride in his ability to catch and properly kill a hog was as genuine as the old knighterrants pride in his ability to stick a knife into another steelclothed brigand like himself when the slain shote was swung upon the planking on the sled before the barrel daddy rested while the boys filled the barrel with water from the kettle  there was always a weird charm about this stage of the work to the boys the sun shone warm and bright in the lee of the corncrib the steam rose up white and voluminous from the barrel the eaves dropped steadily the hens ventured near nervously but full of curiosity while the men laughed and joked with daddy starting him off on long stories and winking at each other when his back was turned  at last he mounted his planking selecting mr jennings to pull upon the other handle of the hoghook he considered he conferred a distinct honor in this selection  the times been sir when i wouldnt thank any man for his help no sir wouldnt thank im  what do you do with these things asked one of the men kicking two iron candlesticks which the old man laid conveniently near  scrape a hawg with them sir what did y spose you numbskull well i never saw anything  youll have a chance mighty quick sir grab ahold sir swing im aroundthere now easy easy now then one two one twothats right  while he dipped the porker in the water pulling with his companion rhythmically upon the hook he talked incessantly mixing up scraps of stories and boastings of what he could do with commands of what he wanted the other man to do  the best man i ever worked with now turn im turn im he yelled reaching over jennings wrist grab under my wrist there wont ye never learn how to turn a hawg now out with im was his next wild yell as the steaming hog was jerked out of the water upon the planking now try the hair on them ears beautiful scald he said clutching his hand full of bristles and beaming with pride never see anything finer here bub a pail of hot water quick try one of them candlesticks they aint no better scraper than the bottom of an old iron candlestick no sir dum your newfangled scrapers i made a bet once with old jake ridgeway that i could scrape the hair offn two hawgs by gum quickern he could one jake was blowin about a new scraper he had   yes yes yes dump it right into the barrel condemmit aint you got no gumption so sim smith he held the watch sim was a mighty good hand twork with he was about the only man i ever sawed with who didnt ride the saw he could jerk a crosscut saw now let him in again now heho once again roll him over now that foreleg needs a tech o water now out with him again thats right thats right by gol a beautiful scald as ever i see  milton standing near caught his eye again clean that ear sir what the devil you standin there for he returned to his story after a pause and jake he scraped awayhyare he shouted suddenly dont ruggle the skin like that cant you see the way i do it leave it smooth as a baby siryessir  he worked on in this way all day talking unceasingly never shirking a hard job and scarcely showing fatigue at any moment  im short o breath a leetle thats all never git tired but my wind gives out dum cold got on me too  he ate a huge supper of liver and potatoes still working away hard at an ancient horsetrade and when he drove off at night he had not yet finished a single one of the dozen stories he had begun     iii   but pitching grain and hogkilling were on the lower levels of his art for above all else daddy loved to be called upon to play the fiddle for dances he officiated for the first time at a dance given by one of the younger mcturgs they were all fiddlers themselveshad been for three generationsbut they seized the opportunity of helping daddy and at the same time of relieving themselves of the trouble of furnishing the music while the rest danced  milton attended this dance and saw daddy for the first time earning his money pleasantly from that time on the associations around his personality were less severe and they came to like him better he came early with his old fiddle in a timeworn whitepine box his hair was neatly combed to the top of his long narrow head and his face was very clean the boys all greeted him with great pleasure and asked him where he would sit  eight on that table sir put a chair up there  he took his chair on the kitchentable as if it were a throne he wore huge moccasins of moosehide on his feet and for special occasions like this added a paper collar to his red woolen shirt he took off his coat and laid it across his chair for a cushion it was all very funny to the young people but they obeyed him laughingly and while they formed on he sawed his violin and coaxed it up to concert pitch and twanged it and banged it into proper tunefulness  aaallready there he rasped out with prodigious force everybody git into his place then lifting one huge foot he put the fiddle under his chin and raising his bow till his knuckles touched the strings he yelled already glang and brought his foot down with a startling bang on the first note rye doodle doo doodle doo  as he went on and the dancers fell into rhythm the clatter of heavy boots seemed to thrill him with oldtime memories and he kept boisterous time with his foot while his high rasping nasal rang high above the confusion of tongues and heels and swaying forms  ladies gran change four hands round balance all ellyman left back to playcis  his eyes closed in a sort of intoxication of pleasure but he saw all that went on in some miraculous way  first lady lead to the righttoodle rum rum gent foller after step along thar four hands round  the boys were immensely pleased with him they delighted in his antics rather than in his tunes which were exceedingly few and simple they seemed never to be able to get enough of one tune which he called honest john and which he played in his own way accompanied by a chant which he meant without doubt to be musical  honers tew your pardnerstee teedle deedle dee dee dee dee stand up straight an put on your style right an left four  the hat was passed by the floormanager during the evening and daddy got nearly three dollars which delighted milton very much  at supper he insisted on his prerogative which was to take the prettiest girl out to supper  lookahere daddy aint that crowdin the mourners objected the others  what do you mean by that sir no sir always done it in michigan and yark state both yes sir  he put on his coat ceremoniously while the tittering girls stood about the room waiting he did not delay his keen eyes had made selection long before and approaching rose watson with oldfashioned elaborate gallantry he said may i have the pleasure and marched out triumphantly amidst shouts of laughter  his shrill laugh rang high above the rest at the table as he said im the youngest man in this crowd sir demmit i bet a hat i cn dance down any man in this crowd yes sir the old man can do it yet  they all took sides in order to please him  ill bet he can said hugh mcturg ill bet a dollar on daddy  ill take the bet said joe randall and with great noise the match was arranged to come the first thing after supper  all right sir any time sir ill let you know the old man is on earth yet  while the girls were putting away the supper dishes the young man lured daddy out into the yard for a wrestlingmatch but some of the others objected  oh now that wont do if daddy was a young man  what do you mean sir i am young enough for you sir just let me get ahold o you sir and ill show you you young rascal you dem jackanapes he ended almost shrieking with rage as he shook his fist in the face of his grinning tormentors  the others held him back with much apparent alarm and ordered the other fellows away  there there daddy i wouldnt mind him i wouldnt dirty my hands on him he aint worth it just come inside and well have that dancingmatch now  daddy reluctantly returned to the house and having surrendered his violin to hugh mcturg was ready for the contest as he stepped into the middle of the room he was not altogether ludicrous his rusty trousers were bagged at the knee and his red woolen stockings showed between the tops of his moccasins and his pantaloonlegs and his coat utterly characterless as to color and cut added to the stoop in his shoulders and yet there was a rude sort of grace and a certain dignity about his bearing which kept down laughter they were to have a square dance of the oldfashioned sort  farrm on he cried and the fiddler struck out the first note of the virginia reel daddy led out rose and the dance began he straightened up till his tall form towered above the rest of the boys like a weatherbeaten pinetree as he balanced and swung and led and called off the changes with a voice full of imperious command  the fiddler took a malicious delight toward the last in quickening the time of the good old dance and that put the old man on his mettle  go it ye young rascal he yelled he danced like a boy and yelled like a demon catching a laggard here and there and hurling them into place like tops while he kicked and stamped wound in and out and waved his hands in the air with a gesture which must have dated back to the days of washington at last flushed breathless but triumphant he danced a final breakdown to the tune of leather breeches to show he was unsubdued     iv   but these rare days passed away as the country grew older it lost the wholesome simplicity of pioneer days and daddy got a chance to play but seldom he no longer pleased the boys and girlshis music was too monotonous and too simple he felt this very deeply once in a while he broke out to some of the old neighbors in protest against the changes  the boys i used to trot on m knee are gittin too hightoned they wouldnt be found dead with old deering and then the preachers are gittin thick and howlin agin dancin and the countrys filling up with dutchmen sot im left out  as a matter of fact there were few homes now where daddy could sit on the table in his ragged vest and rusty pantaloons and play honest john while the boys thumped about the floor there were few homes where the old man was even a welcome visitor and he felt this rejection keenly the women got tired of seeing him about because of his uncleanly habits of spitting and his tiresome stories many of the old neighbors had died or moved away and the young people had gone west or to the cities men began to pity him rather than laugh at him which hurt him more than their ridicule they began to favor him at threshing or at the fall hogkilling  oh youre getting old daddy youll have to give up this heavy work of course if you feel able to do it why all right like to have you do it but i guess well have to have a man to do the heavy lifting i spose  i spose not sir i am jest as able to yank a hawg as ever sir yes sir demmitdemmit do you think ive got one foot in the grave  nevertheless daddy often failed to come to time on appointed days and it was painful to hear him trying to explain trying to make light of it all  m caugh wouldnt let me sleep last night a goldum leetle nasty ticklin caugh too but it kept me awake fact was anwell m wife she said i hadnt better come but dont you worry sir it wont happen again sir no sir  his hands got stiffer year by year and his simple tunes became practically a series of squeaks and squalls there came a time when the fiddle was laid away almost altogether for his left hand got caught in the cogwheels of the horsepower and all four of the fingers on that hand were crushed thereafter he could only twang a little on the strings it was not long after this that he struck his foot with the ax and lamed himself for life  as he lay groaning in bed mr jennings went in to see him and tried to relieve the old mans feelings by telling him the number of times he had practically cut his feet off and said he knew it was a terrible hard thing to put up with  gol dummit it aint the pain the old sufferer yelled its the dum awkwardness ive chopped all my life i can let an ax in up to the makers name and hew to a hairline yes sir it was jest them dum new mittens my wife made they was s slippery he ended with a groan  as a matter of fact the one accident hinged upon the other it was the failure of his left hand with its useless fingers to do its duty that brought the ax down upon his foot the pain was not so much physical as mental to think that he who could hew to a hairline right and left hand should cut his own foot like a tenyearold boythat scared him it brought age and decay close to him for the first time in his life he felt that he was fighting a losing battle  a man like this lives so much in the flesh that when his limbs begin to fail him everything else seems slipping away he had gloried in his strength he had exulted in the thrill of his lifeblood and in the swell of his vast muscles he had clung to the idea that he was strong as ever till this last blow came upon him and then he began to think and to tremble  when he was able to crawl about again he was not the same man he was gloomy and morose snapping and snarling at all that came near him like a wounded bear he was alone a great deal of the time during the winter following his hurt neighbors seldom went in and for weeks he saw no one but his hired hand and the faithful dumb little old woman his wife who moved about without any apparent concern or sympathy for his suffering the hired hand whenever he called upon the neighbors or whenever questions were asked said that daddy hung around over the stove most of the time paying no attention to any one or anything he aint dangerous tall he said meaning that daddy was not dangerously ill  milton rode out from school one winter day with bill the hand and was so much impressed with his story of daddys condition that he rode home with him he found the old man sitting bent above the stove wrapped in a quilt shivering and muttering to himself he hardly looked up when milton spoke to him and seemed scarcely to comprehend what he said  milton was much alarmed at the terrible change for the last time he had seen him he had towered above him laughingly threatening to warm his jacket and now here he sat a great hulk of flesh his mind flickering and flaring under every wind of suggestion soon to go out altogether  in reply to questions he only muttered with a trace of his old spirit im all right jest as good a man as i ever was only im cold ill be all right when spring comes so t i cn git outdoors somethin to warm me up yessir im cold thats all  the young fellow sat in awe before him but the old wife and bill moved about the room taking very little interest in what the old man said or did bill at last took down the violin ill wake him up he said this always fetches the old feller now watch im  oh dont do that milton said in horror but bill drew the bow across the strings in the same way that daddy always did when tuning up  he lifted his head as bill dashed into honest john in spite of miltons protest he trotted his feet after a little and drummed with his hands on the arms of his chair then smiled a little in a pitiful way finally he reached out his right hand for the violin and took it into his lap he tried to hold the neck with his poor old mutilated left hand and burst into tears  dont you do that again bill milton said its better for him to forget that now you take the best care of him you can tonight i dont think hes going to live long i think you ought to go for the doctor right off  oh hes been like this for the last two weeks he aint sick hes jest old thats all replied bill brutally  and the old lady moving about without passion and without speech seemed to confirm this and yet milton was unable to get the picture of the old man out of his mind he went home with a great lump in his throat                                       the next morning while they were at breakfast bill burst wildly into the room  come over there all of you we want you  they all looked up much scared whats the matter bill  daddys killed himself said bill and turned to rush back followed by mr jennings and milton  while on the way across the field bill told how it all happened  he wouldnt go to bed the old lady couldnt make him and when i got up this morning i didnt think nothin about it i sposed of course hed gone to bed all right but when i was going out to the barn i stumbled across something in the snow and i felt around and there he was he got hold of my revolver someway it was on the shelf by the washstand and i spose he went out there sot we wouldnt hear him  i dassnt touch him he said with a shiver and the old woman she jest slumped down in a chair an set therewouldnt do a thingso i come over to see you  miltons heart swelled with remorse he felt guilty because he had not gone directly for the doctor to think that the old sufferer had killed himself was horrible and seemed impossible  the wind was blowing the snow cold and dry across the yard but the sun shone brilliantly upon the figure in the snow as they came up to it there daddy lay the snow was in his scant hair and in the hollow of his vast halfnaked chest a pistol was in his hand but there was no mark upon him and miltons heart leaped with quick relief it was delirium not suicide  there was a sort of majesty in the figure halfburied in the snow his hands were clenched and there was a frown of resolution on his face as if he had fancied death coming and had gone defiantly forth to meet him       part ix  the sociable at dudleys dancing the weevily wheat      good night lettie     goodnight ben     the moon is sinking at the west   good night my sweetheart once again   the parting kiss while comrades wait   impatient at the roadside gate   and the red moon sinks beyond the west   the sociable at dudleys  i   john jennings was not one of those men who go to a donation party with fifty cents worth of potatoes and eat and carry away two dollars worth of turkey and jellycake when he drove his team around to the front door for mrs jennings he had a sack of flour and a quarter of a fine fat beef in his sleigh and a fivedollar bill in his pocketbook a contribution to elder wheats support  milton his twentyyearold son was just driving out of the yard seated in a fine new cutter drawn by a magnificent gray fouryearold colt he drew up as mr jennings spoke  now be sure and dont never leave him a minute untied and see that the harness is all right do you hear milton  yes i hear answered the young fellow rather impatiently for he thought himself old enough and big enough to look out for himself  dont race will y milton was his mothers anxious question from the depth of her shawls  not if i can help it was his equivocal response as he chirruped to marc antony the grand brute made a rearing leap that brought a cry from the mother and a laugh from the young driver and swung into the road at a flying pace the night was clear and cold the sleighing excellent and the boys heart was full of exultation  it was a joy just to control such a horse as he drew rein over that night large with the long lithe body of a tiger and the broad clear limbs of an elk the gray colt strode away up the road his hoofs flinging a shower of snow over the dasher the lines were like steel rods the sleigh literally swung by them the traces hung slack inside the thills the bells clashed out a swift clamor the runners seemed to hiss over the snow as the duckbreasted cutter swung round the curves and softly rose and fell along the undulating road  on either hand the snow stood billowed against the fences and amid the wide fields of cornstalks bleached in the wind over in the east above the line of timber skirting cedar creek the vast slightly gibbous moon was rising sending along the crusted snow a broad path of light other sleighs could be heard through the still cold air far away a party of four or five were singing a chorus as they spun along the road  something sweet and unnamable was stirring in the young fellows brain as he spun along in the marvelously still and radiant night he wished eileen were with him the vast and cloudless blue vault of sky glittered with stars which even the radiant moon could not dim not a breath of air was stirring save that made by the swift strong stride of the horse  it was a night for youth and love and bells and milton felt this consciously and felt it by singing    stars of the summer night   hide in your azure deeps   she sleepsmy lady sleeps  he was on his way to get bettie moss one of his old sweethearts who had become more deeply concerned with the life of edwin blackler he had taken the matter with sunny philosophy even before meeting eileen deering at the seminary and he was now on his way to bring about peace between ed and bettie who had lately quarreled incidentally he expected to enjoy the sleighride  stiddy boy ho boy stiddy old fellow he called soothingly to marc as he neared the gate and whirled up to the door a girl came to the door as he drove up her head wrapped in a white hood a shawl on her arms she had been waiting for him  hello milt that you  its me been waiting  i should say i had begun t think youd gone back on me everybody elses gone  well hop in here before you freeze well not be the last ones there yes bring the shawl youll need it t keep the snow off your face he called authoritatively  taint snowin is it she asked as she shut the door and came to the sleighs side  clear as a bell he said as he helped her in  then wherell the snow come from  from marcs heels  goodness sakes you dont expect me t ride after that wildheaded critter do you  his answer was a chirp which sent marc halfway to the gate before bettie could catch her breath the reins stiffened in his hands bettie clung to him shrieking at every turn in the road milton jennings if you tip us over ill  milton laughed drew the colt down to a steady swift stride and bettie put her hands back under the robe  i wonder who that is ahead he asked after a few minutes which brought them in sound of bells  i guess its cy hurd it sounded like his bells when he went past i guess its him and bill an belle an cad hines  expect to see ed there asked milton after a little pause  i dont care whether i ever see him again or not she snapped  oh yes you do he answered feeling somehow her insincerity  welli dont  milton didnt care to push the peacemaking any further however he had curiosity enough to ask what upset things tween you n ed  oh nothing  you mean none o my business  i didnt say so  no you didnt need to he laughed and she joined in  yes thats cy hurd i know that laugh of his fars i cn hear it said bottie as they jingled along i wonder whos with him  well mighty soon see said milton as he wound the lines around his hands and braced his feet giving a low whistle which seemed to run through the colts blood like fire his stride did not increase in rate but its reach grew majestic as he seemed to lengthen and lower his broad feet flung great disks of hardpacked snow over the dasher and under the clash of his bells the noise of the other team grew plainer  get out of the way sang milton as he approached the other team there was challenge and exultation in his tone  hello in a hurry shouted those in front without increasing their own pace  yaas something of a hurry drawled milton in a disguised voice  waal turn out an go by if you are  no thankee ill just let m nag nibble the hay out o your box an take it easy  sure o that  you bet high i am milton nudged bettie who was laughing with delight its bill an his bays he thinks there isnt a team in the country can keep up with him get out o the way there he shouted again im in a hurry  let em out let em out bill they heard cy say and the bays sprang forward along the level road the bells ringing like mad the snow flying the girls screaming at every lurch of the sleighs but marcs head still shook haughtily above the endgate still the foam from his lips fell upon the hay in the box ahead  git out o this yip yelled bill to his bays but marc merely made a lunging leap and tugged at the lines as if asking for more liberty milton gave him his head and laughed to see the great limbs rise and fall like the pistons of an engine they swept over the weeds like a hawk skimming the stubble of a wheat field  get out o the way or ill run right over your back yelled milton again  try it was the reply  grab hold of me bettie and lean to the right when we turn this corner im going to take the inside track and pass em  youll tip us over  no i wont do as i tell you  they were nearing a wide corner where the road turned to the right and bore due south through the woods milton caught sight of the turn gave a quick twist of the lines around his hands leaned over the dasher and spoke shrilly  git out o this marc  the splendid brute swerved to the right and made a leap that seemed to lift the sleigh and all into the air the snow flew in such stinging showers milton could see nothing the sleigh was on one runner heeling like a yacht in a gale the girl was clinging to his neck he could hear the bells of the other sleigh to his left marc was passing them he heard shouts and the swish of a whip another convulsive effort of the gray and then milton found himself in the road again in the moonlight where the apparently unwearied horse with head outthrust nostril wideblown and body squared was trotting like a veteran on the track the team was behind  stiddy boy  milton soothed marc down to a long easy pace then turned to bettie who had uncovered her face again  how d y like it  my sakes i dont want any more of that if id a known you was goin t drive like that i wouldnt a come youre worsen ed i expected every minute wed be down in the ditch but oh aint he jest splendint she added in admiration of the horse  dont y want to drive him  oh yes let me try i drive our teams  she took the lines and at miltons suggestion wound them around her hands she looked very pretty with the moon shining on her face her eyes big and black with excitement and milton immediately put his arm around her and laid his head on her shoulder milton jennings you dont  look out he cried in mock alarm dont you drop those lines he gave her a severe hug  milton jennings you let go me  thats what you said before  take these lines  cant do it he laughed my hands are cold got to warm them see he pulled off his mitten and put his icy hand under her chin the horse was going at a tremendous pace again  ooooh if you dont take these lines ill drop em so there  dont y do it he called warningly but she did and boxed his ears soundly while he was getting marc in hand again betties rage was fleeting as the blown breath from marcs nostrils and when milton turned to her again all was as if his deportment had been grave and cavalier  the stinging air made itself felt and they drew close under their huge buffalo robes as marc strode steadily forward the dark groves fell behind the clashing bells marked the rods and miles and kept time to the songs they hummed    jingle bells jingle bells   jingle all the way   oh what joy it is to ride   in a onehorse open sleigh  they overtook another laughing singing load of young folksa great wood sleigh packed full with boys and girls two and twohooded girls and boys with caps drawn down over their ears a babel of tongues arose from the sweeping creaking bobsleigh and rose into the silent air like a mighty peal of laughter     ii   a schoolhouse set beneath the shelter of great oaks was the center of motion and sound on one side of it the teams stood shaking their bells under their insufficient blankets making a soft chorus of fitful trills heard in the pauses of the merry shrieks of the boys playing pompom pullaway across the road before the house which radiated light and laughter a group of young men stood on the porch as milton drove up  hello milt said a familiar voice as he reined marc close to the step  that you shep  chuss its me replied shep  howd you know me so far off  puh dont y spose i know that horse an those bellsmiss moss allow me he helped her out with elaborate courtesy the supper and the old folks are here and the girls and boys and the fun is over to dudleys he explained as he helped bettie out  ill be back soons i put my horse up said milton to bettie you go in and get good n warm and then well go over to the house  i saved a place in the barn for you milt i knew youd never let marc stand out in the snow said shephard as he sprang in beside milton  i knew you would whats the news is ed here tnight  yehup on deck with sfye kinney itll make him swear when he finds out who bettie come with  let him are the yohe boys here  yep theyre alwiss on hand like a sore thumb bills been drinking and is likely to give ed trouble he neverll give bettie up without a fight look out he dont jump onto your neck  no danger o that said milton coolly  the yohe boys were strangers in the neighborhood they had come in with the wave of harvest help from the south and had stayed on into the winter making few friends and a large number of enemies among the young men of the crick everybody admitted that they had metal in them for they instantly paid court to the prettiest girls in the neighborhood without regard to any prior claims  and the girls were attracted by these missourians their air of mysterious wickedness and their muscular swagger precisely as a flock of barnyard fowl are interested in the strange bird thrust among them  but the southerners had muscles like wildcats and their feats of broil and battle commanded a certain respectful consideration in fact most of the young men of the district were afraid of the redfaced boldeyed strangers one of the few exceptions being milton and another shephard watson his friend and roommate at the rock river seminary neither of these boys being at all athletic it was rather curious that bill and joe yohe should treat them with so much consideration  bill was standing before the huge cannon stove talking with bettie when milton and shephard returned to the schoolhouse the mans hard black eyes were filled with a baleful fire and his wolfish teeth shone through his long red mustache it made milton mutter under his breath to see how innocently bettie laughed with him she never dreamed and could not have comprehended the vileness of the mans whole life and thought no lizard reveled in the mud more hideously than he his conversation reeked with obscenity his tongue dropped poison each moment when among his own sex and his eye blazed it forth when in the presence of women  hello bill said milton with easy indifference how goes it  oh bout soso you rather got ahead o me tnight didnt yeh  well rather the man that gets ahead o me has got t drive a good team eh he looked at bettie  id like to try it said bill  well lets go across the road said milton to bettie anxious to get her out of the way of bill  they had to run the gauntlet of the whooping boys outside but bettie proved too fleet of foot for them all  when they entered the dudley house opposite her cheeks were hot with color but the roguish gleam in her eyes changed to a curiously haughty and disdainful look as she passed blackler who stood desolately beside the door looking awkward and sullen  milton was a great favorite and he had no time to say anything more to bettie as peacemaker he reached ed as soon as possible  ed whats up between you and bettie  oh i dont know i cant find out blackler replied and he spurred himself desperately into the fun     iii   itll make ed blackler squirm t see betsey come in on milt jennings arm said bill to shephard after milton went out  wal chuss i denk it will shephard was looking round the room where the old people were noisily eating supper and the steaming oysters and the cold chickens savory smell went to his heart one of the motherly managers of the feast bustled up to him  shephard you cn run over t the house an tell the young folks that they can come over t supper about eight oclock thatll be in a half an hour you understand  oh im so hungry cant y give me a hunk o chicken t stay m stomach  mrs councill laughed ill fish you out a drumstick she said and he went away gnawing upon it hungrily bill went with him still belching forth against blackler  jim said he heard he said hed slap my face fr a cent i wish he would id lick the life out of im in a minnit  why dont you pitch into milt hes got her now hes the one yd orto be dammin  oh he dont mean nothin by it he dont care for her i saw him down to town at the show with the girl hes after hes jest makin ed mad  a game of copenhagen was going on as they entered bettie was in the midst of it but milton in the corner was looking on and talking with a group of those who had outgrown such games  the ring of noisy flushed and laughterintoxicated young people filled the room nearly to the wall and round and round the ring flew bettie pursued by joe yohe  go it joe yelled bill  youre good frim yelled shephard  milton laughed and clapped his hands hot foot bettie  like another atalanta the superb young girl sped now dodging through the ring now doubling as her pursuer tried to catch her by turning back at last she made the third circuit and breathless and laughing took her place in the line but joe rushed upon her determined to steal a kiss anyhow  hyare hyare none o that  thats no fair cried the rest and he was caught by a dozen hands  she didnt go round three times he said  yes she did cried a dozen voices  you shut up he retorted brutally looking at ed blackler who had not spoken at all ed glared back but said nothing bettie ignored ed and the game went on  theres going to be trouble here tonight said milton to shephard  shephard as the ring dissolved stepped into the middle of the room and flourished his chickenleg as if it were a baton after the burst of laughter his sonorous voice made itself heard  come to supper everybody take his girl if he can and if he cantget the other fellers girl  bill yohe sprang toward bettie but milton had touched her on the arm  not tnight bill he grinned  bill grinned in reply and made off toward another wellknown belle ella pratt who accepted his escort ed blackler with gloomy desperation took maud buttles the most depressingly plain girl in the room an action that did not escape betties eyes and which softened her heart toward him but she did not let him see it  supper was served on the desks each couple seated in the drabcolored wooden seats as if they were at school a very comfortable arrangement for those who occupied the back seats but torture to the adults who were obliged to cramp their legs inside the desk where the primer class sat on schooldays  bettie saw with tenderness how devotedly poor ed served maud he could not have taken a better method of heaping coals of fire on her head  ed was entirely unconscious of her softening however for he could not look around from where he sat he heard her laughing and believed she was happy he had not taken poor maud for the purpose of showing his penitence for he had no such feeling in his heart he was on the contrary rather gloomy and reckless he was not in a mood to show a front of indifference  the oysters steamed the heels of the boys boots thumped in wild delight the women bustled about the girls giggled and the men roared with laughter everybody ate as if he and she had never tasted oystersoup and chicken before and the cakes and pies went the way of the oystersoup like corn before a troup of winter turkeys  bill yohe by way of a joke put some frosting down the back of cy hurd and by way of delicate attention to ella alternately shoved her out of the seat and pulled her back again while joe hurled a chickenleg at cad hines as she stood in the entryway will kinney told sary hines for the fourth time how his team had run away interrupted by his fear that some kind of pie would get away untasted  an so i laid the lines downhyare gimme another handful of crackers merryan i laid the lines down while i went t finenary a noyster i can hold any more mrs moss im ready fr pie nowan so i noticed ole franks eye kind o roll but thinksi i cn git holt o the lines if heyesm i alwiss eat mince wont you try some saryananso jest as i gut my axyou bet im goin t try a piece of every kind if it busts my stummick gutta git my moneys worth  milton was in his best mood and was very attractive in his mirth his fine teeth shone and his yellow curls shook under the stress of his laughter he wrestled with bettie for the choice bits of cake delighting in the touch of her firm sweet flesh and as for bettie she was almost charmed to oblivion of ed by the superior attractions of miltons townbred gallantry ed looked singularly awkward and lonesome as he sat sprawled out in one of the low seats and curiously enough his uncouthness and disconsolateness of attitude won her heart back again  everybody with the usual rustic freedom had remarks to make upon the situation  wal bettie made a swop hev yeh said councill  hello milt thought you had a girl down town  oh i keep one at each end of the line milton replied with his ready laugh  wal i swan t gudgeon i cant keep track o you town fellers youre too many fr me said mrs councill  carrie hines came up behind milton and bettie and put her arms around their necks bringing their cheeks together bettie grew purple with anger and embarrassment but milton with his usual readiness said thank you and reached for the tittering malefactors waist nobody noticed it for the room was full of such romping  the men were standing around the stove discussing political outlooks and the matrons were busy with the serving of the supper out of doors the indefatigable boys were beginning again on pompom pullaway  supper over the young folks all returned to the house across the way leaving the men of elderly blood to talk on the grange and the uselessness of the middlemen sport began again in the dudley farmhouse by a dozen or so of the young people forming on for weevily wheat  weevily wheat was a donation dance as it would have been wicked to have a fiddle to play the music singers were substituted with stirring effect and a song was sung while the couples bowed and balanced and swung in rhythm to it    come hither my love and trip together      in the morning early   ill give to you the parting hand      although i love you dearly   but i wont have none of yr weevily wheat      an i wont have none of yr barley   but have some flour in a half an hour      to bake a cake for charley    oh charley he is a fine young man      charley he is a dandy   oh charley hes a fine young man      fr he buys the girls some candy   oh i wont have none o yr weevily wheat      i wont have none o yr barley   but have some flour in a half an hour      to bake a cake for charley    oh charley hes etc  milton was soon in the thick of this most charming oldfashioned dance which probably dates back to dances on the green in england or norway bettie was a good dancer and as she grew excited with the rhythm and swing of the quaint plaintive music her form grew supple at the waist and her large limbs light the pair moved up and back between the two ranks of singers then down the outside and laughed in glee when they accelerated the pace at the time when they were swinging down the center all faces were aglow and eyes shining  bills red face and bullet eyes were not beautiful but the grace and power of his body were unmistakable he was excited by the music the alcohol he had been drinking and by the presence of the girls and threw himself into the play with dangerous abandon  under his illfitting coat his muscles rolled swift and silent his tall boots were brilliantly blue and starred with gold at the top and his pantaloons were tucked inside the tops to let their glory strike the eye his physical strength and grace and variety of steps called forth many smiles and admiring exclamations from the girls and caused the young men to lose interest in weevily wheat  when a new set was called for bill made a determined assault on bettie and secured her for she did not have the firmness to refuse but the singers grew weary and the set soon broke up a game of forfeit was substituted this also dwindled down to a mere excuse for lovers to kiss each other and the whole company soon separated into little groups to chatter and romp some few sat at the table in the parlor and played authors  bettie was becoming annoyed by the attentions of bill and to get rid of him went with miss lytle milton and two or three others into another room and shut the door this was not very unusual but poor blackler seemed to feel it a direct affront to him and was embittered he was sitting by ella pratt when bill yohe swaggered up to him  say do you know where your girl is  no an i dont care  wal its time ycared shes in the other room there milt jennings has cut you out  youre a liar cried the loyal lover leaping to his feet  spat yohes open palm resounded upon the pale face of blackler whose eyes had a wild glare in them and the next moment they were rolling on the floor like a couple of dogs the stronger and older man above the valiant lover below the house resounded with sudden screams and then came the hurry of feet then a hush in the midst of which was heard the unsubdued voice of blackler as he rose to his feet youre a  another dull stroke with the knotted fist and the young fellow went to the floor again while joe yohe like a wild beast roused at the sight of blood stood above the form of his brother who had leaped upon the fallen man shouting with the hoarse raucous note of a tiger  give im hell ill back yeh  bettie pushed through the ring of men and women who were looking on in delicious horrorpushed through quickly and yet with dignity her head was thrown back and the strange look on her face was thrilling facing the angry men with a gesture of superb scorn and fearlessness she spoke and in the deep hush her quiet words were strangely impressive  bill yohe what do you think youre doing  for a moment the men were abashed and starting back they allowed blackler dazed bleeding and half strangled to rise to his feet he would have sprung against them both for he had not heard or realized who was speaking but bettie laid her hand on his arm and the haughty droop of her eyelids changed as she said in a tender voice  never mind ed they aint worth mindin  her usual self came back quickly as she led him away friends began to mutter now and the swagger of the brothers threatened further trouble their eyes rolled their knotted hands swung about like bludgeons threats horrible snarls and oaths poured from their lips but there were heard at this critical moment rapid footstepsa round jovial voiceand bursting through the door came the great form and golden head of lime gilman  hold on here whats all this he said leaping with an ominously goodnatured smile into the open space before the two men whose restless pacing stopped at the sound of his voice his sunny laughing blue eyes swept around him taking in the situation at a glance he continued to smile but his teeth came together  git out o this you hounds git he said in the same jovial tone you you he said to bill slapping him lightly on the breast with the back of his lax fingers bill struck at him ferociously but the slopeshouldered giant sent it by with his left wrist kicking the feet of the striker from under him with a frightful swing of his right foota trick which appalled joe  clear the track there ordered lime its against the law t fight at a donation so out y go  bill crawled painfully to his feet  ill pay you for this yet  any time but now git out r ill kick you out limes voice changed now the silent crowd made way for them and seizing joe by the shoulder and pushing bill before him the giant passed out into the open air there he pushed bill off the porch into the snow and kicked his brother over him with this parting word  you infernal hyenies kickins too good fr you if you ever want me look around an youll find me  then to the spectators who thronged after he apologized  i hate t fight and especially to kick a man but theys times when a mans got t do it now jest go back and have a good time dont let them hyenies spoil all yr fun  that ended it all knew lime everybody had heard how he could lift one end of the separator and toss a twobushel sack filled with wheat over the hind wheel of a wagon and the terror of his kick was not unknown to them they all felt sure that the yohes would not return and all went back into the house and attempted to go on with the games but it was impossible such exciting events must be discussed and the story was told and retold by each one  when milton returned to the parlor he saw bettie tender dignified and grave bending over blackler bathing his bruised face milton had never admired her more than at that moment she looked so womanly she no longer cared what people thought  the other girls pale and tearful and a little hysterical stood about close to their sweethearts they enjoyed the excitement however and the fight appealed to something organic in them  the donation party was at an end that was clear and the people began to get ready to go home bettie started to thank lyman for his help  dont say anything id a done it jest the same fr anybody it aint the thing to come to a donation and git up a row  milton hardly knew whether to ask bettie to go back with him or not but blackler relieved him from embarrassment by rousing up and saying  oh im all right now bettie hyeres yer girl milt see the eye ive got on me she says she wont ride home with any such  ed what in the world do you mean bettie could hardly understand her lovers sudden exultation it was still a very serious matter to her in spite of the complete reconciliation which had come with the assault she felt in a degree guilty and that feeling kept her still tearful and subdued but ed leered and winked with his good eye in uncontrollable delight milton turned to bettie at last and said  well ill get marc around to the door in a few minutes get your things on  bettie and ed stood close together by the door she was saying  youll forgive me wont you ed  why course i will bettie i was as much to blame as you was i no business to git mad till i knew what i was gittin mad at  they were very tender now  illill go home with you if you want me to stead of with milt she quavered  no ive got to take sfye home its the square thing  all right ed but come an let me talk it all straight  its all straight now lets let it all go whaddy ysay  all right ed  there was a kiss that the rest pretended not to hear and bidding them all goodnight bettie ran out to the fence where milton sat waiting  the moon was riding high in the clear cold sky but falling toward the west as they swung into the woodroad through the branches of the oaks the stars set in the deepblue fathomless night peered cold and bright there was no wind save the rush of air caused by the motion of the sleigh neither of the young people spoke for some time they lay back in the sleigh under the thick robes listening to the chime of the bells the squeal of the runners and the weirdlysweet distant singing of another sleighload of young people far ahead  milton pulled marc down to a slow trot and tightening his arm around betties shoulders in a very brotherly hug said  well im glad you and ed have fixed things up again youd always have been sorry  it was all my fault anyway replied the girl with a little tremor in her voice and it was all my fault tonight too i no business to a gone off an left him that way  well its all over now anyway and so i wouldnt worry any more about it said milton soothingly and then they fell into silence again  the sagacious marc antony strode steadily away and the two young lovers went on with their dreaming bettie was silent mainly and milton was trying to fancy that she was eileen and was remembering the long rides they had had together and the horses hoofs beat a steady rhythm the moon fell to the west and the bells kept cheery chime the breath of the horse rose into the air like steam the housedogs sent forth warning howls as they went by once or twice they passed houses where the windows were still lighted and where lanterns were flashing around the barn where the horses were being put in for the night  the lights were out at the home of bettie when they drove up for the young people however rapidly they might go to the sociable always returned much slower than the old folks milton leaped out and held up his arms to help his companion out as she shook the robes down stood up and reached out for his arms he seized her round the waist and holding her clear of the ground kissed her in spite of her struggles  milton  the las time bettie the las time he said in extenuation with this mournful word on his lips he leaped into the sleigh and was off like the wind but the listening girl heard his merry voice ringing out on the still air suddenly something sweet and majestic swept upon the girl something that made her look up into the glittering sky with vast yearning in the awful hush of the sky and the plain she heard the beat of her own blood in her ears she longed for song to express the swelling of her throat and the wistful ache of her heart       an afterword of winds snows and the stars     o witchery of the winter night     with broad moon shouldering to the west    in city streets the west wind sweeps   before my feet in rustling flight   the midnight snows in untracked heaps   lie cold and desolate and white   i stand and wait with upturned eyes   awed with the splendor of the skies   and startrained progress of the moon    the city walls dissolve like smoke   beneath the magic of the moon   and age falls from me like a cloak   i hear sweet girlish voices ring   clear as some softly stricken string   the moon is sailing to the west   the sleighbells clash in homeward flight   with frost each horses breast is white   the big moon sinking to the west                                              good night lettie        good night ben   the moon is sinking at the west   good night my sweetheart once again   the parting kiss while comrades wait   impatient at the roadside gate   and the red moon sinks beyond the west
