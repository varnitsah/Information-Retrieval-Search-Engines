i  editors introduction   as i sat one evening idly musing on memories of roers and boers and contemplating the horns of a weendigo i had shot in labrador and the head of a moo cow1 from canada i was roused by a ring at the door bell        1       a literary friend to whom i have shown your ms says a       weendigo is ojibbeway for a cannibal and why do you shoot       poor moo cowspublisher        mere slip of the pen meant a cow moose literary gent no       sportsmaned        all rightpublisher  the hallporter presently entered bearing a huge parcel which had just arrived by post i opened it with all the excitement that an unexpected parcel can cause and murmured like thackerays sailorman claret perhaps mumm i hope  it was a mummy case by jingo  this was no common or museum mummy case the lid with the gilded mask was absent and the under half or lower segment painted all over with hieroglyphics of an unusual type and green in colourhad obviously been used as a cradle for unconscious infancy a baby had slept in the last sleepingplace of the dead what an opportunity for the moralist but i am not a collector of cradles  who had sent it and why  the question was settled by an envelope in a feminine hand which with a cylindrical packet fell out of the mummy case and contained a letter running as follows      lady bettys oxford      my dear siryou have not forgotten me and my friend leonora     odolite      the mummy case which encloses this document is the cradle of     her ancient race      we are for reasons you will discover in the accompanying     manuscript about to start for treasure island where if anywhere     in this earth ready money is to be found on easy terms of personal     insecurity  oh confound it i cried heres another fiend of a woman sending me another manuscript they are always at it wants to get it into a highclass magazine as usual and my guess was correct  the letter went on      you who are so well known will have no difficulty in getting     the editor of the nineteenth century or the quarterly review or     bow bells to accept my little contribution i shall be glad to hear     what remuneration i am to expect and cheques may be forwarded     to      yours very truly      mary martin      psthe mummy case is very valuable please deposit it at the     old bank in the high where it will represent my balance      m m  now i get letters like this not usually escorted by a mummy case about thrice a day and a pretty sum it costs me in stamps to send back the rubbish to the amateur authors but how could i send back a manuscript to a lady already on her way to treasure island  here perhaps i should explain how mary martin as she signed herself came to choose me for her literary agent to be sure total strangers are always sending me their manuscripts but mrs martin had actually been introduced to me years before  i was staying as it happened at one of our university towns which i shall call oxford for shortnot that that was really its name walking one day with a niece a scholar of lady bettys hall we chanced to meet in the high two rather remarkable persons one of them was the very prettiest girl i ever saw in my life her noble frame marked her as the victor over girton at lawntennis while her pincenez indicated the student she reminded me in the grace of her movements of the artemis of the louvre and the psyche of naples while her thoughtful expression recalled the celebrated reading girl of donatello only a reading girl indeed could have been as she was reader in english literature on the churton collins foundation  who is she i said to my friend the scholar of lady bettys what a lovely creature she is  who that she replied with some tartness well what you can see in her i dont know thats leonora odolite and the lady with her is the lady superior of lady bettys  they call them pretty and the proctor my friend went on as mrs martinpolly they call her toohas been proctor twice2        2       i say you know keep clear of improbabilities no one was       ever old enough to have been proctor twicepublisher        thats all you know about it why i shall bring in a       character old enough to have been proctor a thousand       timesed  now nobody could have called polly bewitching her age must really have been quite thirtyfive i dislike dwelling on this topic but she was short dumpy wore blue spectacles a green umbrella a red and black shawl worsted mittens and uncompromising boots she had also the ringlets and other attractions with which french art adorns its ideal englishwoman  at my request i was introduced but presently some thirty professors six or seven senior dons and a sprinkling of heads of houses in red and black sleeves came bounding out of university sermon and gathered round the lovely leonora the master of st catherines was accompanied by a hitherto unattached student who manifestly at once fell a victim to leonoras charms  this youth was of peculiar aspect he was a member of the nearly extinct boshman tribe of kokoatinaland his long silky hair originally black had been blanched to a permanent and snowy white by failures in the attempt to matriculate at balliol he was shortnot above four feet nineand was tattooed all over his dark but intelligent features  when he was introduced i had my first opportunity of admiring leonoras extraordinary knowledge of native customs and etiquette  let me present to you said the master of st catherines the boshman chief ustâni  you stonish me answered leonora with a smile that captivated the boshman it is a rule among the tribes of kokoatinaland and in africa generally to greet a new acquaintance with a verbal play on his name3 owing to our insular ignorance and the difficulty of the task this courtesy had been omitted at oxford in ustânis case even by the professors of comparative philology and the learned keeper of the museum from that hour to another which struck later when he struck too ustâni was leonoras slave        3       is this bonâ fidepublisher        all right see she p 145 ayeshas elegant pun on holly       its always donepun i meaned  i had no further opportunity of conversing with leonora and polly nor indeed did i ever think of them again till pollys letter and mummy case recalled them to my memory  perhaps for pretty leonoras sake i did after all take up and open the vast cylindrical roll of ms4 in the mummy case dawn found me still reading the following record of unparalleled adventure5        4       dont you think it would stand being cut a littlepublisher        we shall seeed        5       there is just one thing that puzzles me polly and leonora       have gone no man knows where and taking everything into       consideration it may be a good two thousand years before they       come back        ought i not then to invest in my own name the       princely cheque of the intelligent publishersed     chapter ii  pollys narrative   i am the plainest woman in england bar none6 even in youth i was not strictly speaking voluptuously lovely short stumpy with a fringe like the thatch of a newly evicted cottage such was my appearance at twenty and such it remains like cain i was branded7 but enough of personalities i had in youth but one friend a lady of kingly descent the kings to be sure were irish and of bewitching loveliness when she rushed into my lonely rooms one wild winter night with a cradle in her arms and a baby in the cradle when she besought me to teach that infant hittite hebrew and the differential calculus and to bring it up in college on commons where the air is salubrious what could i do but acquiesce it is unusual i know for a student of my sex however learned to educate an infant in college and bring her up on commons but for once the uncompromising nature of my charms strangled the breath of scandal in the bud and little leonora odolite became the darling of the university the old keeper of the bodleian was a crusty bachelor who liked nothing young but calf and preferred morocco to that but even he loved leonora one night the little girl was lost and only after looking for her in the hebdomadal boardroom in the sheldonian the pusaeum and all the barges did we find that unprincipled old man amusing her by letting off crackers and romancandles among the mexican mss in the bodleian        6       i may as well say at once that i will not be responsible for       pollys style sometimes it is flat they tell me and       sometimes it is flamboyant whatever they may mean it is       never the least like what one would expect an elderly lady don       or donna to writeed        7       see the mark of cain arrowsmith an excellent       shillingsworthed        is this not log rollingpublisher  these were halcyon hours happier as leonora grew up and received the education prescribed for her by her parent her hebrew was fair and her hittite up to a first class but to my distress she mainly devoted herself to celtic studies  i should tell you that leonoras chief interest in life was the decipherment of the inscriptions on her cradlethe mummy case which had rocked her ancestors since abrahams time and which is now in your possession of itself it is a sufficient proof of the accuracy of this narrative the mummy case is not the ordinary coffin of egyptian commerce the hieroglyphics have baffled dr isaac taylor and have been variously construed as chinese etruscan and basque by the various professors of these learned lingoes8        8       dont you think this bit is a little dull the public dont       care about dead languagespublisher        story cant possibly get on without it as youll see you       must have something of this sort in a romance look at poes       cypher in the gold beetle and the chart in treasure       island and the portuguees scroll in king solomons       minesed  now about this mummy case you must know that it had been in leonoras family ever since her ancestress theodolitê pharaohs daughter left egypt not knowing when she was well off and settled in ireland of all places where she founded the national prosperity9        9       is not this a little steeppublisher        no it is in all the irish histories see lady wildes       ancient legends of ireland if you dont believe meed  the mummy case and a queer ring see cover inscribed with a duck a ducks egg and an umbrella were about all that the odolites kept of their ancient property the older leonora grew the more deeply she studied the inscriptions on the mummy case she tried it as zend she tried it as sanskrit and japanese and the american language and finally she tried it as irish  we had a very rainy season that winter even for oxford and the more it rained the more leonora pored over that mummy case i kept telling her there was nothing in it but she would not listen to me     chapter iii  leonoras discovery   one wild winter night when the sleet lashed the pane my door suddenly opened i started out of a slumber andcould i believe my eyes can history repeat itselfthere stood the friend of my early youth her eyes ablaze a cradle in her arms was it all coming round again a moments reflection showed me that it was not my early friend but her daughter leonora  leonora i screamed dont tell me that you  i have deciphered the inscription said the girl proudly setting down the cradle the baby had not come round  oh is that all i replied lets have a squint at it in my case no mere figure of speech  what do you call that said leonora handing me the accompanying document  illustration  i call it pie said i using a technical term of typography i cant make head or tail of it i said peevishly  well pie or no pie i love it like pie and ive broken the crust answered the girl according to my interpretation which i cannot mistrust  why i asked  because she answered and the response seemed sufficient when mixed with her bright smile  it runs thus she resumed with severity in the only language you can partially understand  it runs thus she reiterated and i could not help saying under such breath as i had left been running a long time now  she frowned and read      i theodolitê daughter of a race that has never been run out     did to the magician jambres whose skill was even as the skill of     the gods those things which as you have not yet heard i shall now     proceed to relate to you      of him i say was i jealous for that he loved a maiden     inferioroh how inferiorto me in charms wit beauty     intellect stature girth and ancestry therefore being well     assured of this i made the man into a mummy ere ever his living     spirit had left him what arts i used to this last purpose it boots     not nor do i choose to tell when i had done this thing i put him     secretly away in a fitting box even as set concealed osiris then     came my maidens and tidied him away as is the wont of these     accursed ones from that hour even until now has no man nor woman     known where to find him even jambres the magician for though the     mummifying as thou shalt not fail to discover was in some sort     incomplete yet the tidying away and the losing were so complete     that no putting forth of precious papyri into cupboards beneath     flights of stairs has ever equalled it      now therefore shall i curse these maidens even in amenti the     place of their tormenting      forget them may they be eternally forgotten      curse them up and down through the whole solar system  this is very violent language my dear said i  our people swore terribly in egypt answered leonora calmly      but it is vain no woman can curse worth a daric10            10 from the use of the word daric i conjecture that           leonoras ancestress lived under the persian empire there           or thereaboutm m      but for this the losing of the one whom i mummied must i     suffer countless penalties for i even the seeress know not what     the said maidens did with the said mummy nor do you know nor any     other and not to know for i want my mummy to have a good cry     over is great part of my punishment but this i the seeress do     know right well for it was revealed to me in a dream and this i     do prophesy unto thee my daughter or daughters daughter ay     this do i say that a curse will rest upon me until he who was     mummied shall be found      now this also do i the seeress tell thee he who was mummified     shall be found in the dark country where there is no sun and men     breathe the vapour of smoke and light lamps at noonday and wire     themselves even with wires when the wind bloweth and the place     where the mummy dwelleth is beneath the three balls of gold and     one will lead thee thither who abides hard by the great tree carven     like the head of an ethiopian and thou shalt come to the people     who slate strangers and to the place of the rolling of logs and     the music thereof      thereafter shalt thou find him even jambres and when thou hast     healed him the curse shall fall from me      nor indeed shall the unmummying be accomplished even then     unless thou o my daughter or my daughters daughter as before     shalt go with hewhowasmummied to the hall of egyptian darkness     and sit in the wizards chair that is thereby even the seat which     was erst the siege perilous these things have i said well knowing     that they shall be accomplished      to thee my daughter      thy grandmother  there polly what do you say to that said nora  your grandmother i replied  polly said miss nora looking at me with quite needlessly flashing eyes you and i will set out on the search for this unhappy mummied one  dont you think the critics will call the motive rather thin i demurred  thin to rescue my ancestress from a curse said leonora  theres just one other thing she mused shall we take a low comedy character this time or not  lets take ustâni i proposed he can double the part with that of the faithful black a great saving in hotel bills and railway fares     chapter iv  the equipment   after it had been decided that we should start in search of he who had been mummified alive the next step seemed to be to go but leonora demurred to this  we must have our things she said what do you think we should take  scissors i replied and i regret to say that at first she misinterpreted the phrase  leonora is a powerful as well as a pretty girl and when the bear fight that ensued was over my rooms were a little mixed  this suggested mixed biscuits that invaluable refreshment of the traveller and from one thing to another we soon made up a complete list of our needs  the scissors and skates and the soap we procured at the church and state stores11 but not of course the revolvers the revolvers we got of the genuine government pattern because both leonora and i are dreadfully afraid of firearms and we knew that these anyhow would not go off the jam we got of course at the official cartridge emporium same which we did not shoot the arabs the gladstone bag and the bryant  mays matches we procured direct from the makers resisting the piteous appeals of itinerant vendors some lifebelts we laid in and as will presently be seen we could have made no more judicious purchase        11       wont the critics say you are advertising the stores and the       tradesmen wont like itpublisher        where would the stern reality of the story be see spectator       and the contrast with the later goings on if you didnt give       namesed  as from information received on a mummy case we were travelling in search of a mummy of course we laid in a case of mumm which was often a source of gaiety in our darkest hours the wine was procured as i would advise every african traveller to do from messrs 12        12       messrs who printers in a hurrypublisher        suppressed the name messrs  gave an impolite response to       our suggestions as to mutual arrangementsed  being acquainted with the deleterious effects of a malarious tropical atmosphere we secured a pair of overalls advertised as sovran for alloverishness the dreaded curse of an african climate these we got at the celebrated emporium of messrs 13        13       name suppressed when eligible opportunity for advertisement       as a substitute for a cheque was hinted at messrs        brusquely replied in the low essex patois wadyermean  our preparations being now exhaustively completed leonora and i returned to oxford packed our things and consulted as to the route which we should adopt     chapter v  down the dark river   down the dark river the mystic isis so leonora had decided we sped ustâni plying the long pole of the dhow or native flatbottomed boat while we took it in turns to keep him up to his work by flicking him with a tandemwhip  the moon went slowly down and it occurred to leonora to remark that we were going down too an unusual thing so early in term like some sweet bride into her chamber the moon departed and the quivering footsteps of the don14 shook the planets from their places to the consternation of the savilian professor of astronomy who as in duty bound was contemplating these revolutionary performances from the observatory in the parks a number of moral ideas occurred to leonora and myself but out of regard for ustânis feelings we denied them expression i began indeed to utter a few appropriate sentiments but the poor boshman exclaimed you floggee floggee missy or preachee preachee but no both floggee and preachee in a tone that would have disarmed a bampton lecturer        14       do you mean the dawnpublisher        every oxford man knows what i meaned  down we drifted ever downwards obedient to the inscrutable laws of the equilibrium of fluids now we swept past the white willow now through the cruel crawling waters of the gut now threaded the calamitous gorge of iffley and then shot the perilous cataract of sandford  at this moment just when the dhow was yet quivering with the strain i noticed an expression of abject fear on the face of ustâni his dark countenance was positively blanched with horror and his teeth chattered  silence chatterbox i cried querulously perhaps when he laid down his pole and seated himself in an attitude of despair  whats the matter old boy asked leonora and the reply came in faltering accents  the ama barghîs15        15       ama is the prefix of all the tribal names ama zulu ama       hagger i connect it with the greek preposition greek       hamaed        dont keep hammer hammering away at greek this is a boys       book not a holiday task this ispublisher  we glanced in terror down the rivers edge  there on the path trodden by so many millions of feet that now are silent16 there were the burly forms of five or six splendid savages        16       please dont begin moralising again one never knows when it       will come upon youpublisher        couldnt help just throwing it ined  the character of their languagewhich was borne to us on the pure breeze of morningtheir costume their floating house in which these scourges of the water highway commonly resideeverything combined to demonstrate that they belonged to the barghîz the most powerful and most dreaded of the native populations  me umslopogey whispered ustâni in his native language meaning that he would retreat  eyes in the boat cried leonora in her clear commanding tones paddle on all  the boshman cowed by her aspect and the mere slave of discipline he had pulled in the st catherines second torpid obeyed her command and presently we were abreast of the barghîz  hi miss cried the barghî chief a man of colossal stature cant yer look where yer a shovin to  though his words were unintelligible his tone was insulting  leonora rose to her feet and to the occasion  by virtue of her rare acquaintance with savage customs she was able to taunt the barghîz with the horrors of their tribal mystery to divulge which is death  she openly insulted the secret orgies of the tribe  she denounced the dogfeast  who ate the puppy pie under marlowe bridge shrilled leonora in her proud sweet young voice  in a moment a shower of stones struck the dhow and spurred the water into storm frank muller the barghî chief distinguished himself by the fury of his imprecations and the accuracy of his aim a smothered groan told me that ustâni had been hit in the mouth  whid whad crash went the stones while leonora plied the pole with desperate energy and i erected the patent reversible umbrellas with which we were provided to catch any breath of favourable wind  the fierce rapidity of the stream finally carried us out of the reach of the infuriated barghîz who moreover were providentially slain by lightninga common enough occurrence in that favoured climate where nobody thinks anything of it and we rested weary and wounded in a sheltered backwater17        17       are you not gliding insensibly into besspublisher        no all right it is a tremendous country for storms cant       use them too often adds to the sense of realityed  the dhows looking rather dowdy said leonora glancing at the shattered craft  if doughty deeds my lady please said i catching her light tone why she must take the consequences but leonora i added shuddering im sure my feet are damp  if there is one thing i dread it is damp feet  no wonder said leonora calmly the dhow has sprung a leek  i searched the dhow everywhere but could find no trace of the vegetable  meanwhile the water had risen above the capstan and ustâni shivering audibly had perched himself on the bowsprit  now or never said leonora is the moment for our lifebelts  we hurriedly put on our lifebelts regretting the absence of an experienced maid  ill be mrs lecks and youll be mrs aleshine laughed leonora as the dhow shuddering in all her timbers collapsed  ego et lecks mea cried i not to seem deficient in opportune gaiety of allusion and we were in the water we advanced briskly down stream ustâni propelling himself with the pole of the dhow  ever anxious about ustânis university education interrupted by this expedition leonora kept coaching him in the usual way  bow youre feathering under water she exclaimed when the unfortunate ustâni disappeared in a lasher where we thanks to our lifebelts floated gaily enough  here we paused to catch a few of the perch and gudgeons which leonora had attracted by carefully wearing white stockings  nothing like white stockings for perch she said  as there were not perch enough to go round ustâni was told to content himself with the pole a synonym if not an equivalent  laying our trenchercaps on the water we used them as of old for trenchers and made an excellent meal     chapter vi  the zÛ   our course was now through a series of cross streams and finally we emerged into a long perfectly straight and perfectly tranquil expanse of water bordered by a path which had every appearance of having been made by the hand of man  night fell a strange murky night smelling of lucifer matches and lit on the eastern horizon by a mysterious light flaring like a dreary dawn  our passage was obstructed by a thousand obstacles and at one point we plunged into the very bowels of the earth for a distance of at least a quarter of a mile next we found the canal barred by a grinning row of black iron teeth under which we dived as best we might we were now ustâni whispered to us within the strange and dreaded region known to the superstitious natives as the zû for the first time in our expedition we heard the roaring of innumerable wild beasts the rattling trumpet of the elephant the drum of the gorilla the scream of the lion the chattering of countless apes the yells of myriads of cockatoos the growls of bears the sobs of walri18 the whistle of rhinocerotes combined to make a strange pandemoniumstrange i call it because the zoological learning i had picked up while with nora at oxford informed me at once that the variety of roars screams grunts skreeks whirrings which our footsteps seemed to awake in every kind of animal bird and insect could be paralleled only in the pages of the swiss family robinson add to this that it was night yet dark as a day on the london flags when the fog creeps silently about your feet and rising from utter blackness grows white and whiter in its ascent till it coils round your neck a white choker        18       is this plural correctpublisher        i cant find walrus in the latin dictionary nor anything else       beginning with w somehow but it seems all righted  yes the fog was playing a dark game but nora could see it and go one lighter there were several on the stream we had quitted she produced a patent electric light19 aided by this we looked about us and saw the strange denizens of the zû        19       patent in the first sense of the word she has not yet       received offers advantageous enough to close with in the other       sense  it was now that the presence of mind of leonora saved us foreseeing the probability of an encounter with wild beasts she had filled her practicable pocket she belonged to the rational dress association with buns and gingerbread nuts  the elephant now walked round the wolves also circulated the bear climbed his pole the great gorilla beat his breast and roared  leonora was their match  for the elephant she had a rusk a bun for the bear and the gorilla was pacified by an offering of nuts from his native brazil                      this way to the crocodile house  we now read on an inscription in black letters and following the path indicated we reached the dank tank where the monsters dwell we had arrived at a place which i find it difficult to describe the floor was smooth and hard  what do you make of this asked leonora tapping her dainty foot on the floor  flags i replied phlagmatically and she was silent  in the centre of the space was a dark pool circled by crystalline palaces inhabited by the sacred snakes from huge pythons to the terrapin proud of his tureen again there was a whipsnake and a toad bloated as the aristocracy of old time and puffed up as the plutocracy of today for such is the lot of toads  now a strange thing happened  hark said ustâni hark hark hark a den is opening  he was right it was the den of a catawampuss an animal whose habits are so well known that i need not delay to describe them  in the centre of the dark pool in the middle of the vague space lay one crocodile the rest were sleeping on the banks the catawampuss secretly emerged from its denhorror i am not ashamed to say prevented me from interferingstealthily crept across the cold floor and true to the instincts of all the feline tribe20 made straight for the water        20       is the catawampuss one of the felidæpublisher        of course he is look at his nameed  ah cried ustâni hes going for him  the expression was ambiguous but we understood it  the catawampuss cunning as the dread jerboa crept to the edge of the pool took a header into it and then still true to the feline instincts swimming on its back made its way to the crocodile in this manner it caught the crocodile by the tail and waked it when the tail of a crocodile awakes the head awakes also the crocodiles head then waking as the catawampuss seized its tail caught the tail of the catawampuss the interview was hurried and tumultuous  the crocodile had one of his ears chawed off first blood for the catawampuss but this was a mere temporary advantage when next we saw clearly through the tempest of flying fur and scales the head of the catawampuss had entirely disappeared and the animal was clearly much distressed  then all of a sudden the end came  they had swallowed each other  not a vestige of either was left  this duel was a wonderful and shocking sight and was therefore withdrawn by request as the patrons of the gardens are directly interested in the morality of the establishment     chapter vii  among the logrollas   how to escape from our perilous position on the banks of a pestilential stream haunted by catawampodes and other fell birds of prey now became a subject for consideration our object of course was to reach the people of the logrollas through whose region according to the prophecy we must pass before finding the magician that should guide us to the mummy our perplexity was only increased by the discovery that we were surrounded on every side by the walls and houses of a gigantic city stealing out by the canal as we had entered we found to our comfort that this must be the very city mentioned by theodolitê as the seeress had declared a deep and noisome night always prevailed only broken here and there as a wanderer scratched one of bryant  mays matches and painfully endeavoured to decipher the number on the door of his house the streets moreover were strewn and interwoven with long strings of iron fallen from the sky  the people who wire themselves with wires whispered leonora what do you think of my interpretation now  i shall inquire i answered and i did inquire for the land of the logrollas but in vain  happily we chanced to meet an old man clothed in a whitish robe of some unknown substance not unlike paper this fluttering vesture was marked with strange characters in black and red which leonora was able to interpret she read them thus they were but fragmentary  illustration                sp al                                               vorce  cse                                          war  urkey                                            pl  ll  zette         on the fragments the words tragedy awful revelations purity and other apparently inconsistent hieroglyphics might be deciphered  he had a large and ragged staff on his back he carried a vast budget and he was always asking everybody wont you put something in the budget  father said leonora in a respectful tone canst thou tell us the way to the land of the people called logrolla and the place of the rolling of logs  he stroked his beautiful white beard and smiled faintly  indeed child we not only know it but ourselves discovered it and wrote it upwe mean sent our representative he answered  it was a peculiarity of this man that he always spoke like royalty in the first person plural  and if a daughter may ask said leonora what is the name of my father  stedfastly regarding her he answered our name is pellmelli  and whither go we my father  that you shall seeas soon that is as the fog lifts or as our representative has made interest with a gas company  with these words he furnished an unequalled supply of litter which came he said from the office where there was plenty and we were borne rapidly in a westward direction  as we journeyed old pellmelli gave us a good deal of information about the logrollas whom he did not seem to like  they were he said a savage and treacherous tribe inhabiting for the most part the ruined abodes of some kingly race of old  the names of their chief dwellings he told us were still called in some ancient and longlost speech  the academy and the athenæum  leonora whose knowledge of languages was extensive and peculiar told pellmelli that these names were derived from the old greek  ah said he you have clearly drunk of the wisdom of the past and thy hands have held the water of the worlds knowledge know you latin also  yes o pellmelli replied leonora and pellmelli said he preferred modern tongues though it would often be useful to him if he did in his dealings with the logrollas  however if our greek is a little to seek our russian is ok he said proudly  he was very bitter against the logrollas  the logrollas favourite weapon he told us was the club and he even proposed to show us this instrument  our litter presently stopped outside a stately palace  the street was dark as always in this strange city but old pellmelli paused sniffed and bending his ear to the ground listened intently  i smell the incense he said and hear the melodious rolling of the logs but they shall know their master  thus speaking he led us into a vast hall where the logrollas were sitting or standing offering each other incense as pellmelli remarked from thin tubes of paper which smoked at one end  now listen said pellmelli and he cried aloud the name of a poet known to the logrollas  instantly we heard from i know not what recess a rolling fire of applause and admiration which swept past us with stately and solemn music like a hymn of praise  there said pellmelli i told you so this is the place of the rolling of logs and yourselves have heard it  leonora said she did not mind how often she heard it as she quite agreed with the sentiments  not so said pellmelli and he cried aloud another namethe name of a poetasterwhich was almost strange to us  then followed through that vasty hall a sharp and rattling crash as of the descent of innumerable slates  great heavens whispered leonora remember the writing the place where they slate strangers  as we were strangers and wholly unknown to the logrollas we thought they might slate us and beating a hasty retreat soon found ourselves with pellmelli in the dark outer air  they are a desperate lot said he they wont ever put anything in the budget  he was quivering with indignation and leonora to soothe him told him the story of our quest for the mummy and asked him if he could help us  we are your man said he we propose tomorrow to send our representative to interview a magician who has just arrived in this country he is a mysterious character his name is asher21 and it is said that he is the wandering jew or at all events has lived for many centuries he if any one can direct you in your search        21       pronounced asshaed  he then appointed a place where his representative should meet us next day and we separated pellmelli taking his staff and going off to lead an excursion against the amatory a brutal and licentious tribe     chapter viii  he   next day leonora was suffering from a slight feverish cold and i dont wonder at it considering what we suffered in the zû i therefore went alone to the rendezvous where i was to meet our representative  to my surprise nobody was there but old pellmelli himself  why you said you would send your representative i exclaimed  we are our usual representative he answered rather sulkily come on for we have to call on messrs apples the famous advertisers  why said i  can you ask he replied can aught be more interesting than an advertiser  i call it log rolling i answered but he was silent  he went at a great pace and presently in a somewhat sordid street pointed his finger silently to an object over a door  it was the carven head of an ethiopian  this new confirmation of the prophecy gave me quite a turn especially when i read the characters inscribed beneath                       try our fine negros head  here dwells the sorcerer even asher said pellmelli and began to crawl upstairs on his hands and knees  why do you do that i asked determined if i must follow pellmelli at all events not to follow his example  it is the manner of the tribe of interviewers my daughter ours is a blessed task yet must we feign humility or the savage people kick us and drive us forth with our garments rent  he now humbly tapped at a door and a strange voice cried  entrez  pellmelli whose russian is his strong point paused in doubt but i explained that the word was french for come in  he crawled in on his stomach while i followed him erect and we found ourselves before a strange kind of tent it had four posts and a broidered veil was drawn all round it  within the veil the sorcerer was concealed and he asked in a gruff tone  wadyerwant  pellmelli explained that he had come to receive a brief personal statement for the budget  the voice replied without hesitation the centuries and the Æons pass and i too make the pass je saute la coupe he added in a foreign tongue while thy race wore naught but a little blue paint i dwelt among the forgotten peoples the red sea knows me and the nile has turned scarlet at my words i am khoot hoomi i am also the chela of the mountain  now it is my turn to ask you a few easy questions  who sitteth on the throne of hokey pokey winky wum the monarch of the anthropophagi  have the jews yet come to their land or have the owners of the land gone to the jews  doth darius the mede yet rule or hath his kingdom passed to the bassarids  as pellmelli was utterly floored by these inquiries which indicated that the sorcerer had been for a considerable time out of the range of the daily papers i answered them as well as i could  when his very natural curiosity had been satisfied by a course of mangnalls questions i ventured to broach my own business  he said he did not deal in mummies himself though he had a stuffed crocodile very much at my service but would i call tomorrow and bring leonora he added that he had known of our coming by virtue of his secret art of divination and thyself he added shalt gaze without extra charge in the fountain of knowledge  thrusting a withered yellow hand out of the mystic tent he pointed to a table where stood a small circular dish or cup of white earthenware containing some brown milky liquid  gaze therein said the sorcerer  i gazedthere was a stranger in the tea  deeply impressed with the belief laugh at it if you will that i was in the presence of a being of more than mortal endowments i was withdrawing when my glance fell on his weird familiarstwo tailless cats this prodigy made me shudder and i said in tones of the deepest awe and sympathy poor puss  yes came the strange voice from within the tent they are born without tails i bred them so it hath taken many centuries and much trouble but at last i have triumphed once too i reared a breed of dogs with two tails but after a while they became a proverb for pride nature loathed them and they perished greek chaire vale22        22       i have consulted the authorities at the british museum who       tell me these are the greek and the latin words for dont you       think you had better go get outed  this though not understood of course by pellmelli was as good as an invitation to withdraw so i induced the old man to come away promising the magician i would return on the morrow  who was this awful man to whom centuries were as moments whose very correspondence as i had noticed came through the dead letter office and who spoke in the tongues of the dead past     chapter ix  the power of he   next day leonora the boshman and i returned to the home of the mage he stood before us a tall thin figure enwrapped in yellowish strange garments of a singular and perfumed characterspicy in factwhich produced upon me a feeling which i cannot attempt to describe and which i can only vaguely hint at by saying that the whole form conveyed to me the notion of something wrapped up23        23       the public will say so is your meaningpublisher        dont give it away but thats what i meaned  with a curious swaying motion which i have never seen anything likefor he seemed less to be walking than to be impelled from behind like a perambulator or dragged from in front like a canalboathe advanced to the table where lay some pieces of a white substance like papyrus all of the same size and oblong shape which showed on their surfaces some of them antiquelooking figures and faces curiously stained and others red and black dots arranged as it seemed to me in some sort of design although at first sight they looked jumbled enough near to these lay a book bound in brown but with heavy black and gold lettering amid which i thought i could make out the words modern magic and the name hoffmann the swathed figure poised itself a moment resting one thin hand on the table and then spoke  there is naught that is wonderful about this matter it said could you but understand it prestigiation itself is wonderful but that its phases and phrases should be changed is not wonderful not now i ween is the gibecière of the ancient wizard seen not now the presto pass of the less ancient conjurer heard nay all things change yet i change not that which is not yet cannot yet have taken placeat least not its proper place that which shall not be may yet come to a bad pass and the blind race of man watches helpless the trammels it could shake off did it but greatly dare my business ladies and gentlemen now is as i have just explained to you to attempt to puzzle your eyes by the quickness of my fingers yours on the other hand will be to detect the wayor modus operandi as old simon magus used to sayin which i perform my little wondersif you can will any gentleman lend me a helmeti mean a hat  as the only male person present was the boshman this appeared to me a futile question and even the stately magician seemed to be struck by some dim idea of the kind for i could discern a pair of mysterious eyes peering anxiously through his swathings and i heard him mutter to himself in several languages ought to have thought of that no hat present dont know any trick to produce one nothing about it in the book  but he recovered himself quickly and went on in clear cheerful tones ladies and gentlemen as no person present has a hat i will proceed to another of the tricks on my little programme will any lady oblige me by drawing a card will you madam he said bowing with infinite grace to leonora  her hand touched ashers as she drew a card and i saw a shiver pass over the veiled figure  will the lady on your left now oblige me he continued turning to me who was indeed standing on leonoras left hand though how he knew it is a thing i have never been able fully to understand  now please he continued look well at your cards but do not show them to me or to each other basta assez greek konx ompax now please still hiding the cards from me and from each other exchange them now he continued his form dilating with conscious power see how true is it that change is perennial even so far as magic and nature herself can be perennial for she who held the king of hearts now holds the queen of spades and she who held the queen of spades now holds the king of hearts thus much among the shifting shadows of life can i the wizard see as a sure and accomplished fact is it not so my children  we bowed in silence overawed by the wonder of his presence although leonora whispered to me he has got the cards wrong but we had better say nothing about it  and now he continued look upon this glass it was an ordinary wineglass and on this silver coin producing a stater of the eretrian republic see i place the coin in the glass and now can i tell you by its means what you will of the future there is no magic in it only a little knowledge of the secrets mutable yet immutable of nature and this is an old secret i did not find it it was known of yore in atlantis and in chichimec in ur and in lycosura even now the rude boshmen keep up the tradition among their medicinemen vill any lady ask the coin a qvestion he continued in a hoarse semitic whisper for all currencies and all languages were alike to him sure its the coin ll be afther tellun ye what ye like voulezvous demander mademoiselle wollen sie gnädige signora  then said leonora in trembling accents i demand to know if i shall find that which i seek  the figure drawing itself up to its full height passed its hand with a proud impatient and mystic gesture across the glass and then stood in the attitude of one who awaited a response should the coin my daughter jump three times he said the answer is yea should it jump but once nay  we waited anxiously the coin did not jump at all the wizard took up the glass shook it impatiently and put it down again still the coin showed no sign of animation then the wizard uttered some private ejaculations in hittite but still the coin did not move then he affected an air of jauntiness and said i remember a circumstance of a similar kind when i was playing odd man out greek tritos anthrôpos dear old sokrates used to call it with darius the night before marathon darius was the mede i was the medium then he seemed about to work another wonder when he was interrupted by the harsh cackling laughter of the boshman who advanced with careless defiance and observed in his own tongue which we all knew perfectly that he could see all the tricks the wizard could do and go several better i waited horrorstruck to see what would follow this insolence  asher made a movement so swift that i could scarcely follow it but it seemed to me that he lightly laid his hand upon the poor boshmans head i looked at ustâni and then staggered back in wonder for there upon his snowy hair right across the woolwhite tresses were five fingermarks black as coal  now go and stand in the corner said the magician in a cold inhuman voice the unhappy boshman tremblingly did his bidding putting his hands to his head in a dazed way as he went and incredible as it may seem thus transferringas if the curse carried double forcesome of the black mark to his own fingers  i will now continued the wizard who had regained his ordinary polished if somewhat swaying and overbalanced manneri will now with your kind permission show you a little trick which was a great favourite with the late tubal cain when we were boys together observe i take this paperknifeit is an ordinary paperknifelook at it for yourselves i will place it on my downturned hand it is an ordinary handlook at it for yourselves but dont touch it the consequences might be disastrous  i for my part having seen the consequences in the case of ustânis hair had no desire to do so  you see continued the sorcerer i place the paperknife there it falls why because of gravity what is gravity newton as you know well invented the art but what of that did he find that which did not exist no for the nonexistent is as though it had never been but now availing myself of the resources of science which is ever old and ever young i clasp my wristthe wrist of the hand on which the paperknife restswith the other hand andyou see  as the sorcerer spoke he deftly turned his hand palm downwards and the paperknife fell with a crash and a clatter on the floor it was terrible to see the dumb wrath of the swathed figure at this new defeat  even in this moment the boshman glided like a serpent among us picked up the paperknife and triumphantly performed the very miracle in which the wizard had failed a harsh cackle of laughter announced his success but the mage was even with him or rather he was odds and evens rapidly he drew his forefinger across the boshmans face perpendicularly and horizontally  illustration                                         on the skin of ustâni azure with terror appeared the above diagram in lines of white the mage then made the sign of a  thus  illustration                                         and challenged leonora to a contest of skill in oughts and crosses but the boshman catching a view of his own altered aspect in a mirror exclaimed you standy ustâni him no standy he him show hisself for tin adults one shilling kids tizzy me umslopoguey and he sloped nor did we ever again see this victim of an overwhelming power limited  we presently took our leave of the mage promising to call next day and bring a policeman     chapter x  a body in pawn      gin a body meet a bodyburns   though leonoras faith in the magician had been a good deal shaken by his failures in his black art she admitted that as a clairvoyant he might be more inspired we therefore went as he had directed us to the neighbourhood of clare market where he had prophesied that we should find a temple adorned with the three balls of gold which the lombards bore with them from their far aryan home in frangipani nor did this part of the prophecy fail to coincide with the document on the mummy case through the thick and choking darkness which has made the lights of london a proverb we beheld the glittering of three aureate orbs and now how to win our way without password or indeed passbook into this home of mystery  here in these immemorial recesses the natives had long been wont to bury as we learned their oldest objects of interest and value there when we pushed our way within the swinging portal lay around us in vast and solemn pyramids of portable property the silent and touching monuments of human existence the busy life of a nation lay sleeping here here for example stood that ancestral instrument for the reckoning of winged time which in the native language is styled a grandfathers clock hard by lay the pipe fashioned of the foam of perilous seas in fairy lands forlorn the pipe on which perchance some swain had discoursed sweet music near the shady heights of high holborn the cradle of infancy the gamp of decrepitude the tricycle of fleeting youth the paraffin lamp which had lighted bridal gaiety the flask which had held the foaming maltall were gathered here and the dust lay deep on all of them  i was about to make some appropriate moral remarks when i heard leonora whose command of tongues is simply marvellous address an attendant priestess in the local dialect  here miss said she ow much can yer let us ave on this ere ticker producing her watch  the priestess whose clearcut features and two lovely black eyes betrayed a mixture of semitic blood was examining the turnipas she called the watchwhen leonora saying mums the word rather violently called my attention with her elbow to a strange parcel lying apart from the rest  it was a long bundle as long as a man and was swathed in cerements of white egyptian tissue  tis you tis you i sneezed rapturously recognising the object of our search the very mummy which two thousand years ago theodolitê had prepared with her own fair but cruel hands  there beyond the shadow of doubt lay all that was mortal of the unlucky jambres on the tissue which wrapped the bundle i distinctly recognised the stencilled mark corresponding to leonoras scarab a duck the egg of a duck and an umbrella24        24       see cover most important to have this cover bound in sur       brochurepublisher  how much said i to the priestess of the temple could you afford to let me have that old bundle of rags for  that old bundle of rags said the woman take it dear lady take it and keep it if you can and the blessing of abraham be on your head  so anxious was she to part with the mummy that we could hardly get her to accept a merely nominal price to give plausibility to the purchase we said we wanted the rags for a papermill joyously did leonora and i call a passing chariot and with the mummy between us we drove to our abode i was surprised on the way by receiving a pettish push from leonoras foot  dont tread on my toes she said though i had not even stirred i told her as much and we were getting a little animated when my bonnet was twitched off and thrown out into the darkness  leonora i said severely these manners are unworthy of a lady  i declare my dear polly she replied that i never even moved and as she was obviously in earnest i had to accept her word  when we reached home after a series of petty but provoking accidents25 we first locked up the mummy very carefully in the spare bedroom tomorrow would be time enough we said to consult the wizard as to our next movement we ordered a repast of the native viands which included i remember a small but savoury fish the blôta and sought our couches in better spirits than usual        25       i say are you not gliding insensibly into the fallen       idolpublisher        not a bit you wait and youll seeed  next morning long before leonora was awake the young but intelligent slavî so the common people call housemaids crept into my chamber with a deathwhite face  Ômum she said it is a term of courtesy wot a night weve been having  why what is the matter jemimaran i asked for that was her melodious native name  theres something in the spare room mum acarrying on horful the bell ringing all night and the thing screaming and walking up and down as restless im agoing to give warning mum she added confidentially  why youve given it i said to reassure her forewarned is forearmed  fourlegged it do run sometimes like a beast mum wailing terrible

 hydepublisher        neither hyde nor hidol youre so nervous do wait till the       ended        wish it was comepublisher  well i asked though every hair upon my head stood erect with horror adding greatly to the peculiarity of my appearance well did you take it what it asked for  yes mum for very fear i dared not refuse and when i had handed it in by a chink in the open door first there was a sound like drinking then an awful cry potash again and then a heavy soft thud as if you had knocked over a bolster stuffed with lead mum  through the brown glimmer of dawn it was about ten am i hurried to leonoras chamber she was dressed and came out what do you advise i asked  send for mr urmson the eminent lawyer at once said she he is used to this kind of thing nothing like taking counsels opinion but first let me knock the door open she applied her magnificent white shoulder to the door which flew into splinters  there was not a trace of the mummy but there in a deprecatory attitude stood the philosopher asher27        27       please pronounce asshaed     chapter xi  the wizard unbosoms   sir said leonora may i request you to inform me why we find you rampaging an unbidden guest in the chamber which is sacred to hospitality  greek tên d apameibomenos prosephê koruthaiolos asher answered the magician dreamily do my senses deceive me orthat voice that winsome bearingam i once more with helen on the walls of ilion  no sir you are in 30 acacia gardens replied leonora severely why permit me to repeat myself do i find you here an unbidden guest  to say that i never guessed youd find me here answered the magician might seem a mere trifling with language and with your feelings  my feelings exclaimed the proud girl indignantly just as if but answer me  when a man has seen as much of life as i have answered the magician when the Æons are to him merely as drops in a bucket which he will never kickand when he suffers he added mournfully from attacks of multiplex personality he recognises the futility of personal explanations  at least i can compel you to tell us where is the mummy said leonora  i am or lately was that mummy said the wizard haughtily then drawing himself up to his full height he added i am the real jambres old gooseberry jamberries he added solemnly no other is genuine  you are playing sir on our credulity replied the girl no living man can be a mummyoutside of the house of lords or the royal academy  you speak he said tenderly with the haste of youth and inexperience when you have lived as long as i have you will know better hearken to my story  three or four thousand years agofor what is timei was the authorised magician at the court of ptolemy patriarchus i had a rivalthe noted witch theodolitê in an evil hour she won me by a show of false affection and taking advantage of my passion mummified me alive to this i owe my remarkable state of preservation at an advanced age très bien conservé he added fatuously  but she only half accomplished her purpose by some accident which has never been explained and in spite of the stress of competition she had purchased pure salts of potash for the execution of her fell purpose in place of adulterated salts of soda  to this i owe it that i am now a living man and in a moment  a certain stiffness of demeanour which we had noticed but ascribed to pride worked an unspeakable change in the mage as we looked at him he hardened into our cheap mummy  heres a jolly go said leonora her mind submerged in terror  i sprang to the bell soda water at once i cried and the slavî appeared with the fluid we applied it to the parched lips of the mummy and jambres was himself again  now will you tell me i asked when he had been given a cigarette and made comfortable why we found youi mean the mummyunder the three balls  twas a pledge he replied when my resources ran low and my rent was unpaid the landlady used to take advantage of my condition and raise a small sum on me  all seemed now explained but leonora was not yet satisfied  you have she began  yes a strawberry mark he replied wearily on the usual place  the quest is accomplished i said  nay replied jambres to give him his real name there is still the adventure of the siege perilous     chapter xii  the wizards scheme   we must as you are aware visit the siege perilous in the hall of egypt and risk ourselves in the chair of the viewless maiden of her that is not to be seen of man  we know it said leonora  it is continued the mage your wish to accomplish the end for which you set forth this seems to you an easy matter enough young hearts are full of such illusions and believe me i would willingly change my years which are lost in geological time for one hands breadth of your daring know then continued this strange creature that the time has now come when matters must be brought to an end between us it will be my business and i will add my pleasure he continued with a lofty air which sat drolly enough upon him in his yellow duds to conduct you to the siege perilous from you in return i must exact an unquestioning obedience and i will add a measureless confidence i beg you to bear in mind that the slightest resistance to my will must be followed by consequences of which you cannot estimate either the reach or the extension  there was such a parrotlike pomp about the creatures tautology and such an oldworld affectation of fine manners \in his constant obeisances that i could hold it no longer but fairly laughed out in his face  i dreaded it is true lest some such fate as ustânis might punish me for my temerity but for reasons which doubtless seemed sufficient to himself the wizard merely looked at me through his veil shook himself a little in his swathings and said in a matteroffact voice well well perhaps we have had enough of such talk as this lets get ahead with the business before us that business is to reach the siege perilous or magic chair thither will i guide ye and there ye shall see what ye shall see but first it is needful as all sages have declared that ye shall show your confidence in me i value not wealth gold is mere drossnay i have the mines of king solomon at my disposal but when the weary king ecclesiast confided to me in his palace of ivory and cedar in jerusalem long ago the secret of these diamond treasures he bade me reveal it to none who did not show their confidence in me  let them entrust you said solomon with their paltry wealth ere you place in their hands opulence beyond the dreams of avarice give me then merely as a sign of confidence gold much gold or he continued in a confidential and semitic tone its equivalent in any safe securities american railways preferred dont bring banknotes my dearrisky things risky things why when i was pals with claude duvalbut tis gone tis gone now my dears what have you got what have you got  i have answered leonora in her clear sweet voice and girlish trustfulness as is my invariable custom my dot namely 300000l worth of american railway shares chiefly chicago nw and l  n in my pocket  thats right my dear thats right said the erie wizard just hand those to me and then

seraphic frenzy had now come upon the mage in good earnest and all the thoughtreader burned in his dusky eyes  we presented indeed a strange spectacle for the mage in his silvery swathings held leonora by the hands and leonora held me as we raced through the gloom  in any other city our aspect and demeanour had excited attention and claimed the interference of the authorities  in berlin uhlans would have charged us in paris grapeshot would have ploughed through our ranks here they deemed we were but of the sacred race of thoughtreaders who by a custom of the strange people are permitted to run at random through the streets and even to enter private houses  we were not even followed in our headlong career by a crowd for the public had ceased to interest itself in frenzied research for hidden pins or concealed cigarettes  after a frantic chase jambres late the mage paused breathless in front of a building of portentous proportions  how it chanced i have never been able to understand but as i am a living and honourable woman this hall had the characteristics of ancient egyptian architecture and that miraculous as it may appear in perfect preservation  there are the hypostyle halls the two osirid pillarscolossal figures of strange gods in coloured reliefthere is the great blue scarab the cartouche the pschent the pschutt and all that we admire in the rameseum of the ancient empire  but all was silent all was deserted the vast adamantine portals were closed  jambres paused in dismay  since i last gave an exhibition of mine art in those halls said he twas in old forgotten days in boscos palmy time much is altered open sesame he cried but curious to say nothing opened  at that moment a dark figure crawled submissively to our feet it was old pellmelli  his instinct for copy had brought him on our track and he began  as our representative i am commissioned  jambres late asher turned from him and he fell still making notes prone on his face where we left him as the pace was too good to inquire  the mage now reconnoitred carefully the vast façade of the hall of egypt and finally fixed his gaze on a perpendicular leaden column adorned with strange symbols through which for it was a rainy night raging torrents of water were distinctly heard flowing downwards to who knows what abysmal and unfathomable depths  in this weird climate it was the familiar yet dreaded waterspout  jambres with the feline agility of a catapult of the mountain began to climb the perpendicular leaden channel to which he had called our attention and of course we had to follow him it was perfectly marvellous to see the ease and grace with which he skipped and hopped up the seemingly naked face of the wall there were places indeed where our position was perilous enough and it did not add to our cheerfulness to hear the horrid roaring and gurgling of the unseen and imprisoned waters that poured down the channel with a violence which seemed as if they might at any moment burst their bonds helped however by certain ledges which projected from the wall beneath square openings filled with some transparent substance on which ledges from time to time we rested we arrived at the steep crest and paused for repose beneath the leafy shade of the rooftree jambres lightly leading the way  now said jambres comes the most delicate part of our journey  so indeed it proved for the mage began rapidly to divest himself of his mysterious swathings wrapper by wrapper he undid cerement on cerement till both leonora and i wondered when he would stop  stop he did however and with a practised hand shot his linen into one long rope which he carefully attached to an erect and smoking pillar perhaps of basaltic formation perhaps an ancient altar of st simeon skylitês when all was taut jambres approached a slanting slope smooth and transparent perhaps of glacial origin on this he stamped and the fragments tinkled as they fell into unknown deeps then he seized the rope let himself down and from far below we heard his voice calling to us to follow him  leonora and i descended with agility to some monstrous basin in the abyssthe pit jambres called it here jambres met us and bade us light the railway readinglamps which as i forgot to mention we had brought with us then jumping off with the lead he advanced along the floor picking his way with great care as indeed it was most necessary to do for the floor was strewn with strange forms stumbling over the legs and backs of which it would have been easy to break ones own when we halted brought up by a barrier of which i did not at first discern the nature our lamps as is sometimes the way of some such patent lamps28 suddenly went out jambres whispered hoarsely wot are yer waitin for come on greek all age nunc est scandendum we saw before us a vast expanse of which it was impossible to gauge the extent so impenetrable so overpowering was the gloom of its blackness it is the abode said jambres mysteriously of my rival de kolta he himself owing to his use of his swathings was sufficiently décolleté        28       i think ive managed not to be libelloused        we shall seepublisher  on the hither side was a row of lumières à pied which seemed afloat on the darkness and in their centre a sudden chasm which looked as if it had been made by human agency the fitful moonbeams29 showed us a most curious and accurately shaped spur or rundown as it is called in the native dialect which connected the floor on which we stood with the darkness beyond        29       youve not mentioned them beforepublisher        thats why i do nowed  what mortal however hardy dared cross this quivering wavering bridge in the total darkness beneath our feet it swayed and leaped like rotten ice on the magic serpentine  hush cried jambres it comes it comes be still  even as he spoke we saw a long shaft of yellow light streaming from an unknown centre and searching out the recesses of the cavern  be still as you value your liberty whispered jambres the bobî is on his beat  then as the long shaft smote the swaying bridge he lightly crossed it and beckoned us to follow we obeyed and in another instant all was again darkness  he has gone his round said jambres wont be back for hours     chapter xiv  the magic chair   there on the plateau or platform we had seen stood in naked mystery the enchanted chair  tis the weird chair of the viewless maiden the place of her who is no more seen said jambres who shall sit therein  the writing said remarked the dauntless leonora that a descendant of theodolitê must achieve this adventure i am ready  nay not so maiden murmured jambres try it not till i have made experience thereof me it cannot harm in me you see the original inventor beware of spurious imitations but it is a dread experience let me work it first  leonora could not resist his winning manner and concern for her safety  i move she said that mr jambres do take the chair at this meeting  i second that proposal said i and there was not a dissentient voice  mr jambres will now take the chair said leonora and the wizard his swathing robes bulging with leonoras securities glided forward  then an awful thing occurred no sooner had jambres sat down than leonora and i found ourselveshow can we expect it to be believedgazing on a blank bare space  the chair was still there but the wizard was gone leonora turned to me horror in her eyes her golden curls changed to a pale german silver  it is the chair of the vanishing lady she said  it is the confidence trick i cried and we both lost consciousness as the true state of the case flashed on our minds the wizard was off with 300000l in highclass american securities     chapter xv  the end   what remains to be told is of little public interest when we came to ourselves all was darkness escape seemed impossible  we could not swarm up the rope by the way we had come  we knew not when the shaft of yellow light might return on its beat  we lit a bryant  mays match and thereby groped our way downwards ever downwards  finally as we had given up all for lost leonora said dont you think the air is a little stuffy  we sniffed about the rocky floor and found an iron grating  it yielded to a strong tug and we descended into subterranean passages framed by the art of men through which rolled and surged torrents of turbid water  through these we waded attacked by armies of rats till thank goodness we saw a moving light flashing hither and thither on the torrent  half swimming half wading we reached the bearer of the light  it was old pellmelli doing a sanitary special as he told us  we somewhat deceitfully led him to believe that we had lost ourselves on a similar errand for a rival budget with which he was concerned in a paper mill30        30       what do you mean by a paper millpublisher        a journalistic war thened  on our faithfully promising to give him exclusive information about our adventures for an extra as he said old pellmelli conducted us to an orifice in the rock whence we escaped at last into the light of such day as dwells in the dark city  our hopes now entirely rest on finding jambres again but it may be of course a good three or four thousand years before that                                                 here this strange narrative closes and as i end my editorial task i have only one question to ask myselfwill this thing go on will jambres and leonora meet will the americans give up jambres under the extradition act or  is the great drama played
