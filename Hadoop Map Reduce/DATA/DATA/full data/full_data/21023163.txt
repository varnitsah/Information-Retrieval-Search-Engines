21023163	the giant of the north or pokings round the pole by rm ballantyne    robert michael ballantyne was born in 1825 and died in 1894  he was educated at the edinburgh academy and in 1841 he became a clerk with the hudson bay company working at the red river settlement in northen canada until 1847 arriving back in edinburgh in 1848  the letters he had written home were very amusing in their description of backwoods life and his family publishing connections suggested that he should construct a book based on these letters  three of his most enduring books were written over the next decade the young fur traders ungava the hudson bay company and were based on his experiences with the hbc  in this period he also wrote the coral island and martin rattler both of these taking place in places never visited by ballantyne  having been chided for small mistakes he made in these books he resolved always to visit the places he wrote about  with these books he became known as a great master of literature intended for teenagers  he researched the cornish mines the london fire brigade the postal service the railways the laying down of submarine telegraph cables the construction of lighthouses the lightship service the lifeboat service south africa norway the north sea fishing fleet ballooning deepsea diving algiers and many more experiencing the lives of the men and women in these settings by living with them for weeks and months at a time and he lived as they lived  he was a very truetolife author depicting the often squalid scenes he encountered with great care and attention to detail  his young readers looked forward eagerly to his next books and through the 1860s and 1870s there was a flow of books from his pen sometimes four in a year all very good reading  the rate of production diminished in the last ten or fifteen years of his life but the quality never failed  he published over ninety books under his own name and a few books for very young children under the pseudonym comus  for todays taste his books are perhaps a little too religious and what we would nowadays call pi  in part that was the way people wrote in those days but more important was the fact that in his days at the red river settlement in the wilds of canada he had been a little dissolute and he did not want his young readers to be unmindful of how they ought to behave as he felt he had been  some of his books were quite short little over 100 pages  these books formed a series intended for the children of poorer parents having less pocketmoney  these books are particularly wellwritten and researched because he wanted that readership to get the very best possible for their money  they were published as six series three books in each series  while ballantyne had some acqaintance with the eskimo during his years with the hudson bay company this book runs a little into the fantastical  the head of the family who are the heroes of the book has the belief that there is a sea of everwarm water surrounding the north pole and that there are islands there abounding in animal life and colonised by the eskimos  the plan is to visit these islands and stand upon the actual north pole which they find to be a low eminence near to the hut of a descendant of a seaman of the original hudson expedition in 1611  the story is very welltold and you find yourself almost believing the captains logic  the tension is maintained right up to the last chapter so much so that we do not learn whether the family who have by this time all become endeared to us ever get home to england and what the father and mother of the captains nephews have to say about their sons adventures  created as an etext by nick hodson august 2003    the giant of the north or pokings round the pole by rm ballantyne    chapter one  introduces our hero and his kindred  the giant was an eskimo of the arctic regions  at the beginning of his career he was known among his kindred by the name of skreekinbroot or the howler because he howled oftener and more furiously than any infant that had ever been born in arctic land  his proper name however was chingatok though his familiars still ventured occasionally to style him skreekinbroot  now it must not be supposed that our giant was one of those ridiculous myths of the nursery with monstrous heads and savage hearts who live on human flesh and finally receive their deserts at the hands of famous giantkilling jacks  no  chingatok was a real man of moderate size not more than seven feet two in his sealskin bootswith a lithe handsome figure immense chest and shoulders a gentle disposition and a fine though flattish countenance which was sometimes grave with thought at other times rippling with fun  we mention the howling characteristic of his babyhood because it was in early life the only indication of the grand spirit that dwelt within himthe solitary evidence of the tremendous energy with which he was endowed  at first he was no bigger than an ordinary infant  he was perhaps a little fatter but not larger and there was not an oily man or woman of the tribe to which he belonged who would have noticed anything peculiar about him if he had only kept moderately quiet but this he would not or could not do  his mouth was his safetyvalve  his spirit seemed to have been born big at once  it was far too large for his infant body and could only find relief from the little plump dwelling in which it was at first enshrined by rushing out at the mouth the shrieks of pigs were trifles to the yelling of that eskimo childs impatience  the caterwauling of cats was as nothing to the growls of his disgust  the angry voice of the polar bear was a mere chirp compared with the furious howling of his disappointment and the barking of a mad walrus was music to the roaring of his wrath  every one except his mother wished him dead and buried in the centre of an iceberg or at the bottom of the polar sea  his mothersquat solid pleasantfaced and mildalone put up with his ways with that longsuffering endurance which is characteristic of mothers  nothing could disturb the serenity of toolooha  when the young giant that was to be roared she fondled him if that was ineffectual she gave him a walrus tusk or a seals flipper to play with if that did not suffice she handed him a lump of blubber to suck if that failed as was sometimes the case she gambolled with him on the floor of her snowhut and rubbed his oily visage lovingly over her not less oleaginous countenance  need we enlarge on this point  have not all mothers acted thus or similarly in all times and climes    from pole to pole a mothers soul   is tender strong and true   whether the loved be good or bad   white yellow black or blue  but tooloohas love was wise as well as strong  if all else failed she was wont to apply corporal punishment and whacked her baby with her tail  be not shocked reader  we refer to the tail of her coat which was so long that it trailed on the ground and had a flap at the end which produced surprising results when properly applied  but the howling condition of life did not last long  at the age of five years little chingatok began to grow unusually fast and when he reached the age of seven the tribe took note of him as a more than promising youth  then the grand spirit which had hitherto sought to vent itself in yells and murderous assaults on its doting mother spent its energies in more noble action  all the little boys of his size although much older than himself began to look up to him as a champion  none went so boldly into mimic warfare with the walrus and the bear as chingatok  no one could make toy sledges out of inferior and scanty materials so well as he  if any little one wanted a succourer in distress skreekinbroot was the lad to whom he or she turned  if a broken toy had to be mended chingatok could do it better than any other boy  and so it went on until he became a man and a giant  when he was merely a big boythat is bigger than the largest man of his tribehe went out with the other braves to hunt and fish and signalised himself by the reckless manner in which he would attack the polar bear singlehanded but when he reached his full height and breadth he gave up reckless acts restrained his tendency to display his great strength and became unusually modest and thoughtful even pensive for an eskimo  the superiority of chingatoks mind as well as his body soon became manifest  even among savages intellectual power commands respect when coupled with physical force it elicits reverence  the young giant soon became an oracle and a leading man in his tribe  those who had wished him dead and in the centre of an iceberg or at the bottom of the polar sea came to wish that there were only a few more men like him  of course he had one or two enemies  who has not  there were a few who envied him his physical powers  there were some who envied him his moral influence  none envied him his intellectual superiority for they did not understand it  there was one who not only envied but hated him this was eemerk a meanspirited narrowminded fellow who could not bear to play what is styled second fiddle  eemerk was big enoughover six feetbut he wanted to be bigger  he was stout enough but wanted to be stouter  he was influential too but wanted to reign supreme  this of course was not possible while there existed a taller stouter and cleverer man than himself  even if eemerk had been the equal of chingatok in all these respects there would still have remained one difference of character which would have rendered equality impossible  it was this our young giant was unselfish and modest  eemerk was selfish and vainglorious  when the latter killed a seal he always kept the titbits for himself  chingatok gave them to his mother or to any one else who had a mind to have them  and so in regard to everything  chingatok was not a native of the region in which we introduce him to the reader  he and the tribe or rather part of the tribe to which he belonged had travelled from the far north so far north that nobody knew the name of the land from which they had come  even chingatok himself did not know it  being unacquainted with geography he knew no more about his position on the face of this globe than a fieldmouse or a sparrow  but the young giant had heard a strange rumour while in his faroff country which had caused his strong intellect to ponder and his huge heart to beat high  tribes who dwelt far to the south of his northern home had told him that other tribes still further south had declared that the people who dwelt to the south of them had met with a race of men who came to them over the sea on floating islands that these islands had something like trees growing out of them and wings which moved about which folded and expanded somewhat like the wings of the seagull that these mens faces were whiter than eskimo faces that they wore skins of a much more curious kind than sealskins and that they were amazingly clever with their hands talked a language that no one could understand and did many wonderful things that nobody could comprehend  a longing wistful expression used to steal over chingatoks face as he gazed at the southern horizon while listening to these strange rumours and a very slight smile of incredulity had glimmered on his visage when it was told him that one of the floating islands of these kablunets or white men had been seen with a burning mountain in the middle of it which vomited forth smoke and fire and sometimes uttered a furious hissing or shrieking sound not unlike his own voice when he was a skreekinbroot  the giant said little about these and other subjects but thought deeply  his mind as we have said was far ahead of his time and condition  let us listen to some of the disjointed thoughts that perplexed this man  who made me he asked in a low tone when floating alone one day in his kayak or skin canoe whence came i whither go i  what is this great sea on which i float that land on which i tread  no sledge no spear no kayak no snowhut makes itself  who made all that which i behold  chingatok looked around him but no audible answer came from nature  he looked up but the glorious sun only dazzled his eyes  there must be one he continued in a lower tone who made all things but who made him  no one  it is impossible  the maker must have ever been  ever been  he repeated this once or twice with a look of perplexed gravity  the northern savage had grasped the grand mystery and like all true philosophers savage or civilised who have gone before him relapsed into silence  at last he resolved to travel south until he should arrive at the coasts where these strange sights before described were said to have been seen  having made up his mind chingatok began his arrangements without delay persuaded a few families of his tribe to accompany him and reached the northwestern shores of greenland after a long and trying journey by water and ice  here he spent the winter  when spring came he continued his journey south and at last began to look out with sanguine expectation for the floating islands with wings and the larger island with the burning mountain on it about which he had heard  of course on his way south our giant fell in with some members of the tribes through whom the rumours that puzzled him had been transmitted to the far north and as he advanced these rumours took a more definite also a more correct form  in time he came to understand that the floating islands were gigantic kayaks or canoes with masts and sails instead of trees and wings  the burning mountain however remained an unmodified mystery which he was still inclined to disbelieve  but these more correct views did not in the least abate chingatoks eager desire to behold with his own eyes the strange men from the unknown south  eemerk formed one of the party who had volunteered to join chingatok on this journey  not that eemerk was influenced by largeminded views or a thirst for knowledge but he could not bear the thought that his rival should have all the honour of going forth on a long journey of exploration to the mysterious south a journey which was sure to be full of adventure and the successful accomplishment of which would unquestionably raise him very much in the estimation of his tribe  eemerk had volunteered to go not as second in command but as an independent member of the partya sort of freelance  chingatok did not quite relish having eemerk for a companion but being a goodhumoured easygoing fellow he made no objection to his going eemerk took his wife with him  chingatok took his mother and little sister also a young woman named tekkona who was his wifes sister these were the only females of the exploring party  chingatok had left his wife behind him because she was not robust at that time besides she was very smallas is usually the case with giants wivesand he was remarkably fond of her and feared to expose her to severe fatigue and danger  the completed party of explorers numbered twenty souls with their respective bodies some of which latter were large some small but all strong and healthy  four of the men were friends of eemerk whom he had induced to join because he knew them to be kindred spirits who would support him  i go to the icecliff to look upon the sea said chingatok one morning drawing himself up to his full height and unconsciously brushing some of the lampblack off the roof of his hut with the hood of his sealskin coat  at this point it may be well to explain once for all that our giant did not speak english and as it is highly improbable that the reader understands the eskimo tongue we will translate as literally as possiblemerely remarking that chingatoks language like his mind was of a superior cast  why goes my son to the icecliff asked toolooha in a slightly reproachful tone  are not the floes nearer  can he not look on the great salt lake from the hummocks  the sun has been hot a long time now  the icecliffs are dangerous  their edges split off every day if my son goes often to them he will one day come tumbling down upon the floes and be crushed flat and men will carry him to his mothers feet like a mass of shapeless blubber  it is interesting to note how strong a resemblance there is in sentiment and modes of thought between different members of the human family this untutored savage this polar giant replied in the eskimo tongue words which may be freely translatednever fear mother i know how to take care of myself  had he been an englishman he could not have expressed himself more naturally  he smiled as he looked down at his stout and genial mother while she stooped and drew forth a choice morsel of walrus flesh from one of her boots  eskimo ladies wear enormous sealskin boots the whole length of their legs  the tops of these boots are made extremely wide for the purpose of stowing away blubber or babies or other odd articles that might encumber their hands  chingatok seemed the personification of savage dignity as he stood there leaning on a short walrus spear  evidently his little mother doted on him  so did oblooria a pretty little girl of about sixteen who was his only sister and the counterpart of her mother hairy coat and tail included only a few sizes smaller  but chingatoks dignity was marred somewhat when he went down on his hands and knees in order to crawl through the low snowtunnel which was the only mode of egress from the snowhut  emerging at the outer end of the tunnel he stood up drew the hood of his sealskin coat over his head shouldered his spear and went off with huge and rapid strides over the frozen billows of the arctic sea  spring was far advanced at the time of which we write and the sun shone not only with dazzling brilliancy but with intense power on the fields of ice which still held the ocean in their cold unyielding embrace  the previous winter had been unusually severe and the ice showed little or no sign of breaking up except at a great distance from land where the heaving of the waves had cracked it up into large fields  these were gradually parting from the main body and drifting away with surfacecurrents to southern waters there to be liquefied and reunited to their parent sea  the particular part of the greenland coast to which the giant went in his ramble is marked by tremendous cliffs descending perpendicularly into the water  these at one part are divided by a valley tilled with a great glacier which flows from the mountains of the interior with a steep declivity to the sea into which it thrusts its tongue or extreme end  this mighty river of ice completely fills the valley from side to side being more than two miles in width and many hundred feet thick it seems as solid and motionless as the rocks that hem it in nevertheless the markings on the surface resemble the currents and eddies of a stream which has been suddenly frozen in the act of flowing and if you were to watch it narrowly day by day and week by week you would perceive by the changed position of objects on its surface that it does actually advance or flow towards the sea  a further proof of this advance is that although the tongue is constantly shedding off large icebergs it is never much decreased in extent being pushed out continuously by the ice which is behind  in fact it is this pushing process which causes the end of the tongue to shed its bergs because when the point is thrust into deep water and floats the motion of the sea cracks the floating mass off from that pail which is still aground and lets it drift away  now it was to these icecliffs that the somewhat reckless giant betook himself  although not well acquainted with that region or fully alive to the extent of the danger incurred his knowledge was sufficient to render him cautious in the selection of the position which should form his outlook  and a magnificent sight indeed presented itself when he took his stand among the glittering pinnacles  far as the eye could reach the sea lay stretched in the sunshine calm as a millpond and sparkling with icejewels of every shape and size  an arctic haze dry and sunny seemed to float over all like golden gauze  not only was the sun encircled by a beautiful halo but also by those lovely lights of the arctic regions known as parhelia or mocksuns  four of these made no mean display in emulation of their great original  on the horizon refraction caused the icefloes and bergs to present endless variety of fantastic forms and in the immediate foregroundat the giants feet tremendous precipices of ice went sheer down into the deep water while away to the right where a bay still retained its winter grasp of an icefield could be seen like white beehives the temporary snowhuts of these wandering eskimos  well might the eye as well as the head of the socalled savage rise upwards while he pondered the great mystery of the maker of all  as he stood on the giddy ledge rapt in contemplation an event occurred which was fitted to deepen the solemnity of his thoughts  not twenty yards from the point on which he stood a great icecliffthe size of an average housesnapped off with a rending crash and went thundering down into the deep which seemed to boil and heave with sentient emotion as it received the mass and swallowed it in a turmoil indescribable  chingatok sprang from his post and sought a safer but not less lofty outlook while the newborn berg rising from the sea swayed majestically to and fro in its newfound cradle  it is not understandable muttered the giant as he took up his new position and gazed with feelings of awe upon the grand scene  i wonder if the palefaced men in the floating islands think much about these things  perhaps they dwell in a land which is still more wonderful than this and hunt the walrus and the seal like us  it is said they come for nothing else but to see our land and find out what is in it  why should i not go to see their land  my kayak is large though it has no wings  the land may be far off but am i not strong  they are palefaced perhaps the reason is that they are starved  that must be so else they would not leave their home  i might bring some of the poor creatures to this happy land of ours where there is always plenty to eat  they might send messengers for their relations to come and dwell with us  i will speak to mother about that she is wise  like a dutiful son the giant turned on his heel descended the cliffs and went straight home to consult with his mother    chapter two  unexpected meetings alarms and confidences  mother i have been thinking said chingatok as he crept into his hut and sat down on a raised bench of moss  that is not news my son you think much  you are not like other men they think little and eat much  the stout little woman looked up through the smoke of her cookinglamp and smiled but her big son was too much absorbed in his thoughts to observe her pleasantry so she continued the cooking of a walrus chop in silence  the kablunets are not to be seen mother resumed chingatok  i have looked for them every day for a long time and begin to weary  my thought is now to launch my kayak when we come to open water load it with meat take four spears and more lines than a strong hunter needs for a whole season then paddle away south to discover the land of the kablunets  they must be poor they may be starving  i will guide them to our home and show them this land of plenty  he paused abruptly and looked at his mother with solemn anxiety for he was well aware that he had given her food for profound reflection  we feel tempted here to repeat our remark about the strong resemblance between different members of the human family but refrain  this untutored woman of the arctic lands met her sons proposition with the wellknown reply of many civilised persons  of what use would it be my son  no good can come of searching out these poor lands  you cannot benefit the miserable kablunets  perhaps they are savage and fierce and you are sure to meet with dangers by the way  worseyou may die  mother returned chingatok when the white bear stands up with his claws above my head and his mouth agape does my hand tremble or my spear fail  no my son  then why do you speak to me of danger and death  toolooha was not gifted with argumentative powers  she relapsed into silence and lampsmoke  but her son was not to be so easily dissuaded  he adopted a line of reasoning which never failed  mother he said sadly it may be that you are right and i am of too fearful a spirit to venture far away from you by myself i will remain here if you think me a coward  dont say so chingatok  you know what i think  go if you must go but who will hunt for your poor old mother when you are gone  this was an appeal which the astute little woman knew to be very powerful with her son  she buried her head in the smoke again and left the question to simmer  chingatok was tenderhearted  he said nothing but as usual he thought much as he gazed in a contemplative manner at his oily parent and there is no saying to what lengths of selfsacrifice he would have gone if he had not been aroused and his thoughts scattered to the winds by a yell so tremendous that it might well have petrified him on the spot  but it did nothing of the kind  it only caused him to drop on his knees dart through the tunnel like an eel spring into the open air like an electrified rabbit from its burrow and stand up with a look of blazing interrogation on his huge countenance  the cry had been uttered by his bosom friend and former playmate oolichuk who came running towards him with frantic gesticulations  the kablunets he gasped the whitefaces have comeon a floating islandalivesmokingit is all true  where demanded our giant whose face blazed up at once  there cried oolichuk pointing seaward towards the icehummocks with both hands and glaring up at his friend  without another word chingatok ran off in the direction pointed out followed hotly by his friend  oolichuk was a large and powerful man but his legs were remarkably short  his pace compared with that of chingatok was as that of a sparrow to an ostrich  nevertheless he kept up for he was agile and vigorous  have you seen themhave you spoken asked the giant abruptly  yes all the tribe was there  no one killed  no but terribly frightened they made me run home to fetch you  chingatok increased his speed  so did oolichuk  while they run let us leap a little ahead of them reader and see what had caused all the excitement  the whole party had gone off that morning with the exception of chingatok and his mother to spear seals in a neighbouring bay where these animals had been discovered in great numbers  dogs and sledges had been taken because a successful hunt was expected and the ice was sufficiently firm  the bay was very large  at its distant southern extremity there rose a great promontory which jutted far out into the sea  while the men were busy there making preparations to begin the hunt oblooria chingatoks little sister amused herself by mounting a hummock of ice about thirty feet high  when there she chanced to look towards the promontory  instantly she opened her eyes and mouth and uttered a squeal that brought her friends running to her side  oolichuk was the first to reach her  he had no need to ask questions obloorias gaze directed his and there coming round the promontory he beheld an object which had never before filled his wondering eyes  it was apparently a monstrous creature with a dark body and towering wings and a black thing in its middle from which were vomited volumes of smoke  kablunets white men he yelled  kablunetshuk huk echoed the whole tribe as they scrambled up the icehill one after another  and they were right  a vessel of the palefaces had penetrated these northern solitudes and was advancing swiftly before a light breeze under sail and steam  despite the preparation their minds had received and the fact that they were out in search of these very people this sudden appearance of them filled most of the eskimos with alarmsome of them with absolute terror insomuch that the term paleface became most appropriate to themselves  what shall we do exclaimed akeetolik one of the men  fly cried ivitchuk another of the men whose natural courage was not high  no let us stay and behold said oolichuk with a look of contempt at his timid comrade  yes stay and see said eemerk sternly  but they will kill us faltered the young woman whom we have already mentioned by the name of tekkona  nono one would kill you said eemerk gallantly they would only carry you off and keep you  while they conversed with eager anxious looks the steam yachtfor such she wasadvanced rapidly threading her way among the icefields and floes with graceful rapidity and ease to the unutterable amazement of the natives  although her sails were spread to catch the light breeze her chief motive power at the time was a screwpropeller  yes it must be alive said oolichuk to akeetolik with a look of solemn awe  the white men do not paddle  they could not lift paddles big enough to move such a great oomiak see note 1 and the wind is not strong it could not blow them so fast  see the oomiak has a tailand wags it  oh do let us run away whispered the trembling oblooria as she took shelter behind tekkona  no no said the latter who was brave as well as pretty we need not fear  our men will take care of us  i wish that chingatok was here whimpered poor little oblooria nestling closer to tekkona and grasping her tail he fears nothing and nobody  ay assented tekkona with a peculiar smile and is brave enough to fight everything and everybody  does oblooria think that no one can fight but the giant whispered oolichuk who stood nearest to the little maid  he drew a knife made of bone from his boot where it usually lay concealed and flourished it with a broad grin  the girl laughed blushed slightly and looking down toyed with the sleeve of tekkonas fur coat  meanwhile the yacht drew near to the floe on which our eskimos were grouped  the ice was cracked right across leaving a lane of open water about ten feet wide between its inner edge and the shore ice  the eskimos stood on the land side of this crack a hundred yards or so from it  on nearing the floe the strange vessel checked her speed  it moves its wings exclaimed eemerk  and turns its side to us said akeetolik  and wags its tail no more cried oolichuk  oh do do let us run away gasped oblooria  no no we will not run said tekkona  at that moment a white cloud burst from the side of the yacht  hi hee huk shouted the whole tribe in amazement  a crash followed which not only rattled like thunder among the surrounding cliffs but went like electric fire to the central marrow of each eskimo  with a united yell of terror they leaped three feet into the airmore or lessturned about and fled  tekkona who was active as a young deer herself took the lead and oblooria whose limbs trembled so that she could hardly run held on to oolichuk who gallantly dragged her along  the terror was increased by a prolonged screech from the steamwhistle  it was a wild scramble in sudden panic the eskimos reached their sledges harnessed their teams left their spears on the ice cracked their whips which caused the dogs to join in the yelling chorus and made for the land at a furious gallop  but their fear began to evaporate in a few minutes and oolichuk was the first to check his pace  ho stop he cried  eemerk looked back saw that they were not pursued and pulled up  the others followed suit and soon the fugitives were seen by those on board the yacht grouped together and gazing intently at them from the top of another icehummock  the effect of the cannonshot on board the yacht itself was somewhat startling  the gun had been loaded on the other side of the promontory for the purpose of being fired if eskimos were not visible on the coast beyond in order to attract them from the interior if they should chance to be there  when however the natives were discovered on the ice the gun was of course unnecessary and had been forgotten  it therefore burst upon the crew with a shock of surprise and caused the captain who was in the cabin at the moment to shoot up from the hatchway like a jackinthebox  who did that he demanded looking round sternly  the crew who had been gazing intently at the natives did not know  i really cannot tell sir said the chief mate touching his cap  two strapping youthsone about sixteen the other eighteenleaned over the side and paid no regard to the question but it was obvious from the heaving motion of their shoulders that they were not so much absorbed in contemplation as they pretended to be  come leo alf you know something about this  the captain was a large powerful man of about forty with bushy irongrey curls a huge beard and an aquiline nose  the two youths turned to him at once and leo the eldest said respectfully we did not see it done uncle butbut we think  well what do you think  at that moment a delicatelooking slender lad about twelve years of age with fair curly hair and flashing blue eyes stepped out from behind the funnel which had hitherto concealed him and said boldly though blushingly  i did it father  ha just like you why did you do it eh  i can hardly tell father said the boy endeavouring to choke a laugh but the eskimos looked so funny and ii had a box of matches in my pocket andandi thought a shot would make them look so very much funnier andandi was right  well benjamin you may go below and remain there till further orders  when captain vane called his son benjamin he was seriously displeased  at other times he called him benjy  yes father replied the boy with a very bad grace and down he went in a state of rebellious despair for he was wildly anxious to witness all that went on  his despair was abated however when in the course of a few minutes the yacht swung round so as to present her stern to the shore and remained in that position enabling him to observe proceedings from the cabin windows almost as well as if he had been on deck  he was not aware that his father knowing his sons nature and wishing to temper discipline with mercy had placed the vessel in that position for his special benefit  the difficulty now was how to attract the natives and inspire them with confidence in the good intentions of their visitors  in any case this would have been a difficult matter but the firing of that unlucky gun had increased the difficulty tenfold  when however captain vane saw the natives cease their mad flight and turn to gaze at the vessel his hopes revived and he set about a series of ingenious efforts to attain his end  first of all he sent a boat in charge of his two nephews leonard and alphonse vandervell to set up a small table on the ice on which were temptingly arranged various presents consisting of knives beads lookingglasses and articles of clothing  having done this they retired like wary anglers to watch for a bite  but the fish would not rise though they observed the proceedings with profound attention from the distant hummock  after waiting a couple of hours the navigators removed the table and left an eskimo dog in its place with a string of blue beads tied round its neck  but this bait also failed  try something emblematic uncle suggested leonard the elder of the brothers before mentioned  and get benjy to manufacture it said alphonse  as benjy was possessed of the most fertile imagination on board he was released from punishment and brought on deck  the result of his effort of genius was the creation of a huge white calico flag on which were painted roughly the figure of a sailor and an eskimo sitting on an iceberg with a kettle of soup between them  on one side were a pair of hands clasped together on the other a sprig of heath the only shrub that could be seen on the shore  splendid exclaimed leo and alf in the same breath as they held the flag up to view  youll become a royal academician if you cultivate your talents benjy said the captain who was proud as well as fond of this his only child  the boy said nothing but a pleased expression and a twinkle in his eyes proved that he was susceptible to flattery though not carried off his legs by it  the banner with the strange device was fixed to a pole which was erected on an icehummock between the ship and the shore and a bag containing presents was hung at the foot of it  still these eskimo fish would not bite though they rose at the flag  oolichuks curiosity had become so intense that he could not resist it he advanced alone very warily and looked at it but did not dare to touch it  soon he was joined by eemerk and the others  seeing this captain vane sent to meet them an interpreter whom he had procured at one of the greenland settlements in passing  just as this man whose name was anders stepped into the boat alongside it occurred to the eskimos that their leader should be sent for  oolichuk undertook to fetch him he ran back to the sledges harnessed a small team and set off like the wind  thus it came to pass that chingatok and his mother were startled by a yell as before mentioned  meanwhile anders was put on the ice and advanced alone and unarmed towards the canal or chasm which separated the parties  he carried a small white flag and a bag containing presents  innocentlooking and defenceless though he was however the eskimos approached him with hesitating and slow steps regarding every motion of the interpreter with suspicion and frequently stooping to thrust their hands into their boots in which they all carried knives  at last when within hearing anders shouted a peaceful message and there was much hallooing and gesticulation among the natives but nothing comprehensible came of it  after a time anders thought he recognised words of a dialect with which he was acquainted and to his satisfaction found that they understood him  kakeite kakeitecome on come on he cried holding up the present  nakrie nakrieno no go awayyou want to kill us answered the doubtful natives  thereupon anders protested that nothing was further from his thoughts that he was a man and a friend and had a mother like themselves and that he wanted to please them  at this eemerk approached to the edge of the canal and drawing a knife from his boot said go away  i can kill you  nothing daunted anders said he was not afraid and taking a good english knife from his bag threw it across the canal  eemerk picked it up and was so pleased that he exclaimed heighyaw heighyaw joyously and pulled his nose several times  anders understanding this to be a sign of friendship immediately pulled his own nose smiled and threw several trinkets and articles of clothing to the other natives who had by that time drawn together in a group and were chattering in great surprise at the things presented  ivitchuk was perhaps the most excited among them  he chanced to get hold of a round hox in the lid of which was a mirror  on beholding himself looking at himself he made such an awful face that he dropt the glass and sprang backward tripping up poor oblooria in the act and tumbling over her  this was greeted with a shout of laughter and anders now believing that friendly relations had been established went to the boat for a plank to bridge the chasm  as leo and alf assisted him to carry the plank the natives again became grave and anxious  stop shouted eemerk you want to kill us  what great creature is that  does it come from the moon or the sun  does it eat fire and smoke  no it is only a dead thing  it is a wooden house  you lie cried the polite eemerk it shakes its wings  it vomits fire and smoke  it has a tail and wags it  while speaking he slowly retreated for the plank was being placed in position and the other natives were showing symptoms of an intention to fly  just then a shout was heard landwards  turning round they saw a dogsledge flying over the ice towards them with oolichuk flourishing the longlashed whip and the huge form of their leader beside him  in a few seconds they dashed up and chingatok sprang upon the ice without a moments hesitation he strode towards the plank and crossed it  walking up to anders he pulled his own nose  the interpreter was not slow to return the salutation as he looked up at the giant with surprise not unmingled with awe  in addition he grasped his huge hand squeezed and shook it  chingatok smiled blandly and returned the squeeze so as to cause the interpreter to wince  then perceiving at once that he had got possession of a key to the affections of the strangers he offered to shake hands with leonard and his brother stooping with regal urbanity to them as he did so  by this time the captain and first mate with benjy and several of the crew were approaching  instead of exhibiting fear chingatok advanced to meet them and shook hands all round  he gazed at captain vane with a look of admiration which was not at first quite accountable until he laid his hand gently on the captains magnificent beard and stroked it  the captain laughed and again grasped the hand of the eskimo  they both squeezed but neither could make the other wince for captain vane was remarkably powerful though comparatively short of limb  well you are a good fellow in every way exclaimed the captain  heigh yah returned chingatok who no doubt meant to be complimentary though we confess our inability to translate  it was obvious that two sympathetic souls had met  come across shouted chingatok turning abruptly to his companions who had been gazing at his proceedings in openmouthed wonder  the whole tribe at once obeyed the order and in a few minutes they were in the seventh heaven of delight and goodwill receiving gifts and handshakings each pulling his own nose frequently by way of expressing satisfaction or friendship and otherwise exchanging compliments with the no less amiable and gratified crew of the steam yacht whitebear    note  the oomiak is the open boat of skin used by eskimo women and is capable of holding several persons  the kayak or mans canoe holds only one    chapter three  shows how the eskimos were entertained by the white men  the whitebear steam yacht owned and commanded by captain jacob vane had sailed from england and was bound for the north pole  ill find itim bound to find it was the captains usual mode of expressing himself to his intimates on the subject if theres a north pole in the world at all and my nephews leo and alf will help me leos a doctor almost and alfs a scientific jackofalltrades so we cant fail  ill take my boy benjy for the benefit of his health and see if we dont bring home a chip o the pole big enough to set up beside cleopatras needle on the thames embankment  there was tremendous energy in captain vane and indomitable resolution but energy and resolution cannot achieve all things  there are other factors in the life of man which help to mould his destiny  short and sad and terribleay we might even say tremendouswas the whitebears wild career  up to the time of her meeting with the eskimos all had gone well  fair weather and favouring winds had blown her across the atlantic  sunshine and success had received her as it were in the arctic regions  the sea was unusually free of ice  upernavik the last of the greenland settlements touched at was reached early in the season and the native interpreter anders secured  the dreaded middle passage near the head of baffins bay was made in the remarkably short space of fifty hours and passing cape york into the north water they entered smiths sound without having received more than a passing bumpan arctic kiss as it werefrom the polar ice  in smiths sound fortune still favoured them  these resolute intending discoverers of the north pole passed in succession the various farthests of previous explorers and the stout brothers vandervell with their cousin benjy vane gazed eagerly over the bulwarks at the swiftlypassing headlands while the captain pointed out the places of interest and kept up a running commentary on the brave deeds and high aspirations of such wellknown men as frobisher davis hudson ross parry franklin kane mcclure rae mcclintock hayes hall nares markham and all the other heroes of arctic story  it was an era in the career of those three youths that stood out bright and freshnever to be forgottenthis first burst of the realities of the arctic world on minds which had been previously well informed by books  the climax was reached on the day when the eskimos of the far north were met with  but from that time a change took place in their experience  fortune seemed to frown from that memorable day  we say seemed because knitted brows do not always or necessarily indicate what is meant by a frown  after the first fears of the eskimos had been allayed a party of them were invited to go on board the ship  they accepted the invitation and went headed by chingatok  that noble savage required no persuasion  from the first he had shown himself to be utterly devoid of fear  he felt that the grand craving of his naturea thirst for knowledgewas about to be gratified and that would have encouraged him to risk anything even if he had been much less of a hero than he was  but if fear had no influence over our giant the same cannot be said of his companions  oolichuk indeed was almost as bold though he exhibited a considerable amount of caution in his looks and movements but eemerk and one or two of his friends betrayed their craven spirits in frequent startled looks and changing colour  ivitchuk was a strange compound of nervousness and courage while akeetolik appeared to have lost the power of expressing every feeling but onethat of blank amazement  indeed surprise at what they saw on board the steam yacht was the predominant feeling amongst these children of nature  their eyebrows seemed to have gone up and fixed themselves in the middle of their foreheads and their eyes and mouths to have opened wide permanently  none of the women accepted the invitation to go aboard except tekkona and oblooria followed her not because she was courageous but because she seemed to cling to the stronger nature as a protection from undefined and mysterious dangers  tell them said captain vane to anders the eskimo interpreter that these are the machines that drive the ship along when there is no wind  he pointed down the hatchway where the complication of rods and cranks glistened in the hold  huk exclaimed the eskimos  they sometimes exclaimed hi ho hoy and hah as things were pointed out to them but did not venture on language more intelligible at first  let em hear the steamwhistle suggested the mate  before the captain could countermand the order benjy had touched the handle and let off a short sharp skirl  the effect on the natives was powerful  they leaped with a simultaneous yell at least a foot off the deck with the exception of chingatok though even he was visibly startled while oblooria seized tekkona round the waist and buried her face in her friends jacket  a brief explanation soon restored them to equanimity and they were about to pass on to some other object of interest when both the steamwhistle and the escapevalve were suddenly opened to their full extent and there issued from the engine a hissing yell so prolonged and deafening that even the captains angry shout was not heard  a yard at least was the leap into the air made by the weakest of the eskimosexcept our giant who seemed however to shrink into himself while he grasped his knife and looked cautiously round as if to guard himself from any foe that might appear  eemerk fairly turned and fled to the stern of the yacht over which he would certainly have plunged had he not been forcibly restrained by two stout seamen  the others trembling violently stood still because they knew not what to do and poor oblooria fell flat on the deck catching tekkona by the tail and pulling her down beside her  you scoundrel exclaimed the captain when the din ceased iigo down sir to  oh father dont be hard on me pleaded benjy with a gleefully horrified look i really could not resist it  thethe temptation was too strong  the temptation to give you a ropesending is almost too strong for me benjamin returned the captain sternly but there was a twinkle in his eye notwithstanding as he turned to explain to chingatok that his son had by way of jest allowed part of the mighty power imprisoned in the machinery to escape  the eskimo received the explanation with dignified gravity and a faint smile played on his lips as he glanced approvingly at benjy for he loved a jest and was keenly alive to a touch of humour  what power is imprisoned in the machinery asked our eskimo through the interpreter  what power repeated the captain with a puzzled look why its boiling watersteam  here he tried to give a clear account of the nature and power and application of steam but not being gifted with capacity for lucid explanation and the mind of anders being unaccustomed to such matters the result was that the brain of chingatok was filled with ideas that were fitted rather to amaze than to instruct him  after making the tour of the vessel the party again passed the engine hatch  chingatok touched the interpreter quietly and said in a low grave tone tell blackbeard thus he styled the captain to let the power yell again  anders glanced up in the giants grave countenance with a look of amused surprise  he understood him and whispered to the captain who smiled intelligently and turning to his son said  do it again benjy  give it em strong  never before did that lad obey his father with such joyous alacrity  in another instant the whistle shrieked and the escapevalve hissed ten times more furiously than before  up went the eskimothree feet or moreas if in convulsions and away went eemerk to the stern over which he dived swam to the floe leaped on his sledge cracked his whip and made for home on the wings of terror  doubtless an evil conscience helped his cowardice  meanwhile chingatok laughed despite his struggles to be grave  this revealed the trick to some of his quickwitted and humourloving companions who at once burst into loud laughter  even oblooria dismissed her fears and smiled  in this restored condition they were taken down to the cabin and fed sumptuously  that night as chingatok sat beside his mother busy with a seals rib he gradually revealed to her the wonders he had seen  the white men are very wise mother  so you have said four times my son  but you cannot understand it  but my son can make me understand said toolooha helping the amiable giant to a second rib  chingatok gazed at his little mother with a look of solemnity that evidently perplexed her  she became restless under it and wiped her forehead uneasily with the flap at the end of her tail  the youth seemed about to speak but he only sighed and addressed himself to the second rib over which he continued to gaze while he masticated  my thoughts are big mother he said laying down the bare bone  that may well be for so is your head my son she replied gently  i know not how to begin mother  another rib may open your lips perhaps suggested the old woman softly  true give me one said chingatok  the third rib seemed to have the desired effect for while busy with it he began to give his parent a graphic account of the yacht and its crew and it was really interesting to note how correctly he described all that he understood of what he had seen  but some of the things he had partly failed to comprehend and about these he was vague  and they have aa power mother shut up in a hard thing so that it cant get out unless they let it and it drives the big canoe through the water  it is very strongterrible  is it a devil asked toolooha  no it is not alive  it is dead  it is that he pointed with emphasis to a pot hanging over the lamp out of which a little steam was issuing and looked at his mother with awful solemnity  she returned the look with something of incredulity  yes mother the power is not a beast  it lives not yet it drives the white mans canoe which is as big as a little iceberg and it whistles it shrieks it yells  a slightly sorrowful look rested for a moment on tooloohas benign countenance  it was evident that she suspected her son either of derangement or having forsaken the paths of truth  but it passed like a summer cloud  tell me more she said laying her hand affectionately on the huge arm of chingatok who had fallen into a contemplative mood and with hands clasped over one knee sat gazing upwards  before he could reply the heart of toolooha was made to bound by a shriek more terrible than she had ever before heard or imagined  chingatok caught her by the wrist held up a finger as if to impose silence smiled brightly and listened  again the shriek was repeated with prolonged power  tell me my son gasped toolooha is oblooriaare the people safe why came you to me alone  the little sister and the people are safe  i came alone to prevent your being taken by surprise  did i not say that it could shriek and yell  this is the white mans big canoe  dropping the old womans hand as he spoke chingatok darted into the open air with the agility of a polar bear and toolooha followed with the speed of an arctic hare    chapter four  a catastrophe and a bold decision  two days after her arrival at the temporary residence of the northern eskimos the steam yacht whitebear while close to the shore was beset by ice so that she could neither advance nor retreat everywhere as far as the eye could reach the sea was covered with hummocks and bergs and fields of ice so closely packed that there was not a piece of open water to be seen with the exception of one small basin a few yards ahead of the lead or lane of water in which the vessel had been imprisoned  no chance of escaping from this i fear for a long time said alf vandervell to his brother as they stood near the wheel looking at the desolate prospect  it seems quite hopeless said leo with however a look of confidence that ill accorded with his words  i do believe we are frozen in for the winter said benjy vane coming up at the moment  there speaks ignorance said the captain whose head appeared at the cabin hatchway  if any of you had been in these regions before you would have learned that nothing is so uncertain as the action of pack ice  at one time you may be hard and fast so that you couldnt move an inch  a few hours after the set of the currents may loosen the pack and open up lanes of water through which you may easily make your escape  sometimes it opens up so as to leave almost a clear sea in a few hours  but it is pretty tight packed just now father and looks wintrylike doesnt it said benjy in a desponding tone  looks boy ay but things are not what they seem hereaway  you saw four mocksuns round the real one yesterday didnt you and the day before you saw icebergs floating in the air eh  true father but these appearances were deceptive whereas this ice which looks so tightly packed is a reality  that is so lad but it is not set fast for the winter though it looks like it  well doctor added the captain turning towards a tall cadaverous man who came on deck just then with the air and tread of an invalid how goes it with you  better i hope  he asked this with kindly interest as he laid his strong hand on the sick mans shoulder but the doctor shook his head and smiled sadly  it is a great misfortune to an expedition captain when the doctor himself falls sick he said sitting down on the skylight with a sigh  come come cheer up doctor returned the captain heartily dont be cast down well all turn doctors for the occasion and nurse you well in spite of yourself  ill keep up all heart captain you may depend ont as long as two of my bones will stick together butwell to change the subject what are you going to do now  just all that can be done in the circumstances replied the captain you see we cannot advance over ice either with sail or steam but theres a basin just ahead which seems a little more secure than that in which we lie  ill try to get into it  there is nothing but a neck of ice between us and it which i think i could cut by charging in under full steam and there seems a faint gleam of something far ahead which encourages me  tell the steward to fetch my glasses benjy  butterface shouted the boy  yis massa  fetch the captains glasses please  yis massa  a pair of large binoculars were brought up by a huge negro whose name was preeminently unsuggestive of his appearance  after a long steady gaze at the horizon the captain shut up the glass with an air of determination and ordered the engineer to get up full steam and the crew to be ready with the icepoles  there was a large berg at the extremity of the lakelet of open water into which captain vane wished to break  it was necessary to keep well out of the way of that berg  the captain trusted chiefly to his screw but got out the icepoles in case they should be required  when all the men were stationed the order was given to go ahead full steam  the gallant little yacht charged the neck of ice like a living creature hit it fair cut right through and scattered the fragments right and left as she sailed majestically into the lakelet beyond  the shock was severe but no harm was done everything on board having been made as strong as possible and of the very best material for a voyage in iceladen seas  an unforeseen event followed however which ended in a series of most terrible catastrophes  the neck of ice through which they had broken had acted as a check on the pressure of the great body of the floe and it was no sooner removed than the heavy mass began to close in with slow but irresistible power compelling the little vessel to steam close up to the icebergso close that some of the upper parts actually overhung the deck  they were slowly forced into this dangerous position  with breathless anxiety the captain and crew watched the apparently gentle but really tremendous grinding of the ice against the vessels side  even the youngest on board could realise the danger  no one moved for nothing whatever could be done  everything depends under god on the ice easing off before we are crushed said the captain  as he spoke the timbers of the yacht seemed to groan under the pressure then there was a succession of loud cracks and the vessel was thrust bodily up the sloping sides of the berg  while in this position with the bow high and dry a mass of ice was forced against the sternpost and the screwpropeller was snapped off as if it had been made of glass  poor captain vanes heart sank as if he had received his deathblow for he knew that the yacht was now even in the event of escaping reduced to an ordinary vessel dependent on its sails  the shock seemed to have shaken the berg itself for at that moment a crashing sound was heard overhead  the terrorstricken crew looked up and for one moment a pinnacle like a church spire was seen to flash through the air right above them  it fell with an indescribable roar close alongside deluging the decks with water  there was a momentary sigh of relief which however was chased away by a succession of falling masses varying from a pound to a ton in weight which came down on the deck like cannonshots breaking the topmasts and cutting to pieces much of the rigging  strange to say none of the men were seriously injured though many received bruises more or less severe  during this brief but thrilling period the brothers vandervell and benjy vane crouched close together beside the port bulwarks partially screened from the falling ice by the mizzen shrouds  the captain stood on the quarterdeck quite exposed and apparently unconscious of danger the picture of despair  it cant last long sighed poor benjy looking solemnly up at the vast mass of the bluishwhite berg which hung above them as if ready to fall  presently the pressure ceased then the ice eased off and in a few minutes the whitebear slid back into the sea a pitiable wreck  now had come the time for action  out poles my lads and shove her off the berg was the sharp order  every one strained as if for life at the icepoles and slowly forced the yacht away from the dreaded berg  it mattered not that they were forcing her towards a rocky shore  any fate would be better than being crushed under a mountain of ice  but the danger was not yet past  no sooner had they cleared the berg and escaped from that form of destruction than the ice began again to close in and this time the vessel was nipped with such severity that some of her principal timbers gave way  finally her back was broken and the bottom forced in  so exclaimed the captain with a look of profound grief our voyage in the whitebear lads has come to an end  all that we can do now is to get the boats and provisions and as much of the cargo as we can safe on the ice  and sharps the word for when the floes ease off the poor little yacht will certainly go to the bottom  no massa said the negro steward stepping on deck at that moment we cant go to de bottom cause wes dare aready  what dye mean butterface  jus what me say replied the steward with a look of calm resignation  is bin blow an seed de rocks stickin troo de bottom ders one de size ob a jollyboats bow comed right troo my pantry an knock all de crockery to smash an de best teapot hes so flat he wouldnt know hisself in a lookinglass  it turned out to be as butterface said  the pack had actually thrust the little vessel on a shoal which extended out from the headland off which the catastrophe occurred and there was therefore no fear of her sinking  well weve reason to be thankful for that at all events said the captain with an attempt to look cheerful come lads lets to work whatever our future course is to be our first business is to get the boats and cargo out of danger  with tremendous energybecause action brought relief to their overstrained feelingsthe crew of the illfated yacht set to work to haul the boats upon the grounded ice  the tide was falling so that a great part of the most valuable part of the cargo was placed in security before the rising tide interrupted the work  this was fortunate for when the water reached a certain point the ice began to move and the poor little vessel was so twisted about that they dared not venture on board of her  that nightif we may call it night in a region where the sun never quite went downthe party encamped on the northwestern coast of greenland in the lee of a huge cliff just beyond which the tongue of a mighty glacier dipped into the sea  for convenience the party divided into two with a blazing fire for each round which the castaways circled conversing in subdued sad tones while supper was being prepared  it was a solemn occasion and a scene of indescribable grandeur with the almost eternal glacier of greenlandthe great humboldt glacier shedding its bergs into the dark blue sea the waters of which had by that time been partially cleared to the northward  on the left was the weird pack and its thousand grotesque forms with the wreck in its iron grasp on the right the perpendicular cliffs and the bright sky over all with the smoke of the campfires rising into it from the foreground  now my friends said captain vane to the crew when assembled after supper i am no longer your commander for my vessel is a wreck but as i suppose you still regard me as your leader i assemble you here for the purpose of considering our position and deciding on what is best to be done  here the captain said among other things it was his opinion that the whitebear was damaged beyond the possibility of repair that their only chance of escape lay in the boats and that the distance between the place on which they stood and upernavik although great was not beyond the reach of resolute men  before going further or expressing a decided opinion he added i would hear what the officers have to say on this subject  let the first mate speak  its my opinion said the mate that theres only one thing to be done namely to start for home as soon and as fast as we can  we have good boats plenty of provisions and are all stout and healthy excepting our doctor whom we will take good care of and expect to do no rough work  thanks mate said the doctor with a laugh i think that at all events i shall keep well enough to physic you if you get ill  are you willing to take charge of the party in the event of my deciding to remain here asked the captain of the mate  certainly sir he replied with a look of slight surprise  you know i am quite able to do so  the second mate too is as able as i am for that matter most of the men i think would find little difficulty in navigating a boat to upernavik  that is well returned the captain because i do not intend to return with you  not return exclaimed the doctor surely you dont mean to winter here  no not here but further north replied the captain with a smile which most of the party returned for they thought he was jesting  benjy vane however did not think so  a gleeful look of triumph caused his face as it were to sparkle and he said eagerly  well winter at the north pole father eh  this was greeted with a general laugh  but seriously uncle what do you mean to do asked leonard vandervell who with his brother was not unhopeful that the captain meditated something desperate  benjy is not far off the mark  i intend to winter at the pole or as near to it as i can manage to get  my dear captain vane said the doctor with an anxious look you cannot really mean what you say  you must be jesting or mad  well as to madness returned the captain with a peculiar smile you ought to know best for its a perquisite of your cloth to pronounce people mad or sane though some of yourselves are as mad as the worst of us but in regard to jesting nothing i assure you is further from my mind  listen  he rose from the box which had formed his seat and looked earnestly round on his men  as he stood there erect tall square powerful with legs firmly planted and apart as if to guard against a lurch of his ship with his bronzed face flushed and his dark eye flashing they all understood that their leaders mind was made up and that what he had resolved upon he would certainly attempt to carry out  listen he repeated it was my purpose on leaving england as you all know to sail north as far as the ice would let me to winter where we should stick fast and organise an overice or overland journey to the pole with all the appliances of recent scientific discovery and all the advantages of knowledge acquired by former explorers  it has pleased god to destroy my ship but my life and my hopes are spared  so are my stores and scientific instruments  i intend therefore to carry out my original purpose  i believe that former explorers have erred in some points of their procedure  these errors i shall steer clear of  former travellers have ignored some facts and despised some appliances  these facts i will recognise these appliances i will utilise  with a steam yacht you my friends who have shown so much enthusiasm and courage up to this point would have been of the utmost service to me  as a party in boats or on foot you would only hamper my movements  i mean to prosecute this enterprise almost alone  i shall join myself to the eskimos  he paused at this point as if in meditation  benjy whose eyes and mouth had been gradually opening to their widest almost gasped with astonishment as he glanced at his cousins whose expressive countenances were somewhat similarly affected  i have had some long talks continued the captain with that big eskimo chingatok through our interpreter and from what he says i believe my chances of success are considerable  i am all the more confirmed in this resolution because of the readiness and ability of my first mate to guide you out of the arctic regions and your willingness to trust him  anders has agreed to go with me as interpreter and now all i want is one other man because  put me down father cried benjy in a burst of excitementim your man  hush lad said the captain with a little smile of course i shall take you with me and also your two cousins but i want one other man to complete the partybut he must be a heartily willing man  who will volunteer  there was silence for a few moments  it was broken by the doctor  i for one wont volunteer he said for im too much shaken by this troublesome illness to think of such an expedition  if i were well it might be otherwise but perhaps some of the others will offer  you cant expect me to do so said the mate for ive got to guide our party home as agreed on besides under any circumstances i would not join you for it is simple madness  youll forgive me captain  i mean no disrespect but i have sailed many years to these seas and i know from experience that what you propose is beyond the power of man to accomplish  experience repeated the captain quickly  has your experience extended further north than this point  no sir i have not been further north than thisnobody has  it is beyond the utmost limit yet reached so far as i know  well then you cannot speak from experience about what i propose said the captain turning away  come lads i have no wish to constrain you i merely give one of you the chance  still no one came forward  every man of the crew of the whitebear had had more or less personal acquaintance with arctic travel and danger they would have followed captain vane anywhere in the yacht but evidently they had no taste for what he was about to undertake  at last one stepped to the front  it was butterface the steward  this intensely black negro was a bulky powerful man with a modest spirit and a strange disbelief in his own capacities though in truth these were very considerable  he came forward stooping slightly and rubbing his hands in a deprecating manner  scuse me massa capting  praps it bery presumsheeous in dis yer chile for to speak afore his betters but as no oder man pears to want to volunteer is willin to go in an win  ob course i aint a man ony a nigger but is a willin nigger an kin do a few small tings

hungryan ill foller you massa troo tick and tinto de nort pole or de sout pole or de east pole or de west poleor any oder pole wotsomediverall de same to butterface slongs youll let im stick by you  the crew could not help giving the negro a cheer as he finished this loyal speech and the captain although he would have preferred one of the other men gladly accepted his services  a few days later the boats were ready and provisioned adieus were said hats and handkerchiefs waved and soon after captain vane and his son and two nephews with anders and butterface were left to fight their battles alone on the margin of an unexplored mysterious polar sea    chapter five  left to their fate  there are times probably in all conditions of life when men feel a species of desolate sadness creeping over their spirits which they find it hard to shake off or subdue  such a time arrived to our arctic adventurers the night after they had parted from the crew of the wrecked whitebear  nearly everything around and much within them was calculated to foster that feeling  they were seated on the rocky point on the extremity of which their yacht had been driven  behind them were the deep ravines broad valleys black beetling cliffs grand mountains stupendous glaciers and dreary desolation of greenland  to right and left and in front of them lay the chaotic icepack of the arctic sea with lanes and pools of water visible here and there like lines and spots of ink  icebergs innumerable rose against the sky which at the time was entirely covered with grey and gloomy clouds  gusts of wind swept over the frozen waste now and then as if a squall which had recently passed were sighing at the thought of leaving anything undestroyed behind it  when we add to this that the wanderers were thinking of the comrades who had just left themthe last link as it were with the civilised world from which they were selfexiled of the unknown dangers and difficulties that lay before them and of the all but forlorn hope they had undertaken there need be little wonder that for some time they all looked rather grave and were disposed to silence  but life is made up of opposites light and shade hard and soft hot and cold sweet and sour for the purpose no doubt of placing man between two moral battledores so as to drive the weak and erring shuttlecock of his will right and left and thus keep it in the middle course of rectitude  no sooner had our adventurers sunk to the profoundest depths of gloom than the battledore of brighter influences began to play upon them  it did not however achieve the end at once  im in the lowest bluest dreariest grumpiest and most utterly miserable state of mind i ever was in in all my life said poor little benjy vane thrusting his hands into his pockets sitting down on a rock and gazing round on the waste wilderness which had only just ceased howling the very personification of despair  sos i massa said butterface looking up from a compound of wet coal and driftwood which he had been vainly trying to coax into a flame for cooking purposes is most orribly miserable  there was a beaming grin on the negros visage that gave the lie direct to his words  thats always the way with you benjy said the captain either bubblin over with jollity an mischief or down in the deepest blues  blues father cried the boy dont talk of bluesits the blacks im in the very blackest of blacks  ha jus like me muttered butterface sticking out his thick lips at the unwilling fire and giving a blow that any grampus might have envied  the result was that a column of almost solid smoke which had been for some time rising thicker and thicker from the coals burst into a bright flame  this was the first of the sweet influences before referred to  mind your wool flatnose cried benjy as the negro drew quickly back  it may be remarked here that the mysterious bond of sympathy which united the spirits of benjy vane and the black steward found expression in kindly respect on the part of the man and in various eccentric courses on the part of the boyamong others in a habit of patting him on the back and giving him a choice selection of impromptu names such as blackmug yelloweyes squarejaws and the like  what have you got in the kettle asked leo vandervell who came up with some dry driftwood at the moment  bubbleumsqueak replied the cook  what sort o squeak is that asked leo as he bent his tall strong frame over the fire to investigate the contents of the kettle  what am it massa  why it am a bit o salt pork an a bit o dat bear you shooted troo de nose yesrday an a junk o walrus an two puffins an some injin corn a leetil pepper an a leetil salt  good that sounds well said leo  ill go fetch you some more driftwood for itll take a deal of boiling that will to make it eatable  the driftwood referred to was merely some pieces of the yacht which had been cast ashore by the hurlyburly of ice and water that had occurred during the last tide  no other species of driftwood was to be found on that coast for the neighbouring region was utterly destitute of trees  where has alf gone to asked the captain as leo was moving away  oh hes looking for plants and shells as usual answered leo with a smile  you know his heart is set upon these things  hell have to set his heart on helping wi the cargo after supper said the captain drawing a small notebook and pencil from his pocket  a few more of the sweet and reviving influences of life now began to circle round the wanderers  among them was the savoury odour that arose from the pot of bubbleumsqueak also the improved appearance of the sky  it was night almost midnight nevertheless the sun was blazing in the heavens and as the stormclouds had rolled away like a dark curtain his cheering rays were by that time gilding the icebergs and rendering the landcliffs ruddily  the travellers had enjoyed perpetual daylight for several weeks already and at that high latitude they could count on many more to come  by the time supper was ready the depressing influences were gone and the spirits of all had recovered their wonted tone  indeed it was not to the discredit of the party that they were so much cast down on that occasion for the parting perhaps for ever from the friends with whom they had hitherto voyaged had much more to do with their sadness than surrounding circumstances or future trials  what plan do you intend to follow out uncle asked alphonse vandervell as they sat at supper that night round the kettle  that depends on many things lad replied the captain laying down his spoon and leaning his back against a convenient rock  if the ice moves off i shall adopt one course if it holds fast i shall try another  then if you insist on gathering and carrying along with you such pocketloads of specimens plants rocks etcetera as youve brought in this evening ill have to build a sort of noahs ark or omnibus on sledgerunners to carry them  and suppose i dont insist on carrying these things what then  well replied the captain in that case i wouldwell let me seea little more of the bubble benjy  wouldnt you rather some of the squeak asked the boy  both lad bothsome of everything  well as i was sayingand youve a right to know whats running in my head seeing that you have to help me carry out the plansill give you a rough notion of em  the captain became more serious as he explained his plans  the eskimos you know he continued have gone by what i may call the shore ice two days journey in advance of this spot taking our dogs along with them  it was my intention to have proceeded to the same point in our yacht and there if the sea was open to have taken on board that magnificent eskimo giant chingatok with his family and steered away due north  in the event of the pack being impassable i had intended to have laid the yacht up in some safe harbour hunted and fished until we had a stock of dried and salted provisions enough to last us two years and then to have started northward in sledges under the guidance of chingatok with a few picked men leaving the rest and the yacht in charge of the mate  the wreck of the whitebear has however forced me to modify these plans  i shall now secure as much of our cargo as we have been able to save and leave it here en cache  what sort of cash is that father asked benjy  you are the best linguist among us leo tell him said the captain turning to his nephew  en cache is french for in hiding returned leo with a laugh  why do you speak french to englishmen father said benjy in a pathetic tone but with a pert look  cause the expression is a common one on this side the atlantic lad and you ought to know it  now dont interrupt me again  well having placed the cargo in security en cache muttered benjy with a glance at butterface i shall rig up the sledges brought from england load them with what we require and follow up the eskimos  youre sure anders that you understood chingatoks description of the place  the interpreter declared that he was quite sure  after that resumed the captain ill act according to the information the said eskimos can give me  dye know i have a strong suspicion that our arctic giant chingatok is a philosopher if i may judge from one or two questions he put and observations he made when we first met  he says he has come from a fine country which lies farvery farto the north of this so far that i feel quite interested and hopeful about it  i expect to have more talk with him soon on the subject  a little more o the bubble lad really butterface your powers in the way of cookery are wonderful  chingatok seems to me quite a remarkable fellow for an eskimo observed leo scraping the bottom of the kettle with his spoon and looking inquiringly into it  i too had some talk with himthrough anderswhen we first met and from what he said i cant help thinking that he has come from the remote north solely on a voyage of discovery into what must be to him the unknown regions of the south  evidently he has an inquiring mind  much like yourself leo to judge from the way you peer into that kettle said benjy please dont scrape the bottom out of it  theres not much tin to mend it with you know in these regions  brass will do quite as well retorted leo and there can be no lack of that while you are here  come now benjy said alf that insolent remark should put you on your mettle  so it does but i wont open my lips because i feel that i should speak ironically if i were to reply returned the boy gazing dreamily into the quiet countenance of the steward  what are you thinking of you lump of charcoal  me massa me tink dere pears to be room for more wittles inside ob me but as all de grubs eated up praps it would be as well to be goin an tacklin suffin else now  youre right butterface cried the captain rousing himself from a reverie  what say you comrades  shall we turn in an have a nap its past midnight  im not inclined for sleep said alf looking up from some of the botanical specimens he had collected  no more am i said leo lifting up his arms and stretching his stalwart frame which notwithstanding his youth had already developed to almost the full proportions of a powerful man  i vote that we sit up all night said benjy the sun does it and why shouldnt we  well ive no objection rejoined the captain but we must work if we dont sleepso come along  setting the example captain vane began to shoulder the bags and boxes which lay scattered around with the energy of an enthusiastic railway porter  the other members of the party were not a whit behind him in diligence and energy  even benjy delicatelooking though he was did the work of an average man besides enlivening the proceedings with snatches of song and a flow of small talk of a humorous and slightly insolent nature    chapter six  future plans discussed and decided  away to the northward of the spot where the whitebear had been wrecked there stretched a point of land far out into the arctic ocean  it was about thirty miles distant and loomed hugely bluff and grand against the brilliant sky as if it were the forefront of the northern world no civilised eyes had ever beheld that land before  captain vane knew that because it lay in latitude 83 north which was a little beyond the furthest point yet reached by arctic navigators  he therefore named it cape newhope  benjy thought that it should have been named butterfacebeak because the steward had been the first to observe it but his father thought otherwise  about three miles to the northward of this point of land the eskimos were encamped  according to arrangement with the white men they had gone there as we have said in charge of the dogs brought by captain vane from upernavik as these animals it was thought stood much in need of exercise  here the natives had found and taken possession of a number of deserted eskimo huts  these rude buildings were the abodes to which the good people migrated when summer heat became so great as to render their snowhuts sloppily disagreeable  in one of the huts sat chingatok his arms resting on his knees his huge hands clasped and his intelligent eyes fixed dreamily on the lampflame over which his culinary mother was bending in busy sincerity  there were many points of character in which this remarkable mother and son resembled each other  both were earnestintensely so and each was enthusiastically eager about small matters as well as great  in short they both possessed great though uncultivated minds  the hut they occupied was in some respects as remarkable as themselves it measured about six feet in height and ten in diameter  the walls were made of flattish stones moss and the bones of seals whales narwhals and other arctic creatures  the stones were laid so that each overlapped the one below it a very little inwards and thus the walls approached each other gradually as they rose from the foundation the top being finally closed by slabs of slatestone  similar stones covered the floorone half of which floor was raised a foot or so above the other and this raised half served for a seat by day as well as a couch by night  on it were spread a thick layer of dried moss and several seal dog and bear skins  smaller elevations in the corners near the entrance served for seats  the door was a curtain of sealskin above it was a small window glazed so to speak with strips of semitransparent dried intestines sewed together  tooloohas cookinglamp was made of soapstone formed like a clamshell and about eight inches in diameter the fuel was sealoil and the wick was of moss  it smoked considerably but eskimos are smokeproof  the pot above it suspended from the roof was also made of soapstone sealskins hung about the walls drying oily mittens socks and boots were suspended about on pegs and racks of ribbones  lumps of blubber hung and lay about miscellaneously  odours not savoury were therefore prevalentbut eskimos are smellproof  mother said the giant raising his eyes from the flame to his parents smokeencircled visage they are a most wonderful people these kablunets  blackbeard is a great mana grand manbut i think he is  chingatok paused shook his head and touched his forehead with a look of significance worthy of a white man  why think you so my son asked the old woman sneezing as a denser cloud than usual went up her nose  because he has come here to search for nothing  nothing my son  yesat least that is what he tried to explain to me  perhaps the interpreter could not explain  he is not a smart man that interpreter he resembles a walrus with his brain scooped out  he spoke much but i could not understand  could not understand repeated toolooha with an incredulous look let not chingatok say so  is there anything that passes the lips of man which he cannot understand  truly mother i once thought there was not replied the giant with a modest look but i am mistaken  the kablunets make me stare and feel foolish  but it is not possible to search for nothing urged toolooha  so i said replied her son but blackbeard only laughed at me  did he cried the mother with a much relieved expression then let your mind rest my son for blackbeard must be a fool if he laughed at you  blackbeard is no fool replied chingatok  has he not come to search for new lands here as you went to search for them there asked toolooha pointing alternately north and south  noif i have understood him  perhaps the brainless walrus translated his words wrongly  is the thing he searches for something to eat  something to drink or wear  no i tell you  it is nothing  yet he gives it a name  he calls it nort pole  perhaps it is needless to remind the reader that chingatok and his mother conversed in their native tongue which we have rendered as literally as possible and that the last two words were his broken english for north pole  nort pole repeated toolooha once or twice contemplatively  well he may search for nothing if he will but that he cannot find  nay mother returned the giant with a soft smile if he will search for nothing he is sure to find it  chingatok sighed for his mother did not see the joke  blackbeard he continued with a grave puzzled manner said that this world on which we stand floats in the air like a bird and spins round  then blackbeard is a liar said toolooha quietly though without a thought of being rude  she merely meant what she said and said what she meant being a naturally candid woman  that may be so mother but i think not  how can the world float without wings demanded the old woman indignantly  if it spinned should we not feel the spinning and grow giddy  and blackbeard says continued the giant regardless of the questions propounded that it spins round upon this nort pole which he says is not a real thing but only nothing  i asked blackbeardhow can a world spin upon nothing  and what said he to that demanded toolooha quickly  he only laughed  they all laughed when the brainless walrus put my question  there is one little boythe son i think of blackbeardwho laughed more than all the rest  he lay down on the ice to laugh and rolled about as if he had the boweltwist  that son of blackbeard must be a fool more than his father said toolooha casting a look of indignation at her innocent kettle  perhaps but he is not like his father returned chingatok meekly there are two other chiefs among the kablunets who seem to me fine men they are very young and wise  they have learned a little of our tongue from the brainless one and asked me some questions about the rocks and the moss and the flowers  they are tall and strong  one of them is very grave and seems to think much like myself  he also spoke of this nothingthis nort pole  they are all mad i think about that thing that nothing  the conversation was interrupted at this point by the sudden entrance of the giants little sister with the news that the kablunets were observed coming round the great cape dragging a sledge  is not the big oomiak with them asked her brother rising quickly  no we see no oomiakno wingsno fire answered oblooria only six men dragging a sledge  chingatok went out immediately and oblooria was about to follow when her mother recalled her  come here little one  there is a bit of blubber for you to suck tell me saw you any sign of madness in these white men when they were talking with your brother about thisthisnort pole  no mother no answered oblooria thoughtfully i saw not madness they laughed much it is truebut not more than oolichuk laughs sometimes  yesi think again  there was one who seems madthe small boy whom brother thinks to be the son of blackbeardbenjay they call him  hah  i thought so exclaimed toolooha evidently pleased at her penetration on this point  go child i cannot quit the lamp  bring me news of what they say and do  oblooria obeyed with alacrity bolting her strip of halfcooked blubber as she ran her mother meanwhile gave her undivided attention to the duties of the lamp  the white men and all the members of the eskimo band were standing by the sledge engaged in earnest conversation when the little girl came forward  captain vane was speaking  yes chingatok he said looking up at the tall savage who stood erect in frame but with bent head and his hands clasped before him like a modest chief which in truth he was  yes if you will guide me to your home in the northern lands i will pay you wellfor i have much iron and wood and such things as i think you wish for and value and you shall also have my best thanks and gratitude  the latter may not indeed be worth much but nevertheless you could not purchase it with all the wealth of the polar regions  chingatok looked with penetrating gaze at anders while he translated and considering the nature of the communication the socalled brainless one proved himself a better man than the giant gave him credit for  does blackbeard asked chingatok after a few seconds thought expect to find this nothingthis nort pole in my country  well i cannot exactly say that i do replied the captain you see im not quite sure from what you tell me where your country is  it may not reach to the pole but it is enough for me that it lies in that direction and that you tell me there is much open water there  men of my nation have been in these regions before now and some of them have said that the polar sea is open others that it is covered always with ice so thick that it never melts  some have said it is a sea of ancient ice so rough that no man can travel over it and that it is not possible to reach the north pole  i dont agree with that  i had been led to expect to fall in with this sea of ancient ice before i had got thus far but it is not to be found  the sea indeed is partly blocked with ordinary ice but there is nothing to be seen of this vast collection of mighty blocks some of them thirty feet highthis wild chaos of ice which so effectually stopped some of those who went before me  this speech put such brains as the brainless one possessed to a severe test and after all he failed to convey its full meaning to chingatok who however promptly replied to such portions as he understood  what blackbeard calls the sea of old ice does exist he said i have seen it  no man could travel on it only the birds can cross it  but ice is not land  it changes place  it is here today it is there tomorrow  next day it is gone  we cannot tell where it goes to or when it will come back  the very old ice comes back again and again it is slow to become like your nort polenothing  but it melts at last and more comes in its placegrowing old slowly and vanishing slowly it is full of wonderlike the stars like the jumping flames like the sun and moon which we cannot understand  chingatok paused and looked upwards with a solemn expression  his mind had wandered into its favourite channels and for the moment he forgot the main subject of conversation while the white men regarded him with some surprise his comrades with feelings of interest not unmingled with awe  but he continued i know where the sea of ancient iceblocks is just now  i came past it in my kayak and can guide you to it by the same way  that is just what i want chingatok said the captain with a joyful look only aid me in this matter and i will reward you well  ive already told you that my ship is wrecked and that the crew except those you see here have left me but i have saved all the cargo and buried it in a place of security with the exception of those things which i need for my expedition  one half of these things are on this sledgethe other half on a sledge left behind and ready packed near the wreck  now i want you to send men to fetch that sledge here  that shall be done said chingatok  thanks thanks my good fellow returned the captain and we must set about it at once for the summer is advancing and you know as well as i do that the hot season is but a short one in these regions  a moment more shall not be lost said the giant  he turned to oolichuk who had been leaning on a short spear and gazing openmouthed eyed and eared during the foregoing conversation and said a few words to him and to the other eskimos in a low tone  oolichuk merely nodded his head said yah or something similarly significant shouldered his spear and went off in the direction of the cape of newhope followed by nearly all the men of the party  stay not quite so fast cried captain vane  stop shouted chingatok  oolichuk and his men paused  one of us had better go with them said the captain to show the place where the sledge has been left  i will go uncle if youll allow me said leo vandervell  oh let me go too father pleaded benjy im not a bit tired do  you may both go  take a rifle with you leo  theres no saying what you may meet on the way  in halfanhour the party under oolichuk had reached the extremity of the cape and captain vane observed that his volatile son mounted to the top of an iceblock to wave a farewell  he looked like a black speck or a crow in the far distance  another moment and the speck had disappeared among the hummocks of the icelocked sea    chapter seven  difficulties encountered and faced  they had not quite doubled the cape of newhope and were about to round the point which concealed the spot that had been named wreck bay when they suddenly found themselves face to face with a polar bear  bruin was evidently out for an evening stroll for he seemed to have nothing particular to do  surprise lit up alike the countenances of the men and the visage of the bear  it was an unexpected meeting on both sides  the distance between them was not more than thirty feet  leo was the only one of the party who carried a rifle  more than once during the voyage had leo seen and shot a bear  the sight was not new to him but never before had he come so suddenly or so very close upon this king of the arctic seas  he chanced at the time to be walking a few yards in advance of the party in company with oolichuk and benjy  the three stopped stared and stood as if petrified  for one moment then they uttered a united and half involuntary roar  right royally did that bear accept the challenge  it rose according to custom on its hind legs and immediately began that slow but deadly wardance with which the race is wont to preface an attack while its upper lip curled in apparent derision exposing its terrible fangs  leo recovered selfpossession instantly  the rifle leaped to his shoulder the centre of the bears breast was covered and the trigger pulled  only a snap resulted  leo had forgotten to load  benjy gasped with anxiety  oolichuk who had held himself back with a sparkling smile of expectation at the prospect of seeing the kablunet use his thunderweapon looked surprised and disappointed but went into action promptly with his spear accompanied by akeetolik  leos rifle being a breechloader was quickly recharged but as the rest of the party stood leaning on their spears with the evident intention of merely watching the combat the youth resolved to hold his hand despite benjys earnest recommendation to put one ball between the bears eyes and the other into his stomach  it was but a brief though decisive battle  those eskimos were well used to such warfare  running towards the animal with levelled spears the two men separated on coming close so that bruin was forced to a state of indecision as to which enemy he would assail first  akeetolik settled the point for him by giving him a prick on the right side thus as it were drawing the enemys fire on himself  the bear turned towards him with a fierce growl and in so doing exposed his left side to attack  oolichuk was not slow to seize the opportunity  he leaped close up and drove his spear deep into the animals heartkilling it on the spot  next day the party returned to the eskimo camp with the sledgeload of goods and the bear on the top  while steaks of the same were being prepared by toolooha captain vane and his new allies were busy discussing the details of the advance  i know that the difficulties will be great he said in reply to a remark from the interpreter but i mean to face and overcome them  ah exclaimed alf who was rather fond of poetry    to dare unknown dangers in a noble cause   despite an adverse nature and her tiresome laws  just so alf my boy stick at nothing never give in victory or death thats my way of expressing the same sentiment  but theres one thing that i must impress once more upon you allnamely that each man must reduce his kit to the very lowest point of size and weight  no extras allowed  what not even a box of paper collars asked benjy  not one my boy but you may take a straitwaistcoat in your box if you choose for youll be sure to need it  oh father returned the boy remonstratively you are severe however i will take one if you agree to leave your woollen comforter behind  you wont need that you see as long as i am with you  of course said alf you will allow us to carry small libraries with us  certainly not my lad only one book each and that must be a small one  the only book i possess is my bible said leo and that wont take up much room for its an uncommonly small one  if i only had my robinson crusoe here cried benjy id take it for theres enough of adventure in that book to carry a man over half the world  ay said alf and enough of mind to carry him over the other half for my part if we must be content with one book each i shall take buzzbys poems  oh horrible cried benjy why hes no better than a maudlin dawdlin drawlin caterwaulin  come benjy dont be insolent hes second only to tennyson  just listen to this morceau by buzzby  it is an ode to courage    high hot hillarious compound of  stop stop man dont begin when were in the middle of our plans interrupted benjy let us hear what book butterface means to take  i not take no book massa only take my flute  music is wots de matter wid me  dat is de ting what hab charms to soove de savage beast  i wouldnt advise you try to soothe a polar bear with it said leo unless you have a rifle handy  yesand especially an unloaded one which is very effective against polar bears put in the captain with a sly look  ah leo i could hardly have believed it of youand you the sportsman of our party too our chief huntsman  oh fie  come uncle dont be too hard on that little mistake said leo with a slight blush for he was really annoyed by the unsportsmanlike oversight hinted at but pray may i ask he added turning sharply on the captain what is inside of these three enormous boxes of yours which take up so much space on the sledges  you may ask leo but you may not expect an answer  that is my secret and i mean to keep it as a sort of stimulus to your spirits when the hardships of the way begin to tell on you  ask chingatok anders continued the captain turning to the interpreter if he thinks we have enough provisions collected for the journey  i wish to start immediately  we have enough answered chingatok who had been sitting a silent but deeply interested observerso to speakof the foregoing conversation  tell him then to arrange with his party and be prepared to set out by noon tomorrow  that night by the light of the midnight sun the eskimos sat round their kettles of bearchops and went into the pros and cons of the proposed expedition  some were enthusiastically in favour of casting in their lot with the white men others were decidedly against it and a few were undecided  among the latter was akeetolik  these ignorant men said that bold savage are foolish and useless they cannot kill bears  the one named lo thus was leonards name reduced to its lowest denomination is big enough and looks very fine but when he sees bear he only stares makes a little click with his thunderweapon and looks stupid  blackbeard explained that said oolichuk lo made some mistake  that may be so retorted akeetolik but if you and me had not been there the bear would not make a mistake  i will not go with these kablunets said eemerk with a frown they are only savages  they are not taught  no doubt they had a wonderful boat but they have not been able to keep their boat  they cannot kill bears perhaps they cannot kill seals or walruses and they ask us to help them to travelto show them the way  they can do nothing  they must be led like children  my advice is to kill them all since they are so useless and take their goods  this speech was received with marks of decided approval by those of the party who were in the habit of siding with eemerk but the rest were silent  in a few moments chingatok said in a low quiet but impressive tone the kablunets are not foolish or ignorant  they are wisefar beyond the wisdom of the eskimos  it is eemerk who is like a walrus without brains  he thinks that his little mind is outside of everything and so he has not eyes to perceive that he is ignorant as well as foolish and that other men are wise  this was the severest rebuke that the goodnatured chingatok had yet administered to eemerk but the latter foolish though he was had wisdom enough not to resent it openly  he sat in moody silence with his eyes fixed on the ground  of course oolichuk was decidedly in favour of joining the white men and so was ivitchuk who soon brought round his hesitating friend akeetolik and several of the others  oblooria being timid would gladly have sided with eemerk but she hated the man and besides would in any case have cast in her lot with her mother and brother even if free to do otherwise  the fair tekkona whose courage and faith were naturally strong had only one idea and that was to follow cheerfully wherever chingatok led but she was very modest and gave no opinion  she merely remarked the kablunets are handsome men and seem good  as for toolooha she had enough to do to attend to the serious duties of the lamp and always left the settlement of less important matters to the men  you and yours are free to do what you please said chingatok to eemerk when the discussion drew to a close  i go with the white men tomorrow  what says oblooria whispered oolichuk when the rest of the party were listening to eemerks reply  oblooria goes with her brother and mother answered that young lady toying coquettishly with her sealskin tail  oolichuks goodhumoured visage beamed with satisfaction and his flat nose curled upas much as it was possible for such a feature to curl with contempt as he glanced at eemerk and said  i have heard many tales from andersthe white mans mouthpiecesince we met  he tells me the white men are very brave and fond of running into danger for nothing but fun  those who do not like the fun of danger should join eemerk  those who are fond of fun and danger should come with our great chief chingatokhuk  let us divide  without more palaver the band divided and it was found that only eight sided with eemerk  all the rest cast in their lot with our giant after which this arctic house of commons adjourned and its members went to rest  a few days after that captain vane and his eskimo allies having left the camp with eemerk and his friends far behind them came suddenly one fine morning on a barrier which threatened effectually to arrest their further progress northward  this was nothing less than that tremendous sea of ancient ice which had baffled previous navigators and sledging parties  chaos absolute chaos exclaimed alf vandervell who was first to recover from the shock of surprise not to say consternation with which the party beheld the scene on turning a high cape  it looks bad said captain vane gravely but things often look worse at a first glance than they really are  i hope it may be so in this case said leo in a low tone  goodbye to the north pole said benjy with a look of despondency so deep that the rest of the party laughed in spite of themselves  the truth was that poor benjy had suffered much during the sledge journey which they had begun for although he rode like the rest of them on one of the eskimo sledges the ice over which they had travelled along shore had been sufficiently rugged to necessitate constant getting off and on as well as much scrambling over hummocks and broken ice  we have already said that benjy was not very robust though courageous and full of spirit so that he was prone to leap from the deepest depths of despair to the highest heights of hope at a moments noticeor vice versa  not having become inured to icetravel he was naturally much cast down when the chaos abovementioned met his gaze  strange said the captain after a long silent look at the barrier strange that we should find it here  the experience of former travellers placed it considerably to the south and west of this  but you know said leo chingatok told us that the old ice drifts about just as the more recently formed does  who knows but we may find the end of it not far off and perhaps may reach open water beyond where we can make skin canoes and launch forth on a voyage of discovery  i vote that we climb the cliffs and try to see over the top of this horrid icejumble said benjy  not a bad suggestion lad  let us do so  we will encamp here anders let all the people have a good feed and tell chingatok to follow us you will come along with him  a few hours later and the captain leo alf benjy chingatok and the interpreter stood on the extreme summit of the promontory which they had named cape chaos and from which they had a splendid birdseye view of the whole region  it was indeed a tremendous and nevertobeforgotten scene  as far as the eye could reach the ocean was covered with ice heaped together in some places in the wildest confusion and so firmly wedged in appearance that it seemed as if it had lain there in a solid mass from the first day of creation  elsewhere the ice was more level and less compact  in the midst of this rugged scene hundreds of giant icebergs rose conspicuously above the rest towering upwards in every shape and of all sizes from which the bright sun was flashed back in rich variety of form from the sharp gleam that trickled down an edge of ice to the refulgent blaze on a glassy face which almost rivalled the sun himself in brilliancy  these icebergs extending as they did to the horizon where they mingled with and were lost in the pearlgrey sky gave an impression of vast illimitable perspective  although no sign of an open sea was at first observed there was no lack of water to enliven the scene for here and there and everywhere were pools and ponds and even lakes of goodly size which had been formed on the surface by the melting ice  in these the picturesque masses were faithfully reflected and over them vast flocks of gulls eiderducks puffins and other wildfowl of the north disported themselves in garrulous felicity  on the edge of the rocky precipice from which they had a birdseye view of the scene our discoverers stood silent for some time absorbed in contemplation with feelings of mingled awe and wonder  then exclamations of surprise and admiration broke forth  the wonderful works of god said the captain in a tone of profound reverence  beautiful beyond belief murmured alf  but it seems an effectual check to our advance said the practical leo who however was by no means insensible to the extreme beauty of the scene  not effectual lad not effectual returned the captain stretching out his hand and turning to the interpreter look anders dye see nothing on the horizon away to the norard  isnt that a bit of watersky over there  ya replied the interpreter gazing intently there be wattersky over there  ya  but not possobubble for go there  ice too big an brokkin up  ask chingatok what he thinks returned the captain  chingatoks opinion was that the watersky indicated the open sea  he knew that sea wellhad often paddled over it and his own country lay in it  but how ever did he cross that ice asked the captain what says he to that anders  i did not cross it answered the eskimo through anders  when i came here with my party the ice was not there it was far off yonder  he pointed to the eastward  just so returned the captain with a satisfied nod that confirms my opinion  you see boys that the coast here trends off to the eastard in a very decided manner  now if that was only the shore of a bay and the land again ran off to the norard it would not be possible for such a sea of ice to have come from that direction  i therefore conclude that we are standing on the most northern cape of greenland that greenland itself is a huge island unconnected with the polar lands that we are now on the shores of the great polar basin in which somewhere not very far from the pole itself lies the home of our friend chingatokat least so i judge from what he has said  moreover i feel sure that the watersky we see over there indicates the commencement of that open sea which i hold in common with many learned men lies around the north pole and which i am determined to float upon before many days go by  wed better spread our wings then father and be off at once said benjy for its quite certain that well never manage to scramble over that icejumble with sledges  nevertheless i will try benjy  but how uncle asked leo  ay how repeated alf that is the question  come come alf let shakespeare alone said the pert benjy if you must quote confine yourself to buzzby  nay benjy be not so severe  it was but a slip  besides our leader has not forbidden our carrying a whole library in our heads so long as we take only one book in our pockets  but uncle you have not yet told us how you intend to cross that amazing barrier which benjy has appropriately styled an icejumble  how boy returned the captain who had been gazing eagerly in all directions while they talked it is impossible for me to say how  all that i can speak of with certainty as to our future movements is that the road by which we have come to the top of this cliff will lead us to the bottom again where toolooha is preparing for us an excellent supper of bearsteaks and tea  one step at a time lads is my motto when that is taken we shall see clearly how and where to take the next  a sound sleep was the step which the whole party took after that which led to the bearsteaks  then captain vane arose ordered the dogs to be harnessed to the sledges and laying his course due north steered straight out upon the sea of ancient ice    chapter eight  difficulties and dangers increase and the captain expounds his views  the first part of the journey over the rugged ice was not so difficult as had been anticipated because they found a number of openingsnarrow lanes as it werewinding between the masses most of which were wide enough to permit of the passage of the sledges and when they chanced to come on a gap that was too narrow they easily widened it with their hatchets and icechisels  there was however some danger connected with this process for some of the mighty blocks of ice amongst which they moved were piled in such positions that it only required a few choppings at their base to bring them down in ruins on their heads  one instance of this kind sufficed to warn them effectually  captain vanes dogsledge was leading the way at the time  leo drove it for by that time the eskimos had taught him how to use the shorthandled whip with the lash full fifteen feet long and leo was an apt pupil in every athletic and manly exercise  beside him sat the captain alf benjy and butterfacethe black visage of the latter absolutely shining with delight at the novelty of the situation  behind came the sledge of chingatok which besides being laden with bearrugs sealskins junks of meat and a host of indescribable eskimo implements carried himself and the precious persons of toolooha and tekkona  next came the sledge of the laughterloving oolichuk with the timid oblooria and another woman  then followed the sledges of ivitchuk and akeetolik laden with the rest of the eskimo women and goods and last of all came captain vanes two englishmade sledges heavilyladen with the goods and provisions of the explorers  these latter sledges although made in england had been constructed on the principle of the native sledge namely with the parts fastened by means of walrussinew lashings instead of nails which last would have snapped like glass in the winter frosts of the polar regions besides being incapable of standing the twistings and shocks of icetravel  all the dogs being fresh and the floor of the lanes not too rough the strangelyassorted party trotted merrily along causing the echoes among the great iceblocks spires and obelisks to ring to the music of their chatting and the cracks of their powerful whips  suddenly a shout at the front and an abrupt pull up brought the whole column to a halt  the captains dogs had broken into a gallop  on turning suddenly round a spur of a glacier about as big as saint pauls cathedral they went swish into a shallow pond which had been formed on the ice  it was not deep but there was sufficient water in it to send a deluge of spray over the travellers  a burst of laughter greeted the incident as they sprang off the sledge and waded to the dry ice a few yards ahead  no damage done exclaimed the captain as he assisted the dogs to haul the sledge out of the water  no damage repeated benjy with a rueful look why im soaked from top to toe  yes youve got the worst of it said leo with a laugh that comes of being forward benjy  you would insist on sitting in front  well it is some comfort retorted benjy squeezing the water from his garments that alf is as wet as myself for that gives us an opportunity of sympathising with each other  eh alf  does buzzby offer no consolatory remarks for such an occasion as this  o yes replied alf in his beautiful poem on melancholy sixth canto buzzby says    when trouble like a curtain spread   obscures the clouded brain   and worries on the weary head   descend like soaking rain   lift up thumbrella of the heart   stride manfully along   defy depressions dreary dart   and shout in gleeful song  come alf clap on to this towrope an stop your nonsense said captain vane who was not in a poetical frame of mind just then  dat is mos boosiful potry exclaimed butterface with an immense display of eyes and teeth as he lent a willing hand to haul out the sledge  mos boosiful  but hes rader a strong remdy massa don you tink  not bery easy to git up a gleefoo shout when ones down in de mout bery bad eh  alfs reply was checked by the necessity for remounting the sledge and resuming the journey  those in rear avoided the pond by going round it  the weathers warm anyhow and thats a comfort remarked benjy as he settled down in his wet garments  we cant freeze in summer you know and  he stopped abruptly for it became apparent just then that the opening close ahead of them was too narrow for the sledge to pass  it was narrowed by a buttress or projection of the cathedralberg which jutted up close to a vast obelisk of ice about forty feet high if not higher  nothing for it boys but to cut through said the captain jumping out and seizing an axe as the sledge was jammed between the masses the dogs lay down to rest and pant while the men were at work  its cut an come again in dem regins muttered the negro steward also seizing an axe and attacking the base of the obelisk  a sudden cry of alarm from the whole party caused him to desist and look up  he echoed the cry and sprang back swiftly for the huge mass of ice having been just on the balance one slash at its base had destroyed the equilibrium and it was leaning slowly over with a deep grinding sound a moment later the motion was swift and it fell with a terrible crash bursting into a thousand fragments scattering lumps and glittering morsels far and wide and causing the whole icefield to tremble  the concussion overturned several other masses which had been in the same nicelybalanced condition some near at hand others out of sight though within earshot and for a moment the travellers felt as if the surrounding pack were disrupting everywhere and falling into utter ruin but in a few seconds the sounds ceased and again all was quiet  fortunately the obelisk which had been overturned fell towards the northaway from the party but although it thus narrowly missed crushing them all in one icy tomb it blocked up their path so completely that the remainder of that day had to be spent in cutting a passage through it  need we say that after this they were careful how they used their axes and icechisels  soon after the occurrence of this incident the labyrinths among the ice became more broken tortuous and bewildering  at last they ceased altogether and the travellers were compelled to take an almost straight course right over everything for blocks masses and drifts on a gigantic scale were heaved up in such dire confusion that nothing having the faintest resemblance to a track or passage could be found  its hard work this remarked the captain to leo one evening seating himself on a mass of ice which he had just chopped from an obstruction and wiping the perspiration from his brow  hard indeed said leo sitting down beside him i fear it begins to tell upon poor benjy  you should really order him to rest more than he does uncle  a grim smile of satisfaction played for a minute on the captains rugged face as he glanced at his son who a short distance ahead was hacking at the ice with a pickaxe in company with alf and butterface and the eskimo men  itll do him good lad replied the captain  hard work is just what my benjy needs  hes not very stout to be sure but there is nothing wrong with his constitution and hes got plenty of spirit  this was indeed true  benjy had too much spirit for his somewhat slender frame but his father being a herculean man did not quite perceive that what was good for himself might be too much for his son captain vane was however the reverse of a harsh man  he pondered what leo had said and soon afterwards went up to his son  benjy my lad  yes father said the boy dropping the head of his pickaxe on the ice resting his hands on the haft and looking up with a flushed countenance  you should rest a bit now and then benjy  youll knock yourself up if you dont  rest a bit father  why ive just had a rest and im not tiredthat is not very  aint it fun father  and the ice cuts up so easily and flies about so splendidlysee here  with flashing eyes our little hero raised his pick and drove it into the ice at which he had been working with all his force so that a great rent was made and a mass the size of a dressingtable sprang from the side of a berg and falling down burst into a shower of sparkling gems  but this was not all  to benjys intense delight a mass of many tons in weight was loosened by the fall of the smaller lump and rolled down with a thunderous roar causing butterface who was too near it to jump out of the way with an amount of agility that threw the whole party into fits of laughter  what dye think o that father  i think its somewhat dangerous answered the captain recovering his gravity and reshouldering his axe  however as long as you enjoy the work it cant hurt you so go ahead my boy itll be a long time before you cut away too much o the polar ice  reaching a slightly open space beyond this point the dogs were harnessed and the party advanced for a mile or so when they came to another obstruction worse than that which they had previously passed  theres a deal of icerubbish in these regions remarked benjy eyeing the wildly heaped masses with a grave face and heaving a deep sigh  yes massa benjy bery too much altogidder said butterface echoing the sigh  come we wont cut through this cried captain vane in a cheery voice well try to go over it  there is a considerable drift of old snow that seems to offer a sort of track  what says chingatok  the easygoing eskimo said that it would be as well to go over it as through it perhaps better  so over it they went but they soon began to wish they had tried any other plan for the snowtrack quickly came to an end and then the difficulty of passing even the empty sledges from one ice mass to another was very great while the process of carrying forward the goods on the shoulders of the men was exceedingly laborious  the poor dogs too were constantly falling between masses and dragging each other down so that they gave more trouble at last than they were worth  in all these trying circumstances the eskimo women were almost as useful as the men  indeed they would have been quite as useful if they had been as strong and they bore the fatigues and trials of the journey with the placid good humour and apparent if not real humility of their race  at last one afternoon our discoverers came suddenly to the edge of this great barrier of ancient ice and beheld from an elevated plateau to which they had climbed a scene which was calculated to rouse in their breasts feelings at once of admiration and despair for there stretching away below them for several miles lay a sea of comparatively level ice and beyond it a chain of stupendous glaciers which presented an apparently impassable barriera huge continuous wall of ice that seemed to rise into the very sky  this chain bore all the evidences of being very old icecompared to which that of the socalled ancient sea was absolutely juvenile  on the iceplain which was apparently illimitable to the right and left were hundreds of pools of water in which the icebergs the golden clouds the sun and the blue sky were reflected and on the surface of which myriads of arctic wildfowl were sporting about making the air vocal with their plaintive cries and ruffling the glassy surfaces of the lakes with their dipping wings  the heads of seals were also observed here and there  these will stop us at last said alf pointing to the bergs with a profound sigh  no they wont remarked the captain quietly  nothing will stop us  thats true anyhow uncle returned alf for if it be as chingatok thinks that we are in search of nothing of course when we find nothing nothing will stop us  why alf said leo i wonder that you who are usually in an enthusiastic and poetical frame of mind should be depressed by distant difficulties instead of admiring such a splendid sight of birds and beasts enjoying themselves in what i may style an arctic heaven  you should take example by benjy  that youth did indeed afford a bright example of rapt enthusiasm just then for standing a little apart by himself he gazed at the scene with flushed face open mouth and glittering eyes in speechless delight  ask chingatok if he ever saw this range before said the captain to anders on recovering from his first feeling of surprise  no chingatok had never seen it except indeed the tops of the bergs at sea in the far distancebut he had often heard of it from some of his countrymen who like himself were fond of exploring  but that sea of ice was not there he said when he had passed on his journey southward  it had drifted there since that time from the great sea  ah the great sea that he speaks of is just what we must find and cross over muttered the captain to himself  but how are we to cross over it uncle asked leo  the captain replied with one of his quiet glances  his followers had long become accustomed to this silent method of declining to reply and forbore to press the subject  come now boys get ready to descend to the plain  well have to do it with caution  there was indeed ground for caution  we have said that they had climbed to an elevated plateau on one of the small bergs which formed the outside margin of the rugged ice  the side of this berg was a steep slope of hard snow so steep that they thought it unwise to attempt the descent by what in switzerland is termed glissading  well have to zigzag down i think continued the captain settling himself on his sledge but the captains dogs thought otherwise  under a sudden impulse of reckless freewill the whole team giving vent to a howl of mingled glee and fear dashed down the slope at full gallop  of course they were overtaken in a few seconds by the sledge which not only ran into them but sent them sprawling on their backs right and left  then it met a slight obstruction and itself upset sending captain vane and his companions with its other contents into the midst of the struggling dogs  with momentarily increasing speed this avalanche of mixed dead and living matter went sliding hurtling swinging shouting struggling and yelling to the bottom  fortunately there was no obstruction there else had destruction been inevitable the slope merged gradually into the level plain over which the avalanche swept for a considerable distance before the momentum of their flight was expended  when at length they stopped and disentangled themselves from the knot into which the traces had tied them it was found that no one was materially hurt  looking up at the height down which they had come they beheld the eskimos standing at the top with outstretched arms in the attitude of men who glare in speechless horror  but these did not stand thus long  descending by a more circuitous route they soon rejoined the captains party and then as the night was far advanced they encamped on the edge of the iceplain on a part that was bathed in the beams of the evercircling sun  that night at supper captain vane was unusually thoughtful and silent  youre not losing heart are you uncle asked leo during a pause  no lad certainly not replied the captain dreamily  youve not been bumped very badly in the tumble father have you asked benjy with an anxious look  bumped no what makes you think so  because youre gazing at tooloohas lamp as if you saw a ghost in it  well perhaps i do see a ghost there returned the captain with an effort to rouse his attention to things going on around him  i see the ghost of things to come  i am looking through tooloohas lamp into futurity  and what does futurity look like asked alf  bright or dark  blackblack as me muttered butterface as he approached and laid fresh viands before the party  it ought to be told that butterface had suffered rather severely in the recent glissade on the snowslope which will account for the gloomy view he took of the future at that time  listen said the captain with a look of sudden earnestness as it is highly probable that a day or two more will decide the question of our success or failure i think it right to reveal to you more fully my thoughts my plans and the prospects that lie before us  you all know very well that there is much difference of opinion about the condition of the sea around the north pole  some think it must be cumbered with eternal ice others that it is comparatively free from ice and that it enjoys a somewhat milder climate than those parts of the arctic regions with which we have hitherto been doing battle  i hold entirely with the latter viewwith those who believe in an open polar basin  i wont weary you with the grounds of my belief in detail but here are a few of my reasons  it is an admitted fact that there is constant circulation of the water in the ocean  that wise and painstaking philosopher maury of the us navy has proved to my mind that this grand circulation of the seawater round the world is the cause of all the oceanic streams hot and cold with which we have been so long acquainted  this circulation is a necessity as well as a fact  at the equator the water is extremely warm and salt besides limeladen in consequence of excessive evaporation  at the poles it is extremely cold and fresh mixing is therefore a necessity  the hot saltwaters of the equator flow to the poles to get freshened and cooled  those of the poles flow to the equator to get salted limed and warmed  they do this continuously in two grand currents north and south all round the world  but the land comes in as a disturbing element it diverts the water into streams variously modified in force and direction and the streams also change places variously sometimes the hot currents travelling north as undercurrents with the cold currents above sometimes the reverse  one branch of the current comes from the equator round the cape of good hope turns up the west coast of africa and is deflected into the gulf of mexico round which it sweeps and then shoots across the atlantic to england and norway  it is known as our gulf stream  now the equatorial warm and salt current enters baffins bay as a submarine current while the cold and comparatively fresh waters of the polar regions descend as a surfacecurrent bearing the great icefields of the arctic seas to the southward  one thing that goes far to prove this is the fact that the enormous icebergs thrown off from the northern glaciers have been frequently seen by navigators travelling northward right against the current flowing south  these huge icemountains floating as they do with seven or eight parts of their bulk beneath the surface are carried thus forcibly up stream by the undercurrent until their bases are worn off by the warm waters below thus allowing the upper current to gain the mastery and hurry them south again to their final dissolution in the atlantic  now lads continued the captain with the air of a man who propounds a selfevident proposition is it not clear that if the warm waters of the south flow into the polar basin as an under current they must come up somewhere to take the place of the cold waters that are for ever flowing away from the pole to the equator  can anything be clearer than thatexcept the nose on benjys face  well then that being so the waters round the pole must be comparatively warm waters and also comparatively free from ice so that if we could only manage to cross this icebarrier and get into them we might sail right away to the north pole  but father said benjy since you have taken the liberty to trifle with my nose i feel entitled to remark that we cant sail in waters either hot or cold without a ship  thats true boy rejoined the captain  however he added with a halfhumorous curl of his black moustache you know im not given to stick at trifles  time will show  meanwhile i am strongly of opinion that this is the last icebarrier we shall meet with on our way to the pole  is there not some tradition of a mild climate in the furthest north among the eskimos asked alf  of course there is  it has long been known that the greenland eskimos have a tradition of an island in an iceless sea lying away in the far north where there are many muskoxen and from what i have been told by our friend chingatok i am disposed to think that he and his kindred inhabit this island or group of islands in the polar basinnot far perhaps from the pole itself  he says there are muskoxen there  but there is another creature and a much bigger one than any eskimo bigger even than chingatok who bears his testimony to an open polar sea namely the greenland whale  it has been ascertained that the right whale does not and cannot enter the tropical regions of the ocean they are to him as a sea of fire a wall of adamant so that it is impossible for him to swim south double cape horn and proceed to the north pacific yet the very same kind of whale found in baffins bay is found at behring straits  now the question is how did he get there  was born there no doubt answered benjy and had no occasion to make such a long voyage  ah my boy but we have the strongest evidence that he was not born there for you must know that some whalers have a habit of marking their harpoons with date and name of ship and as we have been told by that good and true man dr scoresby there have been several instances where whales have been captured near behring straits with harpoons in them bearing the stamp of ships that were known to cruise on the baffins bay side of america  moreover in one or two instances a very short time had elapsed between the date of harpooning on the atlantic and capturing on the pacific side  these facts prove at all events a northwest passage for whales and as whales cannot travel far under ice without breathing they also tend to prove an open polar sea  another argument in favour of this basin is the migration of birds to the northward at certain seasons  birds do not migrate to frozen regions and such migrations northward have been observed by those who like ourselves have reached the highest latitudes  captain nares of the alert in may 1876 when only a little to the southward of this saw ptarmigan flying in pairs to the northwest seeking for better feedinggrounds  ducks and geese also passed northward early in june indicating plainly the existence of suitable feedinggrounds in the undiscovered and mysterious north  we have now passed beyond the point reached by captain nares  my last observation placed us in parallel 84 degrees 40 minutes the highest that has yet been reached by civilised man  the highest uncle interrupted leo  yesthe highest  scoresby reached 81 degrees 50 minutes in 1806 parry 82 degrees 45 minutes in 1827with sledges  that unfortunate and heroic american captain hall ran his vessel the polaris in the shortest space of time on record up to latitude 82 degrees 16 minutes  captain nares reached a higher latitude than had previously been attained by ships and captain markham of captain nares expedition travelled over this very sea of ancient ice with sledges to latitude 83 degrees 204 minutesabout 400 miles from the pole and the highest yet reached as i have said  so you see we have beaten them all  moreover i strongly incline to the belief that the open polar sea lies just beyond that range of huge icebergs which we see before us  the captain rose as he spoke and pointed to the gigantic chain behind one of which the sun was just about to dip causing its jagged peaks to glow as with intense fire  but how are we ever to pass that barrier uncle asked alf who was by nature the least sanguine of the party in regard to overcoming difficulties of a geographical nature although by far the most enthusiastic in the effort to acquire knowledge  you shall see tomorrow answered the captain at present we must turn in and rest  see the eskimos have already set us the example    chapter nine  the captain makes a stupendous effort  disappointments and discoveries  next morning the iceplain was crossed at a swinging gallop  indeed the dogs were so fresh and frisky after a good rest and a hearty meal that they ran away more than once and it became a matter of extreme difficulty to check them  at last the great chain was reached and the party came to an abrupt halt at the base of one of the largest of the bergs  captain vane gazed up at it as napoleon the first may be supposed to have gazed at the alps he had resolved to scale and cross  the resemblance to alpine scenery was not confined to mere formsuch as towering peaks and mighty precipicesfor there were lakelets and ponds here and there up among the crystal heights from which rivulets trickled streams brawled and cataracts thundered  it was evident however that the old giant that frowned on them was verging towards dissolution for he was honeycombed in all directions  impossible to scale that said alf with a solemn look  even leos sanguine temperament was dashed for a moment  we dare not attempt to cut through it he said for masses are falling about here and there in a very dangerous fashion  as he spoke a tall spire was seen to slip from its position topple over and go crashing down into a dark blue gulf of ice below it  no chance of success now said benjamin vane gloomily  none wotsomediver muttered butterface his broad black visage absolutely elongated by sympathetic despair  for you must know as far as his own feelings were concerned sympathy alone influenced him personally he was supremely indifferent about reaching the north pole in fact he did not believe in it at all and made no scruple of saying so when asked but he seldom volunteered his opinion being an extremely modest and polite man  during these desponding remarks captain vane did not seem to be much depressed  anders he said turning abruptly to the interpreter ask chingatok what he thinks  can we pass this barrier and if not what would he advise us to do  it was observed that the other eskimos drew near with anxious looks to hear the opinion of their chief  toolooha and tekkona however seemed quite devoid of anxiety  they evidently had perfect confidence in the giant and poor little oblooria glanced up in the face of her friend as if to gather consolation from her looks  chingatok after a short pause said  the icemountains cannot be passed  the white men have not wings they cannot fly  they must return to land and travel for many days to the open water near the faroff landthere  he pointed direct to the northward  captain vane made no reply  he merely turned and gave orders that the lashings of one of the large sledges which conveyed the baggage should be cast loose  selecting a box from this he opened it and took therefrom a small instrument made partly of brass partly of glass and partly of wood  you have often wondered benjy he said what i meant to do with this electrical machine  you shall soon see  help me to arrange it boy and do you leo uncoil part of this copper wire  here alf carry this little box to the foot of the berg and lay it in front of yon blue cavern  which  that one close to the waterfall or  no the big cavern just under the most solid part of the bergthe one that seems to grow bluer and bluer until it becomes quite black in its heart  and have a care alf  the box you carry is dangerous  dont let it fall  lay it down gently and come back at once  anders he added turning round let all the people go back with dogs and sledges for a quarter of a mile  there was something so peremptory and abrupt in their leaders manner that no one thought of asking him a question though all were filled with surprise and curiosity as to what he meant to do  come here leo he said after his orders had been obeyed  hold this coil and pay it out as i walk to the berg with the end in my hand  the coil was one of extremely fine copper wire  leo let it run as the captain walked off  a minute or two later he was seen to enter the dark blue cavern and disappear  my dear dad is reckless exclaimed benjy in some anxiety what if the roof o that cave should fall in  there are bits of ice dropping about everywhere  what can he be going to do  as he spoke the captain issued from the cave and walked smartly towards them  now then its all right he said give me the coil leo and come back all of you  fetch the machine alf  in a few minutes the whole party had retired a considerable distance from the huge berg the captain uncoiling the wire as he went  surely youre not going to try to blow it up piecemeal said leo  no lad im not going to do that or anything so slow returned the captain stopping and arranging the instrument  but if the box contains gunpowder persisted leo theres not enough to  it contains dynamite said the captain affixing the coil to the machine and giving it a sharp turn  if a volcano had suddenly opened fire under the iceberg the effect could not have been more tremendous  thunder itself is not more deep than was the crash which reverberated among the icecliffs  smoke burst in a huge volume from the heart of the berg  masses fragments domes and pinnacles were hurled into the air and fell back to mingle with the blue precipices that tumbled slid or plunged in horrible confusion only a portion indeed of the mighty mass had been actually disrupted but the shock to the surrounding ice was so shattering that the entire berg subsided  stupendous exclaimed alf with a look of awestricken wonder  benjy after venting his feelings in a shriek of joyful surprise seemed to be struck dumb  anders and butterface stood stillspeechless  as for the eskimos they turned with one hideous yell and fled from the spot like maniacsexcepting chingatok who although startled stood his ground in an attitude expressive of superlative surprise  soit has not disappointed me remarked the captain when the hideous din had ceased dynamite is indeed a powerful agent when properly applied immeasurably more effective than powder  but it seems to me said leo beginning to recover himself that although you have brought the berg down you have not rendered it much more passable  thats true lad answered the captain with a somewhat rueful expression  it does seem a lumpy sort of heap after all but there may be found some practicable bits when we examine it more closely  come well go see  on closer inspection it was found that the ruined berg still presented an absolutely insurmountable obstacle to the explorers who being finally compelled to admit that even dynamite had failed left the place in search of a natural opening  travelling along the chain for a considerable time in the hope of succeeding they came at last to a succession of comparatively level floes which conducted them to the extreme northern end of the chain and there they found that the floes continued onwards in an unbroken plain to what appeared to be the open sea  that is a watersky for certain exclaimed captain vane eagerly on the evening when this discovery was made  the open ocean cannot now be far off  theres a very dark cloud there father said benjy who as we have before said possessed the keenest sight of the party  a cloud boy where  umyes i see something  it is land said chingatok in a low voice  land exclaimed the captain are you sure  yes i know it well  i passed it on my journey here  we left our canoes and oomiaks there and took to sledges because the floes were unbroken  but these icemountains were not here at that time  they have come down since we passed from the great sea  there said the captain turning to leo with a look of triumph he still speaks of the great sea  if these bergs came from it we must have reached it lad  but the land puzzles me said leo  can it be part of greenland  scarcely for greenland lies far to the eastard and the latest discoveries made on the north of that land show that the coast turns still more decidedly easttending to the conclusion that greenland is an island  this land therefore must be entirely new landan island a continent perhaps  but it may be a cape father interposed benjy  you know that capes have a queer way of sticking out suddenly from land just as mens noses stick out from their faces  true benjy true but your simile is not perfect for mens noses dont always stick out from their faceswitness the nose of butterface which you know is well aft of his lips and chin  however this may be greenlands nosewho knows  we shall go and find out ere long come use your whip leo  ho  chingatok tell your hairy kinsmen to clap on all sail and make for the land  hold on uncle cried alf i think i see a splendid specimen of  the crack of leos whip and the yelping of the team drowned the rest of the sentence and alf was whirled away from his splendid specimen whatever it was for ever  it is a piece of great good fortune said the captain as they swept along over the hard and level snow that the eskimos have left their boats on this land for now i shall have two strings to my bow  what is the other string asked leo as he administered a flip to the flank of a lazy dog  ah that remains to be seen lad replied the captain  why what a tyrant you are uncle exclaimed alf who had recovered from his disappointment about the splendid specimen  you wont tell us anything almost  who ever before heard of the men of an expedition to the north pole being kept in ignorance of the means by which they were to get there  the captains reply was only a twinkle of the eye  father wants to fill you with bliss alf said benjy according to your own notions of that sort of thing  what do you mean ben  why have we not all heard you often quote the wordswhere ignorance is bliss tis folly to be wise  hear hear  thats it benjy said the captain with a nod and a short laugh while his son assumed the satisfied gravity of look appropriate to one who has made a hit i wont decrease his bliss by removing his ignorance yet awhile  haint buzzby got nuffin to say on that ere pint whispered butterface to benjy who sat just in front of him  ah to be sure  i say alf said the boy with an earnest look hasnt your favourite author got something to say about the bliss of ignorance  im almost sure i heard you muttering something in your dreams on that subject the other day  of course he has  he has a long poem on that subject  here is a bit of it  alf whose memory was good immediately recited the following    how sweet is ignorance  how soothing to the mind   to search for treasures in the brain and nothing find   consider  when the memory is richly stored   how apt the victim of redundant knowledge to be bored   when nothing fills the chambers of the heart and brain   then negative enjoyment comes with pleasures in her train   descending on the clods of sense like summer rain    knowledge tis said gives power and so it often does   knowledge makes sorrow too around our pillows buzz   in debt i am with little cash i know itand am sad   of course if i were ignorant of thishow glad   a loving friend whom once i knew in glowing health   has broken down and also somehow lost his wealth   how sad the knowledge makes me  better far   in ignorance to live than hear of things that jar   and think of things that are notnot of things that are    if ignorance is bliss the poet saithwhy if   why doubt a fact so clearly proven stubborn stiff   the heavy griefs and burdens of the world around   the hideous tyranny by which mankind is ground   the earthquake tempest rush of war and wail of woe   are all as though they were notif i do not know   wrapped in my robe of ignorance what can i miss   am i not saved from alland more than allof this   do i not revel in a regal realm of bliss  bravo  buzzby cried the captain but i say alf dont it seem to smack rather too much of selfishness  of course it does uncle  i do not think buzzby always sound in principle and like many poets he is sometimes confused in his logic  youre right benjy the land is clear enough now remarked the captain whose interest in buzzby was not profound and whose feelings towards logic bordered on the contemptuous as is often the case with halfeducated men and strange to say sometimes with highlyeducated men as well as with the totally ignorantso true is it that extremes meet  in the course of a couple of hours the sledges drew near to the island which proved to be a large but comparatively low one rising not more than a hundred feet in any part  it was barren and ragged with patches of reindeer moss growing in some parts and dwarf willows in others myriads of seabirds made it their home and these received the invaders with clamorous cries as if they knew that white men were a dangerous novelty and objected to the innovation  despite their remonstrances the party landed and the eskimos hurried over the rocks to that part of the island where they had left their kayaks and womens boats in charge of a party of natives who were resident on the island at the time they passed and from whom they had borrowed the dogs and sledges with which they had travelled south  meanwhile the white men took to rambling leo to shoot wildfowl for supper alf to search for specimens and benjy to scramble among the rocks in search of anything that might turn up  butterface assisted the latter in his explorations  while the rest were thus engaged the captain extemporised a flagstaff out of two spears lashed together with a small block at the top for the purpose of running up a flag and formally taking possession of the island when they should reassemble this done he wrote a brief outline of his recent doings which he inserted in a gingerbeer bottle brought for that very purpose  then he assisted anders in making the encampment and preparing supper  the two were yet in the midst of the latter operation when a shout was heard in the distance  looking in the direction whence it came they saw chingatok striding over the rocks towards them with unusual haste  he was followed by the other eskimos who came forward gesticulating violently  my countrymen have left the island said chingatok when he came up  and taken the kayaks with them asked captain vane anxiously  every one replied the giant  this was depressing news to the captain who had counted much on making use of the eskimo canoes in the event of his own appliances failing  where have they gone think you he asked  tell blackbeard replied chingatok turning to anders that no one knows  since they went away the lanes of open water have closed and the ice is solid everywhere  but where the kayak and the oomiak cannot float the sledge may go said the captain  that is true tell the pale chief he is wise yet he knows not all things  let him think  when he comes to the great open sea what will he do without canoes  huk exclaimed oolichuk with that look and tone which intimated his belief that the pale chief had received a clincher  the chattering of the other eskimos ceased for a moment or two as they awaited eagerly the captains answer but the captain disappointed them he merely said well we shall see  i may not know all things chingatok nevertheless i know a deal more than you can guess at  come now lets have supper anders we cant wait for the wanderers  as he spoke three of the wanderers came into camp namely leo benjy and butterface  whats come of alf asked the captain  neither leo nor benjy had seen him since they parted a quarter of an hour after starting and both had expected to find him in camp but butterface had seen him  sawd him runnin said the sable steward runnin like a mad kangaroo arter a smallish brute like a mouse  nebber sawd nuffin like massa alf for runnin  well we cant wait for him said the captain i want to take possession of the island before supper  what shall we call it  disappointment isle said leo seeing that the eskimos have failed us  noi wont be ungrateful returned the captain considering the successes already achieved  call it content isle then suggested benjy  but i am not content with partial success  come butterface havent you got a suggestion to make  the negro shook his woolly head  no he said is orrible stoopid nebber could get nuffin to come out o my brainsep wen its knocked out by accident  yous hard to please massa  spose you mix de two dispintment an contentan call im halfanhalf island  home is in sight now said chingatok who had taken no interest in the above discussion as it was carried on in english  a few days more and we should be there if we only had our kayaks  theres the name exclaimed the captain eagerly when this was translated homeinsight that will do  rising quickly he bent a union jack to the halyards of his primitive flagstaff ran it up and in the name of queen victoria took possession of homeinsight island  after having given three hearty british cheers in which the eskimos tried to join with but partial success they buried the gingerbeer bottle under a heap of stones a wooden cross was fixed on the top of the cairn and then the party sat down to supper while the captain made a careful note of the latitude and longitude which he had previously ascertained  this latest addition to her majestys dominions was put down by him in latitude 85 degrees 32 minutes or about 288 geographical miles from the north pole    chapter ten  a sketcher in imminent danger  difficulties increase and are overcome as usual  the first night on homeinsight island was not so undisturbed as might have been expected  the noisy gulls did indeed go to sleep at their proper bedtime which by the way they must have ascertained by instinct for the sun could be no certain guide seeing that he shone all night as well as all day and it would be too much to expect that gulls had sufficient powers of observation to note the great luminarys exact relation to the horizon  polar bears like the eskimo had forsaken the spot  all nature indeed animate and inanimate favoured the idea of repose when the explorers lay down to sleep on a mossy couch that was quite as soft as a feather bed and much more springy  the cause of disturbance was the prolonged absence of alf vandervell that enthusiastic naturalists failure to appear at supper was nothing uncommon  his nonappearance when they lay down did indeed cause some surprise but little or no anxiety and they all dropped into a sound sleep which lasted till considerably beyond midnight  then the captain awoke with a feeling of uneasiness started up on one elbow yawned and gazed dreamily around  the sun which had just kissed his hand to the disappointed horizon and begun to reascend the sky blinded the captain with his beams but did not prevent him from observing that alfs place was still vacant  very odd he muttered alf didnt use totowats is name in thisway  the captains head dropped his elbow relaxed and he returned to the land of nod for another halfhour  again he awoke with a start and sat upright  thisll never do he exclaimed with a fierce yawn something must be wrong  ho  benjy  umph replied the boy who though personally light was a heavy sleeper  rouse up ben alfs not come back  where did you leave him  don know burrerface saw im las  benjy dropped off with a sigh but was rearoused by a rough shake from his father who lay close to him  come ben stir up butterface  we must go look for alf  butterface lay on the other side of benjy who only half alive to what he was doing raised his hand and let it fall heavily on the negros nose by way of stirring him up  hallo massa benjamin  yous dreamin drefful strong dis mornin  yer up ol ebony groaned the boy  in a few minutes the whole camp was roused sleep was quickly banished by anxiety about the missing one guns and rifles were loaded and a regular searchexpedition was hastily organised  they started off in groups in different directions leaving the eskimo women in charge of the camp  the captain headed one party chingatok another and leo with benjy a third while a few of the natives went off independently in couples or alone  i was sure alf would get into trouble said benjy as he trotted beside leo who strode over the ground in anxious haste  that way he has of getting so absorbed in things that he forgets where he is wont make him a good explorer  not so sure of that ben returned leo he can discover things that men who are less absorbed like you might fail to note  let us go round this hillock on separate sides  we might pass him if we went together  keep your eyes open as you go  he may have stumbled over one of those low precipices and broken a leg  keep your ears cocked also and give a shout now and then  we have said that the island was a low one nevertheless it was extremely rugged with little ridges and hollows everywhere like miniature hills and valleys  through one of these latter benjy hurried glancing from side to side as he went like a red indian on the warpathwhich character indeed he thought of and tried to imitate  the little vale did not however as leo had imagined lead round the hillock  it diverged gradually to the right and ascended towards the higher parts of the island  the path was so obstructed by rocks and boulders which had evidently been at one time under the pressure of ice that the boy could not see far in any direction except by mounting one of these  he had not gone far when on turning the corner of a cliff which opened up another gorge to view he beheld a sight which caused him to open mouth and eyes to their widest  for there seated on an eminence with his back to a low precipice not more than three or four hundred yards off sat the missing explorer with book on knees and pencil in handsketching and there seated on the top of the precipice looking over the edge at the artist skulked a huge polar bear taking as it were a surreptitious lesson in drawing the bear probably supposing alf to be a wandering seal had dogged him to that position just as benjy vane discovered him and then finding the precipice too high for a leap perhaps or doubting the character of his intended victim he had paused in uncertainty on the edge  the boys first impulse was to utter a shout of warning for he had no gun wherewith to shoot the brute but fear lest that might precipitate an attack restrained him  benjy however was quickwitted  he saw that the leap was probably too much even for a polar bear and that the nature of the ground would necessitate a detour before it could get at the artist  these and other thoughts passed through his brain like the lightning flash and he was on the point of turning to run back and give the alarm to leo when a rattling of stones occurred behind himjust beyond the point of rocks round which he had turned  in the tension of his excited nerves he felt as if he had suddenly become red hot  could this be another bear  if so what was he to do whither to fly  a moment more would settle the question for the rattle of stones continued as the steps advanced  the boy felt the hair rising on his head  round came the unknown monster in the form ofa man  ah benjy i  but the appearance of benjys countenance caused leo to stop abruptly both in walk and talk  he had found out his mistake about sending the boy round the hillock and turning back had followed him  ah look there said benjy pointing at the tableau vivant on the hilltop  leos ready rifle leaped from his shoulder to his left palm and a grim smile played on his lips for long service in a volunteer corps had made him a good judge of distance as well as a sure and deadly shot  stand back benjy behind this boulder he whispered  ill lean on it to make more certain  he was deliberately arranging the rifle while speaking but never for one instant took his eye off the bear which still stood motionless with one paw raised as if petrified with amazement at what it saw  as for alf he went on intently with his work lifting and lowering his eyes continuously putting in bold dashes here or tender touches there holding out the book occasionally at arms length to regard his work with head first on one side then on the other and in short going through all those graceful and familiar little evolutions of artistic procedure which arouse ones home feelings so powerfully everywhere even in the arctic regions  little did the artist know who was his uninvited pupil on that sunny summer night  with one knee resting on a rock and his rifle on the boulder leo took a steady somewhat lengthened aim and fired  the result was stupendous  not only did the shot reverberate with crashing echoes among surrounding cliffs and boulders but a dying howl from the bear burst over the island like the thunder of a heavy gun and went booming over the frozen sea  no wonder that the horrified alf leapt nearly his own height into the air and scattered his drawingmaterials right and left like chaff  he threw up his arms and wheeled frantically round just in time to receive the murdered bear into his very bosom  they rolled down a small slope together and then falling apart lay prone and apparently dead upon the ground  you may be sure that leo soon had his brothers head on his knee and was calling to him in an agony of fear quite regardless of the fact that the bear lay at his elbow giving a few terrific kicks as its huge life oozed out through a bullethole in its heart while benjy half weeping with sympathy half laughing with glee ran to a neighbouring pool to fetch water in his cap  a little of the refreshing liquid dashed on his face and poured down his throat soon restored alf who had only been stunned by the fall  what induced you to keep on sketching all night asked leo after the first explanations were over  all night repeated alf in surprise have i been away all night what time is it  three oclock in the morning at the very least said leo  the sun is pretty high as you might have seen if you had looked at it  but he never looked at it said benjy whose eyes were not yet quite dry he never looks at anything or thinks of anything when he goes sketching  surely you must allow that at least i look at and think of my work said alf rising from the ground and sitting down on the rock from which he had been so rudely roused but you are half right benjy  the sun was at my back you see hid from me by the cliff over which the bear tumbled and i had no thoughts for time or eyes for nature except the portion i was busy withby the way where is it  what your sketch  ay and the colours  i wouldnt lose these for a sight of the pole itself  look for them ben my boy i still feel somewhat giddy  in a few minutes the sketch and drawingmaterials were collected undamaged and the three returned to camp alf leaning on leos arm  on the way thither they met the captains party and afterwards the band led by chingatok  the latter was mightily amused by the adventure and continued for a considerable time afterwards to upheave his huge shoulders with suppressed laughter  when the whole party was reassembled the hour was so late and they had all been so thoroughly excited that no one felt inclined to sleep again  it was resolved therefore at once to commence the operations of a new day  butterface was set to prepare coffee and the eskimos began breakfast with strips of raw blubber while steaks of leos bear were being cooked  meanwhile chingatok expressed a wish to see the drawing which had so nearly cost the artist his life  alf was delighted to exhibit and explain it  for some time the giant gazed at it in silence  then he rested his forehead in his huge hand as if in meditation  it was truly a clever sketch of a surpassingly lovely scene  in the foreground was part of the island with its pearlgrey rocks redbrown earth and green mosses in the midst of which lay a calm pool like the islands eye looking up to heaven and reflecting the bright indescribable blue of the midnight sky  further on was a mass of cold grey rocks  beyond lay the northern icepack which extended in chaotic confusion away to the distant horizon but the chaos was somewhat relieved by the presence of lakelets which shone here and there over its surface like shields of glittering azure and burnished gold  ask him what he thinks of it said leo to anders a little surprised at chingatoks prolonged silence  i cannot speak answered the giant my mind is bursting and my heart is full  with my finger i have drawn faces on the snow  i have seen men put wonderful things on flat rocks with a piece of stone but thisthis is my country made little  it looks as if i could walk in it yet it is flat  the giant is rather complimentary laughed benjy when this was translated to my eye your sketch is little better than a daub  it is a daub that causes me much anxiety said the captain who now looked at the drawing for the first time  dyou mean to tell me alf that youve been true to nature when you sketched that pack  as true as i could make it uncle  ill answer for its truth said leo and so will benjy for we both saw the view from the top of the island though we paid little heed to it being too much occupied with alf and the bear at the time  the pack is even more rugged than he has drawn it and it extends quite unbroken to the horizon  the captains usually hopeful expression forsook him for a little as he commented on his bad fortune  the season advances you see he said and its never very long at the best  i had hoped we were done with this troublesome sea of ancient ice but it seems to turn up everywhere and from past experience we know that the crossing of it is slow work as well as hard  however we mustnt lose heart  nebber say die as butterface is fond of remarking  yis massa nebber say die but allers say lib to de top ob your bent  dems my pinions wen deys wanted  also go ahid  dats a grand sentmentwas borned mong de yankees an i stoled it wen i left ole virginny  what says chingatok asked the captain of the eskimo who was still seated with the sketch on his knees in profound meditation  blackbeard has trouble before him answered the uncompromising giant without removing his eyes from the paper  there he said pointing to the pack you have three days hard work  after that three days easy and swift work  after that no more go on  must come back  he speaks in riddles anders  what does he mean by the three days of hard work coming to an end  i mean said chingatok that the ice was loose when i came to this island  it is now closed  the white men must toil toil toilvery slow over the ice for three days then they will come to smooth ice where the dogs may run for three days  then they will come to another island like this one on the faroff side of which there is no ice nothing but sea sea sea  our kayaks are gone continued the giant sadly we must come back and travel many days before we find things to make new ones  while he was speaking captain vanes face brightened up  are you sure of what you say chingatok  chingatok is sure replied the eskimo quietly  then well conquer our difficulties after all  come boys lets waste no more time in idle talk but harness the dogs and be off at once  of course the party had to travel round the island for there was neither ice nor snow on it  when the other side was reached the real difficulties of the journey were fully realised  during the whole of that day and the next they were almost continuously engaged in dragging the sledges over masses of ice some of which rose to thirty feet above the general level  if the reader will try to imagine a very small ant or beetle dragging its property over a newly macadamised road he will have a faint conception of the nature of the work  to some extent the dogs were a hindrance rather than a help especially when passing over broken fragments for they were always tumbling into holes and cracks out of which they had to be dragged and were much given to venting their illhumour on each other sometimes going in for a free fight in the course of which they tied their traces into indescribable knots and drove their eskimo masters furious  on such occasions the whipsboth lash and handlewere applied with unsparing vigour until the creatures were cowed  danger also as well as toil was encountered during the journey  on the evening of the second day the sledge driven by oolichuk diverged a little from the line of march towards what seemed an easier passage over the hummocks  they had just gained the top of an iceblock which unknown to the driver overhung its base  when the dogs reached the edge of the mass it suddenly gave way  down went the team with a united howl of despair  their weight jerked the sledge forward another mass of the ice gave way and over went the whole affair  in the fall the lashings broke and oolichuk with several of his kindred including poor little oblooria went down in a shower of skins packages bags and eskimo cooking utensils  fortunately they dropped on a slope of ice which broke their fall and as it were shunted them all safely though violently to the lower level of the pack  beyond a few scratches and bruises no evil resulted from this accident to these hardy natives of the north  that night they all encamped as on the previous night in the midst of the pack spreading their skins and furs on the flattest ice they could find and keeping as far from overhanging lumps as possible  what does blackbeard mean by coming here asked chingatok of anders as they lay side by side gazing up at the blue sky awaiting sleep  we cannot swim over the sea and we have no boats  i dont know answered the interpreter  our chief is a wonderful man  he does things that seem to be all wrong but they turn out mostly to be all right  does he ever speak of a great spirit asked the giant in a solemn tone  not to me replied the other but i hear him sometimes speaking to his little boy about his god  then he must know his god returned chingatok  has he seen him spoken to him  anders was a good deal surprised as well as puzzled by the questions put by his new friend  his extremely commonplace mind had never been exercised by such ideas  i never asked him about that he said and he never told me  perhaps he will tell you if you ask him  the interpreter turned on his side with a sigh and went to sleep  the giant lay on his back gazing long and steadily with a wistful look at the unbroken vault of sky whose vast profundity seemed to thrust him mercilessly back  as he gazed a little cloud light as a puff of eiderdown and golden as the sun from which its lustre came floated into the range of his vision  he smiled for the thought that light may suddenly arise when all around seems blank gave his inquiring spirit rest and he soon joined the slumbering band who lay upon the ice around him  according to chingatoks prophecy on the third day the fagged and weary discoverers surmounted their first difficulty and came upon comparatively smooth ice the surface of which resembled hardtrodden snow and was sufficiently free from obstructing lumps to admit of rapid sledge travelling  it was late when they reached it but as they could now all sit on the sledges and leave the hard work to the dogs the leader resolved to continue the advance without resting  its time enough to stop when were stopped he remarked to leo while making preparations to start  we will sleep at the first obstruction we meet with if its a sufficiently troublesome one  see that the things are well lashed on all the sledges alf  remember that i hold you responsible for lost articles  and what am i responsible for father asked benjy with a pert look  for keeping out of mischief ben  thats the most i can expect of you  you are only a sort of negative blessing to us you see benjy said alf as he stooped to tighten a rope  its not so much what you do as what you dont do that rejoices us  im glad of that retorted the boy arranging himself comfortably on his fathers sledge because i wont do anything at all for some hours to come which ought to fill you all with perfect felicity  awake me leo if we chance to upset  now then all ready cried the captain  off you go thenclap on all sail  crack went the mighty whips howl went the dogs and the sledges were soon skimming over the sea at the rate of ten miles an hour  of course they did not keep that pace up very long  it became necessary to rest at times also to give the dogs a little food  when this latter process had been completed the teams became so lively that they tried to runaway  let them run said the captain to leo  and help them on added benjy  leo took the advice of both applied the lash and increased the speed so much that the sledge swung from side to side on the smooth places sometimes catching on a lump of ice and all but throwing out its occupants  the eskimos entered into the spirit of their leaders  they also plied their lashes and being more dexterous than leo soon converted the journey into a race in which chingatokhis giant arm flourishing an appropriately huge whipwas rapidly coming to the front when a tremendous shout in the rear caused them to pull up  looking back alfs sledge was seen inverted and mixed as it were with the team while alf himself and his eskimo friends were sprawling around on the ice  no damage was done to life or limb but a sledgerunner had been partially broken and could not be mendedso said oolichukin less than an hour  this then said the captain is our first obstruction so here we will make our beds for the night    chapter eleven  another island discoveredthe englishmen and eskimos alike are astonished in more ways than one  as chingatok had predicted on the sixth day from homeinsight island the party came to another island where the great pack abruptly terminated  it was not large probably ten or twelve miles in length from the eskimo account but the ends of it could not be seen from the spot where they landed  at that point it was only two miles wide and on the opposite side its shores were laved by an open sea which was quite free from ice with the exception of a few scattered floes and bergsa sea whose waves fell in slow regular cadence on a pebbly beach and whose horizon was an unbroken line barely distinguishable from the sky  close to it a few black rocks showed above the water around which great numbers of gulls puffins and other seabirds disported themselves in clamorous joy sometimes flying to the shore as if to have a look at the newcomers and then sheering off with a screamit might be a laughto tell their comrades what they had seen  here then at last is the open polar sea said captain vane after the first long silent gaze of joy and admiration  i have no doubt of it whatever  and now we shall proceed i hope without interruption to the pole  of course you do not intend that we should swim there do you uncle said leo  of course not my boy  in those big cases which have cost us so much labour to bring here i have three large and stout indiarubber boats  ha  i guessed as much exclaimed alf  no doubt returned the captain but you did not guess all  i hope not said leo for to say truth i dont much relish the idea of rowing over an unknown sea an unknown distance at the rate of three or four miles an hour  i hope you have a patent steamengine that will drive us along somewhat faster  no lad no i have no such steamengine or any other miraculous contrivance that sets the laws of nature at defiance and appears only in nursery tales  this expedition has been undertaken on no haphazard or insane plan  it was all cut and dry before we left old england and it is much simpler than you suppose  what then is to be your motive power if not oars or sailswhich last would not work well i fear in an indiarubber boat asked leo  kites replied the captain  kites repeated both alf and leo in surprise  not paper ones surely said benjy in a tone of disappointment not unmingled with contempt  no ben not paper ones said the captain but you shall see  let the boxes be unlashed and carried into yonder cave  ill unpack them presently  meanwhile anders i want you to interpret for me  go tell chingatok i wish to have a talk with him  while the brothers went to obey their leaders order and benjy to superintend the pitching of the camp captain vane walked along the shore with anders and the giant  are you sure chingatok that there is no more ice in this sea asked the captain  no more great packs only a little here and there and a few icemountains answered the eskimo  and no more islands  no more islands till you come to the land where i and my people dwell there are more islands beyond that with people on thempeople who are not friendly to us  how far off now is your land from this island continued the captain with a grave nod to leo who joined them at the moment  about three days with a kayak  the captain pondered for a few minutes  leo he said the observation which i took yesterday enables me to place this island in latitude 86 degrees 40 minutes  i judge that a kayak may travel at the rate of three miles an hour which making allowance for sleep and rests gives the distance of this island from chingatoks native land approximately at about 100 miles so that the home of this giant and his tribe is actually in the near neighbourhood of the pole itself  if this be so we may consider that our success wind weather etcetera permitting is absolutely certain  the captain spoke in the deep earnest tones of one under the influence of powerful but suppressed enthusiasm  now then leo he continued we will go and take formal possession of this new discovery  what shall we call it  good hope is too familiar as a cape  why not great hope asked leo  good  that will do well  so captain vane took possession of great hope island having fixed its position in latitude 86 degrees 40 minutes north and longitude 60 degrees west  after that he proceeded to open the cases which had so long been objects of interest to his own party and objects of intense curiosity to the eskimos who crowded round the entrance of the shallow cavern with eager looks while their leader went to work with hammer and chisel on the copper fastenings  wugh  huk hi hosh ho were something like the exclamations uttered by the eskimos when the lid of the first case flew up and revealed only a mass of brown paper wrappings  it was interesting to observe the utter selfoblivion of these children of nature  of course the eyes and mouths of all opened wider and wider while the work went on  we can understand this for it is characteristic of the simple in all nations but it was not so easy to understand why shoulders should slowly rise and elbows be slightly bent and the ten fingers gradually expand like claws  anxiety might account for the way in which some of them softly lifted one foot and then the other but why did little oblooria raise her left foot by imperceptible degrees and remain poised upon the other as if she were a bird except on the supposition that she was unconsciously imitating tekkona who was doing the same thing  it was interesting also to note the slight substratum of consciousness that displayed itself in oolichuk who while regarding the captain in glaring expectancy put his arm inadvertently as it were round obloorias waistalso the complete absence of consciousness in the latter who was so engrossed with the captain that she did not appear to feel the touch of oolichuk  these little peculiarities however although extremely interesting were not observed by any of the actors on that occasionexcept perhaps by benjy who being sharpwitted had a knack of seeing round a corner at times  when the contents of the case were turned out they proved to consist of several coils of rope and a large square bundle  the uncording of the latter intensified the expectation of the eskimo to boiling point and when the brown paper was removed and a roll of something with a strange not to say bad smell was displayed they boiled over in a series of exclamations to which the former huks and hos were mere childs play  but when the roll was unrolled and assumed a flat shape not unlike the skin of a huge walrus they gave a shout  then when the captain opening a smaller package displayed a pair of bellows like a concertina they gave a gasp  when he applied these to a hole in the flat object and caused it slowly to swell they uttered a roar and when finally they saw the flat thing transformed into a goodlysized boat they absolutely squealed with delight and began to caper about in childlike joy  in this manner three cases were opened and three boats produced  then the magician who went about his work in perfect silence with a knowing smile on his lips opened several longish boxes which leo had guessed to be filled with fishingrods or spare rifles but which it turned out contained oars for the indiarubber boats  after that the captain opened another large case which roused the surprise of his white followers as much as that of the natives  it looks like one of mothers silk dresses remarked benjy as the new wonder was dragged forth  too voluminous for that said alf  a balloon exclaimed leo  no boys its only a kite said the captain unfolding it  i confess it does not look very like one but its appearance will change by and by  and its appearance did change remarkably as it was opened out and put together  the construction of this kite was peculiar  in the first place it was square in form or rather diamondshaped and its size when fully distended was eighteen feet by fourteen  the simplicity of it you see said the captain as he put it together is its great recommendation  he ceased to speak for a few moments while engaged with a troublesome joint and benjy took advantage of the pause to express a hope that simplicity was not its greatest recommendation because he had never heard of any one attempting to reach the pole on the strength of simplicity  without noticing this remark the captain went on  you see it would be troublesome to carry distending sticks of great length because they would be in the way and apt to get broken  each stick therefore has a joint in the middle like that of a fishingrod there are four such sticks fastened to or radiating from a strong steel central hinge so that they can be folded together or opened out into the form of a cross  a small but very strong cross of bamboo fits on the machine behind the central hinge and locks it in a distended position after the silk has been placed on it  strong cords run round the outer edges of the silk and there are loops at the corners to attach it to the distenders  thus you see the kite can be put up or folded into a portable form like an umbrella though not of course as quickly nor yet as easily owing to its great size  while he was speaking the captain was busily putting the several parts of the kite together  as he concluded he laid the machine on its face locked it with the little bamboo cross and then held it up in triumph to the delight of his white observers and the blank astonishment of the eskimos  we say blank because unlike the boat the nature of which they understood before it had been quite inflated this machine was to them an absolute mystery and seemed to be of no use at all  their opinion of it was not improved when a sudden puff of wind blew it flat on the ground causing the captain to fall on the top of it  its a little awkward in handling he growled unlocking the centrecross  hold the points down lads till i drag it into the umbrella form  there its all safe now  the truth is unmanageableness when in hand is the only fault of my kite  once in the air its as tractable as a lamb getting it up is the chief difficulty but that is not too great to be overcome  besides you know nothings perfect in this world father said benjy with a wink at butterface who having acute risible tendencies exploded  some of the eskimos whose sympathies were strong joined in the laugh by way of relief to their feelings  when the captain had wound a strap round the closed kite to restrain its volatile nature he opened another large case which contained several reels of strong cord somewhat resembling loglines but with this peculiarity that alongside of each thick cord there ran a thin red line of twine connected with though not bound to the other by means of little loops or rings of twine fixed about six feet apart throughout its entire length  these are the cords to fly the kites said the captain taking up one of the reels which was as large as a mans hat  you see i have three sets of silk in that box and six sets of reels and sticks besides a few spare pieces of the latter so that we can afford to suffer a little damage  now the use of this peculiar sort of double line will be clear when in action but i may as well explain it  the end of this stout line is to be made fast to the band which you saw on the kite and the end of this thin red line to the top of its upright stick  you remember well enough how independent ordinary kites are  you cannot cause them to descend except by hauling them in by main force and you cannot moderate their pull  this kite of mine is capable of exerting a pull equal to six horses with a sufficiently strong wind  so you see it would be impossible for a dozen men to hold it without some check on its power  this check is supplied by the thin red line which is made of the strongest silk  by pulling it gently you bend the head of the kite forward so that it ceases to present a flat surface to the wind which flies off it more or less at the tail  by pulling still more on the red line the tractionpower is still further reduced and with a good pull the kite can be made to present its head altogether to the wind and thus to lie flat on it when of course it will descend slowly to the ground waving from side to side like a dropped sheet of paper  are you going to try it father asked benjy eagerly  the captain looked up at the clouds with a critical glance  theres hardly enough of wind today boy  nevertheless we will try  in a very short time the kite was again extended the centre locked the thick cord fixed to a loop in the band and the thin cord to the head of the main stick  while this was being done the corners were held down by leo benjy anders and butterface  how about a tail father asked benjy with sudden animation  ha  i forgot the tail  ive got several tails  its well you reminded me  it is indeed responded the boy for i remember well that when my kites lost their tails they used to whirl wildly about until they dashed their heads on the ground  this kite would be little better than a mad elephant without its tail  a short tail made of the strongest catgut was now fixed to the lower extremity of the kite  it had a bag at the end to be weighted with stones as required  now then alf do you carry the reel away fifty yards or so and pay out the line as you go  make a dozen of the eskimos hold on with you till i come and regulate the pull  i must remain here to set it off  alf did as he was ordered  when he was far enough out the captain and leo raised the aerial monster with caution grasping it by the shoulders while benjy held on to the tail  their great care was to keep it flat so that it presented nothing but its thin head to the wind but this was a difficulty for it kept fluttering as if anxious to get away catching a slant of wind underneath now and then which caused both leo and the captain to stagger  dont hold down the tail benjy cried the captain looking anxiously over his shoulder  unfortunately ben did not hear the dont  not only did he hold on with increased vigour but he gave the tail an energetic pull downwards the result was that the wind got fairly underneath and the head was jerked upward  leo fearing to tear the silk let go and the captain was thrown violently off  benjy alone stood to his gunsor to his tailwith loyal heroism for a moment but when he felt himself lifted off the ground a few inches a feeling of horror seized him  he let go and came down with a whack  free at last the huge kite shot upwards like a rocket and a terrible howl from the eskimo showed that all was not right at their end of the line  the truth was that none of them were impressed with the importance of the duty required of them  the sudden strain jerked the line out of the hands of some and threw others to the ground and alf who had for greater security taken a turn of the line round his right arm was dragged forward at full racing speed  indeed he was beginning to take those tremendous bounds called giant strides which were sure to terminate in his being dragged along the ground  captain vane saw the danger and was equal to the occasion  there was little time for thought or action  another moment and alf would be off the beach into the sea  let go  alf let go cried leo in an agony of alarm  no no hold on shouted the captain  poor alf could not help holding on  the turns of the line round his arm held him fast  another moment and he was abreast of the captain who sprang at him as he passed like a leopard on his prey and held on  but the pace was little checked with this additional weight  it was beyond the captains running powers and both he and alf would have been thrown violently to the ground had it not happened that they had reached the water into which they plunged with a tremendous splash  they were dragged through it however only for a few seconds for by that time the captain had succeeded in getting hold of the red line and pulling it separately the result was immediate and satisfactory  the head of the kite was thrown forward acting somewhat as a sail does when a ship is thrown into the wind and the two unfortunates came to an anchor in four feet of water  we must not let it into the water alf gasped the captain clearing the water from his eyes  how can we prevent it spluttered alf shaking the wet hair off his face  ease your fingers a bit  there hold on  as he spoke the captain gave a slight pull on the regulating line  the kite at once caught the wind and soared giving the two operators an awful tug which nearly overturned them again  too much growled the captain  you see it takes some experience to regulate the excitable thing properly  there now haul away for the shore  by this time they were joined by leo and chingatok who ran into the water and aided them in dragging the refractory machine ashore  thats a vigorous beginning father remarked benjy as they came to land  it is my boy  go and fetch me dry clothes while we haul in the kite and make her snug  when do you mean to start asked leo as he coiled away the slack of the line on the reel  the first steady fair wind that blows from the south answered the captain but we must have one or two experimental trials of the kites and boats together before we set out on the real voyage  its a capital idea returned leo enthusiastically  theres a sort of neckornothing dash about it that quite suits me  but uncle what of the eskimos  the three boats wont carry the half of them  i know that lad and shall get over the difficulty by leaving some of them behind  chingatok says they are quite able to take care of themselves can easily regain the greenland shore find their canoes or make new ones and return to their own land if they choose  but uncle said alf who was by no means as reckless as his brother dont you think its rather risky to go off into an unknown sea in open boats for no one knows how long to go no one knows exactly where  why alf returned the captain with a laugh if you were as stupid about your scientific pursuits as you are about geographical affairs you would not be worth your salt  a seas a sea isnt it whether known or unknown and the laws that affect all seas are pretty much alike  of course it is risky  so is going on a forlorn hope  so is shooting with a set of fellows who dont know how to manage their guns so is getting on a horse for it may kick you off or run away  so is eating fish for you may choke yourself  everything almost is more or less risky  you must risk something if youd discover the north pole which has baffled adventurers from the days of adam till now  and you are wrong in saying that we shall go off for no one knows how long  the distance from this island to the pole is pretty nearly 200 miles  if our kites carry us along at the rate of ten miles an hour we shall cover the distance in 20 hours  if we have calms or contrary winds we may take 20 days  if storms come we have not much to fear for the weather is warmso toois the water  then our boats are lifeboatsthey cannot sink  as to not knowing where exactly we are going why man were going to the north pole  everybody knows where that is and we are going to the home of chingatok which cannot be very far from it  there alf i hope you are sufficiently answered said leo as he undid the lockinggear of the kite which by that time lay prone on its face as peaceful as a lamb  the next three days were spent in flying the other kites tying them on the boats acquiring experience and making preparations for the voyage it was found that with a moderate breeze the kites towed the boats at the rate of ten miles an hour which was beyond the most sanguine hopes of the captain  of course they could not beat to windward with them but they could sail with a considerable slant and they prevented the boats while thus advancing from making much leeway by means of deep leeboards such as are used even at the present day by dutch ships  but i cant understand said benjy after several trials had been made why you should not have fitted sails to the boats instead of kites  because a sail only a quarter the size of a kite would upset the boat said the captain and one small enough to suit it would be little better than a pair of oars  this kite system is like fitting a gigantic sail to a lilliputian boat dye see  i see father  but i wish it had been a balloon  it would have been greater fun to have gone to the pole in a balloon  a balloon will never go there nor anywhere else benjy except where the wind carries it for a balloon cannot be steered  its impossible in the nature of thingsas much so as that dream of the visionary perpetual motion  on the fourth day after their arrival at great hope island the wind blew strong and steady from the south and the explorers prepared to start the eskimos had been told that they were to remain behind and shift for themselvesa piece of news which did not seem to affect them at all one way or other  those who were selected to go with the explorers were perfectly willing to do so  chingatok of course was particularly ready  so were his corpulent mother and tekkona and oblooria so also were oolichuk ivitchuk and akeetolik  it was a splendid sunny afternoon when the kites were finally flown and attached to the three boats which were commanded respectively by the captain leo and alf  these three sat at the bow of each boat manipulating the regulators and keeping the kites fluttering while the goods and provisions were put on board  then the eskimo women and crews stepped in and the stern ropes were cast loose  let go the checkstrings shouted the captain  this was done  the huge kites began to strain at once and the indiarubber boats went rushing out to sea leaving the remainder of the eskimo band speechless on the shore  they stood there motionless with open mouths and eyes the very embodiment of unbelieving wonder till the boats had disappeared on the horizon    chapter twelve  the open polar basin at last  alf washes himself in it  who can imagine or describe the feelings of captain vane and his young relatives on finding themselves sweeping at such a magnificent rate over the great polar basinthat mysterious sea which some believe to be a sea of thickribbed ice and others suppose to be no sea at all but dry land covered with eternal snows  one theorist even goes the length of saying that the region immediately around the pole is absolutely nothing at allonly empty space caused by the whirling of the eartha space which extends through its centre from pole to pole  much amusement did the captain derive from the contemplation of these theories as he crossed over the grand and boundless ocean and chatted pleasantly with his son or chingatok or toolooha who formed the crew of his little boat  the party consisted of thirteen all told  these were distributed as follows  in the captains boat were the three just mentioned  in leos boat were butterface oolichuk and oblooria  how it came to pass that oolichuk and oblooria were put into the same boat no one seemed to know or indeed to care except oolichuk himself who to judge from the expression of his fat face was much pleased  as for oblooria her mild visage always betokened contentment or resignation save when overshadowed by timidity  in alfs boat were anders ivitchuk akeetolik and tekkona  the interpreter had been given to alf because he was not quite so muscular or energetic as the captain or his brother while anders was eminently strong and practical  the eskimo women counted as men being as expert with oar and paddle as they and very nearly as strong as most ordinary men  what added to the romance of the first days experience was the fact that a few hours after they started a dead calm settled down over the sea which soon became like a great sheet of undulating glass in which the rich white clouds the clear sky and the boats with their crews were reflected as in a moving oily mirror yet strange to say the kites kept steady and the pace of ten or twelve miles an hour did not abate for a considerable time  this of course was owing to the fact that there was a continuous current blowing northward in the higher regions of the atmosphere  the sun meantime glowed overhead with four mocksuns around him nevertheless the heat was not oppressive partly because the voyagers were sitting at rest and partly because a slight current of cool air the creation of their own progress fanned their cheeks  still further to add to the charm flocks of seabirds circling in the air or dipping in the water a berg or two floating in the distance a porpoise showing its back fin now and then a seal or a walrus coming up to stare in surprise and going down to meditate perhaps in wonder with an occasional puff from a lazy whaleall this tended to prevent monotony and gave life to the lovely scene  is it not the most glorious and altogether astonishing state of things you ever heard or dreamed of father asked benjy breaking a prolonged silence  out o sight my boy out o sight replied the captain  never heard nor saw nor dreamed of anything like it before  praps it is a dream said benjy with a slightly distressed look how are we ever to know that were not dreaming  the boy finished his question with a sharp cry and leaped up  steady boy steady  have a care or youll upset the boat said the captain  what did you do that for father  what my boy  pinch me so hard  surely you didnt do it on purpose  indeed i did ben replied the captain with a laugh  you asked how you were to know you were not dreaming  if you had been dreaming that would have wakened youwouldnt it  i dare say it would father returned the boy resuming his seat but im convinced now  dont do it again please  i wish i knew what chingatok thinks of it  try to ask him father  im sure youve had considerable experience in his lingo by this time  benjy referred here not only to the numerous conversations which his father had of late carried on with the giant through the interpreter but to the fact that having been a whaler in years past captain vane had previously picked up a smattering of various eskimo dialects  up to that day he had conversed entirely through the medium of anders but as that useful man was now in alfs boat the captain was left to his own resources and got on much better than he had expected  chingatok turned his eyes from the horizon on which they had been fixed and looked dreamily at the captain when asked what he was thinking about  i have been thinking said he of home my home over there  he lifted his huge right arm and pointed to the north  and i have been thinking he continued that there must be another home up there  he raised his hand and pointed to the sky  why do you think so asked the captain in some surprise  because it is so beautiful so wonderful so full of light and peace replied the eskimo  sometimes the clouds and the wind and the rain come and cover it but they pass away and there it is just the same always calm and bright and beautiful  could such a place have been made for nothing  is there no one up there not even the maker of it and if there is does he stay there alone  men and women die but surely there is something in us that does not die  if there is no spirit in us that lives of what use was it to make us at all  i think we shall have a home up there  chingatok had again turned his eyes to the horizon and spoke the concluding words as if he were thinking aloud  the captain looked at him earnestly for some time in silence  you are right chingatok he said at length or at least attempted to say as best he couldyou are right  my religion teaches me that we have spirits that godyour god and minedwells up there in what we call heaven and that his people shall dwell with him after death  his people repeated the eskimo with a perplexed look  are some men his people and some not  undoubtedly replied the captain men who obey a chiefs commands are his menhis friends  those who refuse to obey and do every kind of wickedness are not his friends but his enemies  god has given us freewills and we may reject himwe may choose to be his enemies  it must not be supposed that captain vane expressed himself thus clearly but the above is the substance of what he attempted by many a strange and complicated sentence to convey  that he had made his meaning to some extent plain was proved by chingatoks reply  but i do not know gods commands how then can i obey them  you may not know them by book replied the captain promptly for you have no books but there is such a thing as the commands or law of god written in the heart and it strikes me chingatok that you both know and obey more of your makers laws than many men who have his word  to this the eskimo made no answer for he did not rightly understand it and as the captain found extreme difficulty in expressing his meaning on such questions he was quite willing to drop the conversation nevertheless his respect for chingatok was immensely increased from that day forward  he tried to explain what had been said to benjy and as that youths mind was of an inquiring turn he listened with great interest but at last was forced to confess that it was too deep for him  thereafter he fell into a mood of unusual silence and pondered the matter for a long time  awaking from his reverie at last he said abruptly hows her head father  due north benjy  he pulled out a pocketcompass about the size of an ordinary watch which instrument it was his habit to guard with the most anxious care  north repeated the boy glancing at the instrument with a look of surprise why were steering almost due east  ah  ben that comes of your judging from appearances without knowledge not an uncommon state of mind in man and boy to say nothing of woman  dont you know what variation of the compass is  no father  what have you been so long at sea with me and never heard yet about the magnetic pole  never a word father  it seems to me that poles are multiplying as we get further north  oh benjy for shamefie fie  maybe if you had told me about it i might have had less to be shamed of and you too father  thats true benjy  thats true  youre a sharp boy for your age but dont be disrespectful to your father ben no good can ever come o that  whatever you are be respectful to your old father  come ill tell you about it now  it will have been observed by this time that little benjamin vane was somewhat free in his converse with his father but it must not therefore be supposed that he was really insolent  all his freedom of speech was vented in good humour and the captain knew that  there was indeed a powerful bond not only of affection but of sympathy between the little delicate boy and the big strong man  they thoroughly understood each other and between those who understand each other there may be much freedom without offence as everybody knows  you must understand began the captain that although the needle of the mariners compass is said to point to the north with its head and to the south with its tail it does not do so exactly because the magnetic poles do not coincide exactly with the geographical poles  there are two magnetic poles just as there are two geographical poles one in the southern hemisphere the other in the northern  dye understand  clear as daylight father  well benjy the famous arctic discoverer sir james ross in 1832 discovered that the northern magnetic pole was situated in the island of boothia felix in latitude 70 degrees 5 seconds and longitude 96 degrees 46 seconds west  it was discovered by means of an instrument called the dipping needle which is just a magnetised needle made for dipping perpendicularly instead of going round horizontally like the mariners compass  a graduated arc is fitted to it so that the amount of dip at any place on the earths surface can be ascertained  at the magnetic equator there is no dip at all because the needle being equally distant from the north and south magnetic poles remains horizontal  as you travel north the needle dips more and more until it reaches the region of the north magnetic pole when it is almost perpendicularpointing straight down  now it is only on a very few places of the earths surface that the horizontal needle points to the true north and south and its deviation from the earths pole in its determination to point to the magnetic pole is called the variation of the compass  this variation is greater or less of course at different places and must be allowed for in estimating ones exact course  in our present explorations we have got so far beyond the beaten track of travel that greater allowance than usual has to be made  in fact we have got considerably to the north of the magnetic pole  at the same time we are a good way to the eastard of it so that when i see the compass with its letter n pointing to what i know to be the magnetic north i take our geographical position into account and steer almost due east by compass for the purpose of advancing due north  dye see  im not so sure that i do father  it seems to me something like the irishmans pig which you pull one way when you want him to go another however ill take your word for it  thats right my boy when a man cant understand he must act on faith if he can for theres no forcing our beliefs you know anyhow he must be content to follow till he does understand always supposing that he can trust his leader  im out of my depths altogether now father  praps wed better change the subject  what dye say to try a race with leo  his boat seems to be overhauling us  no no ben no racing  let us advance into the great unknown north with suitable solemnity  we appear to sail rather better than you do uncle shouted leo as his boat drew near  thats because youre not so heavilyladen replied the captain looking back you havent got giants aboard you see moreover theres one o you rather lightheaded  hallo uncle evil communications eh  youd better change benjy for oblooria  shes quite quiet and never jokes  i say may i go ahead of you  no lad you maynt  take a reef in your regulator and drop into your proper place  obedient to orders leo pulled the regulator or checkstring until the kites position was altered so as to present less resistance to the wind and dropped astern of the faith which was the name given by benjy to his fathers boat the other two being named respectively the hope and the charity  the prosperous advance did not however last very long  towards evening the three kites suddenly and without any previous warning began to dive soar flutter and tumble about in a manner that would have been highly diverting if it had not been dangerous  this no doubt was the effect of various countercurrents of air into which they had flown  the order was at once given to haul on the regulators and coil up the towing lines  it was promptly obeyed but before a few fathoms had been coiled in the kites again became as steady as before with this change however that they travelled in a northwesterly direction  the value of the leeboards now became apparent  these were hinged down the middle so as to fold and become small enough to stow in the bottom of each boat when not in use  when unfolded and hung over the side they presented a surface of resistance to the water much greater than that of an ordinary boats keel so that very little leeway indeed was made  by means of the steeringoar captain vane kept his boat advancing straight northward while the kite was puffing in a northwesterly direction  the kite was thus compelled by the boat also to travel due north though of course it did so in a sidelong manner  thus far the advance continued prosperously the pace being but little checked and the course unaltered but when an hour or two later the wind again shifted so as to carry the kites further to the west the pace became much slower and the leeway or drift to leeward considerable  ultimately the wind blew straight to the west and the boats ceased to advance  this wont do uncle said leo who was close astern of the faith im drifting bodily to leeward and making no headway at all  down with the topsi mean the kites shouted the captain  pass the word to alf  accordingly the kites were reeled in the regulators being so pulled and eased off that they were kept just fluttering without tugging during the operation  when however they passed out of the windstratum into the region of calm which still prevailed immediately above the sea the kites descended in an alarming manner swaying to and fro with occasional wild swoops which rendered it necessary to haul in on the lines and reel up with the utmost speed  captain vane was very successful in this rather difficult operation while he hauled in the line benjy reeled it up with exemplary speed and the kite was finally made to descend on the boat like a cloud  when secured the lockingcross was removed the distendingrods were folded inwards the restraining or what we may term the waistband was applied and the whole affair was changed into a gigantic mrs gamp umbrella  being placed in the bow of the boat projecting over the water it formed a not ungraceful though peculiar bowsprit and was well out of the way  leo and butterface were equally successful but poor alf was not so fortunate  the too eager pursuit of knowledge was the cause of alfs failure as has often been the case with others  he took on himself as chief of his boat the difficult and responsible task of hauling in the linewhich involved also the occasional and judicious manipulation of the regulating cord when a sudden puff of wind should tend to send the kite soaring upwards with six or eight horsepower into the sky  to ivitchuk was assigned the easy task of gathering in the slack and holding on to alf if a sudden jerk should threaten to pull him overboard  anders reeled up  just as the kite was passing out of the windy region above into the calm region below alf beheld floating near the boat a beautiful and to him entirely new species of marine creature of the jellyfish kind  with a wild desire to possess it he leaned over the boats edge to the uttermost and stretched out his left hand while with his right he held on to the kite  need we say that the kite assisted himassisted him overboard altogether and sent him with a heavy plunge into the sea  ivitchuk dropped his line and stretched out both arms towards the spot where the kablunet had gone down  akeetolik roared  anders howled and dropped his reel  left to itself the kite with characteristic indecision made an awful swoop towards the north pole with its right shoulder  changing its mind it then made a stupendous rush with its left to the southeast  losing presence of mind it suddenly tossed up its tail and coming down head foremost went with fatal facility into the deep sea  when alf rose and was dragged panting into the boat his first glance was upwardsbut not in thankfulness for his preservation  gone he groaned rising to his feet  but the kite was not gone  the word had barely left his lips when it rose half its length out of the water and then fell in melancholy inaptitude for further mischief flat upon the sea  anything damaged asked the captain as he and leo rowed their boats towards the charity  nothing replied alf with a guilty look the stick and things seem to be all right but it has got awfully wet  no matter said the captain laughing at alfs forlorn look the sun will soon dry it  so long as nothing is broken or torn well get on very well  but now boys we must go to work with oars  there must be no flagging in this dash for the pole  its a neckornothing business now mark my orders  although weve got four oars apiece we must only work two at a time  i know that young bloods like you are prone to go straining yourselves at first an then bein fit for nothing afterwards  we must keep it up steadily  two in each boat will pull at a time for one hour while the other two rest or sleep and so on shift about till another breeze springs up  dont fold it up tight alf leave it pretty slack till it is dry and then put on its belt  dont you think we might have supper before taking to the oars suggested leo  i second that motion cried benjy  and i support it said alf  very good get out the prog an well lay ourselves alongside three abreast as nelson did at the battle o the nile said the captain  their food was simple but sufficient  pemmicana solid greasy nutricious compoundwas the foundation  hard biscuit chocolate and sugar formed the superstructure  in default of fire these articles could be eaten cold but while their supply of spirits of wine lasted a patent vesuvian of the most complete and almost miraculous nature could provide a hot meal in ten minutes  of fresh water they had a twoweeks supply in casks but this was economised by means of excellent water procured from a pond in a passing bergfrom which also a lump of clear ice had been hewn wrapped in a blanket and carried into the captains boat as a supply of fresh water in solid form  laying the oars across the boats to keep them together they floated thus pleasantly on the glassy sea bathed in midnight sunshine  and while they feasted in comfort inexpressibleto the surprise no doubt of surrounding gulls and puffinsbenjamin vane once again gave utterance to the opinion that it was the most glorious and altogether astonishing state of things that he had ever heard or dreamed of since the world began    chapter thirteen  a gale and a narrow escape  this is a world of alternations  we need not turn aside to prove that the calm with which the voyage of our discoverers began lasted about four days and nights during which period they advanced sometimes slowly under oars sometimes more or less rapidly under kitesif we may so express itaccording to the state of the wind  and during all that time the discipline of two and twoat watch or at sleep if not at workwas rigidly kept up  for none knew better than captain vane the benefit of discipline and the demoralising effect of its absence especially in trying circumstances  it is but just to add that he had no difficulty in enforcing his laws  it is right also to state that the women were not required to conform even although they were accustomed to hard labour and willing to work as much as required in all three boats the bow was set apart as the womens quarters and when toolooha oblooria or tekkona showed symptoms of a desire to go to sleepthere was no retiring for the night in these latitudesa blanket stretched on two oars cut their quarters off from those of the men and maintained the dignity of the sex  but soon the serene aspect of nature changed  grey clouds overspread the hitherto sunny sky  gusts of wind came sweeping over the sea from time to time and signs of coming storm became so evident that the captain gave orders to make all snug and prepare for dirty weather  you see lads he said when the three boats were abreast and the kites had been furled we dont know what may happen to us now  nobody in the world has had any experience of these latitudes  it may come on to blow twentyton armstrongs instead of great guns for all we know to the contrary  the lightning may be sheet and fork mixed instead of separate for any light weve got on the subject and it may rain whales and walruses instead of cats and dogs so it behoves us to be ready  thats true father said benjy but it matters little to me for ive made my will  only i forgot to leave the top with the broken peg and the rusty penknife to rumty swillpipe so if you survive me and get home on a whales backor otherwiseyoull know what to do  this is not a time for jesting ben said alf rather seriously  did i say it was inquired ben with a surprised look  alf deigned no reply and butterface laughed while he and the others set about executing the captains orders  the arrangements made in these indiarubber boats for bad weather were very simple and complete  after the lading in each had been snugly arranged so as to present as flat a surface on the top as possible a waterproof sheet was drawn over all and its edges made fast to the sides of the boat by means of tags and loops which were easily fastened and detached  as each sheet overhung its boat any water that might fall upon it was at once run off  this of course was merely put on to protect the cargo and any one who chose to take shelter under it  the boat being filled with air required no such sheet because if filled to overflowing it would still have floated  all round this sheet ran a strong cord for the crew who sat outside of it as on a raft to lay hold of if the waves should threaten to wash them off  there were also various other ropes attached to it for the same purpose and loops of rope served for rowlocks  when all had been arranged those whose duty it was to rest leaned comfortably against the lumps caused by inequalities of the cargo while the others took to their oars  its coming cried benjy about halfanhour after all had been prepared  and unquestionably it was coming  the boys quick eyes had detected a line on the southern horizon which became gradually broader and darker as it rose until it covered the heavens  at the same time the indigo ripple caused by a rushing mighty wind crept steadily over the sea  as it neared the boats the white crests of breaking waves were seen gleaming sharply in the midst of the dark blue  clap the women under hatches shouted the captain with more good sense than refinement  benjy butterface and anders at the word lifted a corner of their respective sheets  obedient toolooha oblooria and tekkona bent their meek heads and disappeared the sheets were refastened and the men taking their places held on to the cords or lifelines  it was an anxious moment  no one could guess how the boats would behave under the approaching trial  oars out cried the captain we must run before it  a hiss which had been gradually increasing as the squall drew near broke into a kind of roar and wind and waves rushed upon them as the men bent their backs to the oars with all their might  it was soon found that the boats had so little hold of the water that the wind and oars combined carried them forward so fast as to decrease considerably the danger of being whelmed by a falling wave  these waves increased every moment in size and their crests were so broken and cut off by the gale that the three boats instead of appearing as they had hitherto done the only solid objects in the scene were almost lost to sight in the chaos of black waves and driving foam  although they tried their best to keep close together they failed and each soon became ignorant of the position of the others  the last that they saw of alfs boat was in the hollow between two seas like a vanishing cormorant or a northern diver  leo was visible some time longer  he was wielding the steeringoar in an attitude of vigorous caution while his eskimos were pulling as if for their lives  an enormous wave rose behind them curled over their heads and appeared ready to overwhelm them but the sturdy rowers sent the boat forward and the broken crest passed under them  the next billow was still larger  taken up though he was with his own boat the captain found time to glance at them with horror  theyre gone he cried as the top of the billow fell and nothing was seen save the heads of the four men like dark spots on the foam  the boat had in truth been overwhelmed and sunk but like a true lifeboat it rose to the surface like a cork the instant the weight of water was removed and her crew who had held on to the lifelines and oars were still safe  well done the little hope cried the captain while benjy gave vent to his feelings in a cheer which was evidently heard by leo for he was seen to wave his hand in reply  next moment another wave hid the hope from view and it was seen no more at that time  i feel easier now benjy thank god after that  alf is a fair steersman and our boats are evidently able to stand rough usage  benjy made no reply  he was rubbing the water out of his eyes and anxiously looking through the thick air in the hope of seeing leos boat again  the poor boy was grave enough now  when the might and majesty of the creator are manifested in the storm and the raging sea the merely humorous fancies of man are apt to be held in check  the captains boat went rushing thus wildly onwards still fortunately in the right direction and for some hours there was no decrease in the force of the gale  then instead of abating as might have been expected it suddenly increased to such an extent that speedy destruction appeared to be inevitable  no sort o craft could live long in this muttered the captain as if to himself rather than to his son who sat with a firm expression on his somewhat pale countenance looking wistfully towards the northern horizon  perhaps he was wondering whether it was worth while to risk so much for such an end  suddenly he shaded his eyes with his hand and gazed intently  land he exclaimed in a low eager tone  whereaway boy  ay so there is something there  what say you chingatok  is it land  the giant who during all this time had calmly plied a pair of oars with strength equal almost to that of four men looked over his shoulder without however relaxing his efforts  no he said turning round again it is an icehill  a berg exclaimed the captain  we will make for it  tie your handkerchief benjy to the end of an oar and hold it up  it will serve as a guide to our comrades  in a wonderfully short space of time the berg which benjy had seen as a mere speck on the horizon rose sharp rugged and white against the black sky  it was a very large oneso large that it had no visible motion but seemed as firm as a rock while the billows of the arctic ocean broke in thunder on its glassy shore  well get shelter behind it ben my boy said the captain hold the oar well up and dont let the rag clap round the blade  shake it out so  god grant that they may see it  amen ejaculated benjy to the prayer with heartfelt intensity  there was danger as well as safety in the near vicinity to this berg for many of its pinnacles seemed ready to fall and there was always the possibility of a mass being broken off under water which might destroy the equilibrium of the whole berg and cause it to revolve with awfully destructive power  however there was one favourable pointthe base was broad and the icecliffs that bordered the sea were not high  in a few more minutes the western end of the berg was passed  its last cape was rounded and the faith was swept by the united efforts of chingatok benjy and toolooha who would not remain under cover into the comparatively still water on the lee or northern side of the berg  hurrah shouted benjy in a tone that was too energetic and peculiar to have been called forth by the mere fact of his own escape from danger  captain vane looked in the direction indicated by the boys glistening eyesglistening with the salt tears of joy as well as with salt sea sprayand there beheld the other two boats coming dancing in like wild things on the crests of the heaving waves  they had seen the signal of the handkerchief understood and followed it and in a few minutes more were under the lee of the icecliffs thanking god and congratulating each other on their deliverance  a sheltered cove was soon found far enough removed from cliffs and pinnacles to insure moderate safety  into this they ran and there they spent the night serenaded by the roaring gale and lullabied by the crash of falling spires and the groans of rending ice    chapter fourteen  records a wonderful apparition but a furious night  when the storm had passed a profound calm once more settled down on the face of nature as if the elements had been utterly exhausted by the conflict  once more the sea became like a sheet of undulating glass in which clouds and sun and boats were reflected vividly and once again our voyagers found themselves advancing towards the north abreast of each other and rowing sociably together at the rate of about four miles an hour  when advancing under oars they went thus abreast so as to converse freely but when proceeding under kites they kept in single file so as to give scope for swerving in the event of sudden change of wind and to prevent the risk of the entanglement of lines  what is that exclaimed benjy pointing suddenly to an object ahead which appeared at regular intervals on the surface of the water  a whale i think said leo  a whale usually spouts on coming up doesnt it said alf  chingatok uttered an unpronounceable eskimo word which did not throw light on the subject  what is it anders shouted the captain  what you say asked the interpreter from alfs boat which was on the other side of the hope  if these squawkin things would hold their noise youd hear better growled the captain before repeating the question  his uncourteous remark had reference to a cloud of gulls which circled round and followed the boats with remonstrative cries and astonished looks  its beast shouted anders not knows his name in ingliss  humph a man with half an eye might see it is beast retorted the captain in an undertone  as he spoke the beast changed its course and bore down upon them  as it drew near the englishmen became excited for the size of the creature seemed beyond anything they had yet seen  strange to say the eskimos looked at it with their wonted gaze of calm indifference  its the great seaserpent at last said benjy with something like awe on his countenance  it does look uncommon like it replied the captain with a perplexed expression on his rugged visage  get out the rifles lad  its as well to be ready  dye know what it is chingatok  again the giant uttered the unpronounceable name while benjy got out the firearms with eager haste  load em all ben load em all an cram the winchester to the muzzle said the captain  theres no sayin what we may have to encounter though i have heard of a gigantic bit of seaweed bein mistaken for the great seaserpent before now  that may be father said benjy with increasing excitement but nobody ever saw a bit of seaweed swim with the activity of a gigantic eel like that  why i have counted its coils as they rise and sink and im quite sure its a hundred and fifty yards long if its an inch  those in the other boats were following the captains examplegetting out and charging the firearmsand truly there seemed some ground for their alarm for the creature which approached at a rapid rate appeared most formidable  yet strange to say the eskimos paid little attention to it and seemed more taken up with the excitement of the white men  when the creature had approached to within a quarter of a mile it diverged a little to the left and passed the boats at the distance of a few hundred yards  then captain vane burst into a sudden laugh and shouted  grampuses  what cried leo  grampuses repeated the captain  why its only a shoal of grampuses following each other in single file that weve mistaken for one creature  never before was man or boy smitten with heavier disappointment than was poor benjy vane on that trying occasion  why whats wrong with you benjy asked his father as he looked at his woeful countenance  to think said the poor boy slowly that ive come all the way to the north pole for this  why ive believed in the great seaserpent since ever i could think ive seen pictures of it twisting its coils round threemasted ships and goin over the ocean with a mane like a lion and its head fifty feet out o the water  oh its too bad id have given my ears to have seen the great seaserpent  there wouldnt have been much of you left benjy if you had given them  well well continued the boy not noticing his fathers remark its some comfort to know that ive all but seen the great seaserpent  it is some comfort to us reader to be able to record the fact that benjy vane was not doomed to total disappointment on that memorable day for on the same evening the voyagers had an encounter with walruses which more than made up for the previous misfortune  it happened thus  the three boats were proceeding abreast slowly but steadily over the still calm sea when their attention was attracted by a sudden and tremendous splash or upheaval of water just off what the captain styled his port bow  at the same moment the head of a walrus appeared on the surface like a gigantic black bladder  it seemed to be as large as the head of a small elephant and its ivory tusks were not less than two feet long  there was a square bluntness about the creatures head and a savage look about its little bloodshot eyes which gave to it a very hideous aspect  its bristling moustache each hair of which was six inches long and as thick as a crow quill dripped with brine and it raised itself high out of the water turning its head from side to side with a rapidity and litheness of action that one would not have expected in an animal so unwieldy  evidently it was looking eagerly for something  catching sight of the three boats it seemed to have found what it looked for and made straight at them  leo quietly got ready his winchester repeater a rifle which as the reader probably knows can discharge a dozen or more shots in rapid succession the cartridges being contained in a case resembling a thick ramrod under the barrel from which they are thrust almost instantaneously into their places  but before the creature gained the boats a second great upheaval of water took place and another walrus appeared  this was the real enemy of whom he had been in quest  both were bulls of the largest and most ferocious description  no sooner did they behold each other than with a roar something betwixt a bark and a bellow they collided and a furious fight began  the sea was churned into foam around them as they rolled reared spurned and drove their tusks into each others skulls and shoulders  the boats lay quietly by their occupants looking on with interest  the eskimos were particularly excited but no one spoke or acted  they all seemed fascinated by the fight  soon one and another and another walrushead came up out of the sea and then it was understood that a number of cow walruses had come to witness the combat  but the human audience paid little regard to these so much were they engrossed by the chief actors  it might have been thought from the position of their tusks which are simply an enlargement and prolongation of the canine teeth that these combatants could only strike with them in a downward direction but this was not so  on the contrary they turned their thick necks with so much ease and rapidity that they could strike in all directions with equal force and numerous were the wounds inflicted on either side as the bloodred foam soon testified  we have said that the human spectators of the scene remained inactive but at the first pause the captain said he thought they might as well put a stop to the fight and advised leo to give one of them a shot  well not be the worse for a fresh steak he added to benjy as leo was taking aim  the effect of the shot was very unexpected  one of the bulls was hit but evidently not in a deadly manner for the motion of the boat had disturbed leos aim  each combatant turned with a look of wild surprise at the interruptor and as not unfrequently happens in cases of interference with fights both made a furious rush at him  at the same moment all the cows seemed to be smitten with pugnacity and joined in the attack  there was barely time to get ready when the furious animals were upon them  guns and rifles were pointed axes and spears grasped and oars gripped  even the women seized each a spear and stood on the defensive  a simultaneous volley checked the enemy for a moment and sent one of the cows to the bottom but with a furious bellow they charged again  the great anxiety of the defenders was to prevent the monsters from getting close to the boats so as to hook on to them with their tusks which would probably have overturned them or penetrated the inflated sides  in either case destruction would have been inevitable and it was only by the active use of oar axe and spear that this was prevented  twice did one of the bulls charge the captains boat and on both occasions he was met by the tremendous might of chingatok who planted the end of an oar on his blunt nose and thrust him off  on each occasion also he received a shot from the double barrel of benjy who fired the first time into his open mouth and the second time into his eye but an angry cough from the one and a wink from the other showed that he did not mind it much  meantime the captain with the winchester repeater was endeavouringbut vainly owing to the motions of the giant and the swaying of the boatto get a shot at the beast while toolooha with an axe was coquetting with a somewhat timid cow near the stern  at last an opportunity offered  captain vane poured half a dozen balls as quick as he could fire into the head of the bull which immediately sank  not less vigorously did the occupants of the other boats receive the charge  leo being more active than the captain as well as more expert with his repeater slew his male opponent in shorter time and with less expenditure of ammunition  butterface too gained much credit by the prompt manner in which he split the skull of one animal with an axe even oblooria the timid rose to the occasion and displayed unlookedfor heroism  with a barbed sealspear she stood up and invited a baby walrus to come onby looks not by words  the baby accepted the invitationperhaps being a pugnacious baby it was coming on at any rateand oblooria gave it a vigorous dab on the nose  it resented the insult by shaking its head fiercely and endeavouring to back off but the barb had sunk into the wound and held on  oblooria also held on oolichuk having just driven off a cow walrus happened to observe the situation and held on to oblooria  the baby walrus was secured and almost as soon as the old bull was slain had a line attached to it and was made fast to the stern  well done little girl exclaimed oolichuk in admiration youre almost as good as a man  among civilised people this might have been deemed a doubtful compliment but it was not so in eskimoland  the little maid was evidently much pleased and the title of the timid one which oolichuk was wont to give her when in a specially endearing frame of mind was changed for the brave one from that day  in a few more minutes the last charge of the enemy was repulsed and those of them that remained alive dived back to that native home into which the slain had already sunk  thus ended that notable fight with walruses  after consummating the victory with three cheers and congratulating each other the conquerors proceeded to examine into the extent of damage received  it was found that beyond a few scratches the faith and the hope had escaped scathless but the charity had suffered considerably  besides a bad rip in the upper part of the gunwale a small hole had been poked in her side below water and her airchamber was filling rapidly  come here quick uncle cried alf in consternation when he discovered this  to his surprise the captain was not so much alarmed as he had expected  it wont sink you alf so keep your mind easy he said while examining the injury  you see i took care to have the boats made in compartments  it will only make you go lopsided like a lame duck till i can repair the damage  repair it uncle how can  never mind just now hand out a blanket quick ill explain after we must undergird her and keep out as much water as we can  this operation was soon accomplished  the blanket was passed under the boat and made fast  by pressing against the injured part it checked the inflow of water  then the cargo was shifted and part of it was transferred to the other boats and soon they were advancing as pleasantly though not as quickly as before while the captain explained that he had brought a solution of guttapercha for the express purpose of repairing damages to the boats but that it was impossible to use it until they could disembark either on land or on an iceberg  well come to another berg ere long no doubt shant we chingatok he asked  the eskimo shook his head and said he thought not but there was a small rocky islet not far from where they were though it lay somewhat out of their course  on hearing this the captain changed his course immediately and rowed in the direction pointed out  theres wind enough up there benjy remarked his father looking up to the sky where the higher clouds were seen rapidly passing the lower strata to the northward but how to get the kites set up in a dead calm is more than i can tell  there is a way out of the difficulty father said benjy pointing behind them  he referred to a slight breeze which was ruffling the sea into what are called cats paws far astern  right boy right  prepare to hoist your topsls lads shouted the captain  in a few minutes the kites were expanded and the towlines attached when the light breeze came up they all soared heavily it is true but majestically into the sky  soon reaching the upper regions they caught the steady breeze there and towed the boats along at the rate of eight or ten miles an hour  in two hours they sighted the islet which chingatok had mentioned and soon afterwards had landed and taken possession of it in the usual manner under the name of refuge island    chapter fifteen  discourses of deep things  the islet or rock for it was little more which the explorers had reached was low and extremely barren  nevertheless it had on it a large colony of seafowl which received the strangers with their wonted clamour of indignationif not of welcome  as it was near noon at the time the captain and leo went with their sextants to the highest part of the island to ascertain its position the eskimos set about making an encampment unloading the boats etcetera and alf with hammer and botanical box set off on a short ramble along the coast accompanied by benjy and butterface  sometimes these three kept together and chatted at other times they separated a little each attracted by some object of interest or following the lead it might have been of wayward fancy  but they never lost sight of each other and after a couple of hours converged as if by tacit consent until they met and sat down to rest on a ledge of rock  well i do like this sort o thing remarked benjy as he wiped his heated brow  there is something to me so pleasant and peaceful about a low rocky shore with the sun blazing overhead and the great sea stretching out flat and white in a dead calm with just ripple enough to let you know it is all alive and heartyonly resting like a goodhumoured and sleepy giant  why ben i declare you are becoming poetical said alf with a smile your conceptions correspond with those of buzzby who writes    great ocean slumbring in majestic calm   lies like a mightya mighty  ii fear ive forgotten  let me see    great ocean slumbring in majestic calm   lies like a mighty  giant in a dwalm suggested benjy  well change the subject said alf opening his botanical box and taking out several specimens of plants and rocks  see here are some bits of rock of a kind that are quite new to me  whats de use ob dem inquired butterface with a look of earnest simplicity  the use said benjy taking on himself to reply why you flatnosed grampus dont you know that these bits of rock are made for the express purpose of being carried home identified classified labelled stuck up in a museum and stared at by wondering ignoramuses who care nothing whatever about them and know less  geologists are constantly going about the world with their little hammers keeping up the supply  yes butterface said alf benjy is partly correct such specimens will be treated as he describes and be stared at in blank stupidity by hundreds of fellows like himself but they will also be examined and understood by geologists who from their profound knowledge of the plans which our creator seems to have had in arranging the materials of the earth are able to point out many interesting and useful facts which are not visible to the naked and unscientific eye such for instance as the localities where coal and other precious things may be found  kin dey tell whar gold is to be found massa alf  o yes they can tell that  den its dis yer chile as wishes said butterface with a sigh dat he was a jollygist  oh  butterface youre a jolly goose at all events said benjy wouldnt it be fun to go and discover a gold mine and dig up as much as would keep us in happy idleness all the rest of our lives  but i say alf have you nothing better than geological specimens in your boxno grubological specimens eh  alf replied by producing from his box a paper parcel which contained some of the required specimens in the shape of biscuit and pemmican  capital  well you are a good fellow alf  let us make a tablecloth of the papernow you undisciplined black dont glare so at the victuals else youll grow too hungry for a moderate supply  when the trio were in the full swing of vigorous feeding the negro paused with his mouth full to ask alf what would be the use of the north pole when it was discovered  make matches or firewood of it said benjy just as he was about to stop up his impudent mouth with a lump of pemmican  truly of what use the pole itself may besupposing it to exist in the form of a thing said alf i cannot tell but it has already been of great use in creating expeditions to the polar regions  you know well enough butterface for youve been round the capes of good hope and horn often enough what a long long voyage it is to the eastern seas on the other side of the world and what a saving of time and expense it would be if we could find a shorter route to those regions from which so many of our necessaries and luxuries come  now if we could only discover an open sea in the arctic regions which would allow our ships to sail in a straight line from england across the north pole to behrings straits the voyage to the east would be reduced to only about 5000 miles and we should be able to reach japan in three or four weeks just think what an advantage that would be to commerce  tea at twopence a pound an sugar to matchnot to mention molasses and baccy you ignorant nigger said benjypass the biscuits  an now massa alf said butterface with an eager look wes diskivered dis open seaeh  well it seems as if we had  but what good will it do us argued benjy becoming more earnest in the discussion if its all surrounded by a ring of ice such as we have passed over on sledges  if repeated alf in that if lies the whole question  no doubt enterprise has fought heroically for centuries to overleap this supposed ring of ice and science has stood expectant on the edge looking eagerly for the day when human perseverance shall reveal the secrets of the far north  it is true also that we at last appear to have penetrated into the great unknown but who shall say that the socalled icering has been fully examined  our explorations have been hitherto confined to one or two parts of it  we may yet find an everopen entrance to this open polar sea and our ships may yet be seen sailing regularly to and fro over the north pole  just so said benjy a north pole steam line once a month to japan and backfirst class accommodation for second class fares  walrus and white bear parties dropped on the way at the pole star hotel an easy trip from the pole itself which may be made in eskimo cabs in summer and reindeer sleighs in winter  return tickets available for six monthstouching at china india nova zembla kamtschatka and iceland splendid view of hecla and the great mer de glace of greenlandfogs permittingdont eat so much butterface else bustin will surely be your doom  your picture is perhaps a little overdrawn ben rejoined alf with a smile  so would the ancients have said retorted benjy if you had prophesied that in the nineteenth century our steamers would pass through the straits of hercules up the mediterranean and over the land to india or that our cousins steam cars would go rattling across the great prairies of america through the vast forests over and under the rocky mountains from the states to california in seven days or that the telephone or electric light should ever come into being  well you see butterface said alf there is a great deal to be said in favour of arctic exploration even at the present day and despite all the rebuffs that we have received  sir edward sabine one of the greatest arctic authorities says of the route from the atlantic to the pacific that it is the greatest geographical achievement which can be attempted and that it will be the crowning enterprise of those arctic researches in which england has hitherto had the preeminence  why butterface continued alf warming with his subject while the enthusiastic negro listened as it were with every feature of his expressive face and even the volatile benjy became attentive why there is no telling what might be the advantages that would arise from systematic exploration of these unknown regions which cover a space of not less than two million five hundred thousand square miles  it would advance the science of hydrography and help to solve some of the difficult problems connected with equatorial and polar currents  it would enable us it is said by a series of pendulum observations at or near the pole to render essential service to the science of geology to form a mathematical theory of the physical condition of the earth and to ascertain its exact conformation  it would probably throw light on the wonderful phenomena of magnetism and atmospheric electricity and the mysterious aurora borealisto say nothing of the flora of these regions and the animal life on the land and in the sea  why alf exclaimed benjy in surprise i had no idea you were so deeply learned on these subjects  deeply learned echoed alf with a laugh why i have only a smattering of them  just knowledge enough to enable me in some small degree to appreciate the vast amount of knowledge which i have yet to acquire  why do you look perplexed butterface  cause massa yous too deep for me altogidder  my brain no big nough to hold it all  and your skulls too thick to let it through to the little blob of brain that you do possess said benjy with a kindlycontemptuous look at his sable friend  oh flatnose youre a terrible thickhead  yous right dere massa replied the negro with a gratified smile at what he deemed a compliment  you should ha seed me dat time when i was leetle boy down in ole virginny whar dey riz me when my granmoder she foun me stickin my fist in de molassesjar an lickin it off she swarmed at me an fetch me one kick she did an sent me slap troo a pannel ob de loft door an tumbled me down de back stair whar i felled over de edge an landed on de top ob a tar barrel wich my head run into  i got on my legs i did wiv difficulty an runned away never a bit de worsenot even a headacheonly it was tree months afore i got dat tar rightly out o my wool  yes my heads tick nough  while butterface was speaking leo and the captain were seen approaching and the three rose to meet them  there was a grave solemnity in the captains look which alarmed them  nothing wrong i hope uncle said alf  wrong no lad theres nothing wrong  on the contrary everything is right  why where do you think we have got to  a hundred and fifty miles from the pole said alf  less less said leo with an excited look  we are not more said the captain slowly as he took off his hat and wiped his brow not more than a hundred and forty miles from it  then we could be there in three days or sooner with a good breeze cried benjy whose enthusiasm was aroused  ay ben if there was nothing in the way but its quite clear from what chingatok says that we are drawing near to his native land which cannot be more than fifty miles distant if so much  you remember he has told us his home is one of a group of islands some of which are large and some small some mountainous and others flat and swampy affording food and shelter to myriads of wildfowl so you see after we get there our progress northward through such a country without roads or vehicles wont be at the rate of ten miles an hour by any means  besides added leo it would not be polite to chingatoks countrymen if we were to leave them immediately after arriving  perhaps they would not let us go so i fear that we shant gain the end of our journey yet a while but that does not matter much for were sure to make it out at last  what makes the matter more uncertain resumed the captain as they sauntered back to camp is the fact that this northern archipelago is peopled by different tribes of eskimos some of whom are of a warlike spirit and frequently give the others trouble  however chingatok says we shall have no difficulty in reaching this nothingas he will insist on styling the pole ever since i explained to him that it was not a real but an imaginary point  i wonder how anders ever got him to understand what an imaginary point is said benjy  that has puzzled me too returned the captain but he did get it screwed into him somehow and the result isnothing  out of nothing nothing comes remarked leo as the giant suddenly appeared from behind a rock but assuredly nothing can beat chingatok in size or magnificence which is more than anything else can  the eskimo had been searching for the absentees to announce that dinner was ready and that toolooha was impatient to begin they all therefore quickened their pace and soon after came within scent of the savoury mess which had been prepared for them by the giants squat but amiable mother    chapter sixteen  arrival in poloeland  fortune which had hitherto proved favourable to our brave explorers did not desert them at the eleventh hour  soon after their arrival at refuge island a fair wind sprang up from the south and when the charity had been carefully patched and repaired the kites were sent up and the voyage was continued  that day and night they spent again upon the boundless sea for the island was soon left out of sight behind them though the wind was not very fresh  towards morning it fell calm altogether obliging them to haul down the kites and take to the oars  it cant be far off now chingatok said the captain who became rather impatient as the end drew near  not far was the brief reply  land ho shouted benjy about halfanhour after that  but benjy was forced to admit that anxiety had caused him to take an iceberg on the horizon for land  well anyhow you must admit said benjy on approaching the berg that its big enough for a fellow to mistake it for a mountain  i wonder what its doing here without any brothers or sisters to keep it company  undercurrents brought it here lad said the captain  you see such a monster as that must go very deep down and the warm undercurrent has not yet melted away enough of his base to permit the surfacecurrent to carry him south like the smaller members of his family  he is still travelling north but that wont last long  hell soon become small enough to put about and go the other way  i never saw a bigger fellow than that benjy  hayes the american mentions one which he measured about 315 feet high and nearly a mile long  it had been grounded for two years  he calculated that there must have been seven times as much of it below water as there was above so that it was stranded in nearly halfamile depth of water  this berg cannot be far short of that one in size  hm probably then his little brothers and sisters are being now crushed to bits in baffins bay said benjy  not unlikely ben if theyve not already been melted in the atlantic which will be this ones fate at lastsooner or later  from a pool on this berg they obtained a supply of pure fresh water  when our explorers did at last sight the land it came upon them unexpectedly in the form of an island so low that they were quite close before observing it  the number of gulls hovering above it might have suggested its presence but as these birds frequently hover in large flocks over shoals of small fish little attention was paid to them  is this your native land chingatok asked the captain quickly  no it is over there said the eskimo pointing to the distant horizon this is the first of the islands  as they gazed they perceived a mountainshaped cloud so faint and far away that it had almost escaped observation  advancing slowly this cloud was seen to take definite form and colour  i knew it was said benjy but was afraid of making another mistake  had the boy or his father looked attentively at the giant just then they would have seen that his colour deepened his eyes glittered and his great chest heaved a little more than was its wont as he looked over his shoulder while labouring at the oars  perhaps we should have said played with the oars for they were mere toys in his grasp chingatoks little mother also was evidently affected by the sight of home  but the captain and his son saw it notthey were too much occupied with their own thoughts and feelings  to the englishmen the sight of land roused only one great allengrossing thoughtthe north pole which despite the absurdity of the idea would present itself in the form of an upright post of terrific magnitudea worthy axletree as it were for the world to revolve upon  to the big eskimo land presented itself in the form of a palatial stone edifice measuring fifteen feet by twelve with a dear pretty little wife choking herself in the smoke of a cookinglamp and a darling little boy choking himself with a mass of walrus blubber  thus the same object when presented to different minds suggested ideas that were    diverse as calm from thunder   wide as the poles asunder  it was midnight when the boats drew near to land  the island in which stood the giants humble home seemed to captain vane not more than eight or ten miles in extent and rose to a moderate heightapparently about five or six hundred feet  it was picturesque in form and composed of rugged rocks the marks on which and the innumerable boulders everywhere showed that at some remote period of the worlds history it had been subjected to the influence of glacial action  no glacier was visible now howeveronly on the rocky summit lay a patch or two of the last winters snowdrift which was too deep for the summer sun to melt away  from this storehouse of water gushed numerous tiny rivulets which brawled cheerily rather than noisily among the rocks watering the rich green mosses and grasses which abounded in patches everywhere and giving life to countless wildflowers and berries which decked and enriched the land  just off the islandwhich by a strange coincidence the inhabitants had named poloethere were hundreds of other islets of every shape and size but nearly all of them low and many flat and swampythe breedinggrounds of myriads of waterfowl  there were lakelets in many of these isles in the midst of which were still more diminutive islets whose mosscovered rocks and fringing sedges were reflected in the crystal water  under a cliff on the main island stood the eskimo village a collection of stone huts bathed in the slanting light of the midnight sun  but no sound issued from these huts or from the neighbouring islands it was the period of rest for man and bird  air earth and water were locked in profound silence and repose  weve got to paradise at last father was the first sound that broke the silence if we except the gentle dip of the oars and the rippling water on the bow  looks like it benjy replied the captain  a wakeful dog on shore was the first to scent the coming strangers  he gave vent to a low growl  it was the keynote to the canine choir which immediately sent up a howl of discord  forthwith from every hut there leaped armed men anxious women and terrified children which latter rushed towards the cliffs or took refuge among the rocks  hallo  chingatok your relations are not to be taken by surprise said the captainor something to that effectin eskimo  the giant shook his head somewhat gravely  they must be at war he said  at war whom with  with the neerdoowulls replied chingatok with a frown  they are always giving us trouble  not badly named father said benjy one would almost think they must be of scotch extraction  at that moment the nativeswho had been gesticulating wildly and brandishing spears and bone knives with expressions of fury that denoted a strong desire on their part to carve out the hearts and transfix the livers of the newcomerssuddenly gave vent to a shout of surprise which was succeeded by a scream of joy  chingatok had stood up in the boat and been recognised  the giants dogan appropriately large one had been the first to observe him and expressed its feelings by wagging its tail to such an extent that its hind legs had difficulty in keeping the ground  immediately on landing the party was surrounded by a clamorous crew who to do them justice took very little notice of the strangers so overjoyed were they at the return of their big countryman  soon a little pleasant though flattishfaced woman pushed through the crowd and seized the giant  this was his wife pingasuk or pretty one she was petitenot much larger than oblooria the timid  the better to get at her chingatok went down on his knees seized her by the shoulders and rubbed her nose against his so vigorously that the smaller nose bid fair to come off altogether  he had to stoop still lower when a stout urchin of about five years of age came up behind him and tried to reach his face  meltik exclaimed the giant rubbing noses gently for fear of damaging him you are stout and fat my son you have been eating much blubber good  at that moment chingatoks eyes fell on an object which had hitherto escaped his observation  it was a little round yellow head in his wifes hood with a pair of small black eyes which stared at him in blank surprise  he made a snatch at it and drew fortha naked baby  our girlie said the wife with a pleased but anxious look dont squeeze  she is very young and tenderlike a baby seal  the glad father tried to fold the creature to his bosom nearly dropped it in his excess of tender caution thrust it hastily back into his wifes hood and rose to give a respectful greeting to an aged man with a scrubby white beard who came forward at the moment  who are these my son asked the old man pointing to the englishmen who standing in a group with amused expressions watched the meeting above described  these are the kablunets father  i met them as i expected in the faroff land  the poor creatures were wandering about in a great kayak which they have lost searching for nothing  searching for nothing my son that cannot be  it is not possible to search for nothingat least it is not possible to find it  but that is what they come here for persisted chingatok they call it the nort pole  and what is the nort pole my son  it is nothing father  the old man looked at his stately son with something of anxiety mingled with his surprise  has chingatok become a fool like the kablunets since he left home he asked in a low voice  chingatok is not sure replied the giant gravely  he has seen so much to puzzle him since he went away that he sometimes feels foolish  the old eskimo looked steadily at his son for a few moments and shook his head  i will speak to these menthese foolish men he said  do they understand our language  some of them understand and speak a little father but they have with them one named unders who interprets  come here unders  anders promptly stepped to the front and interpreted while the old eskimo put captain vane through an examination of uncommon length and severity  at the close of it he shook his head with profound gravity and turned again to his son  you have indeed brought to us a set of fools chingatok  your voyage to the faroff lands has not been very successful  these men want something that they do not understand that they could not see if it was before them that they cannot describe when they talk about it and that they could not lay hold of if they had it  yes father sighed chingatok it is as i told younothing only the nort polea mere name  a new light seemed to break in on chingatok as he said this for he added quickly but father a name is somethingmy name chingatok is something yet it is nothing  you cannot see it you do not lay hold of it yet it is there  toohoo my son that is so no doubt but your name describes you and you are something  no one ever goes to a faroff land to search for a name  if this nort pole is only a name and not a thing how can it be exclaimed the old man turning on his heel and marching off in a paroxysm of metaphysical disgust  he appeared to change his mind however for turning abruptly back he said to anders tell these strangers that i am glad to see them that a house and food shall be given to them and that they are welcome to poloe  perhaps their landthe faroff landis a poor one they may not have enough to eat  if so they may stay in this rich land of mine to hunt and fish as long as they please  but tell them that the eskimos love wise men and do not care for foolishness  they must not talk any more about this search after nothingthis nort polethis nonsense huk  having delivered himself of these sentiments with much dignity the old man again turned on his heel with a regal wave of the hand and marched up to his hut  that must be the king of poloe whispered captain vane to leo endeavouring to suppress a smile at the concluding caution as they followed anders and one of the natives to the hut set apart for them  the captain was only half right  amalatok was indeed the chief of the island but the respect and deference shown to him by the tribe were owing more to the mans age and personal worth than to his rank  he had succeeded his father as chief of the tribe and during a long life had led his people in council at the hunt and in war with consummate ability and success  although old he still held the reins of power chiefly because his eldest son and rightful successorchingatoks elder brotherwas a weakminded man of little capacity and somewhat malignant disposition  if our giant had been his eldest he would have resigned cheerfully long ago  as it was he did not see his way to change the customs of the land though he could not tell when or by whom or under what circumstances the order of succession had been established probably like many other antiquated customs it had been originally the result of despotism on the part of men in power and of stupid acquiescence on the part of an unthinking people  on reaching his hut the old chief sat down and leaning carelessly against the wall he toyed with a bit of walrus rib as an englishman might with a pair of nutcrackers at dessert  why did you bring these barbarians here  i did not bring them father they brought me said the son with a deprecating glance  huk exclaimed the chief after which he added hum  it was evident that he had received new light and was meditating thereon  my son continued amalatok these kablunets seem to be stoutbodied fellows can they fightare they brave  they are brave father very brave  even the little one whom they call bunjay is bravealso he is funny  i have never seen the kablunets fight with men but they fight well with the bear and the walrus and the ice  they are not such fools as you seem to think true about this nothingthis nort polethey are quite mad but in other matters they are very wise and knowing as you shall see before long  good good remarked the old chief flinging the walrus rib at an intrusive dog with signal success i am glad to hear you say that because i may want their help  amalatok showed one symptom of true greatnessa readiness to divest himself of prejudice  for what do you require their help father asked chingatok  instead of answering the old chief wrenched off another walrus rib from its native backbone and began to gnaw it growlingly as if it were his enemy and he a dog  my father is disturbed in his mind said the giant in a sympathising tone  even a less observant man than chingatok might have seen that the old chief was not only disturbed in mind but also in body for his features twitched convulsively and his face grew red as he thought of his wrongs  listen said amalatok flinging the rib at another intrusive dog again with success and laying his hand impressively on his sons arm my enemy grabantakthat bellowing walrus that sly seal that emptyskulled puffin that porpoise cormorant narwhalsssus  the old man set his teeth and hissed  well my father  it is not well my son  it is all ill  that marrowless bear is stirring up his people and there is no doubt that we shall soon be again engaged in a bloodya useless war  what is it all about father  aboutabout nothing  huk about nort polenothing murmured chingatokhis thoughts diverted by the word  no it is worse than nort pole worse than nothing returned the chief sternly it is a small islandvery smallso small that a seal would not have it for a breathingplace  nothing on it no moss no grass birds wont stay thereonly fly over it and wink with contempt  yet grabantak says he must have itit is within the bounds of his land  well let him have it if it be so worthless said chingatok mildly  let him have it shouted the chief starting up with such violence as to overturn the cookinglampto which he paid no regard whateverand striding about the small hut savagely no never  i will fight him to the last gasp kill all his men slay his women drown his children level his huts burn up his meat  amalatok paused and glared apparently uncertain about the propriety of wasting good meat  the pause gave his wrath time to cool  at all events he continued sitting down again and wrenching off another rib we must call a council and have a talk for we may expect him soon  when you arrived we took you for our enemies  and you were ready for us said chingatok with an approving smile  huk returned the chief with a responsive nod  go chingatok call a council of my braves for tonight and see that these miserable starving kablunets have enough of blubber wherewith to stuff themselves  our giant did not deem it worth while to explain to his rather petulant father that the englishmen were the reverse of starving but he felt the importance of raising them in the old chiefs opinion without delay and took measures accordingly  blackbeard he said entering the captains hut and sitting down with a troubled air my father does not think much of you  tell him that unders  i understand you well enough chingatok go on and let me know why the old man does not think well of me  he thinks you are a fool returned the plain spoken eskimo  hm  im not altogether surprised at that lad  ive sometimes thought so myself  well i suppose youve come to give me some good advice to make me wisereh  chingatok  yes that is what i come for  do what i tell you and my father will begin to think you wise  ah yes the old story remarked benjy who was an amused listener for his father translated in a low tone for the benefit of his companions as the conversation proceededthe same here as everywhere do as i tell you and all will be well  hold your tongue ben whispered alf  well what am i to do asked the captain  invite my father to a feast said chingatok eagerly and me too and my mother too also my wife and some of the braves with their wives and you must give us biskit anwhat do you call that brown stuff  coffee suggested the captain  yes cuffy also tee and shoogre and seal st atewhat  steakeh  yes stik and cook them all in the strange lamp  you must ask us to see the feast cooked and then we will eat it  it will be observed that when chingatok interpolated english words in his discourse his pronunciation was not perfect  well you are the coolest fellow ive met with for many a day  to order a feast invite yourself to it name the rest of the company as well as the victuals and insist on seeing the cooking of the same said the captain in english then in eskimowell chingatok i will do as you wish  when would you like supper  now replied the giant with decision  you hear butterface said the captain when he had translated go to work and get your pots and pans ready  see that you put your best foot foremost  it will be a turningpoint this feast i see  need we say that the feast was a great success  the wives highly pleased at the attention paid them by the strangers were won over at once  the whole party when assembled in the hut watched with the most indescribable astonishment the proceedings of the negrohimself a living miracleas he manipulated a machine which in separate compartments cooked steaks and boiled tea coffee or anything else by means of a spirit lamp in a few minutes  on first tasting the hot liquids they looked at each other suspiciously then as the sugar tickled their palates they smiled tilted their pannikins drained them to the dregs and asked for more  the feast lasted long and was highly appreciated  when the company retiredwhich did not happen until the captain declared he had nothing more to give them and turned the cooking apparatus upside down to prove what he saidthere was not a man or woman among them who did not hold and even loudly assert that the kablunets were wise men  after the feast the council of war was held and the strangers were allowed to be present  there was a great deal of talkprobably some of it was not much to the point but there was no interruption or undignified confusion  there was a peaceparty of course and a warparty but the latter prevailed  it too often does so in human affairs  chingatok was understood to favour the peaceparty but as his sire was on the other side respect kept him tonguetied  these eskimos reverence age and are respectful to women whispered leo to alf so we may not call them savages  the old chief spoke last summing up the arguments as it were on both sides and giving his reasons for favouring war  the island is of no use he said it is not worth a seals nose yet grabantak wishes to tear it from usus who have possessed it since the forgotten times  why is this because he wishes to insult us huk from the audience  shall we submit to insult shall we sit down like frightened birds and see the blacklivered cormorant steal what is ours shall the courage of the poloes be questioned by all the surrounding tribes  never while we have knives in our boots and spears in our hands  we will fight till we conquer or till we are all deadtill our wives are husbandless and our children fatherless and all our stores of meat and oil are gone  huk huk then shall it be said by surrounding tribes behold how brave were the poloes they died and left their wives and little children to perish or mourn in slavery rather than submit to insult  the huks that greeted the conclusion of the speech were so loud and numerous that the unfortunate peacemakers were forced to hide their diminished heads  thus did amalatok resolve to go to war for worse than nort polefor nothingrather than submit to insult  see note 1    note 1  it may not be inappropriate here to point out that eskimo savages are sometimes equalled if not surpassed in this respect by civilised and even christian nations    chapter seventeen  the effect of persuasion on diverse characters  the warlike tendencies of grabantak the northern savage had the effect of compelling captain vane and his party to delay for a considerable time their efforts to reach the pole  this was all the more distressing that they had by that time approached so very near to it  a carefully made observation placed the island of poloe in latitude 88 degrees 30 minutes 10 seconds about 90 geographical or 104 english statute miles from the pole  there was no help for it however  to have ventured on grabantaks territory while war was impending would have been to court destruction captain vane saw therefore that the only way of advancing his own cause was to promote peace between the tribes  with a view to this he sought an interview with the old chief amalatok  why do you wish to go to war he asked  i do not wish to go to war answered the chief frowning fiercely  why do you go then said the captain in a soothing tone for he was very anxious not to rouse the chiefs anger but he was unsuccessful for the question seemed to set the old man on fire  he started up grinding his teeth and striding about his hut knocking over pots oil cans and cookinglamps somewhat like that famous bull which got into a china shop  finding the space too small for him he suddenly dropped on his knees crept through the low entrance sprang up and began to stride about more comfortably  the open air calmed him a little  he ceased to grind his teeth and stopping in front of the captain who had followed him said in a low growl do you think i will submit to insult  some men have occasionally done so with advantage answered the captain  kablunets may do so eskimos never returned the old man resuming his hurried walk to and fro and the grinding of his teeth again  if amalatok were to kill all his enemiesall the men women and children said the captain raising a fierce gleam of satisfaction in the old mans face at the mere suggestion and if he were to knock down all their huts and burn up all their kayaks and oomiaks the insult would still remain because an insult can only be wiped out by ones enemy confessing his sin and repenting  for a few seconds amalatok stood silent his eyes fixed on the ground as if he were puzzled  the white man is right he said at length but if i killed them all i should be avenged  vengeance is mine saith the lord leaped naturally to the captains mind but reflecting that the man before him was a heathen who would not admit the value of the quotation he paused a moment or two  and what he then said if grabantak should kill amalatok and all his men and carry away the women and children into slavery would the insult be wiped out in that case  would it not rather be deepened  true it would but then we should all be deadwe should not care  the men would all be dead truly returned the captain but perhaps the women and children left behind might care  they would also suffer  go go said the eskimo chief losing temper as he lost ground in the argument what can kablunets know about such matters  you tell me you are men of peace that your religion is a religion of peace  of course then you understand nothing about war  go i have been insulted and i must fight  seeing that it would be fruitless talking to the old chief while he was in this frame of mind captain vane left him and returned to his own hut where he found chingatok and leo engaged in earnest conversation alf and benjy being silent listeners  im glad youve come uncle said leo making room for him on the turf seat because chingatok and i are discussing the subject of war and  a strange coincidence interrupted the captain  i have just been discussing the same subject with old amalatok  i hope that in showing the evils of war you are coming better speed with the son than i did with the father  as to that said leo i have no difficulty in showing chingatok the evils of war  he sees them clearly enough already  the trouble i have with him is to explain the bible on that subject  you see he has got a very troublesome inquiring sort of mind and ever since i have told him that the bible is the word of god he wont listen to my explanations about anything  he said to me in the quietest way possible just now why do you give me your reasons when you tell me the great spirit has given his  i want to know what he says  well now you know it is puzzling to be brought to book like that and i doubt if anders translates well  you understand and speak the language uncle better than he does i think so i want you to help me  ill try leo though i am ashamed to say i am not so well read in the word myself as i ought to be  what does chingatok want to know  he wants to reconcile things of course  that is always the way now i told him that the great spirit is good and does not wish men to go to war and that he has written for us a law namely that we should live peaceably with all men  chingatok liked this very much but then i had told him before that the great spirit had told his ancient people the jews to go and fight his enemies and take possession of their lands  now he regards this as a contradiction  he sayshow can a man live peaceably with all men and at the same time go to war with some men kill them and take their lands  ah  leo my boy your difficulty in answering the eskimo lies in your own partial quotation of scripture said the captain  then turning to chingatok he added my young friend did not give you the whole lawonly part of it  the word is written thusif it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men  some times it is not possible chingatok then we must fight  but the law says keep from fighting as much as you can  mind that chingatok and if you are ever induced to go to war for the sake of a little islandfor the sake of a little insultdont flatter yourself that you are keeping out of it as much as lieth in you  good good said the giant earnestly blackbeards words are wise  as to the people of god in the long past continued the captain god told them to go to war so they went but that does not authorise men to go to war at their own bidding  what is right in the great father of all may be very wrong in the children  god kills men every day and we do not blame him but if man kills his fellow we hunt him down as a murderer  in the long past time the great father spoke to his children by his wise and holy men and sometimes he saw fit to tell them to fight  with his reasons we have nothing to do  now the great father speaks to us by his book  in it he tells us to live in peace with all menif possible  good said the giant with an approving nod though a perplexed expression still lingered on his face  but the great father has never before spoken to me by his booknever at all to my forefathers  he may however have spoken by his spirit within you chingatok i cannot tell returned the captain with a meditative air  you have desires for peace and a tendency to forgive  this could not be the work of the spirit of evil  it must have been that of the good spirit  this seemed to break upon the eskimo as a new light and he relapsed into silence as he thought of the wonderful idea that within his breast the great spirit might have been working in time past although he knew it not  then he thought of the many times he had in the past resisted what he had hitherto only thought of as good feelings and the sudden perception that at such times he had been resisting the father of all impressed him for the first time with a sensation of guiltiness  it was some time before the need of a saviour from sin entered into his mind but the ice had been broken and at last through leos bible as read by him and explained by captain vane jesus the sun of righteousness rose upon his soul and sent in the light for which he had thirsted so long  but as we have said this effect was not immediate and he remained in a state of uncertainty and sadness while the warlike councils and preparations went on  meanwhile captain vane set himself earnestly to work to hit on some plan by which if possible to turn the feeling of the eskimo community in favour of peace  at first he thought of going alone and unarmed with anders as interpreter to the land of grabantak to dissuade that savage potentate from attacking the poloes but the eskimos pointed out that the danger of this plan was so great that he might as well kill himself at once  his own party also objected to it so strongly that he gave it up and resolved in the meantime to strengthen his position and increase his influence with the natives among whom his lot was cast by some exhibitions of the powers with which science and art had invested him    chapter eighteen  the captain electrifies as well as surprises his new friends  it will be remembered that the party of englishmen arrived at poloeland under oars and although the indiarubber boats had been gazed at and gently touched with intense wonder by the natives they had not yet seen the process of disinflation or the expansion of the kites  of course chingatok and their other eskimo fellowtravellers had given their friends graphic descriptions of everything but this only served to whet the desire to see the wonderful oomiaks in action  several times during the first few days the old chief had expressed a wish to see the kablunets go through the water in their boats but as the calm still prevailed and the captain knew his influence over the natives would depend very much on the effect with which his various proceedings were carried out he put him off with the assurance that when the proper time for action came he would let him know  one night a gentle breeze sprang up and blew directly off shore  as it seemed likely to last the captain waited till the whole community was asleep and then quietly roused his son  lend a hand here ben he whispered and make no noise  benjy arose and followed his father in a very sleepy frame of mind  they went to the place where the indiarubber boats lay close behind the englishmens hut and unscrewing the brass heads that closed the airholes began to press out the air  thats it ben but dont squeeze too hard lest the hissing should rouse some of em  whatr ee doin this foreeyaou asked benjy yawning  youll see that tomorrow lad  hum goin tsqueezem all  yes all three and put em in their boxes  the conversation flagged at this point and the rest of the operation was performed in silence  next morning after breakfast seeing that the breeze still held the captain sent a formal message to amalatok that he was prepared to exhibit his oomiaks  the news spread like wildfire and the entire community soon assembledto the number of several hundredsin front of the englishmens hut where the captain was seen calmly seated on a packingcase with a solemn expression on his face  the rest of his party had been warned to behave with dignity  even benjys round face was drawn into something of an oval and butterface made such superhuman attempts to appear grave that the rest of the party almost broke down at the sight of him  great was the surprise among the natives when they perceived that the three oomiaks had disappeared  my friends said the captain rising i will now show you the manner in which we englishmen use our oomiaks  a soft sigh of expectation ran through the group of eager natives as they pressed round their chief and chingatok who stood looking on in dignified silence while the captain and his companions went to work many of the women occupied a little eminence close at hand whence they could see over the heads of the men and some of the younger women and children clambered to the top of the hut the better to witness the great sight  numerous and characteristic were the sighs huks grunts growls and other exclamations all of which were in keeping with the more or less intense glaring of eyes and opening of mouths and slight bending of knees and elbows and spreading of fingers and raising of hands as the operators slowly unrolled the indiarubber mass attached the bellows gradually inflated the first boat fixed the thwarts and stretchers and as it were constructed a perfect oomiak in little more than ten minutes  then there was a shout of delight when the captain and leo one at the bow the other at the stern lifted the boat as if it had been a feather and carrying it down the beach placed it gently in the sea  but the excitement culminated when chingatok stepping lightly into it sat down on the seat seized the little oars and rowed away  we should have said attempted to row away for though he rowed lustily the boat did not move owing to anders who like eskimos in general dearly loved a practical joke  holding fast by the tailline a few seconds he suddenly let go and the boat shot away while anders throwing a handful of water after it said go off bad boy and dont come back we can do without you  a roar of laughter burst forth some of the small boys and girls leaped into the air with delight causing the tails of the latter to wriggle behind them  the captain gave them plenty of time to blow off the steam of surprise when they had calmed down considerably he proceeded to open out and arrange one of the kites  of course this threw them back into the openeyed and mouthed and fingerspreading condition and if possible called forth more surprise than before  when the kite soared into the sky they shouted when it was being attached to the bow of the boat they held their breath with expectation many of them standing on one leg and when at last the boat with four persons in it shot away to sea at the rate of eight or ten miles an hour they roared with ecstasy accompanying the yells with contortions of frame and visage which were so indescribable that we gladly leave it all to the readers imagination  there can be no doubt of the fact that the captain placed himself and his countrymen that day on a pedestal from which there was no fear of their being afterwards dislodged  did not i tell you said chingatok to his sire that night in the privacy of his hut that the kablunets are great men  you did my son  chingatok is wise and his father is a fool  no doubt the northern savage meant this selfcondemning speech to be understood much in the same way in which it is understood by civilised people  when the oomiak swelled i thought it was going to burst added the chief  so did i when i first saw it said chingatok  father and son paused a few minutes  they usually did so between each sentence  evidently they pondered what they said  have these men got wives asked the chief  the old one has and bunjay is his son  the other onesno  the black man may have a wife i know not but i should think that no woman would have him  what made him black  i know not  was he always black  the kablunets say he wasfrom so big  chingatok measured off the half of his left hand by way of explaining how big  is he black under the clothes  yes black all over  again the couple paused  it is strange said the old man shaking his head  perhaps he was made black because his father was wicked  not so returned the young giant  i have heard him say his father was a very good man  strange repeated the chief with a solemn look he is very ugly worse than a walrus  tell me my son where do the kablunets live  do they hunt the walrus or the seal  blackbeard has told me much father that i do not understand  his people do not hunt muchonly a very few of them do  wah they are lazy  the few hunt to keep the rest in meat i suppose  no father that is not the way  the few hunt for fun  the great many spend their time in changing one thing for another  they seem to be never satisfiedalways changing changingevery day and all day getting and giving and never satisfied  poor things said the chief  and they have no walruses no white bears no whales nothing added the son  miserables  perhaps that is why they come here to search for nothing  but father if they have got nothing at home why come here to search for it  what do they eat asked amalatok quickly as if he were afraid of recurring to the puzzling question that had once already taken him out of his mental depth  they eat all sorts of things  many of them eat things that are nasty things that grow out of the ground things that are very hot and burn the tongue things that are poison and make them ill  they eat fish too like us and other people bring them their meat in great oomiaks from faroff lands  they seem to be so poor that they cannot find enough in their own country to feed themselves  wretched creatures said the old man pitifully  yes and they drink too  drink waters so hot and so terrible that they burn their mouths and their insides and so they go mad  did i not say that they were fools said amalatok indignantly  but the strangest thing of all continued chingatok lowering his voice and looking at his sire in a species of wonder is that they fill their mouths with smoke  what  eat smoke said amalatok in amazement  no they spit it out  did blackbeard tell you that  yes  then blackbeard is a liar  chingatok did not appear to be shocked by the old mans plain speaking but he did not agree with him  no father said he after a pause  blackbeard is not a liar  he is good and wise and speaks the truth  i have seen the kablunets do it myself  in the big oomiak that they lost some of the men did it so puff pull puff puffis it not funny  both father and son burst into laughter at this and then becoming suddenly grave remained staring at the smoke of their cookinglamp silently meditating on these things  while thus engaged a man entered the low doorway in the only possible manner on hands and knees and rising displayed the face of anders  blackbeard sends a message to the great old chief said the interpreter  he wishes him to pay the kablunets a visit  he has something to show to the great old chief  tell him i come said the chief with a toss of the head which meant be off  i wonder said amalatok slowly as anders crept out whether blackbeard means to show us some of his wisdom or some of his foolishness  the white men appear to have much of both  let us go see said chingatok  they went and found the captain seated in front of the door of his hut with his friends round himall except benjy who was absent  they were very grave as usual desiring to be impressive  chief began the captain in that solemn tone in which ghosts are supposed to address mankind i wish to show you that i can make the stoutest and most obstinate warrior of poloeland tremble and jump without touching him  that is not very difficult said the old man who had still a lurking dislike to acknowledge the englishmen his superiors  i can make any one of them tremble and jump by throwing a spear at him  a slight titter from the assembly testified to the success of this reply  but rejoined the captain with deepening solemnity i will do it without throwing a spear  so will i by suddenly howling at him in the dark said amalatok  at this his men laughed outright  but i will not howl or move said the captain  that will be clever returned the chief solemnised in spite of himself  let blackbeard proceed  order one of your braves to stand before me on that piece of flat skin said the captain  amalatok looked round and observing a huge ungainly man with a codfishy expression of face who seemed to shrink from notoriety ordered him to step forward  the man did so with obvious trepidation but he dared not refuse  the captain fixed his eyes on him sternly and in a low growling voice muttered in english now benjy give it a good turn  codfishiness vanished as if by magic and with a look of wild horror the man sprang into the air tumbled on his back rose up and ran away  it is difficult to say whether surprise or amusement predominated among the spectators  many of them laughed heartily while the captain still as grave as a judge said in a low growling tone as if speaking to himself  not quite so stiff benjy not quite so stiff  be more gentle next time  dont do it all at once boy jerk it benjy a turn or so at a time  it is perhaps needless to inform the reader that the captain was practising on the eskimos with his electrical machine and that benjy was secretly turning the handle inside the hut  the machine was connected by means of wires with the piece of skin on which the patients stood  these wires had been laid underground not indeed in the darkness but during the secrecy and silence of the previous night  after witnessing the effect on the first warrior no other brave seemed inclined to venture on the skin and the women who enjoyed the fun greatly were beginning to taunt them with cowardice when oolichuk strode forward  he believed intensely and justifiably in his own courage  no man he felt quite sure had the power to stare him into a nervous conditionnot even the fiercest of the kablunets  let blackbeard try and do his worst  animated by these stern and selfreliant sentiments he stepped upon the mat  benjy being quick in apprehension perceived his previous error and proceeded this time with caution  he gave the handle of the machine a gentle halfturn and stopped peeping through a crevice in the wall to observe the effect  ha ha ho hohi huk laughed oolichuk as a tickling sensation thrilled through all his nervous system  the laugh was irresistibly echoed by the assembled community  benjy waited a few seconds and then gave the handle another and slightly stronger turn  the laugh this time was longer and more ferocious while the gallant eskimo drew himself together determined to resist the strange and subtle influence at the same time frowning defiance at the captain who never for a moment took his coalblack eye off him  again benjy turned the handle gently  he evidently possessed something of the ancient inquisitor spirit and gloated over the pains of his victim  the result was that oolichuk not only quivered from head to foot but gave a little jump and anything but a little yell  benjys powers of selfrestraint were by that time exhausted  he sent the handle round with a whirr and oolichuk tumbling backwards off the mat rent the air with a shriek of demoniac laughter  of course the delight of the eskimosespecially of the childrenwas beyond all bounds and eager were the efforts made to induce another warrior to go upon the mysterious mat but not one would venture  they would rather have faced their natural enemy the great grabantak unarmed any day  in this difficulty an idea occurred to amalatok  seizing a huge dog by the neck he dragged it to the mat and bade it lie down  the dog crouched and looked sheepishly round  next moment he was in the air wriggling  then he came to the ground over which he rushed with a prolonged howl and disappeared among the rocks on the hill side  it is said that that poor dog was never again seen but benjy asserts most positively that a week afterwards he saw it sneaking into the village with its tail very much between its legs and an expression of the deepest humility on its countenance  youd better give them a taste of dynamite father said benjy that evening as they all sat round their supperkettle  no no boy  it is bad policy to fire off all your ammunition in a hurry  well give it em bit by bit  just so impress them by degrees said alf  de fust warrior was nigh busted by degrees said butterface with a broad grin as he stirred the kettle  you gib it im amost too strong massa benjee  blackbeard must be the bad spirit remarked amalatok to his son that same night as they held converse togetheraccording to custombefore going to bed  the bad spirit is never kind or good replied chingatok after a pause  no said the old man never  but blackbeard is always good and kind returned the giant  this argument seemed unanswerable  at all events the old man did not answer it but sat frowning at the cookinglamp under the influence of intense thought  after a prolonged meditationduring the course of which father and son each consumed the titbits of a walrus rib and a seals flipper chingatok remarked that the white men were totally beyond his comprehension  to which after another pause his father replied that he could not understand them at all  then retiring to their respective couches they calmly went to sleepperchance to dream    chapter nineteen  a shooting trip to paradise isle and further display of the captains contrivances  while our explorers were thus reduced to a state of forced inaction as regarded the main object of their expedition they did not by any means waste their time in idleness  on the contrary each of the party went zealously to work in the way that was most suitable to his inclination  after going over the main island of poloe as a united party and ascertaining its size productions and general features the captain told them they might now do as they pleased  for his part he meant to spend a good deal of his time in taking notes and observations questioning the chief men as to the lands lying to the northward repairing and improving the hut and helping the natives miscellaneously so as to gain their regard  of course leo spent much of his time with his rifle for the natives were not such expert hunters but that occasionally they were badly off for food  of course also alf shouldered his botanical box and sallied forth hammer in hand to break stones as butterface put it  benjy sometimes followed alfmore frequently leo and always carried his fathers doublebarrelled shotgun  he preferred that because his powers with the rifle were not yet developed  sometimes he went with toolooha or tekkona or oblooria in one of the native oomiaks to fish at other times he practised paddling in the native kayak so that he might accompany chingatok on his excursions to the neighbouring islands after seals and wildfowl  in the excursions by water leo preferred one of the indiarubber boats partly because he was strong and could row it easily and partly because it was capable of holding more game than the kayak  these expeditions to the outlying islands were particularly delightful there was something so peaceful yet so wild so romantic and so strange about the region that the young men felt as if they had passed into a new world altogether  it is scarcely surprising that they should feel thus when it is remembered that profound calms usually prevailed at that season causing the sea to appear like another heaven below them that the sun never went down but circled round and round the horizon dipping indeed a little more and more towards it each night but not yet disappearing that myriads of wild birds filled the air with plaintive cries that whales and seaunicorns and walruses sported around that icebergs were only numerous enough to give a certain strangeness of aspect to the scenea strangeness which was increased by the frequent appearance of arctic phenomena such as several mocksuns rivalling the real one and objects being enveloped in a golden haze or turned upside down by changes in atmospheric temperature  no wonder that arctic voyagers are always hankering after the far north said leo to benjy one magnificent morning as they rowed towards the outlying islands over the golden sea  captain vane was with them that morning and it was easy to see that the captain was in a peculiar frame of mind  a certain twinkle in his eyes and an occasional smile apparently at nothing showed that his thoughts whatever they might be were busy  now it cannot have failed by this time to strike the intelligent reader that captain vane was a man given to mystery and rather fond of taking by surprise not only eskimos but his own companions  on the bright morning referred to he took with him in the boat a small flat box or packingcase measuring about three feet square and not more than four inches deep  as they drew near to leos favourite sportinggrounda long flat island with several small lakes on it which were bordered by tall reeds and sedges where myriads of ducks geese gulls plover puffins and other birds revelled in abject felicitybenjy asked his father what he had got in the box  ive got somethin in it benjysomethin  why daddy returned the boy with a laugh if i were an absolute lunatic you could not treat me with greater contempt  do you suppose i am so weak as to imagine that you would bring a packingcase all the way from england to the north pole with nothing in it  youre a funny boy benjy said the captain regarding his son with a placid look  youre a funny father daddy answered the son with a shake of the head and its fortunate for you that im good as well as funny else id give you some trouble  youve got a good opinion of yourself ben anyhow said leo looking over his shoulder as he rowed  just change the subject and make yourself useful  jump into the bow and have the boathook ready the water shoals rather fast here and i dont want to risk scraping a hole in our little craft  the island they were approaching formed part of the extensive archipelago of which poloe was the main or central island  paradise isle as leo had named it lay about two miles from poloe  the boat soon touched its shingly beach but before it could scrape thereon its occupants stepped into the water and carefully carried it on shore  now benjy hand me the rifle and cartridges said leo after the boat was placed in the shadow of a low bank and fetch the gamebag  what you dont intend to carry the packingcase uncle do you  i think id better do it answered the captain lifting the case by its cord in a careless way it might take a fancy to have a swim on its own account you know  come along the birds are growing impatient dont you see  with a short laugh leo shouldered his rifle and marched towards the first of a chain of little lakes followed by benjy with the gamebag and the captain with the case  soon a splendid grey wildgoose was seen swimming at a considerable distance beyond the reeds  theres your chance now leo said the captain  but leo shook his head  no use he said if i were to shoot that one id never be able to get it the mud is too deep for wading and the reeds too thick for swimming amongst  its a pity to kill birds that we cannot get hold of so you see i must walk along the margin of the lake until i see a bird in a good position to be got at and then pot him  but isnt that slow work lad asked the captain  it might be slow if i missed often or wounded my birds replied leo but i dont often miss  the youth might with truth have said he never missed for his eye was as true and his hand as sure as that of any leatherstocking or robin hood that ever lived  why dont you launch the boat on the lake asked the captain  because i dont like to run the risk of damaging it by hauling it about among mud and sticks and overland  besides that would be a cumbersome way of hunting  i prefer to tramp about the margin as you see and just take what comes in my way  there are plenty of birds and i seldom walk far without getting a goodishhist  theres one  as he spoke another large grey goose was seen stretching its long neck amongst the reeds at a distance of about two hundred yards  the crack of the rifle was followed by the instant death of the goose  at the same moment several companions of the bird rose trumpeting into the air amid a cloud of other birds  again the rifles crack was heard and one of the geese on the wing dropped beside its comrade  as leo carried his repeating rifle he might easily have shot another but he refrained as the bird would have been too far out to be easily picked up  now benjy are you to go in or am i asked the sportsman with a sly look  oh  i suppose i must said the boy with an affectation of being martyred though in truth nothing charmed him so much as to act the part of a waterdog  a few seconds more and he was stripped for his garments consisted only of shirt and trousers  but it was more than a few seconds before he returned to land swimming on his back and trailing a goose by the neck with each hand for the reeds were thick and the mud softish and the second bird had been further out than he expected  its glorious fun said benjy panting vehemently as he pulled on his clothes  its gloriously knocked up youll be before long at that rate said the captain  oh but uncle said leo quickly you must not suppose that i give him all the hard work  we share it between us you know  benjy sometimes shoots and then i do the retrieving  youve no idea how good a shot he is becoming  indeed let me see you do it my boy  dye see that goose over there  what the one near the middle of the lake about four hundred yards off  ay benjy i want that goose  you shoot it my boy  but youll never be able to get it uncle said leo  benjy i want that goose  you shoot it  there was no disobeying this peremptory command  leo handed the rifle to the boy  down on one knee ben hythe position my boy said the captain in the tone of a disciplinarian  benjy obeyed took a long steady aim and fired  bravo shouted the captain as the bird turned breast up  theres that gooses brother comin to see whats the matter with him just cook his goose too benjy  the boy aimed again fired and missed  again cried the captain look sharp  again the boy fired and this time wounded the bird as it was rising on the wing  although wounded the goose was quite able to swim and made rapidly towards the reeds on the other side  what am i to lose that goose cried the captain indignantly  leo seized the rifle  almost without taking time to aim he fired and shot the bird dead  there said he laughing but i suspect it is a lost goose after all it will be hard work to get either of these birds uncle  however ill try  leo was proceeding to strip when the captain forbade him  dont trouble yourself lad he said ill go for them myself  you uncle  ay me  dye suppose that nobody can swim but you and benjy  here help me to open this box  in silent wonder and expectation leo and benjy did as they were bid when the mysterious packingcase was opened there was displayed to view a mass of waterproof material  tumbling this out and unrolling it the captain displayed a pair of trousers and boots in one piece attached to something like an oval lifebuoy  thrusting his legs down into the trousers and boots he drew the buoywhich was covered with indiarubber clothup to his waist and fixed it there  then putting the end of an indiarubber tube to his mouth he began to blow and the buoy round his waist began to extend until it took the form of an oval  now boys said the captain with profound gravity im about ready to go to sea  here you observe is a pair o pants that wont let in water  at the feet youll notice two flaps which expand when driven backward and collapse when moved forward  these are propellershuman webfeetto enable me to walk ahead dye see and here are two small paddles with a joint which i can fix togethersoand thus make one doublebladed paddle of em about four feet long  it will help the feet you understand but im not dependent on it for i can walk without the paddles at the rate of two or three miles an hour  as he spoke captain vane walked quietly into the water to the wild delight of benjy and the amazement of his nephew  when he was about waistdeep the buoy floated him  continuing to walk though his feet no longer touched ground he was enabled by the propellers to move on  when he had got out a hundred yards or so he turned round took off his hat and shoutedland ho  ship ahoy shrieked benjy in an ecstasy  mind your weather eye shouted the captain resuming his walk with a facetious swagger while with the paddles he increased his speed soon after he returned to land with the two geese  well now daddy said his son while he and leo examined the dress with minute interest i wish youd make a clean breast of it and let us know how many more surprises and contrivances of this sort youve got in store for us  i fear this is the last one benjy though theres no end to the applications of these contrivances  youd better apply this one to yourself now and see how you get on in it  of course benjy was more than willing though as he remarked the dress was far too big for him  never mind that my boy  a tight fit aint needful and nobody will find fault with the cut in these regions  where ever did you get it father asked the boy as the fastenings were being secured round him  i got it from an ingenious friend who says hes goin to bring it out soon  mayhap its in the shops of old england by this time  there now off you go but dont be too risky ben  keep her full and mind your helm  see note  thus encouraged the eager boy waded into the water but in his haste tripped and fell sending a volume of water over himself  he rose however without difficulty and proceeding with greater caution soon walked off into deep water  here he paddled about in a state of exuberant glee  the dress kept him perfectly dry although he splashed the water about in reckless fashion and did not return to land till quite exhausted  benjamin vane from that day devoted himself to that machine  he became so enamoured of the watertramp as he styled itnot knowing its proper name at the timethat he went about the lakelets in it continually sometimes fishing at other times shooting  he even ventured a short distance out to sea in it to the amazement of the eskimos the orbits of whose eyes were being decidedly enlarged benjy said and their eyebrows permanently raised by the constant succession of astonishmentfits into which they were thrown from day to day by their white visitors    note  lest it should be supposed that the pedomotive here described is the mere creature of the authors brain it may be well to state that he has seen it in the establishment of the patentees messrs thornton and company of edinburgh    chapter twenty  benjys enjoyments interrupted and poloeland overwhelmed with a catastrophe  one pleasant morning towards the end of summer benjamin vane went out with his gun in the watertramp on the large lake of paradise isle  leo and he had reached the isle in one of the indiarubber boats  they had taken anders with them to carry their game and little oblooria to prepare their dinner while they were away shooting for they disliked the delay of personal attention to cooking when they were ravenous after landing benjy and seeing him busy getting himself into the aquatic dress leo said he would pull off to a group of walruses which were sporting about off shore and shoot one  provisions of fowl and fish were plentiful enough just then at the eskimo village but he knew that walrus beef was greatly prized by the natives and none of the huge creatures had been killed for some weeks past  about this time the threatened war with the northern eskimos had unfortunately commenced  the insatiable grabantak had made a descent on one of amalatoks smaller islands killed the warriors and carried off the women and children with everything else he could lay hands on  of course amalatok made reprisals attacked a small island belonging to grabantak and did as much general mischief as he could  the paltry islet about which the war began was not worthy either of attack or defence  then amalatok burning with the righteous indignation of the man who did not begin the quarrel got up a grand muster of his forces and went with a great fleet of kayaks to attack grabantak in his strongholds  but grabantaks strongholds were remarkably strong  a good deal of killing was done and some destruction of property accomplished but that did not effect the conquest of the great northern savage  neither did it prove either party to be right or wrong  grabantak retired to impregnable fastnesses and amalatok returned to poloeland covered with glorysome of his followers also covered with wounds a few of which had fallen to his own share  the success however was not decided  on the whole the result was rather disappointing but amalatok was brave and highspirited as some people would say  he was not going to give in not he  he would fight as long as a man was left to back him and bring grabantak to his kneesor die  either event would of course have been of immense advantage to both nations  he ground his teeth and glared when he announced this determination and also shook his fist but a sharp twinge of pain in one of his unhealed wounds caused him to cease frowning abruptly  there was a sound too in the air which caused him to sit down and reflect  it was a mixed and halfstifled sound as if of women groaning and little children wailing  some of his braves of course had fallen in the recent conflictsfallen honourably with their faces to the foe their young widows and their little ones mourned them and refused to be comforted because they were not  it was highly unpatriotic no doubt but natural  amalatok had asked the white men to join him in the fight but they had refused  they would help him to defend his country if attacked they said but they would not go out to war  amalatok had once threatened blackbeard if he refused to go but blackbeard had smiled and threatened to retaliate by making him jump  whereupon the old chief became suddenly meek  this then was the state of affairs when benjy and leo went shooting on the morning to which we have referred  but who can hope to describe with adequate force the joyful feelings of benjamin vane as he moved slily about the lakelets of paradise isle in the watertramp  the novelty of the situation was so great  the surrounding circumstances were so peculiar  the prolonged calms of the circumpolar basin at that period of the year were so new to one accustomed to the variable skies of england the perpetual sunshine the absence of any necessity to consider time in a land from which night seemed to have finally fled the glassy repose of lake and sea so suggestive of peace the cheery bustle of animal life so suggestive of pleasureall these influences together filled the boys breast with a strong romantic joy which was far too powerful to seek or find relief in those boisterous leaps and shouts which were his usual safetyvalves  although not much given to serious thought except when conversing with his father benjy became meditative as he moved quietly about at the edge of the reeds and began to wonder whether the paradise above could exceed this paradise below  events occurred that day which proved to him that the sublunary paradise was at least woefully uncertain in its nature  now just keep still will you for one moment muttered benjy advancing cautiously through the outer margin of reeds among the stems of which he peered earnestly while he cocked his gun  the individual to whom he spoke made no reply because it was a goose would that it were thus with all geese  it was a grey goose of the largest size  it had caught a glimpse of the new and strange creature that was paddling about its home and was wisely making for the shelter of a spot where the reeds were more dense and where benjy would not have dared to follow  for it must be remembered that our young sportsman was sunk to his waist in water and that the reeds rose high over his head so that if once lost in the heart of them he might have found it extremely difficult to find his way out again  anxious not to lose his chance he gave vent to a loud shout  this had the effect of setting up innumerable flocks of wildfowl which although unseen had been lurking listeners to the strange though gentle sound of the watertramp  among them rose the grey goose with one or two unexpected comrades  benjy had not at that time acquired the power of selfrestraint necessary to good shooting  he fired hastily and missed with the first barrel  discharging the second in hotter haste he missed again but brought down one of the comrades by accident  this was sufficiently gratifying  picking it up he placed it on the boatbuoy in front of him to balance several ducks which already lay on the part in rear  he might have carried a dozen geese on his novel huntingdress if there had been room for them for its floating power was sufficient to have borne up himself and at least four if not five men  pursuing his way cautiously and gently by means of the webbed feet alone the young sportsman moved about like a sly waterspirit among the reeds sometimes addressing a few pleasant words such as how dye do old boy or dont alarm yourself my tulip to a waterhen or a coot or some such bird which crossed his path but was unworthy of his shot at other times stopping to gaze contemplatively through the reed stems or to float and rest in placid enjoyment while he tried to imagine himself in a forest of watertrees  everywhere the feathered tribes first gazed at him in mute surprise then hurried with every variety of squeak and quack and fluttering wing from his frightful presence  suddenly he came in sight of a bird so large that his heart gave a violent leap and the gun went almost of its own accord to his shoulder but the creature disappeared among the reeds before he could take aim another opening however again revealed it fully to view  it was a swana hyperborean wild swan  just as he made this discovery the great bird having observed benjy spread its enormous wings and made off with an amazing splutter  bang went benjys gun both barrels in quick succession and down fell the swan quite dead with its head in the water and its feet pointing to the sky  what a feast the eskimos will have tonight was benjys first thought as he tramped vehemently towards his prize  but his overflowing joy was rudely checked for having laid his gun down in front of him for the purpose of using the paddle with both hands it slipped to one side tilted up and disappearing like an arrow in the lake went to the bottom  the sinking of benjys heart was not less complete  he had the presence of mind however to seize the reeds near him and check his progress at the exact spot  leaning over the side of his little craft he beheld his weapon quivering as it were at the bottom in about eight feet of water  what was to be done  the energetic youth was not long in making up his mind on that point  he would dive for it  but diving in the watertramp was out of the question  knowing that it was all but impossible to make his way to the shore through the reeds he resolved to reach the opposite shore which was in some places free from vegetation  seizing one of the reeds he forced it down and tied it into a knot to mark the spot where his loss had happened  he treated several more reeds in this way till he gained the open water outside thus marking his path  then he paddled across the lake landed undressed and swam out again pushing the empty dress before him intending to use it as a restingplace  on reaching the spot he dived with a degree of vigour and agility worthy of a duck but found it hard to reach the bottom as he was not much accustomed to diving  for the same reason he found it difficult to open his eyes under water so as to look for the gun  while trying to do so a desperate desire to breathe caused him to leap to the surface where he found that he had struggled somewhat away from the exact spot after a few minutes rest he took a long breath and again went down but found to his dismay that in his first dive he had disturbed the mud and thus made the water thick  groping about rendered it thicker and he came to the surface the second time with feelings approaching to despair  besides which his powers were being rapidly exhausted  but benjy was full of pluck as well as perseverance  feeling that he could not hold out much longer he resolved to make the next attempt with more carea resolve it may be remarked which it would have been better to have made at first  he swam to the knotted reed considered well the position he had occupied when his loss occurred took an aim at a definite spot with his head and went down  the result was that his hands grasped the stock of the gun the moment they reached the bottom  inflated with joy he leaped with it to the surface like a bladder laid it carefully on the waterdress and pushing the latter before him soon succeeded in getting hold of the dead swan  the bird was too heavy to be lifted on the float he therefore grasped its neck with his teeth and thus heavily weighted made for the shore  it will not surprise the reader to be told that benjy felt hungry as well as tired after these achievements and this induced him to look anxiously for leo and to wonder why the smoke of obloorias cookinglamp was not to be seen anywhere  the engrossing nature of the events just described had prevented our little hero from observing that a smart breeze had sprung up and that heavy clouds had begun to drive across the hitherto blue sky while appearances of a very squally nature were gathering on the windward horizon  moreover while engaged in paddling among the reeds he had not felt the breeze  it was while taking off the watertramp that he became fully alive to these facts  thats it he muttered to himself  theyve been caught by this breeze and been delayed by having had to pull against it or perhaps the walruses gave them more trouble than they expected  appeasing his appetite as well as he could with this reflection he left the watertramp on the ground with the dripping gun beside it and hurried to the highest part of the island  although not much of an elevation it enabled him to see all round and a feeling of anxiety filled his breast as he observed that the once glassy sea was ruffled to the colour of indigo while wavelets flecked it everywhere and no boat was visible  they may have got behind some of the islands he thought and continued his lookout for some time with growing anxiety and impatience however because the breeze was by that time freshening to a gale  when an hour had passed away the poor boy became thoroughly alarmed  can anything have happened to the boat he said to himself  the indiarubber is easily cut  perhaps they may have been blown out to sea  this latter thought caused an involuntary shudder  looking round he observed that the depression of the sun towards the horizon indicated that night had set in  this will never do he suddenly exclaimed aloud  leo will be lost i must risk it  turning as he spoke he ran back to the spot where he had left the waterdress which he immediately put on  then leaving gun and game on the beach he boldly entered the sea and struck out with feet and paddle for poloeland  although sorely buffeted by the rising waves and several times overwhelmed his waterproof costume proved well able to bear him up and with comparatively little fatigue he reached the land in less than two hours  without waiting to take the dress off he ran up to the eskimo village and gave the alarm  while these events were going on among the islets captain vane and alphonse vandervell had been far otherwise engaged  come alf said the captain that same morning after leo and his party had started on their expedition let you and me go off on a scientific excursionon what we may style a botanicogeologicometeorological survey  with all my heart uncle and let us take butterface with us and oolichuk  ay lad and ivitchuk and akeetolik too and chingatok if you will for ive fixed on a spot whereon to pitch an observatory and we must set to work on it without further delay  indeed i would have got it into working order long ago if it had not been for my hope that the cessation of this miserable war would have enabled us to get nearer the north pole this summer  the party soon started for the highest peak of the island of poloeor poloeland as alf preferred to call it  oolichuk carried on his broad shoulders one of those mysterious cases out of which the captain was so fond of taking machines wherewith to astonish the natives  indeed it was plain to see that the natives who accompanied them on this occasion expected some sort of surprise despite the captains earnest assurance that there was nothing in the box except a few meteorological instruments  how the captain translated to the eskimos the word meteorological we have never been able to ascertain  his own explanation is that he did it in a roundabout manner which they failed to comprehend and which he himself could not elucidate  on the way up the hill alf made several interesting discoveries of plants which were quite new to him  ho stop i say uncle he exclaimed for the twentieth time that day as he picked up some object of interest  what now lad said the captain stopping and wiping his heated brow  here is another specimen of these petrifactionslook  he means a vegetable o some sort turned to stone chingatok explained the captain as he examined the specimen with an interested though unscientific eye  you remember uncle the explanation i gave you some time ago said the enthusiastic alf about professor heer of zurich who came to the conclusion that primeval forests once existed in these now treeless arctic regions from the fossils of oak elm pine and maple leaves discovered there  well i found a fossil of a plane leaf the other daynot a very good one to be sureand now here is a splendid specimen of a petrified oakleaf  dont you trace it quite plainly  well lad returned the captain frowning at the specimen i do believe youre right  there does seem to be the mark of a leaf there and there is some ground for your theory that this land may have been once covered with trees though its hard to believe that when we look at it  an evidence uncle that we should not be too ready to judge by appearances said alf as they resumed their upward march  the top gained a space was quickly selected and cleared and a simple hut of flat stones begun while the captain unpacked his box  it contained a barometer a maximum and minimum selfregistering thermometer wet and dry bulb also a black bulb thermometer a oneeighthinch raingauge and several other instruments  i have another box of similar instruments alf down below said the captain as he laid them carefully out and i hope by comparing the results obtained up here with those obtained at the level of the sea to carry home a series of notes which will be of considerable value to science  when the captain had finished laying them out the eskimos retired to a little distance and regarded them for some minutes with anxious expectancy but as the strange things did not burst or go up like skyrockets they soon returned with a somewhat disappointed look to their hutbuilding  the work was quickly completed for eskimos are expert builders in their way and the instruments had been carefully set up under shelter when the first symptoms of the storm began  i hope the sportsmen have returned said the captain looking gravely round the horizon  no doubt they have said alf preparing to descend the mountain  leo is not naturally reckless and if he were the cautious anders would be a drag on him  an hour later they regained the eskimo village just as benjy came running in a state of dripping consternation from the sea  need it be said that an instant and vigorous search was instituted  not only did a band of the stoutest warriors headed by chingatok set off in a fleet of kayaks but the captain and his companions started without delay in the two remaining indiarubber boats and flying their kites despite the risk of doing so in a gale went away in eager haste over the foaming billows  after exerting themselves to the uttermost they failed to discover the slightest trace of the lost boat  the storm passed quickly and a calm succeeded enabling them to prosecute the search more effectively with oar and paddle but with no better result  day after day passed and still no member of the bandenglishman or eskimowould relax his efforts or admit that hope was sinking  but they had to admit it at last and after three weeks of unremitting toil they were compelled to give up in absolute despair  the most sanguine was driven to the terrible conclusion that leo anders and timid little oblooria were lost  it was an awful blow  what cared alf or the captain now for discovery or scientific investigation  the poor negro who had never at any time cared for plants rocks or poles was sunk in the profoundest depths of sorrow  benjys gay spirit was utterly broken  oolichuks hearty laugh was silenced and a cloud of settled melancholy descended over the entire village of poloe    chapter twenty one  fate of the lost ones  leo anders and timid little oblooria however were not lost  their case was bad enough but it had not quite come to that  on parting from benjy as described in the last chapter these three went after a walrus which coquetted with them instead of attacking and drew them a considerable distance away from the island  this would have been a matter of trifling import if the weather had remained calm but as we have seen a sudden and violent gale arose  when the coming squall was first observed the boat was far to leeward of paradise isle and as that island happened to be one of the most northerly of the group over which amalatok ruled they were thus far to leeward of any land with the exception of a solitary sugarloaf rock near the horizon  still leo and his companions were not impressed with any sense of danger  they had been so long accustomed to calms and to moving about in the indiarubber boats by means of paddles with perfect ease and security that they had half forgotten the force of wind besides the walrus was still playing with them provokinglykeeping just out of rifleshot as if he had studied firearms and knew their range exactly  the rascal exclaimed leo at last losing patience he will never let us come an inch nearer  try im once more said anders who was a keen sportsman push him paddle strong  ho  oblooria paddle hard and queek  although the interpreter being in a facetious mood addressed oblooria in english she quite understood his significant gestures and bent to her work with a degree of energy and power quite surprising in one apparently so fragile  leo also used his oars for they had both oars and paddles with such goodwill that the boat skimmed over the arctic sea like a northern diver and the distance between them and the walrus was perceptibly lessened  i dont like the looks o the southern sky said leo regarding the horizon with knitted brows  hims black noughanyow said anders  hold  ill have a farewell shot at the brute and give up the chase said leo laying down the oars and grasping his rifle  the ball seemed to take effect for the walrus dived immediately with a violent splutter and was seen no more  by this time the squall was hissing towards them so fast that the hunters giving up all thought of the walrus turned at once and made for the land but land by that time lay far off on the southern horizon with a dark foamflecked sea between it and them  theres no fear of the boat oblooria said leo glancing over his shoulder at the girl who sat crouching to meet the first burst of the coming storm but you must hold on tight to the lifelines  there was no need to caution anders  that worthy was already on his knees embracing a thwarthis teeth clenched as he gazed over the bow  on it came like a whirlwind of the tropics and rushed right over the low round gunwale of the boat sweeping loose articles overboard and carrying her bodily to leeward  leo had taken a turn of the lifelines round both thighs and held manfully to his oars  these after stooping to the first rush of wind and water he plied with all his might and was ably seconded by oblooria as well as by the interpreter but a very few minutes of effort sufficed to convince them that they laboured in vain  they did not even hold their own as sailors have it but drifted slowly yet steadily to the north  its impossible to make head against this said leo suddenly ceasing his efforts and i count it a piece of good fortune for which we cannot be too thankful that there is still land to leeward of us  he pointed to the sugarloaf rock before mentioned towards which they were now rapidly drifting  nothing to eat dere  nothing to drink said anders gloomily  oh that wont matter much  a squall like this cant last long  we shall soon be able to start again for home no doubt  i say anders what are these creatures off the point there  they seem too large and black for seabirds and not the shape of seals or walruses  the interpreter gazed earnestly at the objects in question for some moments without answering  the rock which they were quickly nearing was rugged barren and steep on its southern face against which the waves were by that time dashing with extreme violence so that landing there would have been an impossibility  on its lee or northern side however they might count on quiet water  we have nothing to fear said leo observing that oblooria was much agitated tell her so anders we are sure to find a sheltered creek of some sort on the other side  i fear not the rocks or storm replied the eskimo girl to anders  it is grabantak the chief of flatland that i fear  grabantak exclaimed anders and leo in the same breath  grabantak is coming with his men  poor little oblooria whose face had paled while her whole frame trembled pointed towards the dark objects which had already attracted their attention  they were by that time near enough to be distinguished and as they came one after another round the western point of sugarloaf rock it was all too evident that the girl was right and that the fleet of kayaks was probably bearing the northern savage and his men to attack the inhabitants of poloe  leos first impulse was to seize his repeating rifle and fill its cartridgechamber quite full  it may be well to observe here that the cartridges being carried in a tight waterproof case had not been affected by the seas which had so recently overwhelmed them  whats de use asked anders in an unusually sulky tone as he watched the youths action  two men not can fight all de mans of flatland  no but i can pick off a dozen of them one after another with my good rifle and then the rest will fly  grabantak will fall first and his best men after him  this was no idle boast on the part of leo  he knew that he could accomplish what he threatened long before the eskimos could get within spearthrowing distance of his boat  no use repeated anders firmly still shaking his head in a sulky manner  when yous bullets be done more an more inimies come on then dey kill you an me an oblooria  leo laid down his weapon  the resolve to die fighting to the last was the result of a mere impulse of animal courage  second thoughts cooled him and the reference to obloorias fate decided him  you are right anders  if by fighting to the death i could save oblooria it would be my duty as well as my pleasure to fight but i see that i havent the ghost of a chance against such a host as is approaching and it would be simply revengeful to send as many as i can into the next world before going there myself  besides it would exasperate the savages and make them harder on the poor girl  in saying this leo was rather arguing out the point with himself than talking to the interpreter who did not indeed understand much of what he said  having made up his mind how to act leo stowed his precious rifle and ammunition in a small bag placed for that purpose under one of the thwarts and resuming the oars prepared to meet his fate whatever it should be peacefully and unarmed  while thus drifting in silence before the gale the thought suddenly occurred to leo how strange it is that i who am a christianin name at leastshould feel as if it were absurd to pray for gods help at such a time as this  surely he who made me and these eskimos is capable of guarding us  the very least we can do is to ask him to guide us  the youth was surprised at the thought  it had flashed upon him like a ray of light  it was not the first time that he had been in even more imminent danger than the present yet he had never before thought of the necessity of asking help from god as if he were really present and able as well as willing to succour  before the thought had passed he acted on it  he had no time for formal prayer  he looked up  it was prayer without words  in a few minutes more the boat was surrounded by the fleet of kayaks  there were hundreds of these tiny vessels of the north each with its solitary occupant using his doublebladed paddle vigorously  need we say that the strangers were at first gazed on with speechless wonder and that the eskimos kept for some time hovering round them at a respectful distance as if uncertain how to act but with their warspears ready  all the time the whole party drifted before the gale towards the islandrock  anders said leo while the natives remained in this state of indecision my mind is made up as to our course of action  we will offer no resistance whatever to these fellows  we must be absolutely submissive unless indeed they attempt to illtreat oblooria in which case of course we will defend her  do you hear  this was said with such quiet decision and the concluding question was put in such a tone that the interpreter replied yis sar promptly  as leo made no sign of any kind but continued to guide the boat steadily with the oars as if his sole anxiety was to round the western point of the island and get into a place of shelter the natives turned their kayaks and advanced along with him  naturally they fell into the position of an escorta part of the fleet paddling on each side of the captives for such they now were while the rest brought up the rear  what ails oblooria anders asked leo in a low tone  what is the matter asked the interpreter turning to the girl who ever since the approach of the eskimos had crouched like a bundle in the bottom of the boat with her face buried in her hands  there is no fear  grabantak is a man not a bear  he will not eat you  grabantak knows me answered the poor girl without lifting her head he came to poloe once before the war and wanted me to be the wife of his son  i want not his son  i want oolichuk  the simplicity and candour of this confession caused leo to laugh in spite of himself while poor little oblooria who thought it no laughing matter burst into tears  of course the men of flatland kept their eyes fixed in wide amazement on leo as they paddled along and this sudden laugh of his impressed them deeply being apparently without a cause coupled as it was with an air of absolute indifference to his probable fate and to the presence of so many foes  even the ruthless landhungerer grabantak was solemnised  in a few minutes the whole party swept round the point of rocks and proceeded towards the land over the comparatively quiet waters of a little bay which lay under the lee of the sugarloaf rock  during the brief period that had been afforded for thought leo had been intently making his plans  he now proceeded to carry them out  hand me the trinketbundle he said to anders  the interpreter searched in a waterproof pouch in the stern of the boat and produced a small bundle of such trinkets as are known to be valued by savages  it had been placed and was always kept there by captain vane to be ready for emergencies  they will be sure to take everything from us at any rate remarked leo as he divided the trinkets into two separate bundles so i shall take the wind out of their sails by giving everything up at once with a good grace  the grabantaks if we may so style them drew near as the fleet approached the shore with increasing curiosity  when land was reached they leaped out of their kayaks and crowded round the strangers  it is probable that they would have seized them and their possessions at this point but the tall strapping figure of leo and his quiet manner overawed them  they held back while the indiarubber boat was being carried by leo and anders to a position of safety  poor oblooria walked beside them with her head bowed down shrinking as much as possible out of sight  everybody was so taken up with the strange white man that no one took any notice of her  no sooner was the boat laid down than leo taking one of the bundles of trinkets stepped up to grabantak whom he easily distinguished by his air of superiority and the deference paid him by his followers  pulling his own nose by way of a friendly token leo smiled benignantly in the chiefs face and opened the bundle before him  it is needless to say that delight mingled with the surprise that had hitherto blazed on the visage of grabantak  come here anders and bring the other bundle with you  tell this warrior that i am very glad to meet with him  great and unconquerable warrior began the interpreter in the dialect which he had found was understood by the men of poloe we have come from faroff lands to bring you gifts  anders said leo whose knowledge of the eskimo tongue was sufficient by that time to enable him in a measure to follow the drift of a speech anders if you dont tell him exactly what i say ill kick you into the sea  as anders stood on a rock close to the waters edge and leo looked unusually stern he thereafter rendered faithfully what the latter told him to say  the speech was something to the following effect  i am one of a small band of white men who have come here to search out the land  we do not want the land  we only want to see it  we have plenty of land of our own in the far south  we have been staying with the great chief amalatok in poloeland  at the mention of his enemys name the countenance of grabantak darkened  without noticing this leo went on  when i was out hunting with my man and a woman the wind arose and blew us hither  we claim your hospitality and hope you will help us to get back again to poloeland  if you do so we will reward you well for white men are powerful and rich  see here are gifts for grabantak and for his wife  this latter remark was a sort of inspiration  leo had observed while anders was speaking that a stout cheerfulfaced woman had been pushing aside the men and gradually edging her way toward the eskimo chief with the air of a privileged person  that he had hit the mark was obvious for grabantak turned with a bland smile and hit his wife a facetious and rather heavy slap on the shoulder  she was evidently accustomed to such treatment and did not wince  taking from his bundle a gorgeous smokingcap richly ornamented with brilliant beads leo coolly crowned the chief with it  grabantak drew himself up and tried to look majestic but a certain twitching of his face and sparkle in his eyes betrayed a tendency to laugh with delight  fortunately there was another cap of exactly the same pattern in the bundle which leo instantly placed on the head of the wifewhose name he afterwards learned was merkut  the chiefs assumed dignity vanished at this  with that childlike hilarity peculiar to the eskimo race he laughed outright and then seizing the cap from merkuts head put it above his own to the amusement of his grinning followers  leo then selected a glittering claspknife with two blades which the chief seized eagerly  it was evidently a great prizetoo serious a gift to be lightly laughed at  then a comb was presented to the wife and a string of gay beads and a pair of scissors  of course the uses of combs and scissors had he explained and deep was the interest manifested during the explanation and utter the forgetfulness of the whole party for the time being in regard to everything else in the worldoblooria included who sat unnoticed on the rocks with her face still buried in her hands  when grabantaks possessions were so numerous that the hood of his coat and the tops of his wifes boots were nearly filled with them he became generous and princelike having more than he knew what to do with began to distribute things to his followers  among these followers was a tall and stalwart son of his own to whom he was rather stern and not very liberal  perhaps the chief wished to train him with spartan ideas of selfdenial  perhaps he wanted his followers to note his impartiality  merkut did not however act on the same principles for she quietly passed a number of valuable articles over to her dear son koyatuk unobserved by his stern father  things had gone on thus pleasantly for some time the novelty of the gifts and the interest in their explanation having apparently rendered these people forgetful of the fact that they might take them all at once when a sudden change in the state of affairs was wrought by the utterance of one word  we must not said leo to anders looking at his follower over the heads of the eskimos forget poor little oblooria  oblooria roared grabantak with a start as if he had been electrified  oblooria echoed koyatuk glaring round  oblooria gasped the entire band  another moment and grabantak bursting through the crowd leaped towards the crouching girl and raised her face  recognising her he uttered a yell which probably was meant for a cheer  hurrying the frightened girl into the circle through which he had broken the chief presented her to his son and with an air worthy of a civilised courtier said  your wife koyatukyour obloorialooria  he went over the last syllables several times as if he doubted his senses and feared it was too good news to be true  this formal introduction was greeted by the chiefs followers with a series of wild shouts and other demonstrations of extreme joy    chapter twenty two  a fight in defence of woman and rifleshooting extraordinary  when the excitement had somewhat abated leo stepped to the side of oblooria and laying his hand on her shoulder said firmly through anders  pardon me grabantak this girl is not the wife of koyatuk she is my sister  the chief frowned clenched his teeth and grasped a spear  when did kablunet men begin to have eskimo sisters  when they took all distressed women under their protection returned leo promptly  every woman who needs my help is my sister he added with a look of selfsufficiency which he was far from feeling  this new doctrine obviously puzzled the chief who frowned smiled and looked at the ground as if in meditation  it seemed to afford great comfort to oblooria who nestled closer to her champion  as for koyatuk he treated the matter with an air of mingled surprise and scorn but dutifully awaited his fathers pleasure  koyatuk was physically a fine specimen of a savage but his spirit was not equal to his body  like his father he was over six feet high and firmly knit being of both larger and stronger build than leo whom he now regarded and of course hated as his rivala contemptible one no doubt stilla rival  the warriors watched their chief in breathless suspense  to them it was a thoroughly new and interesting situation  that a white stranger tall and active but slender and very young should dare singlehanded to defy not only their chief but as it were the entire tribe including the royal family was a state of things in regard to which their previous lives afforded no parallel  they could not understand it at all and stood as it were in eager openmouthed and onelegged expectation  at last grabantak looked up as if smitten by a new idea and spoke  can kablunet men fight he asked  they love peace better than war answered leo but when they see cause to fight they can do so  turning immediately to his son grabantak said with a grim smile  behold your wife take her  koyatuk advanced  leo placed oblooria behind him and being unarmed threw himself into a pugilistic posture of defence  the young eskimo laid one of his strong hands on the englishmans shoulder intending to thrust him aside violently  leo was naturally of a tender disposition he shrank from dealing a violent blow to one who had not the remotest idea of what was coming or how to defend himself from the human fist when used as a batteringram  but leo chanced to be in a sense doubly armed  during one of his holiday rambles in england he had visited cornwall and there had learned that celebrated throw which consists in making your haunch a fulcrum your right arm a lever and your adversary a shuttlecock  he suddenly grasped his foe round the waist with one arm  next moment the grabantaks saw what the most imaginative among them had never till then conceived ofkoyatuks soles turned to the sky and his head pointing to the ground  the moment following he lay flat on his back looking upwards blankly  the huk hi ho hooroos that followed may be conceived but cannot be described  some of the men burst into laughter for anything ludicrous is irresistible to an eskimo of the very far north  a few were petrified  others there were who resented this indignity to the heirapparent and flourished their spears in a threatening manner these last grabantak quieted with a look  the incident undoubtedly surprised that stern parent but also afforded him some amusement  he said it was an insult that must be avenged  oddly enough he made use of an expression which sounded curiously familiar to leos ears as translated by anders  the insult said grabantak could only be washed out in blood  strange that simple savages of the far north should hold to that ridiculous doctrine  we had imagined that it was confined entirely to those further south whose minds have been more or less warped by civilised usage  a ring was immediately formed and poor leo now saw that the matter was becoming serious  he was on the eve of fighting an enforced duel in obloorias service  while the savages were preparing the lists and koyatuk having recovered was engaged in converse with his father leo whispered to anders  perhaps oblooria has no objection to be the wife of this man  but the poor girl had very strong objections  she was moreover so emphatic in her expressions of horror and cast on her champion such a look of entreaty that he would have been more than mortal had he refused her  it was very perplexing  the idea of killing or being killed in such a cause was very repulsive  he tried to reason with grabantak about the sin of injuring a defenceless woman and the abstract right of females in general to have some say in the selection of their husbands but grabantak was inexorable  is the kablunet afraid he asked with a glance of scornful surprise  does he look afraid returned leo quietly  koyatuk now stepped into the middle of the ring of warriors with a short spear in his right hand and halfadozen spare ones in his left whereby leo perceived that the battle before him was not meant to be a mere exchange of shots for the satisfaction of honour  there was evidently no humbug about these eskimos  two men mounted guard over anders and oblooria who however were allowed to remain inside the ring to witness the combat  a warrior now advanced to leo and presented him with a small bundle of spears  he took them almost mechanically thanked the giver and laid them down at his feet without selecting one  then he stood up and crossing his arms on his breast gazed full at his opponent who made a hideous face at him and flourished his spear  it was quite evident that the eskimos were perplexed by the white youths conduct and knew not what to make of it  the truth is that poor leo was almost beside himself with conflicting emotions and uncertainty as to what he ought to do  despite all that had taken place he found it almost impossible to persuade himself that he was actually about to engage in mortal combat  he had not a vestige of angry feeling in his heart against the man whom he was expected to fight with to the death and the extraordinary nature of the complex faces that koyatuk was making at him tended to foster the delusion that the whole thing was a farceor a dream  then the knowledge that he could burst through the ring get hold of his rifle and sell his life dearly or perhaps cause the whole savage tribe to fly in terror was a sore temptation to him  all this coupled with the necessity for taking instant and vigorous action of some sort was enough to drive an older head distracted  it did drive the blood violently to the youths face but by a powerful effort of selfrestraint he continued to stand perfectly still like a living statue facing the eskimo  at last koyatuk became tired of making useless faces at his rival suddenly poising his spear he launched it  had leos eye been less quick or his limbs less active that spear had laid him low for ever  he had barely time to spring aside when the weapon passed between his side and his left arm grazing the latter slightly and drawing blood which trickled to the ends of his fingers  there could be no further doubt now about the nature of the fight catching up a spear from the bundle at his feet he was just in time to receive the eskimo who sprang in on him with the intention of coming at once to close quarters  his rush was very furious probably with a view to make it decisive  but the agile leo was equal to the occasion bending suddenly so low as to be quite under his opponents desperate thrust he struck out his right leg firmly  koyatuk tripped over it and ploughed the land for some yards with his hands head and knees  considerably staggered in mind and body by the fall he sprang up with a roar and turned to renew the attack  leo was ready  the eskimo by that time mad with pain humiliation and rage exercised no caution in his assault  he rushed at his rival like a mad bull  our englishman saw his opportunity  dropping his own spear he guarded the thrust of his adversarys with his right arm while with his left fist he planted a solid blow on koyatuks forehead  the right fist followed the left like the lightning flash and alighted on koyatuks nose which flat by nature was rendered flatter still by art  indeed it would be the weakest flattery to assert that he had any nose at all after receiving that blow  it was reduced to the shape of a small pancake from the two holes in which there instantly spouted a stream of blood so copious that it drenched alike its owner and his rival  after giving him this double salute leo stepped quickly aside to let him tumble forward heels over head which he did with the only halfchecked impetuosity of his onset and lay prone upon the ground  there anders said the victor turning round as he pointed to his prostrate foe surely grabantaks son has got enough of blood now to wipe out all the insults he ever received or is likely to receive from me  grabantak appeared to agree to this view of the case  that he saw and relished the jest was obvious for he burst into an uproarious fit of laughter in which his amiable warriors joined him and advancing to leo gave him a hearty slap of approval on the shoulder  at the same time he cast a look of amused scorn on his fallen son who was being attended to by merkut  it may be observed here that merkut was the only woman of the tribe allowed to go on this warexpedition  being the chiefs wife she had been allowed to do as she pleased and it was her pleasure to accompany the party and to travel like the warriors in a kayak which she managed as well as the best of them  grabantak now ordered his men to encamp and feed till the gale should abate  then calling leo and the interpreter aside he questioned them closely as to the condition of the poloese and the numbers of the white men who had recently joined them  of course leo made anders give him a graphic account of the preparations made by his enemies to receive him in the hope that he might be induced to give up his intentions but he had mistaken the spirit of the eskimo who merely showed his teeth frowned laughed in a diabolic manner and flourished his spear during the recital of amalatoks warlike arrangements  he wound up by saying that he was rejoiced to learn all that because it would be all the more to his credit to make his enemy go down on his knees lick the dust crawl in his presence and otherwise humble himself  but tell him anders said leo earnestly that my white brothers though few in number are very strong and brave  they have weapons too which kill far off and make a dreadful noise  grabantak laughed contemptuously at this  does the kablunet he asked think i am afraid to dieafraid of a noise does he think that none but white men can kill far off  as he spoke he suddenly hurled his spear at a gull which with many others was perched on a cliff about thirty yards off and transfixed it  go to the boat anders and fetch my rifle said leo in a low tone  when the rifle was brought a crowd of eskimos came with it  they had been closely observing their chief and the stranger during the conference but remained at a respectful distance until they saw something unusual going on  tell the chief said leo to look at that peak with the solitary gull standing on it  he pointed to a detached cone of rock upwards of two hundred yards distant  when the attention of the whole party was concentrated on the bird in question leo took a steady aim and fired  need we say that the effect of the shot was wonderful not only did the braves utter a united yell and give a simultaneous jump but several of the less brave among them bolted behind rocks or tumbled in attempting to do so while myriads of seafowl which clustered among the cliffs sprang from their perches and went screaming into the air  at the same time echoes innumerable which had lain dormant since creation or at best had given but sleepy response to the bark of walruses and the cry of gulls took up the shot in lively haste and sent it to and fro from cliff to crag in bewildering continuation  wonderful exclaimed grabantak in openmouthed amazement when he beheld the shot gull tumbling from its lofty perch do it again  leo did it againall the more readily that another gull unwarned by its predecessors fate flew to the conical rock at the moment and perched itself on the same peak  it fell as before and the echoes were again awakened while the seabirds cawed and screamed more violently than ever  the timid ones among the braves having recovered from their first shock stood fast this time but trembled much and glared horribly  the chief who was made of sterner stuff than many of his followers did not move though his face flushed crimson with suppressed emotion  as to the seabirds curiosity seemed to have overcome fear for they came circling and wheeling overhead in clouds so dense that they almost darkened the skymany of them swooping close past the eskimos and then shearing off and up with wild cries  an idea suddenly flashed into leos head  pointing his rifle upwards he began and continued a rapid fire until all the bullets in it ten or twelve were expended  the result was as he had expected  travelling through such a dense mass of birds each ball pierced we know not how many until it absolutely rained dead and wounded gulls on the heads of the natives while the rocks sent forth a roar of echoes equal to a continuous fire of musketry  it was stupendous  nothing like it had occurred in the polar regions since the world first became a little flattened at the poles  nothing like it will happen again until the conjunction of a series of similar circumstances occurs  the timid braves lost heart again and dived like the coneys into holes and corners of the rocks  others stood still with chattering teeth  even grabantak wavered for a moment  but it was only for a moment  recovering himself he uttered a mighty shout then he yelled then he howled then he slapped his breast and thighs then he seized a smallish brave near him by the neck and hurled him into the sea  having relieved his feelings thus he burst into a fit of laughter such as has never been equalled by the wildest maniac either before or since  suddenly he calmed stepped up to leo and wrenched the rifle from his grasp  i will do that he cried and held the weapon out at armslength in front of his face with both hands but there was no answering shot  why does it not bark he demanded turning to leo sternly  it will only bark at my bidding said leo with a significant smile  bid it then said the chief in a peremptory tone still holding the rifle out  you must treat it in the right way otherwise it will not bark  i will show you  having been shown how to pull the trigger the chief tried again but a sharp click was the only reply  grabantak having expected a shot he nervously dropped the rifle but leo was prepared and caught it  you must not be afraid of it it cannot work properly if you are afraid  see look there he added pointing to the conical rock on which another infatuated gull had perched himself  grabantak looked earnestly  his timid braves began to creep out of their holes and directed their eyes to the same spot  while their attention was occupied leo managed to slip a fresh cartridge into the rifle unobserved  now said he handing the rifle to the chief try again  grabantak who was not quite pleased at the hint about his being afraid seized the rifle and held it out as before  resolved to maintain his reputation for coolness he said to his followers in imitation of leo  do you see that gull  huk replied the warriors with eager looks  leo thought of correcting his manner of taking aim but reflecting that the result would be a miss in any case he refrained  grabantak raised the rifle slowly as its owner had done and frowned along the barrel  in doing so he drew it back until the butt almost touched his face  then he fired  there was a repetition of previous results with some differences  the gull flew away from the rock unhurt one of the braves received the bullet in his thigh and ran off shrieking with agony while the chief received a blow from the rifle on the nose which all but incorporated that feature with his cheeks and drew from his eyes the first tears he had ever shed since babyhood  that night grabantak sat for hours staring in moody silence at the sea tenderly caressing his injured nose and meditating no doubt on things past present and to come    chapter twenty three  leo visits flatland and sees as well as hears much to interest him there  the result of grabantaks meditation was that considering the nature and wonderful weapons of the men by whom amalatok had been reinforced he thought it advisable to return to his own land which was not far distant for the purpose of adding to the force with which he meant to subjugate the men of poloe  we are unconquerable he said while conversing on the situation with teyma his first lieutenant or prime minister everybody knows that we are invincible  it is wellknown that neither white men nor yellow menno nor black men nor blue mencan overcome the flatlanders we must keep up our name  it will not do to let the ancient belief die down that one flatlander is equal to three men of poloe or any other land  the poloe men laugh in their boots when they hear us boast in this way said teyma gently  we draw attention to the curious resemblance in this phrase to our more civilised laughing in the sleeve while we point out that the prime minister although of necessity a man of war was by nature a man of peace  indeed his name teyma which signifies peace had been given him because of his pacific tendencies  what would you not have me defend the flatland name demanded grabantak fiercely  no i would have you defend only the flatland property replied the blunt minister  and is not puiroe my property growled grabantak referring to the barren rock which was the cause of war  so is that your property said teyma picking up a stone and yet i treat it thus  he tossed it contemptuously into the sea is that worth flatlander blood would you kill me for that shall eskimo wives and mothers weep and children mourn and starve for a useless rock in the sea  you always thwart me teyma said grabantak trying to suppress a burst of wrath which he was well aware his fearless minister did not mind in the least  it is true this island is not worth the shake of a puffins tail but if we allow the poloe men to take it  to keep it mildly suggested teyma they have long had it  well to keep it if you will continued the chief testily will not other tribes say that the old name of the flatlanders is dead that the warspirit is gone that they may come and attack us when they please for we cannot defend our property and they will try to make us slaves what shall flatlanders become slaves no never never never cried grabantak furiously though unconsciously quoting the chorus of a wellknown song  no never reechoed teyma with an emphatic nod yet there are many steps between fighting for a useless rock and being made slaves  well then cried grabantak replying to the first part of his lieutenants remark and ignoring the second we must fight to prove our courage  as to losing many of our best men of course we cannot help that  then we must kill burn and destroy right and left in poloeland to prove our power  after that we will show the greatness of our forbearance by letting our enemies alone  perhaps we may even condescend to ask them to become our friends  what an honour that would be to them and doubtless what a joy  grabantak said teyma with a look and tone of solemnity which invariably overawed his chief and made him uncomfortable you have lived a good many years now  did you ever make a friend of an enemy by beating him  of course not said the other with a gesture of impatience  grabantak you had a father  yes said the chief with solemn respect  and he had a father  true  and he too had a father  well i suppose he had  of course he had  all fathers have had fathers back and back into the mysterious longtime  if not where did our tales and stories come from there are many stories told by fathers to sons and fathers to sons till they have all come down to us and what do these stories teach us that all fighting is bad except what must be  even what must be is badonly it is better than some things that are worse  loss of life loss of country loss of freedom to hunt and eat and sleep are worse we must fight for thesebut to fight for a bare rock for a name for a coast for a fancy it is foolish and when you have got your rock and recovered your name and pleased your fancy do the brave young men that are dead return  do the maidens that weep rejoice  do the mothers that pine revive  of what use have been all the wars of flatland from longtime till now  can you restore the mountainheaps of kayaks and oomiaks and spears and walruslines from the smoke into which they vanished  can you recall the great rivers of whaleoil from the sea into which they have been poured or the blood of men from the earth that swallowed it  is not war always loss loss loss and never gain  why cannot we live at peace with those who will and fight only with those who insist on war  go teyma stop your mouth with blubber said the chief rising i am weary of you  i tell you amalatok shall die puiroe shall be mine the tribes shall all learn to tremble at the name of grabantak and to respect the men of flatland  ay and to love them too i suppose added teyma with a facetious sneer  boo replied his chief bringing the conversation to an abrupt close by walking away  in accordance with their chiefs resolve the grabantak band embarked in their kayaks next morning the gale having moderated and with the intention of obtaining reinforcements paddled back to flatland which they reached in a couple of days  on the voyage leo confined himself strictly to the oars and paddles being unwilling to let the eskimos into the secret of the kite until he could do so with effect either in the way of adding to their respect for the white man and his contrivances or of making his escape  now as has been said or hinted although grabantaks son koyatuk was a stout and tall man he was not gifted with much brain  he possessed even less of that substance than his father whose energy and power of muscle coupled with indomitable obstinacy enabled him to hold the reins of government which were his by hereditary right  besides being a fearless man grabantak was respected as a good leader in war  but koyatuk had neither the energy of his father nor his determination  he was vacillating and lazy as well as selfish  hence he was not a favourite and when after landing at flatland he endeavoured to renew his claim to oblooria neither his father nor the people encouraged him the timid one was therefore left with leo and anders who immediately fitted up for her a separate screenedoff apartment in the hut which was assigned to them in the native village  even koyatuks mother did not befriend her son on this occasion  merkut had her own reasons for proving faithless to her spoilt boy whom on most occasions she favoured  knowing his character well the sturdy wife of grabantak had made up her mind that koyatuk should wed a young intelligent and what you may call lumpy girl named chukkee who was very fond of the huge and lazy youth and who being herself goodnatured and unselfish would be sure to make him a good wife  after one or two unavailing efforts therefore and a few sighs the heirapparent to the throne of flatland ceased to trouble oblooria and devoted himself to his three favourite occupationshunting eating and repose  misser lo whispered anders on the first night after landing as they busied themselves with the partition above referred to we scapes from dis here land very easy  how anders  wy yous ony got wait for nort vint den up kite launch boat anhup away  true lad but i dont want to escape just yet  not want to scape  no  you see anders we are now on very friendly terms with this tribe and it seems to me that if we were to remain for a time and increase our influence we might induce grabantak to give up this war on which he seems to have set his heart  i have great hopes of doing something with teyma  he is evidently a reasonable fellow and has much power i think with the chiefindeed with every one  pity that he is not to succeed grabantak instead of that stupid koyatuk  besides now i am here i must explore the land if possible  it is a pity no doubt to leave our friends even for a short time in ignorance of our fate but we cant help that at present  light the lamp anders and lets see what were about  the summer was by that time so far advanced that the sun descended a considerable way below the horizon each night leaving behind a sweet mellow twilight which deepened almost into darkness inside the eskimo huts  these latter like those already described were made of stone and the small openings that served for windows did not let in much light at any time  the hut which had been assigned by grabantak to his prisonersor visitors for as such he now seemed to regard themwas a large roomy one made chiefly of clay  it stood on a little mound a hundred yards or so apart from the main village of flatland and was probably one of the chiefs private palaces  it was oval in formlike a huge oven about fifteen feet in diameter and six feet in height  onehalf of the floor was raised about eight inches thus forming the breck which served for a lounge by day and a couch by night  its furniture of skins cookinglamp etcetera was much the same as that of the eskimo huts already described except that the low tunnelshaped entrance was very longabout twelve feet  light was admitted by a parchmentcovered hole or window with several rents in it as well as by various accidental holes in the roof  when the lamp was lighted and skins were spread on the breck and leo having finished the partition was busy making entries in a notebook and anders was amusing himself with a tobacco pipefoolish man and oblooria was devoting herself to the lamp from which various charming sounds and delicious smells emanatedas well as smokethis northern residence looked far more cheerful and snug than the luxurious dwellers in civilised lands will readily believe  i wonder said leo looking up from his book after a prolonged silence i wonder what strange sounds are those i hear  praps its de vint said anders puffing a cloud from his lips in sleepy contentment and glancing upwards  when he and leo looked at the roof of the hut it shook slightly as if something had fallen on it  strange muttered leo reverting to his notebook it did not look like wind when the sun went down  it must be going to blow hard  after a few minutes of silence leo again looked up inquiringly  deres anoder squall said anders  more like a sneeze than a squall  listen that is a queer pattering sound  they listened but all was silent  after a minute or so they resumed their occupations  the sounds were however no mystery to those who were in the secret of them  knowing the extreme curiosity of his countrymen grabantak had placed a sentinel over his guests hut with orders to let no one go near it  the sentinel entered on his vigil with that stern sense of dutyuntodeath that is supposed to animate all sentinels  at first the inhabitants of flatland kept conscientiously away from the forbidden spot but as the shades of night toned down the light some of them could not resist drawing near occasionally and listening with distended eyes ears and nostrils as if they expected to drink in foreign sounds at all these orifices  the sentinel grasped his spear steeled his heart and stood in front of the door with a look of grand solemnity worthy of the horseguards  at last however the sentinels own curiosity was roused by the eager looks of thosechiefly big boyswho drew ever nearer and nearer occasional sounds from the hut quickened his curiosity and the strange smell of tobaccosmoke at last rendered it unbearable  slowly sternly as if it were part of his duty to spy he moved to the torn window and peeped in  he was fascinated at once of course  after gazing for five minutes in rapt admiration he chanced to withdraw his face for a moment and then found that nine eskimos had discovered nine holes or crevices in the hut walls against which their fat faces were thrust while at least halfadozen others were vainly searching for other peepholes  a scarcely audible hiss caused the rapt nine to look up  a terrible frown and a shake of the official spear caused them to retire down the slope that led to the hut  this was the unaccountable squall that had first perplexed leo and his comrade  but like tigers who have tasted blood the flatlanders could not now be restrained  go said the sentinel in a low stern voice to the retreating trespassers whom he followed to the foot of the slope  if you come up again i will tell grabantak who will have you all speared and turned into whalebuoys  the boys did not appear to care much for the threat  they were obviously buoyed up with hope  oh do do let us peep just once entreated several of them in subdued but eager tones  the sentinel shook his obdurate head and raised his deadly spear  we will make no noise said a youth who was the exact counterpart of benjamin vane in all respects except colour and costumethe first being dirty yellow and the latter hairy  the sentinel frowned worse than ever  the kablunets said another of the band entreatingly shall hear nothing louder than the falling of a snowflake or a bit of eiderdown  still the sentinel was inexorable  the eskimos were in despair  suddenly benjys counterpart turned and fled to the village on light and noiseless toe  he returned immediately with a rich odorous steaming piece of blubber in his hand  it was a wise stroke of policy  the sentinel had been placed there without any reference to the fact that he had not had his supper  he was ravenously hungry  can you blame him for lowering his spear untying his eyebrows and smiling blandly as the held out his hand  just one peep and it is yours said the counterpart holding the morsel behind him  my life is in danger if i do remonstrated the sentinel  your supper is in danger if you dont said the counterpart  it was too much for him  the sentinel accepted the bribe and devouring it returned with the bribers on tiptoe to the hut where they gazed in silent wonder to their hearts content  well that beats everything said leo laying down his book and pencil but i never did hear a gale that panted and snorted as this one does  ill go out and have a look at it  he rose and crawled on hands and knees through the tunnel  the spies rolled off the hut with considerable noise and fled while the sentinel resuming his spear and position tried to look innocent  while he was explaining to anders why he was there grabantak himself walked up accompanied by his lieutenant  they were hospitably entertained and as oblooria had by that time prepared a savoury mess such as she knew the white men loved the chief and teyma condescended to sup with their captiveguests  leo had not with him the great cooking machine with which his uncle had effected so much in poloeland but he had a tin kettle and a couple of pannikins with some coffee sugar and biscuit which did good service in the way of conciliating if not surprising the chief of flatland  both he and his lieutenant moreover were deeply interested in anderss proceedings with the pipe  at first they supposed he was conducting some religious ceremony and looked on with appropriate solemnity but on being informed of the mistake grabantak smiled graciously and requested a whiff  he received one and immediately made such a hideous face that anders could not restrain a short laugh whereupon the chief hit him over the head with his empty pannikin but after frowning fiercely joined in the laugh  leo then began to question the chief about the land over which he ruled and was told that it was a group of islands of various sizes like the group which belonged to amalatok but with more islands in it that most of these islands were flat and covered with lakes large and small in which were to be found many animals and birds as numerous almost as the stars  ask him from what direction these birds come said leo pulling out his pocketcompass and expecting that grabantak would point to the south but the chief pointed to the north then to the south then to the east and then to the west  what does he mean  i dont understand him said leo  the birds come from everywherefrom all round  they come here to breed said the chief spreading his hands round him and pointing in all directions  then when the young are strong and the cold season begins they spread the wing and go away thereto every placeall round  anders said leo impressively do you know i think we have actually arrived at the immediate region of the north pole  what the chief says almost settles the question  this you see must be the warmest place in the polar regions the central spot around the pole to which migratory birds flock from the south  if voyagers crossing the arctic circle at all parts have observed these birds ever flying north it follows that they must have some meetingplace near the pole where they breed and from which they depart in autumn  well according to grabantak this is the meetingplace therefore this must be near the pole  how i wish uncle were here  leo had been more than half soliloquising he now looked up and burst into a laugh for the interpreter was gazing at him with an expression of blank stupidity  yous kite right missr lo he said at last with a meek smile kite right no doubt only yous too clibber for me  well anders ill try not to be quite so clibber in future but ask grabantak if he will go with me on an expedition among these islands  i want very much to examine them all  examine them all repeated the chief with emphasis when this was translated tell the young kablunet with the hard fist that the sunless time would come and go and the sunseason would come again before he could go over half my lands  besides i have more important work to do  i must first go to poloeland to kill and burn and destroy after that i will travel with hardfist  hardfist as the chief had styled him in reference to his late pugilistic achievements felt strongly inclined to use his fists on grabantaks skull when he mentioned his sanguinary intentions but recalling alfs oftquoted words discretion is the better part of valour he restrained himself  he also entered into a long argument with the savage in the hope of converting him to peace principles but of course in vain  the chief was thoroughly bent on destroying his enemies  then in a state of almost desperate anxiety leo sought to turn him from his purpose by telling him about god the father and the prince of peace and pulling out his bible began to read and make anders interpret such passages of the word as bore most directly on his subject  while acting in this to him novel capacity as a teacher of gods word leo more than once lifted up his heart in brief silent prayer that the spirit might open the heart of the savage to receive the truth  the chief and his lieutenant listened with interest and surprise  being savages they also listened with profound respect to the young enthusiast but grabantak would not give up his intention  he explained however that he meant first to go to the largest and most central island of his dominions to make inquiry there of the man of the valley what would be the best time to set out for the war  the man of the valley asked leo who is that  he is an eskimo replied grabantak with a sudden air of solemnity in his manner whose first forefather came in the far past longtime from nobody knows where but this first forefather never had any father or mother  he settled among the eskimos and taught them many things  he married one of their women and his sons and daughters were many and strong  their descendants inhabit the great isle of flatland at the present day  they are good and strong great hunters and warriors  the first forefather lived long till he became white and blind  his power and wisdom lay in a little strange thing which he called buk  how it made him strong or wise no one can tell but so it was  his name was makitok  when he died he gave buk to his eldest son  it was wrapped up in a piece of sealskin  the eldest son had much talk with his father about this mysterything and was heard to speak much about the kablunets but the son would never tell what he said  neither would he unwrap the mysterything for fear that its power might escape  so he wrapped it up in another piece of sealskin and gave it to his eldest son telling him to hand it down from son to son along with the name makitok  so buk has grown to be a large bundle now and no one understands it but every one has great reverence for it and the makitok now in possession is a great mysteryman very wise we always consult him on important matters  here was food for reflection to leo during the remainder of that night and for many hours did his sleepless mind puzzle over the mystery of makitok the man of the valley  this sleepless condition was not unpleasantly prolonged by the sounds of animal life that entered his ovenlike dwelling during great part of the night  evidently great numbers of the feathered tribes were moving about either because they meant to retire at dissipatedly late or had risen at unreasonably early hours  among them he clearly distinguished the musical note of the longtailed duck and the harsh scream of the great northern diver while the profound calmness of the weather enabled him to hear at intervals the soft blow and the lazy plash of a white whale turning it might be on his other side in his waterbed on the arctic sea  following the whales example leo turned round at last buried his face in a reindeer pillow and took refuge in oblivion    chapter twenty four  a glorious region contemplated and a glorious chase planned  leo did not slumber long  very early in the morning he awoke with that sensation about him which told that at that time further repose was not attainable  he therefore rose donned the few garments which he had put off on lying down crept through his tunnel and emerged into the open air  and what a vision of glorious beauty met his enraptured eyes while the fresh seabreeze entered like life into his heaving chest  it was still a profound calm  earth air water sky seemed to be uniting in a silent act of adoration to their great creator while the myriad creatures therein contained were comparatively quiet in the enjoyment of his rich and varied bounties  it seemed as if the hour were too early for the strife of violent passionstoo calm for the stirrings of hatred or revenge  everything around spoke only of peace  sitting down with his back to a sunbathed rock and his face to the silver sea leo drew out his bible and proceeded to read the records of the prince of peace  as he lifted his eyes from the words marvellous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well to the vision of beauty and life that lay before him leo made the words and the thought for the first time his own  the prospect embraced innumerable islands of all sizes studding like gems the gentlyheaving sea  over these countless millions of seabirds flew or sailed to and fro some with the busy fluttering of activity as if they had something to do and a mind to do it others loitering idly on the wing or dipping lightly on the wave as if to bid their images goodmorning  burgomaster yellowlegged and pinkbeaked gulls large and small wheeled in widening circles round him occasional flocks of ptarmigan in the mixed brown and white plumage of summer whirred swiftly over him and took refuge among the rocky heights of the interior none of which heights rose above three hundred feet eiderducks chattering kittiwakes and graceful tern auks guillemots puffins geese and even swans swarmed on the islands far and near while seals whales narwhals dolphins and grampuses revelled in the sea so that the arctic world appeared almost overcharged with animal life  of course the noise of their cries and evolutions would have been great had not distance lent enchantment to sound as well as view  to leo there seemed even a sort of restfulness in the voices of the innumerable wildfowl  they were so far off most of them that the sounds fell on his ear like a gentle plaint and even the thunderous plash of the great greenland whale was reduced by distance to a ripple like that which fell on the shore at his feet  while he was meditating anders joined him and responded heartily to his salutation but anders was not in a poetical frame of mind that morning his thoughts had been already turned to an eminently practical subject  im tole said he seating himself beside our hero dat grabantak holds a talk bout fighting  and a council of war said leo  i know what the result of that will be  when leaders like grabantak and amalatok decide for war most of the people follow them like a flock of sheep  although most of the people never saw this miserable islandthis puiroeand know and care nothing about it youll see that the flatlanders will be quite enthusiastic after the council and ready to fight for it to the bitter end  a very bitter end it is indeed to see men and women make fools of themselves about nothing and be ready to die for the same  will grabantak allow us to be present at the council think you  ho yis  he send me to say you muss come  leo was right  nothing could surpass the impetuosity of grabantak except the anxiety of many of the flatlanders to be led by the nose was not the point in question one of vital importance to the wellbeing of the communityindeed of the whole arctic world  teyma mildly asked them what was the point in question but not a soul could tell until grabantak starting up with furious energy manufactured a point and then explained it in language so intricate yet so clear that the whole council stood amazed at their never having seen it before in that light and then said more or less emphatically there thats what we thought exactly only we could not state it so well as the great grabantak  after this there was no chance for teyma and his partyand he had a party even among northern savageswho believed in men working hard at their own affairs and letting other people alone as far as that was possible  but the peaceparty in arctic land was in a minority at that time and the council broke up with shouts for grabantak and denunciations of death and destruction to the men of poloeland  but things do not always turn out as meneven wise menarrange them from that day during the brief period of preparation for the setting out of an expedition to visit makitok of great isle leo received daily visits from the prime minister who was deeply interested and inquisitive about the strange thing as he styled the bible which told the kablunets about god and the prince of peace  of course leo was willing and happy to give him all the information he desired and in doing so found a new and deep source of pleasure  teyma was not the man to hide his light under a bushel  he was a fearless outspoken counsellor and not only sought to advance the pacific views he held by talking to the men of his own party in private but even propounded them in public to grabantak himself who however could not be moved though many of his men quietly changed sides  with all this teyma was loyal to his chief  whatever he did was in the way of fair and open argument  he was too loyal to help leo when he made a certain proposal to him one day  teyma said leo on that occasion you have been very friendly to me will you do me a great favour  will you send a young man in a kayak to poloeland with a message from me to my people  they must think i am dead  i wish them to know that i am here and well  no replied teyma promptly that would let the men of poloe know that we talk of going to attack them  i do not love war  i wish to let our enemies alone but if my chief decides for war it is my duty to help not to frustrate him  if we go to war with poloeland we must take the men of poloe by surprise  that could not be if a young man went with your message  leo saw the force of this and respected teymas disinterested loyalty to his chief but felt inclined to argue that fidelity to the best interests of his country stood higher than loyalty to a chief  he refrained however from pressing the matter at that time  not so anders  when that worthy saw that teyma would not act and that leo from some inexplicable reason hesitated he quietly took the matter into his own hands and so wrought on the feelings of a weak but amiable youth of the tribe that he prevailed on him to carry a message to the enemy explaining to him earnestly that no evil but the reverse would result from his mission that the kablunets were men of peace who would immediately come over to flatland and put everything right in a peaceable and satisfactory manner  tell the white men said anders that we are prisoners in flatland alive and wellbut they must come to help us quickly  no difficulty was experienced in sending the messenger away  there was unlimited personal freedom in flatland  young men frequently went off to hunt for days together at a time without saying anything about their intentions unless they chose so the secret messenger set out  thus the interpreter lighted the fuse of a mine which was eminently calculated to blow up the plans of grabantak  but another fuse had been lighted which in a still more effectual manner overturned the plans of that warlike chief  it chanced at this time that the flatlanders ran short of meat  their habit was to go off on a grand hunt gather as much meat as they could and then come home to feast and rejoice with their families until scarcity again obliged them to hunt  of course there were many among them whose natural activity rebelled against this lazy style of life but the exertions of these did not suffice to keep the whole tribe supplied  hence it came to pass that they often began to be in want while in the midst of plenty  a grand hunt was therefore organised  they were tired they said of ducks and geese and swans  they wanted a change from seals and bears walruses and such small fry  nothing short of a whale would serve them  once stirred up to the point of action there was no lack of energy among these northern eskimos  kayaks lines and spears were got ready and oomiaks were launched for women and children loved to see the sport though they did not join in it  everywhere bustle and excitement reigned and the hubbub was not a little increased by the agitated dogs which knew well what was afoot and licked their lips in anticipation  of course leo and anders prepared to go and see the fun  so did oblooria  it was arranged that leo and the latter were to go in the indiarubber boat  that vessel had been the source of deep absorbing interest and curiosity to the natives  when our travellers landed it had been conveyed to the side of the hut assigned them and laid gently on the turf where it was stared at by successive groups all day  they would have stayed staring at it all night if they had not been forbidden by grabantak to approach the kablunets during the hours of repose  leo explained its parts to them but made no reference to its expansive and contractile properties  he also launched it and paddled about to gratify the curiosity of his new friends but did not show them the kite which folded and in its cover he had stowed away in the hut  one night fearing that the sun might injure the boat leo had squeezed the air out of it folded it and stowed it away in the hut beside the kite  the astonishment of the natives when they came out next morning to stare and wonder according to custom was very great  leo resolved to make a mystery of it looked solemn when spoken to on the point and gave evasive replies  when however the time came for setting off on this grand hunt he carried his boat still bundled up in skins down to the waters edge where kayaks and oomiaks in hundreds lay ready to be launched  the news spread like wildfire that the kablunet was going to act wonderfully  every man woman and child in the place hurried to the spot  it is destroyed exclaimed grabantak sadly when he saw the boat unrolled flat and empty on the sand  we shall not describe the scene in detail  it is sufficient to say that leo did not disappoint the general expectation  he did indeed act wonderfully filling the unsophisticated savages with unbounded surprise and admiration while he filled the boat with air and launched it  he then stepped into it with anders gallantly lifted oblooria on board and seizing the oars rowed gently out to sea  with shouts of delight the eskimos jumped into their kayaks and followed  their admiration was however a little calmed by the discovery that the kayaks could beat the kablunet boat in speed though the women in their oomiaks could not keep up with it  there was no emulation however leo carefully refrained from racing  he had been supplied with a long lance and a couple of spears to which latter were attached by thongs of walrus hide two inflated sealskins to act as buoys  these leo had been previously instructed how to use  he took the kite with him on this occasion without however having much expectation of being able to use it as the calm still prevailed it was folded of course and fixed in its place in the bow  the natives thought it must be a spear or harpoon of strange form  it was not long before a whale was sighted  there were plenty of these monsters about some coming lazily to the surface to blow others lying quite still with their backs out of the water as if sunning themselves or asleep  soon the spirit of the hunter filled each eskimo bosom  what appeared to be an unusually large whale was observed on the horizon  kablunets indiarubber boats and all less important things were forgotten for the moment paddles were plied with energy and the chase began    chapter twenty five  in which a great hunt is described a war expedition frustrated and a hero ennobled  now in a fit of unwise ambition anders the interpreter resolved to signalise himself and display his valour on the occasion of this hunt he borrowed a kayak of one of the natives and went as an independent hunter  leo being quite able to row his boat alone with oblooria to steer did not object  the whale which had been selected was a thoroughgoing arctic monster of the largest size nearly a hundred feet long which while on his passage from the atlantic to the pacific through behring straits had paused for a nap off the isles of flatland  the fleet of kayaks converged towards the fish like a flock of locusts despite his utmost efforts leo could not do more than keep up in rear of the hunters for the sharp shuttlelike kayaks shot like arrows over the smooth sea while his clumsier boat required greater force to propel it  in a few minutes those eskimos who were best paddlers crept ahead of the rest  grabantak and his son took the lead whether because of right or because of superior strength it was hard to say  anders who was a powerful fellow and an expert canoeman kept close alongside of them not content with this he attempted to pass them but they saw his intention put on what sporting men call a spurt and in a few seconds left him several yards behind  on nearing their victim grabantak and koyatuk checked their speed and got their spears ready  a few minutes later and a dozen of the followers were up and prepared to act but they all held backall except the excitable anderswhile the chief and his son glided cautiously towards the fish one on either side  suddenly each grasped a spear and drove it with all the force of both arms deep into the whales flesh  it was a rude awaking  of course the fish dived instantly  in doing so it flung its tail on high with a superb sweep sending tons of water and the impatient anders into the air  the interpreter came down in a cataract of spray with his kayak doubled up but himself uninjured while the eskimos greeted the event with a shout of alarm  this changed into laughter when it was found that the ambitious man was none the worse for his toss and the women in one of the oomiak paddling quickly up hauled the drenched and crestfallen man out of the sea  they also picked up his spear with the sealskin buoy attached  giving him the place of honour in the bow they put the spear in his hand and bade him keep up heart and do better next time  meanwhile the whale having got over its first surprise and feeling the two large sealskinfloats a somewhat heavy as well as unusual drag soon came again to the surface not far from the spot where leo lay on his oars an amused as well as interested spectator of the scene  ho shrieked oblooria whose eager little heart was easily excited she pointed to the fish and gazed at leo with blazing eyes  you may be sure our hero did not lose time  the indiarubber boat leaped over the water as if it had suddenly been endowed with life  the smart little woman carefully arranged the spear and buoy ready to hand several of the kayaks which chanced to be nearest to the whale rushed towards it like swordfish but they had no chance leo being so near he did not check his speed on reaching the fish but allowed the boat to run tilt on its back  the smooth indiarubber glided up on the slippery surface till more than half its length was on the creatures back  it was thus checked without a shockprobably unfelt by the whale  leo seized the spear leaped up and with both hands drove it deep into the flesh just as the chief and his son had done  the force with which he drove it was so great that it thrust the boat back into the water  this was fortunate for it enabled them narrowly to escape the vortex that was instantly made by the diving of the now enraged monster a few backstrokes of the oars took them out of the sea of foam left behind  the masterly manner in which this was done called forth shouts of admiration from the entire fleet and it greatly surprised leo himself for it was the first time he had attempted to use the harpoon  it must have been chance he muttered to himself as he again lay on his oars awaiting the whales reappearance a sort of happy accident i feel convinced i could not do it so well a second time  the fish took a longer dive on this occasion and when he retained to the surface for another breath of air was at a considerable distance from all parts of the fleet  the instant he was seen however every paddle flashed into the sea and the kayaks darted away in pursuit they soon came up with their victim and another spear with its accompanying sealskin buoy was fixed in its side  down it went a third time and reappeared in quite an opposite direction from that in which it had been looked for  this uncertainty in the movements of the whale was a matter of small moment to the occupiers of the light kayaks but it told rather heavily on leo in his clumsier boat  he therefore resolved to paddle gently about take things easy watch the progress of the chase and trust to the chapter of accidents giving him another chance  you see oblooria he said in the eskimo tongue which he was picking up rapidly its of no use my pulling wildly about in all directions blowing myself for nothing so well just hang offandon here and watch them  as this remark called for no direct reply oblooria merely smiled indeed she more than smiledbut said nothing  it is just possible that leos rendering of the phrase offandon into eskimo may have sounded ridiculous  however this may be the two sat there for some time absorbed and silent spectators of the chase  how long will they take to kill it asked leo when he saw grabantak thrust somewhere about the thirtyfifth spear into the victim  all day answered oblooria  all day repeated leo in surprise  if they could lance him far in said the girl he would die soon but his flesh is thick and his life is deep down  leo relapsed into silence  the idea of remaining a mere spectator all day was distasteful to his active mind and body  he had almost made up his mind to ask one of the natives to lend him a kayak and change places when a puff of wind sent a few catspaws over the hitherto glassy sea  he looked quickly in the direction whence it came and observed a blue line on the horizon  it was a coming breeze  ere long it touched them blowing gently indeed but steadily  a glance upwards showed that it was steadier and stronger in the upper regions and blew towards the southeast in which direction the chase was being prosecuted with unflagging activity  if there was only enough muttered leo to take the kite up id soon be alongside of the whale come ill try  lend a hand oblooria  the eskimo girl had during her voyage to flatland become so well acquainted with the operation of extending and setting up the kite that she was able to lend effective assistance  in less than ten minutes it was expanded and although leo was nearly pulled into the water before he got fair hold of the regulator while oblooria was thrown down by an eccentric whisk of the tail they managed at last to get it fairly over their heads and soon sent it shooting upwards into the stronger air current above  of course they began to rush over the sea at a pace that would have quickly left the best kayak in the fleet far astern but leo did not wish to act precipitately  he sat down in the bow to attend to the regulator while oblooria held the steeringoar  keep her away a bit oblooria starboardi mean to that side  so we wont spoil their sport too soon  he pulled the regulator as he spoke and eased the pace while the eskimo girl with eyes glittering from expectancy and hope turned the boat off to the right  leo seemed to be meditative at first as if uncertain how to proceed soon this condition of mind passed  he let go the regulator and taking up the long whale lance with which he had been provided examined its blade and point  the full force of the breeze filled the kite and carried them along at not less than ten miles an hour  hitherto the eskimos had been so intent on their prey that they had no eyes for anything else  again and again had the whale been pierced by the stinging harpoons and the number of inflated sealskins which he was obliged by that time to drag down into the deep was so great that his dives had become more frequent and much shorter  it was obvious that the perseverance of his little foes would in the end overcome his mighty strength  it was equally evident however that there was still a great deal of fighting power left in him and as some of the harpoons had come out while several of the floats had broken loose there was just a possibility that he might yet escape if not vigorously followed up  suddenly one of the eskimos was seen to drop his paddle and point with both hands to the sky uttering at the same time a cry of surprise and alarm  there was no mistaking the cry  every paddle ceased to dip and every eye was turned to the sky  of course every voice gave forth a howl  a mystery shouted grabantak  an evil spirit cried koyatuk  a new kind of bird roared teyma  at that moment a cry louder than ever arose  leos boat was observed coming like a narwhal over the sea with the foam flying from its bows  the new kind of bird so they at first imagined had let down a long thin tail caught the boat of the white man and was flying away with it  into the midst of them the boat rushed  they dashed aside right and left  leo was standing in the bow  he moved not spoke not looked at no one but stood up bent a little forward with a stern frown on his brow his lips compressed and the long lance held level in both hands as if in the act of charging  catch hold of him yelled grabantak as they flew past  as well might they have tried to catch a comet  steer a little to the left said leo in a low tone  obedient on the instant the girl made a sharp stroke with the oar  steadyso  now oblooria hold on tight for your life  they were going straight at the whale  leo did not dare to think of the result of his intended attack  he could not guess it  he hoped all would be well  he had no time to think of pros and cons  they were close to the victim  on it now sliding over its back while the sharp lance entered its body with the full momentum of the chargedeep down into its vitals  blood flew out like a waterspout  the lance was torn from leos grasp as he fell backwards  oblooria leaped up in wild excitement dropped her oar and clapped her hands  at that instant the stout tractionline snapped and the boat remained fast while the kite descended in a series of helpless gyrations into the sea  next moment the whale went down in a convulsive struggle and the boat with its daring occupants was whelmed in a whirlpool of blood and foam  no cry proceeded from the eskimos during this stupendous attack  they seemed bereft alike of voice and volition but on beholding the closing catastrophe they rushed to the rescue with a united roar  before they could gain the spot leo was seen to emerge from the deep dripping with pink and white foam like a very watergod  oblooria followed instantly like a piebald waternymph  the boat had not been upset though overwhelmed and they had held on to it with the tenacity of a last hope  looking sharply round as he gasped and swept the water from his eyes leo seized the oars which being attached to the boat were still available and rowed with all his might away from the approaching eskimos as if he were afraid of being caught by them  they followed with if possible increased surprise at this inexplicable conduct they made up to him some even shot ahead of him  poor leo was not a moment too soon in reaching his kite for these people were about to transfix it with their whaleharpoons when he dashed up and ordered them to desist  having rescued the miserablelooking thing from the sea and hastily folded it he placed it in the bow  then breathing freely he began to look about him just as the whale came again to the surface in a dying flurry  it so chanced that it came up right under grabantaks kayak which it tossed up end over end  this would not have been a serious matter if it had not the next moment brought its mighty tail down on the canoe  it then sheered off a hundred yards or so leaped half its length out of the water and fell over on its side with a noise like thunder and died  every one turned to the place where the chiefs kayak lay a complete wreck on the water  its owner was seen swimming beside it and was soon hauled into one of the womens oomiaks  evidently he had been severely hurt but he would not admit the fact  with characteristic dignity he sternly ordered the fleet to lay hold of the whale and make for the shore  tell him his arm is broken said leo that evening to anders after examining the chiefs hurts in the privacy of his own hut and let him know that i am a medicineman and will try to cure him  grabantak received the information with a look of anger  then said he amalatok must live a little longer for i cannot fight him with a broken arm  go he added looking full at leo with something like admiration go you have done well today my young men want to make your nose blue  the peremptory nature of the chiefs command forbade delay  leo was therefore obliged to creep out of his hut wondering intensely and not a little uncomfortably as to what having his nose made blue could mean  he was quickly enlightened by anders who told him that the most successful harpooner in a whale hunt is looked on as a very great personage indeed and is invariably decorated with what may be styled the eskimo order of the blue ribbon  scarcely had he received this information when he was seized by the young men and hurried into the midst of an expectant circle where he submitted with a good grace to the ceremony  a youth advanced to him made a few complimentary remarks seized him by the right ear and with a little wet paint drew a broad blue line across his face over the bridge of his nose  he was then informed that he had received the highest honour known to the eskimos of the far north and that among other privileges it gave him the right of marrying two wives if he felt disposed to do so  accepting the honour but declining the privilege leo expressed his gratitude for the compliment just paid him in a neat eskimo speech and then retired to his hut in search of muchneeded repose not a little comforted by the thought that the chiefs broken arm would probably postpone the threatened war for an indefinite period  that night ridiculous fancies played about his deerskin pillow for he dreamed of being swallowed by a mad whale and whisked up to the sky by a kite with a broken arm and a blue stripe across its nose    chapter twenty six  tells of a warlike expedition and its happy termination  while these stirring events were taking place in flatland our friends in the island of poloe continued to fish and hunt and keep watch and ward against their expected enemies in the usual fashion but alas for the poor englishmen  all the light had gone out of their eyes all the elasticity had vanished from their spirits  ah it is only those who know what it is to lose a dear friend or brother who can understand the terrible blank which had descended on the lives of our discoverers rendering them for the time at least comparatively indifferent to the events that went on around them and totally regardless of the great object which had carried them so far into those regions of ice  they could no longer doubt that leo and his companions had perished for they had searched every island of the poloe group including that one on which leo and the eskimos had found temporary refuge  here indeed a momentary gleam of hope revived when alf found the spent cartridgecases which his brother had thrown down on the occasion of his shooting for the purpose of impressing his captors and they searched every yard of the island high and low for several days before suffering themselves to relapse into the old state of despair  no evidence whatever remained to mark the visit of the eskimos for these wily savages never left anything behind them on their warexpeditions and the storm had washed away any footprints that might have remained in the hard rocky soil  amalatokwho with his son and his men sympathised with the englishmen in their loss and lent able assistance in the prolonged searchgave the final deathblow to their hopes by his remarks when captain vane suggested that perhaps the lost ones had been blown over the sea to flatland  that is not possible said amalatok promptly  why not  the distance is not so very great  the distance is not very great that is true replied amalatok  if lo had sailed away to flatland he might have got safely there but blackbeard surely forgets that the storm did not last more than a few hours  if lo had remained even a short time on this island would not the calm weather which followed the storm have enabled him to paddle back again to poloe  no he must have thought the storm was going to be a long one and thinking that must have tried again to face it and paddle against it  in this attempt he has perished  without doubt lo and unders and oblooria are in the land of spirits  eskimos of the far north unlike the red men of the prairies are prone to give way to their feelings  at the mention of the timid ones name oolichuk covered his face with his hands and wept aloud  poor alf and benjy felt an almost irresistible desire to join him  all the fun and frolic had gone completely out of the latter and as for alf he went about like a man half asleep with a strange absent look in his eyes and a perfect blank on his expressionless face  no longer did he roam the hills of poloeland with geological hammer and box  he merely went fishing when advised or asked to do so or wandered aimlessly on the seashore  the captain and benjy acted much in the same way  in the extremity of their grief they courted solitude  the warm hearts of chingatok and the negro beat strong with sympathy they longed to speak words of comfort but at first delicacy of feeling which is found in all ranks and under every skin prevented them from intruding on sorrow which they knew not how to assuage  at last the giant ventured one day to speak to alf  has the great spirit no word of comfort for his kablunet children he asked  yes yes replied alf quickly  he says call upon me in the time of trouble and i will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me  have you not called asked chingatok with a slight look of surprise  no i say it to my shame chingatok  this blow has so stunned me that i had forgotten my god  call now said the giant earnestly  if he is a good and true god he must keep his promise  alf did call then and there and the eskimo stood and listened with bowed head and reverent look until the poor youth had concluded his prayer with the name of jesus  the negros line of argument with benjy was different and characteristically lower toned  you muss keep up de heart massa benjy  nobody nebber knows wot may come for to pass  praps massa leo he go to de nort pole by hisself he was allers bery fond o takin peepil by surprise  nebber say die massa benjy slongs ders a shot in de locker  at any other time benjy would have laughed at the poor cooks efforts to console him but he only turned away with a sigh  two days after that the eskimos of poloe were assembled on the beach making preparations to go off on a seal hunt  is that a whale on the horizon or a walrus asked the captain touching chingatok on the arm as they stood on the edge of the sea ready to embark  more like a black gull said benjy or a northern diver  chingatok looked long and earnestly at the object in question and then said with emphasisa kayak  one of the young men returning from a hunt i suppose said alf whose attention was aroused by the interest manifested by the surrounding eskimos  not so said amalatok who joined the group at the moment the man paddles like a man of flatland  what one of your enemies cried the captain who in his then state of depression would have welcomed a fight as a sort of relief evidently butterface shared his hopes for he showed the whites of his eyes and grinned amazingly as he clenched his horny hands  yesour enemies said amalatok  the advanced guard of the host said the captain heartily come the sooner we get ready for selfdefence the better  yis dats de word said the negro increasing his grin for a moment and then collapsing into sudden solemnity we nebber fights cep in selfdefenceoh nonebber  they come not to attack said chingatok quietly  flatlanders never come except in the night when men sleep  this is but one man  perhaps he brings news exclaimed benjy with a sudden blaze of hope  perhaps echoed alf eagerly  it may be so said chingatok  it was not long before the question was set at rest  the approaching kayak came on at racing speed  its occupant leaped on shore and panting from recent exertion delivered his thrilling message  prisoners in flatland said the captain at the council of war which was immediately summoned but alive and well  let us be thankful for that good news anyhow but then they ask us to help them quickly that means danger  yes danger shouted oolichuk who at the thought of oblooria in the hands of his foes felt an almost irresistible desire to jump at some of the youths of his own tribe and kill them by way of relieving his feelings  rest content oolichuk cried amalatok with a horrible grinding of his teeth we will tear out their hearts and batter in their skulls and  but resumed the captain hastily i do not think the danger so great all i would urge is that we should not delay going to their rescue  ho huk hi interrupted the whole band of assembled warriors leaping up and going through sundry suggestive actions with knives and spears  does my father wish me to get the kayaks ready asked chingatok who as usual retained his composure  do my son  let plenty of blubber be stowed in them and warspears said the old chief we will start at once  the promptitude with which these northern eskimos prepared for war might be a lesson to the men of civilised communities  we have already said that the sun had by that time begun to set for a few hours each day before it had reached the deepest twilight that night a hundred and fifty picked warriors with their kayaks and war material were skimming over the sea led by the fiery old chief and his gigantic but peaceloving son  of course captain vane benjy alphonse vandervell and butterface accompanied them but none of the women were allowed to go as it was expected that the war would be a bloody one  these therefore with the children were left in charge of a small body of the big boys of the tribe with the old men  the weather was fine the sea smooth and the arms of the invading host strong  it was not long before the sea that separated poloe island from flatland was crossed  towards sunset of a calm and beautiful day they sighted land  gently with noiseless dip of paddle they glided onward like a phantom fleet  that same evening leo and oblooria sat by the couch of grabantak nursing him  the injury received by the chief from the whale had thrown him into a high fever  the irritation of enforced delay on his fiery spirit had made matters worse and at times he became delirious  during these paroxysms it required two men to hold him down while he indulged in wild denunciations of his poloe foes with frequent allusions to dread surgical operations to be performed on the body of amalatok operations with which the royal college of surgeons is probably unacquainted  leo whose knowledge of the eskimo tongue was rapidly extending sought to counteract the patients ferocity by preaching forgiveness and patience  being unsuccessful he had recourse to a soporific plant which he had recently discovered  to administer an overdose of this was not unnatural perhaps in a youthful doctor absolute prostration was not the precise result he had hoped for but it was the result and it had the happy effect of calming the spirit of grabantak and rendering him open to conviction  fortunately the flatlanders were on the lookout when the men of poloe drew near  one of the flatland braves was returning from a fishing expedition at the time saw the advancing host while they were yet well out at sea and came home at racing speed with the news  strange that they should come to attack us said teyma to leo at the council of war which was immediately called  it has always up to this time been our custom to attack them  not so strange as you think said anders who now for the first time mentioned the sending of the message to poloeland  black looks were turned on the interpreter and several hands wandered towards boots in search of daggers when the prime minister interfered  you did not well unders to act without letting us know he said with grave severity  we must now prepare to meet the men of poloe whether they come as friends or foes  let the young men arm  i go to consult with our chief  you must not consult with grabantak said leo firmly  he lies limp his backbone has no more strength than a piece of walrus line  his son must act for him at present  boo exclaimed one of the warriors with a look of ineffable contempt koyatuk is big enough but he is brainless  he can bluster and look fierce like the walrus but he has only the wisdom of an infant puffin no we will be led by teyma  this sentiment was highly applauded by the entire council which included the entire army indeed the whole grownup male part of the nation so that koyatuk was deposed on the spot as all incompetents ought to be and one of the best men of flatland was put in his place  but if i am to lead you said the premier firmly it shall be to peace not to war  lead us to what you like you have brains returned the man who had previously said boo  we know not what is best but we can trust you  again the approval was unanimous  well then i accept the command until my chiefs health is restored said teyma rising  now the council is at an end  to your huts warriors and get your spears ready and to your lamps girls  prepare supper for our warriors and let the allowance of each be doubled  this latter command caused no small degree of surprise but no audible comment was made and strict obedience was rendered  leo returned to grabantaks hut where he found that fiery chief as limp as ever but with some of the old spirit left for he was feebly making uncomfortable references to the heart liver and other vital organs of amalatok and all his band  soon afterwards that band came on in battle array on murderous deeds intent  the flatlanders assembled on the beach to receive them  leave your spears on the ground behind you shouted teyma to his host advance to the waters edge and at my signal throw up your arms  they have been forewarned growled amalatok grinding his teeth in disappointment and checking the advance of his fleet by holding up one hand  no doubt said captain vane who with benjy alf and butterface was close to the poloe chief in one of the indiarubber boats no doubt my young countryman having sent a message expected us  surelyeh benjy is not that leo standing in front of the rest with another man  the captain applied his binocular telescope to his eyes as he spoke  yes its himthank god and i see anders too quite plainly and oblooria  are they bound hand and foot demanded amalatok savagely  no they are as free as you are  and the eskimos are unarmed apparently  ha that is their deceit growled the chief  the flatlanders were always sly but they shall not deceive us  braves get ready your spears  may it not be that leo has influenced them peacefully my father suggested chingatok  not so my son said the chief savagely  grabantak was always sly as a white fox fierce as a walrus mean as a wolf greedy as a black gull contemptible as  the catalogue of grabantaks vices was cut short by the voice of teyma coming loud and strong over the sea  if the men of poloe come as friends let them land  the men of flatland are about to feed and will share their supper  if the men of poloe come as foes still i say let them land  the braves of flatland have sharpened their spears  teyma threw up both hands as he finished and all his host followed suit  for a moment or two the poloese hesitated  they still feared deception then the voice of leo was heard loud and clear  why do you hesitate come on uncle suppers getting cold  weve been waiting for you a long time and are all very hungry  this was received with a shout of laughter by the englishmen high above which rose a wild cheer of joy from benjy  amalatok swallowed his warlike spirit laid aside his spear and seized his paddle  chingatok gave the signal to advance and a few minutes later those warriors of the norththose fierce savages who probably for centuries had been sworn hereditary foeswere seated round the igloelamps amicably smearing their fingers and faces with fat as they feasted together on chops of the walrus and cutlets of the polar bear    chapter twenty seven  the great discovery  friendly relations having been established between the flatlanders and the poloese both nations turned their attention to the arts of peace  among other things captain vane and his party devoted themselves once more with renewed energy to the pursuit of discovery and scientific investigation  an expedition was planned to great isle not now for the purpose of consulting makitok the oracle as to the best time for going to war but to gratify the wishes of captain vane who had the strongest reason for believing that he was in the immediate neighbourhood of the pole  blackbeard says he must be very near nothing now observed chingatok to anders the day after their arrival  near nothing exclaimed teyma who was sitting close by  of course the giant explained and the premier looked incredulous  i wish i had not left my sextant behind me in the hurry of departure said the captain that evening to leo  but we came off in such hot haste that i forgot it  however ill ask amalatok to send a young man back for it  im persuaded we cannot now be more than a few miles distant from our goal  i quite agree with you uncle for when i looked at the north star last night it seemed to me as directly in the zenith as it was possible to imagine  ay lad but the unaided eye is deceptive  a few miles of difference cannot be distinguished by it  when did the pole star become visible  only last night i fancied i had made it out the night before but was not quite sure the daylight even at the darkest hour being still too intense to let many of the stars be seen  well we shall see  i am of opinion that we are still between twenty and forty miles south of the pole  meanwhile ill induce teyma to get up an expedition to the island of this makiwhat  tok said leo makitok  everything almost ends in tok or tuk hereabouts  who and what is this man asked the captain  no one seems to know precisely  his origin has been lost in the mists of antiquity  his first forefatherso tradition styles himseems like melchisedec to have had no father or mother and to have come from no one knows where  anyhow he founded a colony in great isle and makitok is the present head of all the families  leo then explained about the mysterything called buk which was wrapped up in innumerable pieces of sealskin  strange said the captain passing strange  all you tell me makes me the more anxious to visit this man of the valley  you say there is no chance of grabantak being able to take the reins of government again for a long time  none  he has got a shake that will keep him helpless for some time to come  and this is well for teyma will be ready to favour any project that tends towards peace or prosperity  now while preparations for the northern expedition were being made our friend oolichuk went awooing  and this is the fashion in which he did it  arraying himself one day like any other lovesick swain in his best he paid a ceremonial visit to oblooria who lived with merkut the wife of grabantak in a hut at the eastern suburb of the village  oolichuks costume was simple if not elegant  it consisted of an undercoat of birdskins with the feathers inwards bearskin pantaloons with the hair out an upper coat of the grey seal dogskin socks and sealskin boots  that young eskimo did not visit his bride emptyhanded  he carried a bundle containing a giftskins of the young eiderduck to make an undergarment for his ladylove two plump little auks with which to gratify her palate and a bladder of oil to wash them down and cause her heart to rejoice  good fortune favoured this brave man for he met oblooria at a lonely part of the shore among the boulders  romance lies deep in the heart of an eskimoso deep that it is not perceptible to the naked eye  whatever the poloe warrior and maiden felt they took care not to express in words  but oolichuk looked unutterable things and invited oblooria to dine then and there  the lady at once assented with a bashful smile and sat down on a boulder oolichuk sat down beside her and presented the bundle of underclothing  while the lady was examining this with critical eyes the gentleman prepared the food  taking one of the auks he twisted off its head put his forefinger under the integuments of the neck drew the skin down backwards and the bird was skinned  then he ran his long thumbnail down the breast and sliced off a lump which he presented to the lady with the offhand air of one who should say if you dont want it you may let it alone  raw though the morsel was oblooria accepted it with a pleased look and ate it with relish  she also accepted the bladder and putting it to her lips pledged him in a bumper of oil  oolichuk continued this process until the first auk was finished  he then treated the second bird in the same manner and assisted his ladylove to consume it as well as the remainder of the oil conversation did not flow during the first part of the meal but after having drunk deeply their lips were opened and the feast of reason began  it consisted chiefly of a running commentary by the man on the kablunets and their ways and appreciative giggles on the part of the woman but they were interrupted at the very commencement by the sudden appearance of one of the kablunets sauntering towards them  they rose instantly and rambled away in opposite directions absorbed in contemplationthe one of the earth and the other of the sky  three days after that captain vane and his party approached the shores of great isle  it was low like the other islands of flatland but of greater extent insomuch that its entire circumference could not be seen from its highest central point  like the other islands it was quite destitute of trees but the low bush was luxuriantly dense and filled they were told with herds of reindeer and muskoxen  myriads of wildfowlfrom the lordly swan to the twittering sandpiperswarmed among its sedgy lakelets while grouse and ptarmigan were to be seen in large flocks on its uplands  the land was clothed in mosses and grasses of the richest green and decked with variegated wildflowers and berries  the voyagers were received with deep interest and great hospitality by the inhabitants of the coast who it seemed never quarrelled with the neighbouring islanders or went to war  makitok dwelt in the centre of the island  thither they therefore went the following day  it was afternoon when they came to the valley in which dwelt the angekok or as red indians would have styled him the medicineman  it was a peculiar valley  unlike other vales it had neither outlet or inlet but was a mere circular basin or depression of vast extent the lowest part of which was in its centre  the slope towards the centre was so gradual that the descent was hardly perceived yet captain vane could not resist the conviction that the lowest part of the vale must be lower than the surface of the sea  the rich luxuriance of herbage in great isle seemed to culminate in this lovely vale  at the centre and lowest part of the valley makitok or rather makitoks forefathers had built their dwelling  it was a hut resembling the huts of the eskimos  no other hut was to be seen  the angekok loved solitude  beside the hut there stood a small truncated cone about fifteen feet high on the summit of which sat an old whitebearded man who intently watched the approaching travellers  beholdmakitok said teyma as they drew near  the old man did not move  he appeared to be over eighty years of age and unlike eskimos in general had a bushy snowwhite beard  the thin hair on his head was also white and his features were good  our travellers were not disappointed with this strange recluse who received them with an air of refinement and urbanity so far removed from eskimo manners and character that captain vane felt convinced he must be descended from some other branch of the human family  makitok felt and expressed a degree of interest in the objects of the expedition which had not been observed in any eskimo except chingatok and he was intelligent and quick of perception far before most of those who surrounded him  and what have you to say about yourself asked the captain that evening after a long animated conversation on the country and its productions  i have little to say replied the old man sadly  there is no mystery about my family except its beginning in the long past  but is not all mystery in the long past asked the captain  true my son but there is a difference in my mystery  other eskimos can trace back from son to father till they get confused and lost as if surrounded by the winterfogs  but when i trace backfar backi come to one manmy first father who had no father it is said and who came no one knows from where  my mind is not confused or lost it is stopped  might not the mysterybundle that you call buk explain matters asked alf  when this was translated the old man for the first time looked troubled  i dare not open it he said in an undertone as if speaking to himself  from father to son we have held it sacred  it must grow ever grownever diminish  its a pity he looks at it in that light remarked leo to benjy as they lay down to sleep that night  i have no doubt that the man whom he styles first father wrapped up the thing whatever it is to keep it safe not to make a mystery of it and that his successors having begun with a mistaken view have now converted the rewrapping of the bundle by each successive heir into a sacred obligation  however we may perhaps succeed in overcoming the old fellows prejudices  goodnight benjy  a snore from benjy showed that leos words had been thrown away so with a light laugh he turned over and soon joined his comrade in the land of dreams  for two weeks the party remained on great isle hunting shooting fishing collecting and investigating also we may add astonishing the natives  during that period many adventures of a more or less exciting nature befell them which however we must pass over in silence  at the end of that time the youth who had been sent for the captains sextant and other philosophical instruments arrived with them allthermometers barometers chronometers wind and water gauges pendulums etcetera safe and sound  as the instruments reached cup valley so benjy had styled makitoks home in the morning it was too early for taking trustworthy observations  the captain therefore employed the time in erecting an observatory  for this purpose he selected with makitoks permission the truncated cone close to the recluses dwelling  here after taking formal possession and hoisting the union jack he busied himself in a state of subdued excitement preparing for the intended observations  ill fix the latitude and longitude in a few hours he said meantime leo you and benjy had better go off with the rifle and fetch us something good for dinner  leo and benjy were always ready to go ahunting  they required no second bidding but were soon rambling over the slopes or wading among the marshes of the island in pursuit of game  leo carried his repeater benjy the shotgun  both wore native eskimo boots as long as the leg which being made of untanned hide are when soaked thoroughly waterproof  see note  oolichuk and butterface carried the gamebags and these were soon filled with such game as was thought best for food  sending them back to camp with orders to empty the bags and return leo and benjy took to the uplands in search of nobler game  it was not difficult to find soon a splendid stag was shot by leo and a muskox by benjy  not long after this the bagbearers returned  you shoots mos awful well massas said butterface but its my pinion dat you bof better go home for captain vane he go mad  what dyou mean butterface asked leo  i mean dat de cappn hes hoed mad or suffin like it an massa alf not mush better  a good deal amused and surprised by the negros statement the two hunters hastened back to makitoks hut where they indeed found captain vane in a state of great excitement  well uncle whats the news asked leo found your latitude higher than you expected  higher exclaimed the captain seizing his nephew by both hands and shaking them  higher  i should think socouldnt be higher theres neither latitude nor longitude here my boy  ive found it comecome up and ill show you the exact spotthe north pole itself  he dragged leo to the top of the truncated cone on which he had pitched his observatory  there look round you he cried taking off his hat and wiping the perspiration from his brow  well uncle where is it asked leo halfamused and halfsceptical  where why dont you see it  no of course you dont  youre looking all round it lad  look downdown at your feet  leonard vandervell he added in sudden solemnity youre on it youre standing on the north pole now  leo still looked incredulous  what i you dont believe  convince him alf  indeed it is true said alf we have been testing and checking our observations in every possible manner and the result never varies more than a foot or two  the north pole is at this moment actually under our feet  as we have now good reader at last reached that great point of geographical interest which has so long perplexed the world and agitated enterprising man we deem this the proper place to present you with a map of captain vanes discoveries  and so said benjy with an injured look the geography books are right after all the world is a little flattened at the poles like an orange  well i never believed it before and i dont believe yet that its like an orange  but it is more than flattened benjy said leo dont you see it is even hollowed out a little as if the spinning of the world had made a sort of whirlpool at the north pole and no doubt there is the same at the south  chingatok who was listening to the conversation without of course understanding it and to whom the captain had made sundry spasmodic remarks during the day in the eskimo tongue went that night to amalatok who was sitting in makitoks hut and said  my father blackbeard has found it  found what my sonhis nothinghis nort pole  yes my father he has found his nort pole  is he going to carry it away with him in his soft windboat asked the old chief with a halfhumorous halfcontemptuous leer  and continued chingatok who was too earnest about the matter to take notice of his fathers levity his nort pole is something after all it is not nothing for i heard him say he is standing on it  no man can stand on nothing therefore his nort pole which he stands on must be something  he is standing on my outlook  he must not carry that away remarked makitok with a portentous frown  boh exclaimed amalatok rising impatiently  i will not listen to the nonsense of blackbeard  have i not heard him say that the world stands on nothing spins on nothing and rolls continually round the sun  how can anything spin on nothing  and as to the sun use your own eyes  do you not see that for a long time it rolls round the world for a long time it rolls in a circle above us and for a long time it rolls away altogether leaving us all in darkness  my son these kablunets are ignorant fools and you are not much better for believing them boo  i have no patience with the nonsense talk of blackbeard  the old chief flung angrily out of the hut leaving his more philosophic son to continue the discussion of the earths mysteries with makitok the reputed wizard of the furthest possible north    note  the writer has often waded kneedeep in such boots for hours at a time on the swampy shores of hudsons bay without wetting his feet in the slightest degree    chapter twenty eight  tells among other things of a notable discovery  soon after this signs of approaching winter began to make their appearance in the regions of the north pole  the sun which at first had been as a familiar friend night and day had begun to absent himself not only all night but during a large portion of each day giving sure though quiet hints of his intention to forsake the region altogether and leave it to the six months reign of night  frost began to render the nights bitterly cold  the birds having brought forth and brought up their young were betaking themselves to more temperate regions leaving only such creatures as bears seals walruses foxes wolves and men to enjoy or endure the regions of the frigid zone  suddenly there came a day in october when all the elemental fiends and furies of the arctic circle seemed to be let loose in wildest revelry it was a turningpoint in the arctic seasons  by that time captain vane and his party had transported all their belongings to great isle where they had taken up their abode beside old makitok  they had with that wizards permission built to themselves a temporary stone hut as benjy vane facetiously said on the very top of the north pole itself that is on the little mound or truncated cone of rock in the centre of the great isle on which they had already set up the observatory and which cone was in very truth as nearly as possible the exact position of that longsoughtfor imaginary point of earth as could be ascertained by repeated and careful observations made with the best of scientific instruments by thoroughly capable men  chingatok and his father with a large band of their followers and some of their women had also encamped by permission round the pole where in the intervals of the chase they watched with solemn and unflagging interest the incomprehensible doings of the white men  the storm referred to began with heavy snowthat slow quiet downfloating of great flakes which is so pleasant even restful in its effect on the senses  at first it seemed as if a golden haze were mixed with the snowfall suggesting the idea that the suns rays were penetrating it  most beautiful said leo who sat beside the captain and his friends on the north pole enjoying the view through the open doorway of the hut and sipping a cup of coffee  it reminds me said alf of buzzbys lines    the snowflakes falling softly   in the mornings golden prime   suggestive of a gentle touch   and the silent flight of time  behold a more powerful reminder of the flight of time said benjy pointing to the aged makitok who with white beard and snowbesprinkled person came slowly towards them like the living embodiment of old father christmas  come said leo hastening to assist the old man let me help you up the pole  leo and indeed all the party had fallen in with benjys humour and habitually referred thus to their mound  why comes the ancient one here through the snow said captain vane rising and offering makitok his seat which was an empty packingcase surely my friend does not think we would forget him  does not benjy always carry him his morning cup of coffee when the weather is too bad for him to come hither  truly returned the old man sitting down with a sigh the kablunets are kind  they never forget  bunjee never fails to bring the cuffy though he does sometimes pretend to forget the shoogre till i have tasted it and made a bad face then he laughs and remembers that the shoogre is in his pouch  it is his little way  but i come not today for cuffy i come to warn  there is danger in the air  blackbeard must take his strange things thus he referred to the philosophical instruments away from herefromhafrom nort pole and put them in my hut where they will be safe  the captain did not at once reply  turning to his companions he said  i see no particular reason to fear this danger in the air  ill go and consult chingatok or his father on the point  the ancient one as you call him said benjy seems to be growing timid with age  the youthful one retorted the captain seems to be growing insolent with age  go you scamp and tell amalatok i want to speak with him  whatever faults our young hero had disobedience was not one of them he rose promptly and soon returned with the chief of poloeland  amalatok confirmed the wizards opinions and both opinions were still more powerfully confirmed while he was speaking by a gust of wind which suddenly came rushing at them as if from all points of the compass converging at the pole and shooting upwards like a whirlwind carrying several hats of the party with volumes of the now wildly agitated snow up into the sky  there was no room for further hesitation  why massa bunjay i thought my woolly scalp he hoed up long wid my hat cried butterface leaping up in obedience to the captains hurried order to look sharp and lend a hand  in a short time all the instruments were removed from the observatory and carefully housed in makitoks hut  even while they were thus engaged the storm burst on them with excessive violence  the snow which had been falling so softly was caught up by the conflicting winds and hurled high into the air or driven furiously over the valley in all directions for the gale did not come from any fixed quarter it rose and swooped and eddied about driving the snowdrift now here now there and shrieking as if in wild delight at the chaotic havoc it was permitted to play  confusion worse confounded gasped leo as he staggered past alf with the last load on his shoulder  and yet there must be order everywhere observed chingatok when after all were safely housed in makitoks hut that evening he heard leo repeat that sentiment  why do you think so chingatok asked the captain with some curiosity  because there is order even in my hut returned the giant  pingasuk referring to his wife keeps all things in perfect order  is the worldmaker less wise than pingasuk  sometimes no doubt when pingasuk is cooking or arranging things may seem in disorder to the eye of my little boy meltik and the small one referring to baby but when meltik and the small one grow older and wiser they will see that it is not so  while chingatok was speaking a gust of wind more furious than ever struck the hut and shook it to its foundations  at the same time a loud rumbling sound was heard outside  most of the men leaped up caught hold of spears or knives and rushed out  through the driving drift they could just see that the observatory which was a flimsy structure had been swept clean away and that the more solid hut was following it even as they gazed they saw its roof caught up and whirled off as if it had been a scroll of paper  the walls fell immediately after and the stones rolled down the rocky cone with a loud rattling which was partially drowned by the shrieking of the tempest  for three days the storm lasted  during that time it was almost impossible to show face in the open air  on the night of the third day the fury of the wind abated  then it suddenly became calm but when butterface opened the door and attempted to go out he found himself effectually checked by a wall of snow  the interior of the hut was pitch dark and it was not until a lamp had been lighted that the party found they were buried alive  to dig themselves out was not however a difficult matter  but what a scene presented itself to their view when they regained the upper air no metamorphosis conceived by ovid or achieved by the magic lantern no pantomimic transformation no eccentricity of dreamland ever equalled it  when last seen the valley was clothed in all the rich luxuriance of autumnal tints and alive with the twitter and plaintive cry of birdlife  now it was draped in the pure windingsheet of winter and silent in the repose of arctic death  nothing almost was visible but snow  everything was whelmed in white  only here and there a few of the sturdier clumps of bushes held up their loads like gigantic weddingcakes and broke the universal sameness of the scene  one raven was the only living representative of the birds that had fled  it soared calmly over the waste as if it were the wizard who had wrought the change and was admiring its work  winter is upon us fairly now friends said captain vane as he surveyed the prospect from the pole which was itself all but buried in the universal drift and capped with the hugest weddingcake of all we shall have to accommodate ourselves to circumstances and prepare for the campaign  i suppose the first thing we shall have to do is to build a snowhouse said benjy looking ruefully round for as usual he was depressed by first appearances  just so benjy and the sooner we go to work the better  now the reader must not hastily conclude that we are about to inflict on him or her a detailed narrative of a six months residence at the north pole  we have no such fell design  much though there is to tellmuch of suffering more of enjoyment many adventures numerous stirring incidents and not a few mishapswe shall pass over the most of it in total silence and touch only on those points which are worthy of special notice  let us leap then into the very middle of the arctic winter  it is continuously dark now  there is no day at all at the pole it is night all round  the last glimmer of the departing sun left them months ago the next glimmer of his return will not reach them for months to come the northern eskimos and their english visitors were well aware of that nevertheless there was nothing of gloom or depressed spirits among them they were too busy for that  had not meat to be procured and then consumed  did not the procuring involve the harnessing of dogs in sledges the trapping of foxes and wolves the fighting of walruses the chasing of polar bears and did not the consuming thereof necessitate much culinary work for the women much and frequent attention and labour on the part of the whole community not to mention hours and sometimes days of calm repose  then as to light had they not the aurora borealis that mysterious shimmering in the northern sky which has puzzled philosophers from the beginning of time and is not unlikely to continue puzzling them to the end  had they not the moon and the stars which latter shone with a brilliancy almost indescribable and among them the now doubly interesting pole star right overhead with several new and gorgeous constellations unknown to southern climes  besides all this had not captain vane his scientific investigations his pendulum experiments his windgauging his ozone testing his thermometric barometric and chronometric observations besides what benjy styled his kiteometric pranks  these last consisted in attempts to bring lightning down from the clouds by means of a kite and cord and in which effort the captain managed to knock himself down and wellnigh shattered the north pole itself in pieces  moreover had not leo to act the part of physician and surgeon to the community a duty which he fulfilled so well that there never had been before that time such a demand for physic in flatland and it is probable there never will be so many sick people there again  in addition to this leo had to exercise his marvellous powers as a huntsman  benjy of course played his wonted role of mischiefmaker and jackofalltrades to the entire satisfaction of everybody especially on that great occasion when he succeeded in killing a polar bear singlehanded and without the aid of gun or spear or any lethal weapon whateverof which great event more hereafter  anders the southern eskimo made himself generally agreeable and butterface became a prime favourite chiefly because of his inexhaustible fund of fun and good humour coupled with his fine musical qualities  we have not said much on this latter point hitherto because we have been unwilling to overwhelm the reader with too sudden a disclosure of that marvellous magazine of power which was latent in our band of heroes but we feel it to be our duty now to state that the negro sang his native melodies with such pathos that he frequently reduced perhaps we should say elevated the unsophisticated eskimos to floods of tears and sometimes to convulsions of laughter  as at benjys suggestion he sometimes changed his moods abruptly the tears often mingled with the convulsions so as to produce some vivid illustrations of eskimo hysteria  but butterfaces strong point was the flute  no one who had not witnessed it could adequately conceive the poutings of thick red lips and general contortions of black visage that seemed necessary in order to draw the tones out of that simple instrument  the agonies of expression the hissing of wind and the turning up of whites of large black eyesit is past belief  the fruitless efforts of the eskimos to imitate him were as nothing to the great original and their delight at the sound was only equalled by their amazement at the sight  alf assisted the captain scientifically and otherwise  of course he was compelled during the long winter to lay aside his geological hammer and botanical box but then had he not the arrangement and naming of his specimens  his chief work however was to act the unwonted and we may add unexpected work of a lawgiver  this duty devolved on him thus  when grabantak recovered healthwhich he was very long in doinghis spirit was so far subdued that he agreedsomewhat sulkily it is true to all that his prime minister had done while he held the reins of government  then he was induced to visit great isle where he was introduced to his mortal foe amalatok whom he found to be so much a man after his own heart that he no longer sighed for the extraction of his spinal marrow or the excision of his liver but became a fast friend and was persuaded by alf to agree to a perpetual peace  he also took a great fancy to chingatok who begged of alf to read to the chief of flatland some of the strange and new ideas contained in his little book  alf willingly complied and for hours these northern savages sat in rapt attention listening to the bible story  my son said grabantak one evening to chingatok if we are henceforth to live in peace why not unite and become one nation  why not echoed chingatok  when amalatok and makitok heard the question propounded they also said why not and as nobody objected the thing was settled offhand then and there  but said the prime minister of flatland starting a difficulty who is to be greatest chief  amalatok on whose mind the spirit of christianity had been gradually making an impression said promptly let grabantak be chief  he is wise in council and brave in war  grabantak had instantly jumped to the conclusion that he ought to be greatest chief and was about to say so when amalatoks humility struck him dumb  recovering himself he replied  but there is to be no mere war and i have been a warrior  no let amalatok be great chief  he is old and wisdom lies with age  i am not so sure of that muttered captain vane to himself in english then to the giant in eskimo what says chingatok  may i speak my father said the giant dutifully to amalatok  you may speak my son  then continued chingatok i would advise that there should be three chiefs who shall be equalmy father grabantak and makitok  let these consult about our affairs  let the people appoint twelve men to hold council with them and what the most of them agree to shall be done  after some further talk this compromise was agreed to  but the laws of poloeland and those of flatland are different said amalatok starting another objection  we must have the same laws  my brother chief is wise said grabantak  let us have new laws and let that wise young kablunet alf make them  both my brother chiefs are wise said makitok  let it be done and let him take the laws out of the little thing that speaks to him thus they referred to the bible having no word in their language by which to name it  great was the surprise of alf at the honour and labour thus thrust upon him but he did not shrink from it  on the contrary he set to work at once with notebook and pencil and set down the two great commandments thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself as the first law in the new code  he set down as the second the golden rule whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you do ye even so to them  proceeding from these as a basis he worked his way gradually down the code till he had embraced nearly all the possibilities of eskimo lifea work which kept him busy all the winter and was not quite finished when time and tide obliged him and his companions to quit the land  now not long after this eventful council benjy vane burst rather irreverently into his fathers hut with excited looks holding what looked like an old book in his hand  what have you got there lad  ive got it at last father  you know ive been trying to wheedle old makitok into letting me open his mysterious bundle  well i prevailed on him to let me do it this afternoon  after unrolling bundle after bundle i came at last to the centre and found that it contained nothing whatever but this book wrapped up in an old cotton pockethandkerchief  the book is very old father  see 1611 on the first page  i did not take time to glance at more than that but brought it straight away to you  hand it over benjy said the captain eagerly  this accounts for the mysterious buk that weve heard so much about  he received the little book with a look of tender curiosity and opened it carefully while leo alf and his son looked on over his shoulder  1611 sure enough he said though not very legible  the characters are queer too  try alf what you can make of it  alf took the book  as he did so old makitok entered somewhat anxious as to what they were doing with his treasure  being quieted by the captain with a draught of cold tea and made to sit down the examination of the book proceeded  it is much worn and in places is almost illegible as might be expected said alf  let me see  coast of labrador something illegible here 1611  this day the mutineers took possess   cant make out what follows and put captain hudson with his son myself the carpenter and five sick men into the dinghy casting us blank with some blank and one cask of water  i begin this diary today it may never be seen by man but if it does fall into the hands of any one who can read it he will do a service to  by conveying  englandjohn mackintosh seaman  can it be possible said alf looking up from the relic with an expression of deep solemnity that we have found a record of that great arctic explorer the unfortunate henry hudson  it seems like it alf read on said leo eagerly  we will not further trouble the reader with alfs laboured deciphering of this curious and ancient notebook which was not only stained and worn but in many places rudely torn as if its owner had seen much hard service  we will merely run over a few of the chief points which it cleared up  unfortunately it threw no additional light on the fate of poor hudson  many of the first pages of the book which no doubt treated of that had been destroyed and the legible portion began in the middle of a record of travelling with a sledgeparty of eskimos to the north of parallel 85 degrees 20 minutesa higher northern latitude it will be observed than had been reached by any subsequent explorer except captain vane  no mention being made of english comrades the presumption remained that they had all been killed or had diedat all events that mackintosh had been separated from them and was the only survivor of the party travelling with the eskimos  further on the journal which was meagre in detail and kept in the dry form of a logbook spoke of having reached a far northern settlement reference was also made to a wife and family leading to the conclusion that the seaman had permanently cast in his lot with the savages and given up all hope of returning to his native land  one sentence near the end caused a considerable sensation and opened their eyes to a fact which they might have guessed if they had not been too much taken up with the spelling out of the faded pencilling to think of it at first  alf read it with difficulty  it ran thus  another boy born today  his name is igluk  it is only the eldest boy of a family in this tribe who bears his fathers surname  my eldest alone goes by the name of mackintosh  his eldest will bear the same name and so on  but these eskimos make a sad mess of it  i doubt if my scotch kinsmen would recognise us under the name of makitok which is the nearest  makitok shouted benjy gazing openeyed at the whitebearded wizard who returned the gaze with some astonishment  why old boy cried the boy jumping up and seizing the wizards hand youre a scotsman  so he is said the captain with a look of profound interest  and i say continued benjy in a tone so solemn that the eyes of all the party were turned on him we did find him sitting on the north pole  and what of that you excitable goose said the captain  goose father  am i a goose for recognising the fulfilment of an ancient prophecy  has it not been a familiar saying ever since i was born that when the north pole was discovered a scotsman would be found sitting on the top of it  unfortunately ben returned alf with a laugh the same prophecy exists in other lands  among the germans i believe it is held that a bohemian and a jew will be found on the top of it  that only confirms the correctness of prophecy in general retorted benjy for this man unites all these in his own person  does not this notebook prove him to be a scot  have we not just found him which proves him to be one of a lost tribein other words a jew and surely youll admit that in appearance at least he is bohemian enough for the settlement of any disputed question  yes hes a scotch bohemian jew or im a dutchman  this discovery seemed almost too much for benjy  he could not think or talk of anything else the remainder of that day  among other things he undertook to explain to makitok something of his origin and antecedents  ancient one he said earnestly through the medium of anders when he had led the old man aside privately you come of a grand nation  they are called scots and are said to be remarkably longheaded and wonderfully cautious  great warriors but greater at the arts of peace and the fellow you call your first father was a mackintosh probably chief of all the mackintoshes who sailed nearly 270 years ago to search for this very north pole that we have got hold of at last but your first father was not the leader old boy  he was only a seaman  the leader was henry hudsona man who ranks among the foremost of arctic explorers  he wont be able to understand what that means anders but no mattertranslate it the best way you can  this henry hudson was one of the most thorough and extensive searchers of these regions that ever sailed the northern seas  he made many important discoveries and set out on his last voyage intending to sail right over the north pole to china which i daresay he would have done had not his rascally crew mutinied and cast him and his little son with seven other men adrift in a little boatall of whom perished no doubt except your first father makitok my ancient tulip  he wound up this summary by grasping and shaking the wizards hand and then flung off to expend his feelings on other members of the community    chapter twenty nine  a runaway journey and a tremendous experiment  as winter advanced captain vane continued to keep up the interest of the eskimos and to increase their respect for the kablunets by gradually unfolding the various sources of power which were at his command  he did this judiciously just giving them a taste of the marvellous now and then to whet their appetites  he was particularly careful however not to practise on their credulity or to pass himself off as a conjuror he distinctly stated that all his powers were derived from godtheir father and hisand that he only excelled them in some matters because of having had better opportunities of acquiring knowledge  among other things he effected an adaptation of his kites which produced results so surprising that we feel bound to describe them particularly  during the winter he found as he had expected that the average temperature at the pole was not nearly so cold as that experienced in lower latitudes  as far as mere feeling went indeed the cold seemed severe enough nevertheless it was not sufficiently intense to freeze the great ocean which remained an open basin all the year rounda result which was doubtless owing to the upflow of the warm undercurrents from the equator referred to in a previous chapter  this however did not apply to the waters lying directly around the poloe and flatland groups  in these archipelagos the waters being shallow the frost was quite intense enough to cool them to the bottom hence the sea immediately round the islands was covered with a thick coat of solid ice which resembled in all respects the ordinary arctic seaice being hummocky in some places comparatively smooth in others with a strong iceberg here and there caught and imprisoned amongst it  as this ice surrounded all the polar land and stretched out to sea far beyond the reach of vision it followed that there was little or no difference between the winter experience of our discoverers and that of all other arctic voyagers  this realm of what we may style islandice stretched away all round in the direction of the arctic circle getting thinner and thinner towards its outer margin until at last it became sludgy and finally melted away into the open sea  this open sea in its turn stretched southward all round to the known arctic regions  thus the arctic basin was found to be a zone of open water surrounded by ice on the south and with a patch of ice and land in its centre  now it was a strong desire on the part of captain vane to visit the southern edge of this central icepatch on which he dwelt that induced him to try the kite adaptation before referred to  benjy my boy said he one fine winter day when the galaxy of stars the full moon and an unusually brilliant aurora diffused a strong light over the undulations of cup valley i have a notion of taking a trip to the suthard soon  which suthard dyou think of going to father asked the boy  in case any reader should hastily exclaim what a ridiculous question there can be only one southward we beg leave to point out that at the north pole every direction lies to the southward and that as there is necessarily no east or west at all there is therefore no possibility of stating by compass to what part of the south one intends to go  of course it was open to the captain to have said he intended to descend south on one of the degrees of longitude or between any two of them and then immediately on quitting the pole the old familiar east and west would as it were return to him  but he found it more convenient on the whole having got beyond all latitude to indicate his intended route by wellknown objects of the land  im going to steer for the starboard side of poloeland he said pay a short visit to grabantak and amalatok in passing and then carry on south to the open water  itll be a longish trip father  not so long as you expect my boy for i mean to go by express  benjys eyes twinkled for he knew that some new device was working in his fathers brain which brain never failed to bring its plans to maturity  what is it to be father  you go and fetch two of the kites benjy and youll soon find out overhaul them well and see that everything is taut and shipshape  let butterface help you and send alf and chingatok to me  i suppose leo is off after muskoxen as usual  yes he pretends that the camp wants a supply of fresh meat  hed pretend that as an excuse for hunting even if we were all dying of surfeit  soon afterwards the captain was seen followed by his usual companions and a company of eskimos dragging two sledges to the upper ridge of cup valley  one sledge was lightly the other heavily laden  youve brought plenty of supplies i hope alf asked the leader  yes enough for three weeks  will that do  quite enough lad but it may not be wanted as im going south in a direction weve not yet tried where i expect to find the open water close to us  its well however to have enough of meat at all times  no fear of its being too much father said benjy  when butterface goes with us a three weeks allowance usually disappears in a fortnight  nebber mind massa said the negro seriously  youve plenty for tree weeks dis time cause is off my feed  got polar dimspepsy or suffin o dat sort i tink  youve brought the electrical machine of course and the dynamite alf asked the captain  of course  i never prepare for a trip without these  theres no saying you see when we may require themeither to blow up obstructions or astonish the natives  the natives are past astonishing now remarked benjy nothing short of a ten thousand jar battery would astonish chingatok and im quite sure that you couldnt rouse a sentiment of surprise in oolichuk unless you made him swallow a dynamite cartridge and blew him inside out but i say daddy how long are you going to keep us in the dark about your plans  dont you see that we are in agonies of suspense  only till we gain the ridge benjy  it will be downhill after that and the snowcrust comparatively smooth as well as hard  arrived at the ridge one of the kites was unfolded and sent up  the breeze was steady and sufficiently strong  it took twenty eskimos to hold it when allowed full play and even these it jerked about in a manner that highly diverted them  these eskimos were very fond of kiteflying for its own sake without reference to utility  i knew you were going to try it on the sledge exclaimed benjy with sparkling eyes  why did you ask me about it then returned the captain  do let me make the first trial father  captain vane was fastening the dragline to the fore part of the light sledge and refused at first to listen to the boys entreaties fearing that some accident might befall him  you know how accustomed i am to manage the kites father  theres not the least fear and ill be superhumanly cautious  there was no resisting benjys tone and eyes  he was allowed to take his place on the sledge as manager  butterface sat behind to steer steering was to be managed by means of a stout pole pressed varyingly on the snow on either side  dont go more than a mile or so my boy said the captain in a serious tone  its only a trial you know  if it succeeds well divide the loading of the sledges and make a fair start in company  benjy promised to manipulate the checkstring with care  the struggling natives were ordered to let the kite straighten the slack of the line gradually  are you ready ben  all right father  got your hand on the checkstring  mind it will pull hard  nowlet go  the natives obeyed  benjy at the same instant hauled sharply on the checkstring intending to tilt the kite well forward and start in a slow stately manner but there was a hitch of some sort somewhere for the string would not act  the kite acted however with its full force up went the fore part of the sledge as it flew off like an arrow from a bow causing butterface to throw a back somersault and leaving him behind  benjy held on to the head of the sledge and made violent efforts to free the checkstring  fortunately the surface of the snow was smooth  after him lads roared the captain setting a brave example and for some time heading the natives in the chase but a few moments sufficed to prove the hopelessness of the race  tug as benjy would at the regulator it refused to act  fortunately being made of silk it did not break  by this time the kite had attained its maximum speed equal as the captain said to a twentyknot breeze  at first the surface of the snow was so smooth and hard that benjy being busy with the obdurate regulator did not appreciate the speed  when he gave up his attempts with a sigh of despair he had leisure to look around him  the sledge was gliding on with railway speed  one or two solitary hummocks that looked like white sentinels on the level plain went past him with an awful rush and several undulations caused by snowdrift were crossed in a light leap which he barely felt  benjy was fully aware of his danger  to meet with a hummock no bigger than a wheelbarrow would in the circumstances have entailed destruction he therefore seized a pole which formed part of the sledgegear and tried steering  it could be done but with great difficulty as he had to sit in the front of the sledge to keep it down  recklessly jovial though he was the boy could not contemplate his probable fate without misgiving  nothing was visible in all the white illimitable plain save a hummock here and there with a distant berg on the horizon  he could not expect the level character of the ice to extend far  whither was he going  south he knew but in that direction his father had often told him lay the open sea  the moon seemed to smile on him the aurora appeared to dance with unwonted vigour as if in glee the very stars winked at him  what if a chasm or a big hummock should turn up thought benjy  the thought seemed to produce the dreaded object for next moment a large hummock appeared right ahead  far away though it was the awful pace brought it quickly near  the poor boy struggledhe absolutely agonisedwith the pole  his efforts were successful  the hummock went past like a meteor but it was a horribly close shave and benjy felt his very marrow shrink while he drew himself up into the smallest possible compass to let it go by  a bump soon after told that the ice was getting more rugged  then he saw a ridge before him  was it large or small  distance the uncertain light and imagination magnified it to a high wall high as the wall of china  in wild alarm our hero tugged at the regulator but tugged in vain  the wall of china was upon himunder him  there was a crash the sledge was in the air  moments appeared minutes  had the vehicle been suddenly furnished with wings  no  another crash which nearly shut up his spine like a telescope told him that there were no wings his teeth came together with a snap  happily his tongue was not between them  happily too the sledge did not overturn but continued its furious flight  oh you villain exclaimed benjy shaking his fist at the airy monster which was thus dragging him to destruction  if benjy had been asked to state the truth just then he would have found it hard to say whether consternation or delight were uppermost it was such a glorious rush  but then how was it to end  well he did not dare to think of that  indeed he had not time to think for troubles came crowding on him  a violent swish and a sudden deluge told him that what he had taken for glassy ice was open water  it was only a shallow pool however  next moment he was across it and bumping violently over a surface of broken ice  the water suggested the fear that he must be nearing the open sea and he became supernaturally grave  fortunately the last crash had been passed without dislocating the parts of either sledge or rider  a long stretch of smooth ice followed over which he glided with everincreasing speed  thus he continued to rush over the frozen sea during a considerable part of that night  poor benjy he became halfmad with excitement at last  the exaltation of his little spirit at the risky neckornothing dash coupled with horror at the certainty of a terrible climax was almost too much for him  he gave vent to his feelings in a wild cheer or yell and just then beheld an iceberg of unusual size looming up on the horizon before him  knowing by experience that he would soon be up to it he used his pole with all his might hoping to steer clear of it  as he drew nearer he saw a dark line on either side of the berg  a feeling of deadly alarm filled him  it was the open sea and he had to choose between being plunged into it or dashed against the berg  it occurred to him then for the first time that a third resource was openhe might cut the rope and let the kite go free  amazed at his stupidity in not thinking of this before he took out his claspknife but before applying it made a last effort to move the regulator  strange to say the silken cord yielded to the first pull as if nothing had been wrong with it at all  the head of the runaway kite was thrown forward and it came wavering down in eccentric gyrations while the sledge gradually lost way and came to a standstill not fifty yards from the berg  up to this point what may be termed the northern islandice continued unbroken but beyond the berg it was broken up into floes and not six hundred yards out it tailed away to the southward in what whalers term streamice  the berg itself was obviously aground  the first object that met benjys eyes after coming to a halt was an enormous polar bear  this was no strange sight to the boy by that time but it was awkward in the circumstances for he had neither gun nor spear  even if he had possessed the latter he was too young and light to cope successfully with the shaggy white king of arctic beasts  from the attitude of the animal it appeared to be watching something in truth it was so intently engaged with a sleeping seal that it had not observed the approach of the sledge  profiting by this benjy quietly moved away round a colossal buttress of the berg and took refuge in an icecave  but such refuge he knew could avail him nothing if the bear should scent him out and search for him  looking hastily round and up into the dark blue cavern he espied a projecting ledge of ice about thirteen feet above the level of the floor  on this he resolved to perch himself  his first care was to examine the contents of the sledge  we have said it had been lightly laden at starting which was the reason of the tremendous pace at which it travelled  although there was neither spear nor gun the anxious boy was somewhat comforted to find an axe strapped in its accustomed place also a blanket sleepingbag and muskox skin besides a mass of frozen blubber but there was nothing else of an eatable nature  there was however a box containing the captains sextant the electrical machine and a packet of dynamite cartridges  regarding these latter objects with a sigh of disappointment benjy seized the axe and hastened towards the ledge of ice muttering to himself in a confidential tone  you see old boy if that bear takes a fancy to call on you it will be as well to be able to say not at home for he could make short work of you much though you think of yourself  yes this ledge is high enough to bid you defiance mister bear and its long and broad enough to hold me and my belongings  the knobs by which to climb to it too are easytoo easybut ill soon rectify that  now then look alive benjy boy for if that bear dont catch that seal hell be sure to look you up  ceasing to speak he actively conveyed the contents of the sledge to his shelf of refuge  then he cut away the knobs by which he climbed to it until there was barely sufficient for his own tiny toes to rest on that done he went to the mouth of the cavern to look about him  what he saw there may be guessed from the fact that he returned next moment running at full speed stumbling over ice lumps bumping his shins and knees dropping his axe and lacerating his knuckles  he had met the bear  need we add that he gained his perch with the agility of a treesquirrel  the bear surprised no doubt but obviously sulky from the loss of the seal entered the cave sedately with an inquiring look  it saw benjy at once and made prodigious efforts to get at him  as the monster rose on its hind legs and reached its paws towards his shelf the poor boys spirit seemed to melt indeed his whole interior felt as if reduced to a warm fluid while a prickly heat broke out at his extremities perspiration beaded his brow and his heart appeared to have settled permanently in his throat  these distressing symptoms did not however last long for he quickly perceived that the bears utmost stretch did not reach nearer than three or four feet of him  some of the alarm returned however when the creature attempted to climb up by his own ladder  seven or eight times it made the attempt while the boy watched in breathless anxiety but each time it slipped when halfway up and fell with a soft heavy thud on the ice below which caused it to gasp and cough  then it sat down on its haunches and gazed at its little foe malignantly  bah you brute exclaimed benjy whose courage was returning im not a bit afraid of you  he leant against the wall of his refuge notwithstanding this boast and licked the ice to moisten his parched lips  after a rest the bear made another trial and twice it succeeded in planting the claws of one huge paw on the edge of the shelf but benjy placed his heel against the claws thrust them off and sent the bear down each time howling with disappointment  sailing softly among the constellations in the auroralighted sky the moon sent a bright ray into the cavern which gleamed on the monsters wicked eyes and glistening teeth but benjy had begun to feel comparatively safe by that time and was becoming himself again  dont you wish you may get me he asked in a desperately facetious spirit  the bear made no reply but turned to examine the contents of the icecave  first he went to the hatchet and smelt it  in doing so he cut his nose  with a growl he gave the weapon an angry pat and in so doing cut his toes  we fear that benjy rejoiced at the sight of blood for he chuckled and made the sarcastic remark that comes of losing your temper old fellow  that bear either understood english or the very sound of the human voice caused it irritation for it turned and rushed at the iceledge with such fury that benjys heart again leaped into his throat  he had however recovered sufficiently to enable him to act with promptitude and discretion  sitting down with his right foot ready and his hands resting firmly on the ice behind him he prepared to receive the charge in the only available manner  so fierce was the onset that the monster ran up the icecliff like a cat and succeeded in fixing the terrible claws of both feet on the edge of the shelf but the boy delivered his right heel with such force that the left paw slipped off  the left heel followed like lightning and the right paw also slipped letting the bear again fall heavily on the ice below  this was more than even a bear could bear  he rushed savagely about the cavern growling hideously dashing the sledge about as if it had been a mere toy and doing all the mischief he could yet always avoiding the axe with particular carethus showing that polar bears not less than men are quite awake to personal danger even when supposed to be blind with rage  at last he lay down to recover himself and lick his bloody nose and paw  while benjy sat contemplating this creature and wondering what was to be the end of it all a bright idea occurred to him  he rose quickly took the electrical machine out of its box and happily found it to be in good working orderthanks to alf who had special charge of the scientific instruments and prided himself on the care with which he attended to them  the bear watched him narrowly with its wicked little eyes though it did not see fit to cease its pawlicking  having arranged the machine benjy took the two handles in his left hand pressed his knee on the board of the instrument to hold it steady and with his right hand caused it to revolve  then he held down the handles as if inviting the bear to come and take them  the challenge was accepted at once  bruin cantered up rose on his hind legs and stretched his neck to its utmost but could not reach the handles though the boy stretched downward as far as possible to accommodate him  the dirtywhite monster whined and snickered with intense feeling at thus finding itself so near and yet so far from the attainment of its object  sympathising with its desires benjy changed his posture and managed just to touch the nose of his enemy  the bear shrank back with a sort of gasp appalledat least shockedby the result  after a little not feeling much the worse for it the brute returned as if to invite another electric shockperhaps with some sinister design in view  but another and a brighter idea had entered benjys brain  instead of giving the bear a shock he tore off a small bit of sealblubber from the mass at his side which he dropped into its mouth  it swallowed that morsel with satisfaction and waited for more  benjy gave it more still it wanted more  you shall have it my boy said benjy whose eyes assumed that peculiar glare of glee which always presaged some desperate intention  he opened another small box and found what he wanted  it was a small object scarcely a couple of inches in length  he fastened the wires of the electric machine quickly to it and then imbedded it in a small piece of blubber which he lowered as before to the bear  youll probably break the wires or smash the machine but ill risk that muttered benjy through his set teeth  i only hope you wont chew it because dynamite maynt be palatable  theredown with it  the bear happily bolted the morsel  the wires seemed to perplex him a little but before he had time to examine the mystery the boy gave the instrument a furious turn  instantly there was a stupendous crash like a very thunderbolt  the bear burst like an overcharged cannon  benjy and the berg collided and at that moment everything seemed to the former to vanish away in smoke leaving not even a wrack behind    chapter thirty  leo in danger next  a novel mode of rescue  when the catastrophe described in the last chapter occurred captain vane and his friends following hard on the heels of the runaway chanced to be within two miles of the berg in the bosom of which benjy had found refuge  there he is shouted the captain joyfully as the flash of the explosion reached his eyes and the roar of the report his ears blessed evidence  hes up to mischief of some sort still and thats proof positive that hes alive  but he may have perished in this piece of mischief said alf anxiously glancing up at the kite which was dragging the heavilyladen sledge rather slowly over the rough ice  i hope not alf  shake the regulator butterface and see that its clear  all right massa  steams on de berry strongest whats possible  heave some o the cargo overboard alf  we must make haste  not the meat lad not the meat everything else before that  so  mind your helm chingatok shell steer wildish when lightened  captain vane was right  when alf had tumbled some of the heavier portions of lading off the sledge it burst away like a wildhorse let go free rendering it difficult at first for chingatok to steady it  in a few minutes however he had it again under control and they soon reached the berg  the dynamite must have gone off by accident said the captain to alf as they stumbled over masses of ice which the explosion had brought down from the roof of the cavern  its lucky it didnt happen in summer else the berg might have been blown to atoms  hallo whats this  bits of a polar bear i do believeandwhat not benjy  it was indeed benjy flat on his back like a spreadeagle and covered with blood and brains but his appearance was the worst of his case though it took a considerable time to convince his horrified friends of that fact  i tell you im all right father said the poor boy on recovering from the state of insensibility into which his fall had thrown him  but youre covered from head to foot with blood exclaimed the anxious father examining him all over though i cant find a cut of any sort about youonly one or two bruises  youll find a bump on the top of my head father the size of a cocoanut  thats what knocked the senses out o me but the blood and brains belong to the bear  i lay no claim to them  where is the bear asked alf looking round  where is he echoed benjy bursting into a wild laugh  oh  massa benjy dont laugh said butterface solemnly you hab no notion wot a awful look you got when you laugh wid sitch a bloody face  this made benjy laugh more than ever  his mirth became catching and the negros solemn visage relaxed into an irrepressible grin  oh you japanjawed porpoise cried benjy you should have seen that bear go offwith such a crack too  i only wish id been able to hold up for two seconds longer to see it properly but my shelf went down and i had to go along with it  blown to bits  nohe was blown to a thousand atoms  count em if you can  again benjy burst into uproarious laughter  there was indeed some ground for the boys way of putting the case  the colossal creature had been so terribly shattered by the dynamite cartridge that there was scarcely a piece of him larger than a mans hand left to tell the tale  well well said the captain assisting his son to rise im thankful its no worse  worse father why it couldnt be worse unless indeed his spirit were brought alive again and allowed to contemplate the humbling condition of his body  i dont refer to the bear benjy but to yourself lad  you might have been killed you know and im very thankful you were notthough you halfdeserve to be  but come we must encamp here for the night and return home tomorrow for the wind has been shifting a little and will be favourable i think in the morning  the wind was indeed favourable next morning we may say almost too favourable for it blew a stiff breeze from the south which steadily increased to a gale during the day  afterwards the sky became overcast and the darkness intense rendering it necessary to attend to the kites regulator with the utmost care and advance with the greatest caution  now while the captain and his friends were struggling back to their polar home leo vandervell happened to be caught by the same gale when out hunting  being of a bold sanguine and somewhat reckless disposition this nimrod of the party paid little attention to the weather until it became difficult to walk and next to impossible to see then having shot nothing that day he turned towards the pole with a feeling of disappointment  but when the gale increased so that he could hardly face it and the sky became obliterated by falling and drifting snow disappointment gave place to anxiety and he soon realised the fact that he had lost his direction  to advance in such circumstances was out of the question he therefore set about building a miniature hut of snow  being by that time expert at such masonry he soon erected a domeshaped shelter in which he sat down on his empty gamebag after closing the entrance with a block of hard snow  the position of our hunter was not enviable  the hut was barely high enough to let him sit up and long enough to let him lie downnot to stretch out  the small allowance of pemmican with which he had set out had long ago been consumed  it was so dark that he could not see his hand when close before his eyes  he was somewhat fatigued and rather cold and had no water to drink  it was depressing to think of going to bed in such circumstances with the yelling of an arctic storm for a lullaby  however leo had a buoyant spirit and resolved to make the best of it  first of all he groped in his gamebag for a small stove lamp which he set up before him and arranged blubber and a wick in it using the sense of touch in default of sight  then he struck a light but not with matches  the englishmens small stock of congreves had long since been exhausted and they were obliged to procure fire by the eskimo method namely a little piece of wood worked like a drill with a thong of leather against another piece of wood until the friction produced fire  when a light had been thus laboriously obtained he applied it to the wick of his lamp and wished fervently for something to cook  it is proverbial that wishing does not usually achieve much  after a deep sigh therefore leo turned his wallet inside out  besides a few crumbs it contained a small lump of narwhal blubber and a little packet  the former in its frozen state somewhat resembled hard butter  the latter contained a little coffeenot the genuine article however  that like the matches had long ago been used up and our discoverers were reduced to roasted biscuitcrumbs  the substitute was not bad  inside of the coffeepacket was a smaller packet of brown sugar but it had burst and allowed its contents to mingle with the coffee  rejoiced to find even a little food where he had thought there was none leo filled his pannikin with snow melted it emptied into it the compound of coffee and sugar put it on the lamp to boil and sat down to watch while he slowly consumed the narwhal butter listening the while to the simmering of the pannikin and the roaring of the gale  after his meagre meal he wrapped himself in his blanket and went to sleep  this was all very well as long as it lasted but he cooled during the night and on awaking in the morning found that keen frost penetrated every fibre of his garments and every pore of his skin  the storm however was over the moon and stars were shining in a clear sky and the aurora was dancing merrily  rising at once he bundled up his traps threw the line of his small handsledge over his shoulder and stepped out for home  but cold and want of food had been telling on him  he soon experienced an unwonted sense of fatigue then a drowsy sensation came over him  leo was well aware of the danger of giving way to drowsiness in such circumstances yet strange to say he was not in the least afraid of being overcome  he would sit down to rest just for two minutes and then push on  he smiled as he sat down in the crevice of a hummock to think of the frequent and needless cautions which his uncle had given him against this very thing  the smile was still on his lips when his head drooped on a piece of ice and he sank into a deep slumber  ah leonard vandervell ill would it have been for thee if thou hadst been left to thyself that day but sharp eyes and anxious hearts were out on the icy waste in search of thee  on arriving at his winter quarters and learning that leo had not yet returned captain vane at once organised an elaborate searchexpedition the man who found him at last was butterface  oh massa leo exclaimed that sable creature on beholding the youth seated white and cold on the hummock but he said no more being fully alive to the danger of the situation  rushing at leo he seized and shook him violently as if he had been his bitterest foe  there was no response from the sleeping man  the negro therefore began to chafe shake and kick him even to slap his face and yell into his ears in a way that an ignorant observer would have styled brutal  at last there was a symptom of returning vitality in the poor youths frame and the negro redoubled his efforts  ho hallo  massa leo wake up  yous dyin you is  whywhatsthematterbutterf muttered leo and dropped his head again  hi hello hooo yelled butterface renewing the rough treatment and finally hitting the youth a sounding slap on the ear  ha  i be tink dat vakes you up  it certainly did wake him up  a burst of indignation within seemed to do more for him than the outward buffetings  he shut his fist and hit butterface a weak but well intended righthander on the nose  the negro replied with a sounding slap on the other ear which induced leo to grasp him in his arms and try to throw him  butterface returned the grasp with interest and soon quite an interesting wrestling match began the only witness of which sat on a neighbouring hummock in the form of a melancholy arctic fox  hi hold on massa leo  dont kill me altogidder shouted butterface as he fell beneath his adversary  yous amost right now  almost right what do you mean  i mean dat yous bin amost froze to deaf but is melted you down to life agin  the truth at last began to dawn on the young hunter  after a brief explanation he and the negro walked home together in perfect harmony    chapter thirty one  the last  in course of time the long and dreary winter passed away and signs of the coming spring began to manifest themselves to the dwellers in the polar lands  chief and most musical among these signs were the almost forgotten sounds of dropping water and tinkling rills  one day in april the thermometer suddenly rose to eighteen above the freezingpoint of fahrenheit  captain vane came from the observatory his face blazing with excitement and oily with heat to announce the fact  that accounts for it feeling so like summer said benjy  summer boy its like india returned the captain puffing and fanning himself with his cap  well begin this very day to make arrangements for returning home  it was on the evening of that day that they heard the first droppings of the melting snow  long before that however the sun had come back to gladden the polar regions and break up the reign of ancient night  his departure in autumn had been so gradual that it was difficult to say when night began to overcome the day  so in like manner his return was gradual  it was not until captain vane observed stars of the sixth magnitude shining out at noon in november that he had admitted the total absence of day and when spring returned it was not until he could read the smallest print at midnight in june that he admitted there was no night there  but neither the continual day of summer nor the perpetual night of winter made so deep an impression on our explorers as the gushing advent of spring  that season did not come gradually back like the light but rushed upon them suddenly with a warm embrace like an enthusiastic friend after a long absence  it plunged as it were upon the region and overwhelmed it  gushing waters thrilled the ears with the sweetness of an old familiar song  exhalations from the moistened earth and soon after the scent of awakening vegetation filled the nostrils with delicious fragrance  in may the willowstems were green and fresh with flowing sap  flowers began to bud modestly as if half afraid of having come too soon  but there was no cause to fear that the glorious sun was strong in his might and like his maker warmed the northern world into exuberant life  mosses poppies saxifrages cochlearia and other hardy plants began to sprout and migratory birds innumerablescreaming terns cackling duck piping plover auks in dense clouds with loudly whirring wings trumpeting geese eiderducks burgomasters etcetera began to return with all the noisy bustle and joyous excitement of a family on its annual visit to muchloved summer quarters  but here we must note a difference between the experience of our explorers and that of all others  these myriads of happy creaturesand many others that we have not space to namedid not pass from the south onward to a still remoter north but came up from all round the horizonup all the meridians of longitude as on so many railway lines converging at the pole and settling down for a prolonged residence in garrulous felicity among the swamps and hills and vales of flatland  truly it was a most enjoyable season and experience but there is no joy without its alley here belownot even at the north pole  the alloy came in the form of a low fever which smote down the stalwart leo reduced his great strength seriously and confined him for many weeks to a couch in their little stone hut and of course the power of sympathy robbed his companions of much of that exuberant joy which they shared with the lower animals at the advent of beautiful spring  during the period of his illness leos chief nurse comforter and philosophical companion was the giant of the north  and one of the subjects which occupied their minds most frequently was the word of god in the days of weakness and suffering leo took to that great source of comfort with thirsting avidity and intense was his gratification at the eager desire expressed by the giant to hear and understand what it contained  of course alf and benjy and the captain and butterface as well as grabantak makitok and amalatok with others of the eskimos were frequently by his side but the giant never left him for more than a brief period night or day  ah  chingatok said leo one day when the returning spring had begun to revive his strength i never felt such a love for gods book when i was well and strong as i feel for it now that i am ill and i little thought that i should find out so much of its value while talking about it to an eskimo  i shall be sorry to leave you chingatokvery sorry  the young kablunet is not yet going to die said the giant in a soft voice  i did not mean that replied leo with the ghost of his former hearty laugh i mean that i shall be obliged to leave flatland and to return to my own home as soon as the season permits  captain vane has been talking to me about it  he is anxious now to depart yet sorry to leave his kind and hospitable friends  i too am sorry returned chingatok sadly  no more shall i hear from your lips the sweet words of my great fatherthe story of jesus you will take your book away with you  that is true my friend and it would be useless to leave my bible with you as you could not read it but the truth will remain with you chingatok  yes replied the giant with a significant smile you cannot take that away  it is hereand here  he touched his forehead and breast as he spoke  then he continued  these strange things that alf has been trying to teach me during the long nights i have learnedi understand  he referred here to a syllabic alphabet which alf had invented and which he had amused himself by teaching to some of the natives so that they might write down and read those few words and messages in their own tongue which formerly they had been wont to convey to each other by means of signs and rude drawingsafter the manner of most savages  well what about that asked leo as his companion paused  could not my friend replied chingatok change some of the words of his book into the language of the eskimo and mark them down  leo at once jumped at the idea  afterwards he spoke to alf about it and the two set to work to translate some of the most important passages of scripture and write them down in the syllable alphabet  for this purpose they converted a sealskin into pretty fair parchment and wrote with the ink which captain vane had brought with him and carefully husbanded  the occupation proved a beneficial stimulus to the invalid who soon recovered much of his wonted health and even began again to wander about with his old companion the repeating rifle  the last event of interest which occurred at the north pole before the departure of our explorers was the marriage of oolichuk with oblooria the ceremony was very simple  it consisted in the bridegroom dressing in his best and going to the tent of his fatherinlaw with a gift which he laid at his feet  he then paid some endearing eskimo attentions to his motherinlaw one of which was to present her with a raw duck cleaned and dismembered for immediate consumption  he even assisted that pleased lady immediately to consume the duck and wound up by taking timid little obloorias hand and leading her away to a hut of his own which he had specially built and decorated for the occasion  as amalatok had arrived that very day on a visit from poloeland with his prime minister and several chiefs and grabantak was residing on the spot with a number of chiefs from the surrounding islands who had come to behold the famous kablunets there was a sort of impromptu gathering of the northern clans which lent appropriate dignity to the wedding  after the preliminary feast of the occasion was over captain vane was requested to exhibit some of his wonderful powers for the benefit of a strange chief who had recently arrived from a distant island  of course our goodnatured captain complied  get out the boats and kites benjy boy he said we must go through our performances to please em  i feel as if we were a regular company of playactors now  wont you give them a blowup first father  no benjy no  never put your best foot foremost  the proverb is a false oneas many proverbs are  we will dynamite them afterwards and electrify them last of all  go look sharp  so the captain first amazed the visitor with the kites and indiarubber boats then he horrified him by blowing a small iceberg of some thousands of tons into millions of atoms after which he convulsed him and made him jump  the latter experiment was the one to which the enlightened eskimos looked forward with the most excited and hopeful anticipations for it was that which gratified best their feeling of mischievous joviality  when the sedate and dignified chief was led all ignorant of his fate to the mysterious mat and stood thereon with grave demeanour the surrounding natives bent their knees drew up elbows expanded fingers and glared in expectancy  when the dignified chief experienced a tremor of the frame and looked surprised they grinned with satisfaction when he quivered convulsively they also quivered with suppressed emotion ah  benjy had learned by that time from experience to graduate very delicately his shocking scale and thus lead his victim step by step from bad to worse so as to squeeze the utmost amount of fun out of him before inducing that galvanic wardance which usually terminated the scene and threw his audience into fits of ecstatic laughter  these were the final rejoicings of the wedding dayif we except a dance in which every man did what seemed best in his own eyes and butterface played reels on the flute with admirable incapacity  but there came a day at last when the inhabitants of flatland were far indeed removed from the spirit of merriment  it was the height of the arctic summertime when the crashing of the great glaciers and the gleaming of the melting bergs told of rapid dissolution and the sleepless sun was circling its dayandnightly course in the everbright blue sky  the population of flatland was assembled on the beach of their native islethe men with downcast looks the women with sad and tearful eyes  two indiarubber boats were on the shore  two kites were flying overhead  the third boat and kite had been damaged beyond repair but the two left were sufficient  the englishmen were about to depart and the eskimos were inconsolable    my boat is on the shore  said benjy quoting byron as he shook old makitok by the hand    and my kite is in the sky   but before i go of more   i willbid youallgoodb  benjy broke down at this point  the feeble attempt to be facetious to the last utterly failed  turning abruptly on his heel he stepped into the faith and took his seat in the stern  it was the hope which had been destroyed  the faith and charity still remained to them  we must draw a curtain over that parting scene  never before in human experience had such a display of kindly feeling and profound regret been witnessed in similar circumstances  let go the tailropes said captain vane in a husky tone  let go de ropes echoed butterface in a broken voice  the ropes were let go  the kites soared and the boats rushed swiftly over the calm and glittering sea  on nearing one of the outer islands the voyagers knew that their tiny boats would soon be shut out from view and they rose to wave a last farewell  the salute was returned by the eskimoswith especial fervour by chingatok who stood high above his fellows on a promontory and waved the parchment roll of texts which he grasped in his huge right hand  long after the boats had disappeared the kites could still be seen among the gorgeous clouds  smaller and smaller they became in their flight to the mysterious south until at last they seemed undistinguishable specks on the horizon and then vanished altogether from view  one by one the eskimos retired to their homesslowly and sadly as if loath to part from the scene where the word farewell had been spoken at last all were gone save chingatok who still stood for hours on the promontory pressing the scroll to his heaving chest and gazing intently at the place on the horizon where his friends had disappeared  there was no night to bring his vigil or his meditations to a close but time wore him out at last  with a sigh amounting almost to a groan he turned and walked slowly away and did not stop until he stood upon the pole where he sat down on one of the captains stools and gazed mournfully at the remains of the dismantled observatory  there he was found by old makitok and for some time the giant and the wizard held converse together  i love these kablunets said chingatok  they are a strange race returned the wizard  they mingle much folly with their wisdom  they come here to find this nort pole this nothing and they find it  then they go away and leave it  what good has it done them  i know not replied chingatok humbly but i know not everything they have showed me much  one thing they have showed methat behind all things there is something else which i do not see  the kablunets are wonderful men  yet i pity them  as blackbeard has said some of them are too fond of killing themselves and some are too fond of killing each other  i wish they would come herethe whole nation of themand learn how to live in peace and be happy among the eskimos but they will not come  only a few of their best men venture to come and i should not wonder if their countrymen refused to believe the half of what they tell them when they get home  old makitok made no reply  he was puzzled and when puzzled he usually retired to his hut and went to bed  doing so on the present occasion he left his companion alone  poor poor kablunets murmured chingatok descending from his position and wandering away towards the outskirts of the village  you are very clever but you are somewhat foolish  i pity you but i also love you well  with his grand head down his arms crossed and the scroll of texts pressed to his broad bosom the giant of the north wandered away and finally disappeared among the flowering and rocky uplands of the interior  the end
