71244670	under the waves or diving in deep waters by rmballantyne    this was a very difficult book to obtain  there was a copy in the british library and another one in a library in dartmouth devon  for several years i tried at least weekly to find a copy via abebooks or ebay with no success  the copy belonging to the ballantyne family had disappeared not to put too fine a point on it  eventually a kind family in canada offered to scan the pages of their copy and send the images to me and this is the result  ballantyne did indeed try out some diving equipment so as to obtain a firsthand feel for diving it is related that something went wrong too much air was sent down and he surfaced rapidly upside down  a similar episode is related in the book  ballantynes style often gives rise to two or even three stories continuing simultaneously and here we have the adventures of one rooney machowl an irishman who decides to move from his ships carpenter trade to that of diving  in fact divers should always have another trade or they wouldnt be much use under the water  in addition there is the aspiration of edgar berrington to win the hand of a fair young lady there are the events happening to the young ladys father and then again the events happening to the young ladys companion  so it is all fairly convoluted  but youll certainly learn a lot about diving as the art stood in 1876  it is rather strange that ballantyne having written this book which ran to several printings did not much mention diving in any other of his books    under the waves or diving in deep waters by rmballantyne   preface  this tale makes no claim to the character of an exhaustive illustration of all that belongs to the art of diving  it merely deals with the most important points and some of the most interesting incidents connected therewith  in writing it i have sought carefully to exhibit the true and to ignore the false or improbable  i have to acknowledge myself indebted to the wellknown submarine engineers messrs siebe and gorman and messrs heinke and davis of london for much valuable information and to messrs denayrouze of paris for permitting me to go under water in one of their divingdresses  alsoamong many othersto captain john hewat formerly commander in the service of the rajah of sarawak for much interesting material respecting the pirates of the eastern seas  rmb  edinburgh 1876    chapter one  introduces our hero one of his advisers and some of his difficulties  so sir it seems that youve set your heart on learning something of everything  the man who said this was a tall and rugged professional diver  he to whom it was said was edgar berrington our hero a strapping youth of twentyone  wellyes i have set my heart upon something of that sort baldwin answered the youth  you see i hold that an engineer ought to be practically acquainted more or less with everything that bears even remotely on his profession therefore i have come to you for some instruction in the noble art of diving  youve come to the right shop mister edgar replied baldwin with a gratified look  i taught you to swim when you wasnt much bigger than a marlinespike an to make boats amost before you could handle a claspknife without cuttin your fingers an now that youve come to mans estate nothinll please me more than to make a diver of you but continued baldwin while a shade clouded his wrinkled and weatherbeaten visage i cant let you go down in the dress without leave  im under authority you know and durstnt overstep  dont let that trouble you interrupted his companion drawing a letter from his pocket i had anticipated that difficulty and wrote to your employers  here is their answer granting me permission to use their dresses  all right sir said baldwin returning the letter without looking at it ill take your word for it sir as its not much in my line to make out the meanin o pothooks and hangersnow then when will you have your first lesson  the sooner the better  just so said the diver looking about him with a thoughtful air  the apartment in which the man and the youth conversed was a species of outhouse or lumberroom which had been selected by baldwin for the stowing away of his diving apparatus and stores while these were not in use at the new pier which was in process of erection in the neighbouring harbour  its floor was littered with snaky coils of indiarubber tubing enormous boots with leaden soles upwards of an inch thick several diving helmets two of which were of brightly polished metal while the others were more or less battered dulled and dinted by hard service in the deep  the walls were adorned with large damp indiarubber dresses which suggested the idea of babygiants who had fallen into the water and been sent off to bed while their costumes were hung up to dry  in one corner lay several of the massive breast and back weights by which divers manage to sink themselves to the bottom of the sea in another stood the chest containing the airpump by means of which they are enabled to maintain themselves alive in that uncomfortable position while in a third and very dark corner an old wornout helmet catching a gleam from the solitary window by which the place was insufficiently lighted seemed to glare enviously out of its goggleeyes at its glittering successors  altogether what with the strange spectral objects and the dim light there was something weird in the aspect of the place that accorded well with the spirit of young berrington who being a hero and twentyone was naturally romantic  but let us pause here to assert that he was also practicaleminently so  practicality is compatible with romance as well as with rascality if we be right in holding that romance is gushing enthusiasm then are we entitled to hold that many methodical and practical men have been are and ever will be romantic  time sobers their enthusiasm a little no doubt but does by no means abate it unless the object on which it is expended be unworthy  recovering from his thoughtful air and repeating just so the diver added well i suppose wed better begin wi them ere odds an ends about us  not so returned the youth quickly i have often seen the apparatus and am quite familiar with it  let us rather go to the pier at once im anxious to go down  ah  mister edgarhasty as usual said baldwin shaking his head slowly  its two years since i last saw you and i had hoped to find that time had quieted you a bit but  well wellnow look here you think youve seen all my apparatus an know all about it  not exactly all returned the youth with a smile but you know ive often been in this store of yours and heard you enlarge on most if not all of the things in it  yesmost but not all thats where it lies sir  youve often seen siebe and gormans dresses but did you ever see this helmet made by heinke and davis  no i dont think i ever did  or that noo helmet wi the speakintoobe made by denayrouze and company an this dress made by the same  no ive seen none of these things and certainly this is the first time i have heard of a speakingtube for divers  well then you see mister edgar you have something to larn here after all among other things that denayrouzes is not the first speakintoobe said baldwin who thereupon proceeded with the most impressive manner and earnest voice to explain minutely to his no less earnest pupil the various clever contrivances by which the several makers sought to render their apparatus perfect  with all this however we will not trouble the reader but proceed at once to the port where diving operations were being carried on in connection with repairs to the breakwater  on their way thither the diver and his young companion continued their conversation  which of the various dresses do you think the best asked edgar  i dont know answered baldwin  ah then you are not bigotedly attached to that of your employerlike some of your fraternity with whom i have conversed  i am attached to siebe and gormans dress returned baldwin but i am no bigot  i believe in every thing and every creature having good and bad points  the dress i wear and the apparatus i work seem to me as near perfection as may be but ive lived too long in this world to suppose nobody can improve on em  ive heard men who go down in the dresses of other makers praise em just as much as i do mine an maybe with as good reason  i believe em all to be serviceable  when ive had more experience of em ill be able to say which i think the best ive got a noo hand on today continued baldwin an as hes goin down this afternoon for the first time so youve come at a good time hes a smart young man but im not very hopeful of him for hes an irishman  come old fellow said edgar with a laugh mind what you say about irishmen  ive got a dash of irish blood in me through my mother and wont hear her countrymen spoken of with disrespect  why should not an irishman make a good diver  because hes too excitable as a rule replied baldwin  you see mister edgar it takes a cool quiet collected sort of man to make a good diver and irishmen aint so cool as i should wish  englishmen are better but the best of all are scotchmen  give me a good heavy rawboned lump of a scotchman wholl believe nothin till hes convinced and accept nothin till its proved wholl argue with a stone wall if hes got nobody else to dispute with in that slow sedate humdrum way that drives everybody wild but himself whos got an amazin conscience but no nerves whatever to speak ofah thats the man to go under water an crawl about by the hour among mud and wreckage without gittin excited or makin a fuss about it if he should get his lifeline or airtoobe entangled among iron bolts smashedup timbers twisted wireropes or such like  scotchmen should feel complimented by your opinion of them said edgar  so they should for i mean it replied baldwin but i hope the irishman will turn up a trump this timemay i take the liberty of askin how youre gittin on wi the engineering mister edgar  oh famously  that is to say ive just finished my engagement with the firm of steel bolt hardy and company and am now on the point of going to sea  baldwin looked at his companion in surprise  going to sea he repeated why i thought you didnt like the sea  you thought right baldwin but men are sometimes under the necessity of submitting to what they dont like  i have no love for the sea except indeed as a beautiful object to be admired from the shore but you see i want to finish my education by going a voyage as one of the subordinate engineers in an oceansteamer so as to get some practical acquaintance with marine engineering  besides i have taken a fancy to see something of foreign parts before settling down vigorously to my profession and  well said baldwin as the youth made rather a long pause  can you keep a secret baldwin and give advice to a fellow who stands sorely in need of it  the youth said this so earnestly that the huge diver who was a sympathetic soul declared with much fervour that he could do both  you must know then began edgar with some hesitation the fact is youre such an old friend baldwin and took such care of me when i was a boy up to that sad time when i lost my father and you lost an employer  ay the best master i ever had interrupted the diver  thatthat i think i may trust you in short baldwin im over head and ears with a young girl andand  an your love aint requitedeh said baldwin interrogatively while his weatherbeaten face elongated  no not exactly that rejoined edgar with a laugh  aileen loves me almost i believe as well as i love her but her father is dead against us  he scorns me because i am not a man of wealth  what is he demanded baldwin  a rich china merchant  hes more than that said baldwin  indeed said edgar with a surprised look what more is he  hes a goose returned the diver stoutly  dont be too hard on him baldwin  remember i hope some day to call him fatherinlaw  but why do you hold so low an opinion of him  why because he forgets that riches may and often do take to themselves wings and fly away whereas broad shoulders and deep chest and sound limbs and a good brain usually last the better part of a lifetime and a brave heart will last for ever  i am afraid that i have yet to prove to myself as well as to the old gentleman that the brave heart is mine returned edgar  as to the physiqueyou may be so far right but he evidently undervalues that  i said nothing about physic returned baldwin who still frowned as he thought of the china merchant and the less that you and i have to do wi that the better  but what are you goin to do sir  that is just the point on which i want to have your advice  what ought i to do  dont run away with her whatever you do said baldwin emphatically  the youth laughed slightly as he explained that there was no chance whatever of his doing that because aileen would never consent to run away or to disobey her father  goodgood said the diver with still greater emphasis than before i like that  the gal that would sacrifice herself and her lover sooner than disobey her fathereven though he is a gooseis made o the right stuff  if its not takin too great a liberty mister edgar may i ask what shes like  what shes likeeh murmured the other dropping his head as if in reverie and stroking the dark shadow on his chin which was beginning to do duty for a beard  why sheshes like nothing that i ever saw on earth before  no ejaculated baldwin elevating his eyebrows a little as he said gravely what not even like an angel  well yes but even that does not sufficiently describe her  shes fairhe waxed enthusiastic heresurpassingly fair with wavy golden tresses and blue eyes and a bright complexion and a winning voice and a sylphlike figure and a thinnish but remarkably pretty face  ah interrupted baldwin with a sigh i know just like my missus  why my good fellow cried edgar unable to restrain a fit of laughter i do not wish to deny the good looks of mrs baldwin but you know that shes uncommonly ruddy and fat and heavy as well as fair  ay an forty if you come to that said the diver  shes fourteen stun if shes an ounce but let me tell you mister edgar she wasnt always heavy  there was a time when my susan was as trim and taut and clipperbuilt as any aileen that ever was born  i have no doubt of it whatever returned the youth but i was going to say when you interrupted me it is her eyes that are her strong pointher deep liquid melting blue eyes that look at you so earnestly and seem to pierce  ay just so interrupted the diver pierce into you like a gimblet goin slap agin the retina turnin short down the jugular right into the heart where they create an agreeable sort o fermentation  oh dont i knowmy susan all over  edgars amusement was tinged slightly with disgust at the divers persistent comparisons  however mastering his feelings he again demanded advice as to what he should do in the circumstances  you hant told me the circumstances yet said the diver quietly  well here they are  old mr hazlit  what  hazlit  miss hazlit is that her name cried baldwin with a look of pleased surprise  yes do you know her  know her  of course i do  why she visits the poor in my district o the old townyou know im a local preacher among the wesleyansan shes one o the best an sweetestha  angel indeed  im glad she wasnt made an angel of for it would have bin the spoilin of a splendid woman  bless her  the diver spoke with much enthusiasm and the young man smiled as he said of course i add amen to your last wordswell then he continued aileens father has refused to allow me to pay my addresses to his daughter  he has even forbidden me to enter his house or to hold any intercourse whatever with her  this unhappy state of things has induced me to hasten my departure from england  my intention is to go abroad make a fortune and then return to claim my bride for the want of money is all that the old gentleman objects to  i cannot bear the thought of going away without saying goodbye but that seems now unavoidable for he has as i have said forbidden me the house  edgar looked anxiously at his companions face but received no encouragement there for baldwin kept his eyes on the ground and shook his head slowly  if the old gentleman has forbid you his house of course you mustnt go into it  however it seems to me that you might cruise about the house and watch till susaileen i meancomes out but i dont myself quite like the notion of that either it dont seem fair an aboveboard like  you are right returned edgar  i cannot consent to hang about a mans door like a thief waiting to pounce on his treasure when it opens  besides he has forbidden aileen to hold any intercourse with me and i know her dear nature too well to subject it to a useless struggle between duty and inclination  she is certain to obey her fathers orders at any cost  then sir said baldwin decidedly youll just have to go afloat without sayin goodbye  theres no help for it but theres this comfort that bein what she is shell like you all the better for itnow here we are at the pier  boat ahoyoy  in reply to the divers hail a man in a punt waved his hand and pulled for the landingplace  a few strokes of the oar soon placed them on the deck of a large clumsy vessel which lay anchored off the entrance to the harbour  this was the divers barge which exhibited a ponderous crane with a pendulous hook and chain in the place where its foremast should have been  several men were busied about the deck one of whom sat clothed in the full dress of a diver with the exception of the helmet which was unscrewed and lay on the deck near his heavilyweighted feet  the dress was wet and the man was enjoying a quiet pipe from all which edgar judged that he was resting after a dive  near to the plank on which the diver was seated there stood the chest containing the airpumps  it was open the pumps were in working order with two men standing by to work them coils of indiarubber tubing lay beside it  elsewhere were strewn about stones for repairing the pier and various building tools  has machowl come on board yet asked baldwin as he stepped on the deck  ah i see he haswell rooney lad are you prepared to go down  yis sur i am  rooney machowl who stepped forward as he spoke was a fine specimen of a man and would have done credit to any nationality  he was about the middle height very broad and muscular and apparently twentythree years of age  his countenance was open goodhumoured and goodlooking though by no means classicthe nose being turnedup the eyes small and twinkling and the mouth large  have you ever seen anything of this sort before asked baldwin with a motion of his hand towards the diving apparatus scattered on the deck  no sur nothin  was you bred to any trade  yis sur im a shipcarpenter  an why dont you stick to that  bekase sur it wont stick to me  theres nothin doin apparently in this poort  annyhow i cant git work an ive a wife an chick at home whove bin so long used to praties and bacon that their stummicks dont take kindly to fresh air fried in nothin  so ye see sur findin it difficult to make a livin above ground im disposed to try to make it under water  while rooney machowl was speaking baldwin regarded him with a fixed and critical gaze  what his opinion of the recruit was did not however appear on his countenance or in his reply for he merely said humph well well see  youll begin your education in your noo profession by payin partikler attention to all that is said an done around you  yis sur returned machowl respectfully touching the peak of his cap and wrinkling his forehead very much while he looked on at the further proceedings of the divers with that expression of deep earnest sincerity of attention whichwhether assumed or genuineis only possible to the countenance of an irishman  during this colloquy the two men standing by the pumpcase and two other men who appeared to be supernumeraries listened with much interest but the diver seated on the plank resting and calmly smoking his pipe gazed with apparent indifference at the sea from which he had recently emerged  this man was a very large fellow with a dark surly countenancenot exactly bad in expression but rather illtemperedlooking  his divingdress being necessarily very wide and baggy made him seem larger than he really wasindeed quite gigantic  the dress was made of very thick indiarubber cloth and allfeet legs body and armswas of one piece so perfectly secured at the seams as to be thoroughly impervious to air or water  to get into it was a matter of some difficulty the entrance being effected at the neck  when this neck is properly attached to the helmet the diver is thoroughly cut off from the external world except through the airtube communicating with his helmet and the pump afore mentioned  have ye got the hole finished maxwell said baldwin turning to the surly diver  yes he replied shortly  well then go down and fix the charge  here it is said baldwin taking from a wooden case an object about eighteen inches long which resembled a large officeruler that had been coated thickly with pitch it was an elongated shell filled to the muzzle with gunpowder  to one end of it was fastened the end of a coil of wire which was also coated with some protecting substance  as baldwin spoke maxwell slowly puffed the last draw from his lips and knocked the ashes out of his pipe on the plank on which he still remained seated while the two supernumeraries busied themselves in completing his toilet for him one screwing on his helmet which appeared ridiculously large the other loading his breast and back with two heavy leaden weights  when fully equipped the diver carried on his person a weight fully equal to that of his own bulky person  now look here mister edgar an pay partikler attention rooney machowl  this here toobe made of indyrubber dee see  yis sur from rooney i fix on as you perceive to the back of maxwells helmet it communicates with that there pump and when these two men work the pump air will be forced into the helmet and into the dress down to his very toes  we could bust him if we were so disposed if it wasnt for an escapevalve here close beside the airtoobe at the back of the helmet which keeps lettin off the surplus air  moreover there is another valve here in front of the breastplate which is under the control of the diver so that he can let air escape by givin it a halfturn when the men at the pumps are givin him too much or he can keep it in when theyre givin him enough  an what does he do asked rooney with an anxious expression whin they give him too little  he pulls on the airpipeas ill explain to you in good timethe proper signal for more air  but what if he forgits or misremimbers the signal asked the inquisitive recruit  why then replied baldwin he suffocates and we pull him up dead an give him decent burial  keep yourself easy my lad an youll know all about it in good time  ill soon give ee the chance to suffocate or bust yourself accordin to taste  come cut it short and look alive said maxwell gruffly as he stood up to permit of a stout rope being fastened to his waist  you shut up retorted baldwin  having exchanged these little civilities the two divers moved to the side of the bargemaxwell with a slow ponderous tread  a short iron ladder dipped from the gunwale of the barge a few feet down into the sea  the diver stepped upon this turning with his face inwards descended kneedeep into the water and then stopped  baldwin handed him the blastingcharge  at the same moment one of the supernumeraries advanced with the frontglass or bullseye in his hand and the men at the pumps gave a turn or two to see that all was working well  all right demanded the supernumerary  right responded maxwell in a voice which issued sepulchrally from the iron globe  there are three round windows fitted with thick plateglass in the helmets to which we refer  the front one is made to screw off and on and the fixing of this is always the last operation in completing a divers toilet  pump away said the man holding the round glass in front of maxwells nose and looking over his shoulder to see that the order was obeyed the glass was screwed on and the man finished off by gravely patting maxwell in an affectionate manner on the head  why does he pat him so asked edgar with a laugh at the apparent tenderness of the act  its a tinder farewell i suppose murmured rooney in case he niver comes up again  it is to let him know that he may now descend in safety answered baldwin  the pump there is kep goin from a few moments before the frontglass is screwed on till the diver shows his head above water againwhich hell do in quarter of an hour or so for it dont take long to lay a charge but our ordinary spell under water when work is steady is about four hoursmore or lesswith perhaps a breath of ten minutes once or twice at the surface when theyre working deep  but why a breath at the surface asked edgar  isnt the air sent down fresh enough  quite fresh enough mister edgar but the pressure when we go deepsay ten or fifteen fathomsis severe on a man if long continued so that he needs a little relief now and then  some need more and some less relief accordin to their strength  maxwell has only gone down fifteen feet so that he wouldnt need to come up at all durin a spell of work were goin to blast a big rock that has bin troublesome to us at low water  the hole was driven in it last week  we moored a raft over it and kep men at work with a long iron jumper that reached from the rock to the surface of the sea  it was finished last night and now hes gone to fix the charge  but i dont understand about the pressure sur at all at all said machowl with a complicated look of puzzlement sure whin i putt my hand in wather i dont feel no pressure whatsomediver  of course not responded baldwin because you dont put it deep enough  you must know that our atmosphere presses on our bodies with a weight of about 20000 pounds  well if you go thirtytwo feet deep in the sea you get the pressure of exactly another atmosphere which means that youve got to stand a pressure all over your body of 40000 when youve got down as deep as thirtytwo feet  but objected rooney i dont fed no pressure of the atmosphere on me body at all  thats because youre squeezed by the air inside of you man as well as by the atmosphere outside which takes off the feelin of it an moreover youre used to it  if the weight of our atmosphere was took off your outside and not took off your insideyour lungs an the likeyoud come to feel it pretty strong for youd swell like a balloon an bust amost if not altogether  baldwin paused a moment and regarded the puzzled countenance of his pupil with an air of pity  contrairywise he continued if the air was all took out of your inside an allowed to remain on your outside youd go squash together like a collapsed indyrubber ball  well then if that be so with one atmosphere what must it be with a pressure equal to two which you have when you go down to thirtytwo feet deep in the sea  an if you go down to twentyfive fathoms or 150 feet which is often done what must the pressure be there  tightish no doubt said rooney  true lad continued joe  of course to counteract this we must force more air down to you the deeper you go so that the pressure inside of you may be a little more than the pressure outside in order to force the foul air out of the dress through the escapevalve and what between the one an the other your sensations are peculiar you may be surebut come young man dont be alarmed  well not send you down very deep at first  if some divers go down as deep as twentyfive fathoms surely youll not be frightened to try two and a half  whatever rooneys feelings might have been the judicious allusion to the possibility of his being frightened was sufficient to call forth the emphatic assertion that he was ready to go down two thousand fathoms if they had ropes long enough and weights heavy enough to sink him  while the recruit is preparing for his subaqueous experiments you and i reader will go see what maxwell is about at the bottom of the sea    chapter two  describes a first visit to the bottom of the sea  when the diver received the encouraging pat on the head as already related he descended the ladder to its lowest round  here being a few feet below the surface the buoyancy of the water relieved him of much of the oppression caused by the great weights with which he was loaded he was in a semifloating condition hence the ladder being no longer necessary was made to terminate at that point  he let go his hold of it and sank gently to the bottom regulating his pace by a rope which descended from the foot of the ladder to the mud on which in a few seconds his leaden soles softly rested  a continuous stream of airbubbles from the safetyvalve behind the helmet indicated to those above that the pumps were doing their duty and at the same time hid the diver entirely from their sight  meanwhile the two men who acted as signalman and assistant stood near the head of the ladder the first holding the lifeline the assistant the coil of airtubing  their duty was to stand by and pay out or haul in tubing and line according as the divers movements and necessities should require  they were to attend also to his signalssome of which were transmitted by the line and some by the airtube  these signals vary among divers  with baldwin and his party one pull on the lifeline meant all right four pulls im coming up  one pull on the airpipe signified sufficient air two pulls more air  pump faster  four pulls was an alarm and signified haul me up  the aspect of rooney machowls face when endeavouring to understand baldwins explanation of these signals was a sight worth seeing  but to return to our diver  on reaching the bottom maxwell took a coil of small line which hung on his left arm and attached one end of it to a stone or sinker which kept taut the ladderline by which he had descended  this was his clew to guide him back to the ladder  not only is the light under water very dimvarying of course according to depth until total darkness ensuesbut a divers vision is much weakened by the muddy state of the water at rivermouths and in harbours so that he is usually obliged to depend more on feeling than on sight  if he were to leave the foot of his ladder without the guidingcoil it would be difficult if not impossible to find it again and his only resource would be to signal haul me up which would be undignified to say the least of it  by means of this coil he can wander about at willwithin the limits of his airtube tether of courseand be certain to find his way back to the ladderfoot in the darkest or muddiest water  having fastened the line the diver walked in the direction of the rock on which he had to operate dropping gradually the coils of the guidingline as he proceeded  his progress was very slow for water is a dense medium and mans form is not well adapted for walking in itas every bather knows who has attempted to walk when up to his neck in it he soon found the object of his search and went down on his knees beside the hole already driven into the rock  even this process of going on his knees was not so simple as it sounds for the men above were sending down more air than could escape by the valve behind the helmet and thus were filling his dress to such an extent that he had a tendency to rise off the ground despite his weights  to counteract this he opened the valve in front let out the superabundant air got on his knees and was soon busy at work inserting the chargetube into the hole and tamping it well home taking care that the fine wire with which it communicated with the party in the barge should not be injured  while thus engaged he was watched apparently with deep interest by a small crab a shrimp and several little fish of various kinds all of which we may add seemed to have various degrees of curiosity  one particular little fish named a goby and celebrated for its wideawake nature and impudence actually came to the frontglass of the helmet and looked in  but the diver was too busy to pay attention to it  nothing abashed the goby went to each of the sidewindows but receiving no encouragement it made for a convenient ledge of the rock where resting its forefins on a barnacle it turned its head a little on one side and looked on in silence  finding this rather tedious after a time it went with much of the spirit of a london streetboy and passing close to the shrimp tweaked the end of one of its feelers causing that volatile creature to vanish  it then made a demonstration of attack on the crab but that crustaceous worthy sitting up on its hindlegs and expanding both claws with a very comeonifyoudare aspect bid it defiance  meanwhile the charge was laid and maxwell rose to return to the world above  feeling a certain uncomfortable hotness in the air he breathed and observing that his legs were remarkably thin and that his dress was clasped somewhat too lovingly about his person he became aware of the fact that having neglected to reclose the frontvalve his supply of air was now insufficient  he therefore shut the valve and began to wend his way back to the ladder  by the time he reached it the air in his dress had swelled him out to aldermanic dimensions so that he pulled himself up the ladderrope hand over hand with the utmost easehaving previously given four pulls on his lifeline to signal coming up  a few seconds more and his head was seen to emerge from the surface like some goggleeyed monster of the briny deep  a comrade at once advanced and unscrewed his frontglass and then but not till then did the men at the pumps cease their labours  all right said maxwell stepping over the side and seating himself on his plank  stand by said baldwin  the two satellites did not require that order for they were already standing by with a small electrical machine  the wire before mentioned as being connected with the charge of powder now safely lodged in the hole at the bottom of the sea was connected with the electrical machine and a few vigorous turns of its handle were given while every eye was turned expectantly on the surface of the sea  that magic spark which now circles round the world annihilating time and space was evolved it flashed down the wire the ocean could not put it out the dry powder received it the massive rock burst into fragments a decided shock was felt on board the barge and a turmoil of gasbubbles and dead or dying fish came to the surface in the midst of which turmoil the shrimp the crab and the goby doubtless came to an untimely end  thus was cleared out of the way an obstruction which had from time immemorial been a serious inconvenience to that port and thus every year serious inconveniences and obstructions that most people know very little about are cleared out of the way by our bold steady and daring divers through the wisdom and the wonderful appliances of our submarine engineers  now then rooney come an well dress you said baldwin  as youre goin to be a professional diver its right that you should have the first chance and set a good example to mister berrington here whos only what we may call an amateur  faix id rather that mister berrington shud go first said rooney who as he spoke however stripped himself of his coat vest and trousers preparatory to putting on the costume  ill be glad to go first rooney if youre afraid said edgar  rooneys annoyance at being thought afraid was increased to indignation by a contemptuous guffaw from maxwell  flushing deeply and casting a glance of anger at maxwell the young irishman crushed down his feelings and said  sure im only jokin  put on the dress mister baldwin av ye plaze  a diver like a too highbred lady cannot well dress himself  he requires two assistants  rooney machowl sat down on the plank beside maxwell who was busy taking off his dress and acted according to orders  first of all they brought him a thick guernsey shirt a pair of drawers and pair of inside stockings which he put on and fastened securely sometimes a crinoline to afford protection to the stomach in deep water is put on but on the present occasion it was omitted the water being shallow  then baldwin put on him a shoulderpad to bear the weight of the helmet etcetera and prevent chafing  if it was cold rooney said his instructor id put two guernseys and pairs of drawers and stockins on you but as its warm one setll do  moreover if you was goin deep youd have the option of stuffin your ears with cotton soaked in oil to relieve the pressure some do an some dont  i never do myself  its said to relieve the pressure of air on the ears but my ears are strong  anyway you wont want it in this waternow for the dress boys  the two assistantswith mouths expanded from ear to earhere advanced with the strong indiarubber garment whose legs feet body and arms are as we have already said all in one piece  pushing his feet in at the upper opening rooney writhed thrust and wriggled himself into it being ably assisted by his attendants who held open the sleeves for him and expanded the tight elastic cuffs and catching the dress at the neck hitched it upwards so powerfully as almost to lift their patient off his legs  next came a pair of outside stockings and canvas overalls or short trousers both of which were meant to preserve the dressproper from injury  having been got into all these things rooney was allowed to sit down while his attendants each put on and buckled a boot with leaden soleseach boot weighing about twenty pounds  a purty pair of dancin pumps remarked rooney turning out his toes while baldwin put on his breastplate after having drawn up the inner collar of the dress and tied it round his neck with a piece of spare yarn  the breastplate was made of tinned copper  it covered part of the back breast and shoulders of the diver and had a circular neck to which the helmet was to be ultimately screwed  it rested on the inner collar of the dress and the outer collarof stout indiarubberwas drawn over it  in this outer collar were twelve holes corresponding to twelve screws round the edge of the breastplate  when these holes had been fitted over their respective screws a breastplateband in four pieces was placed over them and screwed tight by means of nutsthus rendering the connection between the dress and the breastplate perfectly watertight  it now only remained to screw the helmet to the circular neck of the breastplate  previously however a woollen nightcap was drawn over the poor mans head well down on his ears and rooney lookedas indeed he afterwards admitted that he feltas if he were going to be hanged  he thought however of the proverb that a man who is born to be drowned never can be hanged and somehow felt comforted  the diving helmet is made of tinned copper and much too large for the largest human head in order that the wearer may have room to move his head freely about inside of it  it should not touch the head in any part but is fixed rigidly to the breastplate resting on the shoulders and does not partake of the motions of the head  in it are three round openings filled with the thickest plateglass and protected by brass bars or guards also an outletvalve to allow the foul air to escape a short metal tube with an inletvalve to which the airpump is screwed and a regulating cock for getting rid of excess of air  the arrangement is such that the fresh air enters and is spread over the front of the divers face while the foul escapes at the back of his head  by a clever contrivancea segmental screwthe helmet can be fixed to its neck with oneeighth of a turn instead of having to be twisted round several times  to various hooks and studs on the helmet and breastplate are hung two leaden masses weighing about forty pounds each  these weights having been attached and a waistbelt with a knife in it put round rooneys waist along with the lifeline the airtube was affixed and he was asked by baldwin how he felt  a trifle heavy replied the pupil through the front hole of the helmet which was not yet closed  that feeling will go off entirely when youre under water said baldwin  now remember if you want more air just give two pulls on the airpipean dont pull as if you was tryin to haul down the barge well be sure to feel you  be gentle and quiet whatever ye do gettin flurried never does any good whatever  dee hear  yis sur answered rooney and his voice sounded metallic and hollow even to those outsidemuch more so to himself  well then if we give you too much air youve only got to open the frontvalveso and when youre easy shut it  when you get down to the bottom give oneonly onepull on the lifeline which means all right and ill give one pull in reply  we must always reply to each other dee see because if you dont answer of course well think youve been suffocated or entangled at the bottom among wreckage and whatnot or been took with a fit an well haul you up as hard as we can so youll have to be particular  dee understand  again the learner replied yis sur but less confidently than before for baldwins cautions although meant to have an encouraging effect proved rather to be alarming  now continued the teacher leading his pupil to the side of the barge be sure to go down slow and come up slow  whatever you do do it slow for if you do it fastespecially in comin upyoull come to grief  if a man comes up too fast from deep water the condensed air inside of him is apt to swell him out and the brain bein relieved too suddenly from the pressure theres a rush of blood to it and a singin in the ears and a pain in the head with other unpleasant symptoms why continued baldwin growing energetic ive actually known a man killed outright by bein pulled up too quick from a depth of twenty fathoms  so mark my words lad and take it easy  if you get nervous just stop a bit an amuse yourself with thinkin over what ive told you and then go on with your descent  at this point rooneys heart almost failed him but catching sight of maxwells halfamused halfcontemptuous face he stepped resolutely on the ladder and began to descend in haste  hold on roared baldwin laying hold of the lifeline  why man alive youre off without the frontglass  och  whirra  so i am said rooney pausing  pump away lads cried baldwin looking back at his assistants  whist  whats that asked the pupil excitedly as a hissing sound buzzed round his head  why thats the air coming in  now then ill screw on the glass  are you all right  all right replied rooney telling as he said himself afterwards one of the biggist lies he iver towld in his life  the glass was screwed on and the learner was effectually cut off from all connection with the outer air save through the slight medium of an indiarubber pipe  having thus screwed him upor inbaldwin gave him the patronising pat on the helmet as a signal for him to descend but rooney stood tightly fixed to the ladder and motionless  again baldwin patted his head encouragingly but still rooney stood as motionless as one of the ironclad warriors in the tower of london  the fact was his courage had totally failed him  he was ashamed to come up and could not by any effort of will force himself to go down  why whats wrong demanded baldwin looking in at the glass which however was so clouded with the inmates breath that he could only be seen dimly  it was evident that rooney was speaking in an excited voice but no sound was audible through that impervious mass of metal and glass  baldwin was therefore about to unscrew the mouthglass when accident brought about what rooneys will could not accomplish  in attempting to move the poor pupil missed his hold or slipped somehow and fell into the sea with a sounding splash  let him go boysgently or hell break everything  a dipll do him no harm cried baldwin to the alarmed assistants  the men let the lifeline and airtube slip until the rushing descent was somewhat abated and then checking the involuntary diver they hauled him slowly to the surface where his arms and open palms went swaying wildly round until they came in contact with the ladder on which they fastened with a grip that was sufficient to have squeezed the life out of a gorilla  in a few seconds he ascended a step and his head emerged then another step and baldwin was able to unscrew the glass  the first word that the poor man uttered through his porthole was och the next musha  a burst of laughter from his friends above somewhat reassured him and again the tinge of contempt in maxwells voice reinfused courage and desperate resolve  why man what was your haste said baldwin  sure the rounds o yer ladder was slippy answered rooney with some indignation  didnt ye see i lost me howld  come putt on the glass an ill try again  never say die was a motto of me owld father an it was the only legacy he left meim ready sur  it is right here to remark that something of the pupils return of courage and resolution was due to his quick perception  he had time to reflect that he really had been at or near the bottom of the seaat all events over head and ears in waterfor several minutes without being drowned even without being moistened and his faith in the divingdress though still weak had dawned sufficiently to assert itself as a power  ha  my lad youll do  youll make a diver yet said baldwin when about to readjust the glass  i forgot to tell you that when your breath clouds the frontglass youve only got to bend your head down and wipe it off with your nightcap  now then down you go once more  this time the pat on the head was followed by a descending motion  the mailed figure was feeling with its right foot for the next round of the ladder  then slowlyvery slowlythe left foot was let down while the two hands held on with a tenacity that caused all the muscles and sinews to stand out rigidly  then one hand was loosened and caught nervously at a lower roundthen the other hand followed and thus by degrees the pupil went under the surface when his helmet appeared like a large round ball of light enveloped in the milkyway of airbubbles that rose from it  youd better give the signal to ask if alls right said edgar who felt a little anxious  do so said baldwin nodding to the assistant  the man obeyed but no answering signal was returned  according to rule they should instantly have hauled the diver up but baldwin bade them delay a moment  im quite sure theres nothing wrong he said stooping over the side of the barge and gazing into the water its only another touch of nervousnessah  i see him holdin on like a barnacle to the ladder afraid to let go  hell soon tire of kickin therethats it there he goes down the rope like the best of us  in another moment the lifeline and airpipe ceased to run out and then the assistant gave one pull on the line  immediately there came back one pullall right  thats all right repeated baldwin now the ice is fairly broken and well soon see how hes going to get on  in order that we too may see that more comfortably you and i reader will again go under water and watch him  we will also listen to him for rooney has a convenient habit of talking to himself and neither water nor helmet can prevent us from overhearing  true to his instructions the pupil proceeded to fasten his clewline to the stone at the foot of the ladderrope and attempted to kneel  well well he said did ye iver  what would me mother say if she heard i couldnt git on my knees whin i tried to  rooney began this remark aloud but the sound of his own voice was so horribly loud and unnaturally near that he finished off in a whisper and continued his observations in that confidential tone  och  is it dancin yer goin to do rooneyin the daytime too he whispered as his feet slowly left the bottom  howld on man  he made a futile effort to stoop and grasp the mud then bethinking himself of baldwins instructions he remembered that too much air had a tendency to bring him to the surface and that opening the frontvalve was the remedy  he was not much too soon in recollecting this for besides rising he was beginning to feel a singing in his head and a disagreeable pressure on the ears caused by the everincreasing density of the air  the moment the valve was fully opened a rush out of air occurred which immediately sank him again and he had now no difficulty in getting on his knees  theres little enough light down here anyhow he muttered as he fumbled about the stone sinker in a vain attempt to fasten his line to it sure the windy must be dirty  the thought reminded him of baldwins teaching  he bent forward his head and wiped the glass with his nightcap but without much advantage for the dimness was caused by the muddiness of the water  just then he began to experience uncomfortable sensations he felt a tendency to gasp for air and became very hot while his garments clasped his limbs very tightly  he had like maxwell forgotten to reclose the breastvalve but unlike the more experienced diver he had failed to discover his omission  he became flurried and anxious and getting more and more confused fumbled nervously at his helmet to ascertain that all was right there  in so doing he opened the little regulating cock which served to form an additional outlet to foul air this of course made matters worse  the pressure of air in the dress was barely sufficient to prevent the water from entering by the breastvalve and regulating cock  perspiration burst out on his forehead  he naturally raised his hand to wipe it away but was prevented by the helmet  rooney possessed an active mind  his thoughts flew fast  this check induced the following ideas  what if i shud want to scratch me head or blow me nose  or what if an earwig shud chance to have got inside this iron pot and take a fancy to go into my ear  his right ear became itchy at the bare idea  he made a desperate blow at it and skinned his knuckles while a hitherto unconceived intensity of desire to scratch his head and blow his nose took violent possession of him  just then a dead cat that had been flung into the harbour the night before and had not been immersed long enough to rise to the surface floated past with the tide and its sightless eyeballs and ghastly row of teeth glared and glistened on him as it surged against his frontglass  a slight spirt of water came through the regulating cock at the same instant as if the dead cat had spit in his face  hooroo  haul up shouted rooney following the order with a yell that sounded like the concentrated voice of infuriated ireland  at the same time he seized the lifeline and airtube and tugged at both not four times but nigh forty times four and never ceased to tug until he found himself gasping on the deck of the barge with his helmet off and his comrades laughing round him  its not a bad beginning said baldwin as he assisted his pupil to unrobe youll make a good diver in course o time  baldwin was right in this prophecy for in a few months rooney machowl became one of the best and coolest divers on his staff  we need not try the readers patience with an account of edgars descent which immediately followed that of the irishman  let it suffice to say that he too accomplished with credit and with less demonstration his first descent to the bottom of the sea    chapter three  refers to a small teaparty and touches very mildly on love  miss pritty was a good soul but weak  she was edgar berringtons maiden auntof an uncertain ageon the mothers side  her chief characteristic was delicacydelicacy of health delicacy of sentiment delicacy of intellectgeneral delicacy in fact all over  she was slight tooslightly made slightly educated slightly pretty and slightly cracked  but there were a few things in regard to which miss laura pritty was strong  she was strong in her affections strong in her reverence for all good things including a few bad things which in her innocence she thought good strong in her prejudices and impulses and strongremarkably strongin parentheses  her speech was eminently parenthetical insomuch that the range of her ideas was wholly untrammelled by the proprieties of subject or language  given a point to be aimed at in conversation miss pritty never aimed at it  she invariably began with it and parting finally from it at the outset diverged to any or every other point in nature  perplexity as a matter of course was the usual result both in speaker and hearer but then that mattered little for miss pritty was also strong in easygoing goodnature  on the evening in which we introduce her miss pritty was going to have her dear and intimate friend aileen hazlit to tea and she laid out her little teatable with as much care as an engineer might have taken in drawing a mathematical problem  the teapot was placed in the exact centre of the tray with its spout and handle pointing so that a line drawn through them would have been parallel to the sides of her little boudoir  the urn stood exactly behind it  the sugarbasin formed on one side of the tray a pendant to the creamjug on the other and inasmuch as the creamjug was small a toastrack was coupled with it to constitute the necessary balance  so too with the cups they were placed equidistant from the teapot the sides of the tray and each other while a salver of cake on one side of the table was scrupulously balanced by a plate of buns on the other side  there she isthe darling exclaimed miss pritty with a little skip and excuse the word a giggle as the bell rang  miss aileen hazlit announced miss prittys small and only domestic who flung wide open the door of the boudoir as its owner was fond of styling it  whereupon there entered an angel in blue with a straw hat and ostrich feather  we quote from the last almost dying speech of a hopeless youth in the towna lawyers clerkwhose heart was stamped over so completely with the word aileen that it was unrecognisable and practically useless for any purpose except beatingwhich it did hard at all times  aileen was beautiful beyond compare because in her case extreme beauty of face and feature was coupled with rare beauty of expression indicating fine qualities of mind  she was quiet in demeanour grave in speech serious and very earnest in thought enthusiastic in action unconscious and unselfish  pooh  perfection  i hear some lady reader ejaculate  no fair one not quite that but as near it as was compatible with humanity  happily there are many such in the worldsome with more and some with less of the external beautyand man is blessed and the world upheld by them  the chief bond that bound aileen and miss pritty together was a text of scripture consider the poor  the latter had strong sympathy with the poor being herself one of the number  the former being rich in faith as well as in means considered them  the two laid their heads together and concerted plans for the raising of the masses which might have been food for study to some statesmen  for instance they fed the hungry and clothed the naked they encouraged the welldisposed and reproved the evil they scattered seeds of kindness wherever they went they sowed the precious word of god in all kinds of groundgood and bad they comforted the sorrowing they visited the sick and the prisoner they refused to help or in any way to encourage the idle they handed the obstreperous and violent over to the police with the hopeif not the recommendationthat the rod should not be spared and in all cases they prayed for them  the results were considerable but not being ostentatiously trumpeted were not always recognised or traced to their true cause  come away darling exclaimed miss pritty eagerly embracing and kissing her friend who accepted but did not return the embrace though she did the kiss  i thought you were not coming at all and i have not seen you for a whole week  what has kept you  there put off your hat  im so glad to see you dear aileen  isnt it strange that im so fond of you  they say that people who are contrasts generally draw togetherat least ive often heard mrs boxer the wife of captain boxer you know of the navy who used to swear so dreadfully before he was married but i am happy to say has quite given it up now which says a great deal for wedded life though its a state that i dont quite believe in myself for if adam had never married eve he would not have been tempted to eat the forbidden fruit and so there would have been no sin and no sorrow or povertyno poor  only think of that  so that our chief occupation would have been gone said aileen with a slight twinkle of her lustrous blue eyes and perhaps you and i might never have met  miss pritty replied to this something very much to the effect that she would have preferred the entrance of sin and all its consequences poverty includedinto the world rather than have missed making the friendship of miss hazlit  at least her words might have borne that interpretationor any other  my father detained me said aileen seating herself at the table while her volatile friend put lumps of sugar into the cups with a tender yet sprightly motion of the hand as if she were doing the cups a special kindnessas indeed she was when preparing one of them to touch the lips of aileen  naughty man why did he detain you said miss pritty  only to write one or two notes his right hand being disabled at present by rheumatism  a gentleman miss in the dininroom said the small domestic suddenly opening a chink of the door for the admission of her somewhat dishevelled head  he wont send his name upsays he wants to see you  how vexing exclaimed miss pritty but ill go down  im determined that he shant interrupt our teteatete  miss pritty uttered a little scream of surprise on entering the diningroom  well aunt said edgar berrington with a hearty smile as he extended his hand you are surprised to see me  of course i am dear eddy cried miss pritty holding up her cheek for a kiss  sit down  why you were in london when i last heard of you  true but im not in london now as you see  ive been a week here  a week eddy  and you did not come to see me till now  well i ought to apologise replied the youth with a slight look of confusion butthe fact is i came down partly on business andand so you see ive been very busy  of course laughed miss pritty people who have business to do are usually very busy  well i forgive you and am glad to see youbut  well auntbut what  in short eddy i happen to be particularly engaged this eveningon business too like yourself but after all why should i not introduce you to my friend  you might help us in our discussionit is to be about the poor  do you know much about the poor and their miseries  edgar smiled sadly as he replied  yes i have had some experimental knowledge of the poorbeing one of them myself and my poverty too has made me inconceivably miserable  come eddy dont talk nonsense  you know i mean the very poor the destitute  but let us go upstairs and have a cup of tea  the idea of discussing the condition of the poor over a cup of tea with two ladies was not attractive to our hero in his then state of mind and he was beginning to excuse himself when his aunt stopped him  now dont say you cant or wont for you must  and i shall introduce you to a very pretty girloh such a pretty oneyouve no ideaand so sweet  miss pritty spoke impressively and with enthusiasm but as the youth knew himself to be already acquainted with and beloved by the prettiest girl in the town he was not so much impressed as he might have been however being a goodnatured fellow he was easily persuaded  all the way upstairs and while they were entering the boudoir little miss prittys tongue never ceased to vibrate but when she observed her nephew gazing in surprise at her friend whose usually calm and selfpossessed face was covered with confusion she stopped suddenly  goodevening miss hazlit said edgar recovering himself and holding out his hand as he advanced towards her i did not anticipate the pleasure of meeting you here  then you are acquainted already exclaimed miss pritty looking as much amazed as if the accident of two young people being acquainted without her knowledge were something tantamount to a miracle  yes i have met mr berrington at my fathers several times said aileen resuming her seat and bestowing a minute examination on the corner of her handkerchief  if aileen had added that she had met mr berrington every evening for a week past at her fathers had there renewed the acquaintance begun in london a year before and had been wooed and won by him before his stern repulse by her father she would have said nothing beyond the bare truth but she thought no doubt that it was not necessary to add all that  well well what strange things do happen said miss pritty resuming her duties at the teatable  sugar eddy  and creamonly to think that aileen and i have known each other so well and she did not know that you were my nephew but after all it could not well be otherwise for now i think of it i never mentioned your name to her  out of sight out of mind eddy you know and indeed you dont deserve to be remembered  if we all had our deserts some people that i know of would be in a very different position from what they are and some people wouldnt be at all  why aunt said edgar laughing  would you  some more cake eddy  no thank you  i was going to say  have you enough cream  allow me to  quite enough thanks  i was about to remark  some sugar aileeni beg your pardonyesyou were about to say  oh  nothing replied edgar half exasperated by these frequent interruptions but laughing in spite of himself only im surprised that sentence of annihilation should be passed on some people by one so amiable as you are  oh  i didnt exactly mean annihilation returned miss pritty with a pitiful smile i only mean that i wouldnt have had them come into existence they seem to be so utterly useless in the world and so interfering too with those who want to be useful  surely that quality or capacity of interference proves them to be not utterly useless said edgar for does it not give occasion for the exercise of patience and forbearance  ah replied miss pritty with an arch smile shaking her finger at her nephew you are a fallacious reasoner  do you know what that means  i cant help laughing still at the trouble i used to have in trying to find out the meaning of that word fallacious when i was at miss dullandoors seminary for young ladieshi  hi  some of us were excessively young ladies and we were taught everything by rote explanations of meanings of anything being quite ignored by miss dullandoor  do you remember her sister  oh  im so stupid to forget that its exactly thirty years today since she died and you cant be quite that age yet besides even if you were it would require that you should have seen and recognised and remembered her on her deathbed about the time of your own birth  oh  she was so funny both in face and figure  one of the older girls made a portrait of her for me which i have yet  ill go fetch it the expression is irresistibleit is killing  excuse me a minute  miss pritty rose and trippedshe never walkedfrom the room  during much of the previous conversation our hero had been sorely perplexed in his mind as to his duty in present circumstances  having been forbidden to hold any intercourse with aileen he questioned the propriety of his remaining to spend the evening with her and had made up his mind to rise and tear himself away when this unlookedfor opportunity for a teteatete occurred  being a man of quick wit and strong will he did not neglect it  turning suddenly to the fair girl he said in a voice low and measured  aileen your father commanded me to have no further intercourse with you and he made me aware that he had laid a similar injunction on yourself  i know full well your truehearted loyalty to him and do not intend to induce you to disobey  i ask you to make no reply to what i say that is not consistent with your promise to your father  for myself common courtesy tells me that i may not leave your presence for a distant land without saying at least goodbye  nay more i feel that i break no command in making to you a simple deliberate statement  edgar paused for a moment for in spite of the powerful restraint put on himself and the intended sedateness of his words his feelings were almost too strong for him  aileen he resumed i may never see you again  your father intends that i shall not  your looks seem to say that you fear as much  now my heart tells me that i shall but whatever betide or wherever i go let me assure you that i will continue to love you with unalterable fidelity  more than this i shall not say less i could not  you said that these new testamentspointing to a pile of four or five which lay on the tableare meant to be given to poor men  i am a poor man will you give me one  willingly said aileen taking one from the pile  she handed it to her lover without a single word but with a tender anxious look that went straight to his heart and took up its lodging thereto abide for ever  the youth grasped the book and the hand at once and stooping pressed the latter fervently to his lips  at that moment miss pritty was heard tripping along the passage  edgar sprang to intercept her and closed the door of the boudoir behind him  why edgar you seem in haste  i am dear aunt circumstances require that i should be  come downstairs with me  i have stayed too long already  i am going abroad and may not spend more time with you this evening  going abroad exclaimed miss pritty in breathless surprise where  i dont know  to china japan new zealand the north poleanywhere in fact ive not quite fixed  goodbye dear aunt  sorry to have seen so little of you  goodbye  he stooped printed a gentle kiss between miss prittys wondering eyes and vanished  a most remarkable boy said the disconcerted lady resuming her seat at the teatableso impulsive and volatile  but hes a dear good boy neverthelesswas so kind to his mother while she was alive and ran away from school when quite youngand no wonder for it was a dreadful school where they used to torture the boysabsolutely tortured them the headmaster and ushers were tried for it afterwards im told  at all events eddy ran away from it after pulling the masters nose and kicking the head usherso it is said though i cannot believe it he is usually so gentle and courteousdo have a little more tea  no  a piece of bun  no  why you seem quite flushed my love  not unwell i trust  no  well then let us proceed to business    chapter four  divers matters  charles hazlit esquire was a merchant and a shipowner a landed proprietor a manager of banks a member of numerous boards and committees a guardian of the poor a volunteer colonel and a goodhumoured man on the whole but purseproud and pompous  he was also the father of aileen  behold him seated in an elegant drawingroom in a splendid mansion at the west end strange that all aristocratic ends would appear to be west ends of the seaport town which owned him  his blooming daughter sat beside him at a table on which lay a small peculiar box  he doated on his daughter and with good reason  their attention was so exclusively taken up with the peculiar box that they had failed to observe the entrance unannounced of a man of rough exterior who stood at the door hat in hand bowing and coughing attractively but without success  my darling said mr hazlit stooping to kiss his childhis only childwho raised her pretty little threecornered mouth to receive it this being your twentyfirst birthday i have at last brought myself to look once again on your sainted mothers jewelcase in order that i may present it to you  i have not opened it since the day she died  it is now yours my child  aileen opened her eyes in mute amazement  it would seem as though there had been some secret sympathy between her and the man at the door for he did precisely the same thing  he also crushed his hat somewhat convulsively with both hands but without doing it any damage as it was a very hard sailorlike hat  he also did something to his lips with his tongue which looked a little like licking them  oh papa exclaimed aileen seizing his hand how kind how  nay love no thanks are due to me  it is your mothers gift  on her deathbed she made me promise to give it you when you came of age and to train you up to that age as far as possible with a disregard for dress and show  i think your dear mother was wrong continued mr hazlit with a mournful smile but whether right or wrong you can bear me witness that i have sought to fulfil the second part of her dying request and i now accomplish the first  he proceeded to unlock the fastenings of the little box which was made of some dark metal resembling iron and was deeply as well as richly embossed on the lid and sides with quaint figures and devices  mr hazlit had acquired a grand freehanded way of manipulating treasure  instead of lifting the magnificent jewels carefully from the casket he tumbled them out like a gorgeous cataract of light and colour by the simple process of turning the box upside down  oh papa take care exclaimed aileen spreading her little hands in front of the cataract to stem its progress to the floor while her two eyes opened in surprise and shone with a lustre that might have made the insensate gems envious  how exquisite  how inexpressibly beautifuloh my dear darling mother  she stopped abruptly and tears fluttered from her eyes  in a few seconds she continued pushing the gems away almost passionately  but i cannot wear them papa  they are worthless to me  she was right  she had no need of such gems  was not her hair golden and her skin alabaster  were not her lips coral and her teeth pearls and were not diamonds of the purest water dropping at that moment from her downcast eyes  true my child and the sentiment does your heart credit they are worthless utterly worthlessmere pasteat this point the face of the man at the door visibly changed for the worsemere paste as regards their power to bring back to us the dear one who wore them nevertheless in a commercial point of viewhere the ears of the man at the door cockedthey are worth some eight or nine thousand pounds sterling so they may as well be taken care of  the tongue and lips of the man at the door again became active  he attemptedunsuccessfully as beforeto crush his hat and inadvertently coughed  mr hazlits usually pale countenance flushed and he started up  hallo  my man how came you here  the man looked at the door and hesitated in his attempt to reply to so useless a question  how comes it that you enter my house and drawingroom without being announced asked mr hazlit drawing himself up  cause i wanted to see you an i found the door open an there warnt nobody down stair to announce me answered the man in a rather surly tone  oh indeedah said mr hazlit drawing out a large silk handkerchief with a flourish blowing his nose therewith and casting it carelessly on the table so as to cover the jewelbox  well as you are now ere pray what have you got to say to me  your ship the seagull has bin wrecked sir on toosday night on the coast of wales  i received that unpleasant piece of news on wednesday morning  what has that to do with your visit  only that i thought you might want divers for to go to the wreck an im a diverthats all  the man at the door said this in a very surly tone for the slight tendency to politeness which had begun to manifest itself while the prospect of a job was hopeful vanished before the haughty manner of the merchant  well it is just possible that i may require the assistance of divers said mr hazlit ringing the bell when i do i can send for you john show this person out  the hallfootman who had been listening attentively at the keyhole and allowed a second or two to elapse before opening the door bowed with a guilty flush on his face and held the door wide open  david maxwellfor it was hepassed out with an angry scowl and as he strode with noisy tread across the hall said something uncommonly pithy to the footman about upstarts and puppies and people who thought they was made o different dirt from others accompanied with many other words and expressions which we may not repeat  to all of this john replied with bland smiles and polite bows hoping that the effects of the interview might not render him feverish and reminding him that if it did he was in a better position than most men for cooling himself at the bottom of the sea  farewell said john earnestly and if you should take a fancy to honour us any day with your company to dinner do send a line to say youre coming  john did not indulge in this pleasantry until the exasperated diver was just outside of the house and it was well that he was so prudent for maxwell turned round like a tiger and struck with tremendous force at his face  his hard knuckles met the panel of the door in which they left an indelible print and at the same time sent a sound like a distant cannon shot into the library  im afraid i have been a little too sharp with him said mr hazlit assisting his daughter to replace the jewels  aileen agreed with him but as nothing could induce her to condemn her father with her lips she made no reply  but continued the old gentleman the rascal had no right to enter my house without ringing  he might have been a thief you know  he looked rough and coarse enough to be one  oh papa said aileen entreatingly dont be too hasty in judging those who are sometimes called rough and coarse  i do assure you ive met many men in my district who are big and rough and coarse to look at but who have the feelings and hearts of tender women  i know it simple one you must not suppose that i judged him by his exterior i judged him by his rude manner and conduct and i do not extend my opinion of him to the whole class to which he belongs  it is strangeand illustrative of the occasional perversity of human reasoningthat mr hazlit did not perceive that he himself had given the diver cause to judge him mr hazlit very harshly and the worst of it was that maxwell did in his wrath extend his opinion of the merchant to the entire class to which he belonged expressing a deep undertoned hope that the whole bilin of em might end their days in a place where he spent many of his own namely at the bottom of the sea it is to be presumed that he wished them to be there without the benefit of divingdresses  it is curious however continued mr hazlit that i had been thinking this very morning about making inquiries after a diver one whom i have frequently heard spoken of as an exceedingly able and respectable manbalding or bolding or some such name i think  oh  baldwin joe baldwin as his intimate friends call him said aileen eagerly  i know him well he is in my district  what exclaimed mr hazlit not one of your paupers  aileen burst into a merry laugh  no papa no not a pauper certainly hes a welloff diver and a wesleyana local preacher i believebut he lives in my district and is one of the most zealous labourers in it oh  if you saw him papa with his large burly frame and his rough bronzed kindly face and broad shoulders and deep bass voice and hearty laugh  the word suggested the act for aileen went off again at the bare idea of joe baldwin being a pauperone at whose feet she said she delighted to sit and learn  well im glad to have such a good account of him from one so well able to judge rejoined her father and as i mean to go visit him without delay ill be obliged if youll give me his address  having received it the merchant sallied forth into those regions of the town where albeit she was not a guardian of the poor his daughters light figure was a much more familiar object than his own  does a diver named baldwin live here asked mr hazlit of a figure which he found standing in a doorway near the end of a narrow passage  the figure was hazy and indistinct by reason of the heavy wreaths of tobaccosmoke wherewith it was enveloped  yis sur replied the figure he lives in the door it the other ind o the passage  its not overlight here sur mind yer feet as ye go an pay attintion to your head for what betune holes in the floor an beams in the ceilin tall gintlemen like you sur come to grief sometimes  thanking the figure for its civility mr hazlit knocked at the door indicated but there was no response  sure its out they are cried the figure from the other end of the passage  joe baldwins layin a charge under the wreck off the jetty todayno doubt thats whats kep im and its washinday with mrs joe i belave but im his pardner sur an if yell step this way mrs machowlll be only too glad to see ye sur an i can take yer orders  not a little amused by this freeandeasy invitation mr hazlit entered a small apartment which surprised him by its clean and tidy appearance a pretty little irishwoman with a pert little turnedup nose auburn hair so luxuriant that it could not be kept in order and a set of teeth that glistened in their purity invited him to sit down and wiped a chair with her apron for his accommodation  youve got a nice little place here remarked the visitor looking round him  troth sur ye wouldnt have said that if youd seen it whin we first came to it  of all the dirty places i iver saw  i belave an irish pig would have scunnered at it an held his nose till he got out  its very well for england but we was used to cleaner places in the owld country  howsiver weve got it made respictable now and were not hard to plaze  this was a crushing reply  it upset mr hazlits preconceived ideas regarding the two countries so completely that he was perplexed  not being a man of rapid thought he changed the subject  you are a diver you say  i am sur  and mr baldwins partnerif i understand you correctly  well we work togetherwhin were not workin apartpritty regular he took in hand to train me some months gone by an as our two missusses has took a fancy to aich other were likely to hold on for some timebarrin accidents av coorse  well then said mr hazlit i came to see mr baldwin about a vessel of mine which was wrecked a few days ago on the coast of wales  och  the seagull it is exclaimed rooney  the same and as it is a matter of importance that i should have the wreck visited without delay i shall be obliged by your sending your partner to my house this evening  rooney promised to send baldwin up and took his wife molly to witness with much solemnity that he would not lose a single minute  thereafter the conversation became general and at last the merchant left the place much shaken in his previous opinion of irish character and deeply impressed with the sagacity of rooney machowl  the result of this visit was that baldwin was engaged to dive for the cargo of the seagull and found himself a few days later busy at work on the welsh coast with a staff of men under him among whom were our friends rooney machowl and surly david maxwell  the latter had at first declined to have anything to do with the job but on consideration of the wages he changed his mind    chapter five  treats of plots and plans engineering and otherwise  the spot where the wreck of the seagull lay was a peaceful sequestered cove or bay on the coast of anglesea  the general aspect of the neighbouring land was bleak  there were no trees and few bushes indeed the spire of a solitary little church on an adjoining hill was the most prominent object in the scene  the parsonage belonging to it was concealed by a rise in the ground and the very small hamlet connected with it was hid like a rabbit in the clefts of some rugged cliffs  the little church was one of those temples which are meant to meet the wants of a rural district and which cause a feeling of surprise in the minds of town visitors as to where the congregation can come from that fills them  but bleak though the country was the immediate shore was interesting and romantic in its form  in one place perpendicular cliffs cut up by ragged gorges descended sheer down into deep water and meeting the constant roll of the irish channel even in calm weather fringed themselves with lacework of foam as if in cool defiance of the ocean in another place a mass of boulders and shattered rocks stretched out into the sea as if still resistant though for the time subdued elsewhere a halfmoon of yellow sand received the ripples with a kiss suggestive of utter conquest and the end of strife  as we have said the spot was peaceful for at the time to which we refer ocean and air were still but ah  those who have not dwelt near the great deep and beheld its fury when roused can form but a faint conception of the scene that occurred there on the night in which the seagull went down  mr hazlit thought of the place as something like the region of a bad debtwhere a portion of his wealth had been wrecked  some knew it as the hated spot where they had suffered the loss of all their fortune but others there were who untouched by the thought of material gain or loss knew it as the scene of the wreck of all their earthly hopesfor the seagull had been a passengership and in that quiet bay god in his providence had dealt some of the most awful blows that human beings are capable of bearing  close to a bald cliff on the northern shore the foretopmast of the wreck rose a few feet above the calm water  in a cove of the cliff the remains of a mast or yard lay parallel with a deep and thick mass of wreckage which had surged out and into that cove on the fatal night with such violence that it now lay in small pieces like giant matchwood  on a patch of gravel not far from that cliff a husband and father had wandered for many days after being savedhe knew not how gazing wistfully hopelessly at the sea which had swallowed up wife and children and fortune  he had been a successful golddigger  on that patch of gravel scenes of terrible suspense had been enacted  expectant ones had come to inquire whether those whom they sought had really embarked in that vessel while grave and sympathetic but wornout or weary men of the coastguard stood ready to give information or to defend the wreck  in the church on the hill there were dreadful marks on the floor where the recovered bodies had lain for a time while frantic relations came and went day by day to search for and claim their dead  ah reader we are not mocking you with fiction  what we refer to is fact  we saw it with our eyes  peaceful though that spot lookedand often looksit was once the scene of the wildest of storms the most terrible of mercantile disasters and the deepest of human woe  but we are mingling thoughts with memories  the wreck which has crept into our mind is that of the royal charter  the seagull although a passengership and wrecked near the same region does not resemble that  at the time of which we write joe baldwin and his men had already saved a considerable portion of the cargo but during his submarine explorations and meditations joe had conceived the idea that there was some possibility of saving the vessel itself for having recoiled from its first shock and sunk in deep water the hull was comparatively uninjured  but joe although a good diver was not a practical engineer  he knew himself to be not a very good judge of such matters and was too modest to suggest anything to competent submarine engineers  he could not however help casting the thing about in his mind for some time  at last one evening while reading a newspaper that had been got from a passing boat he observed the return of the ship in which his young friend edgar berrington had gone to india  at once he wrote the following letter    my dear mister edgarim in a fix here  its my opinion theres a   chance of savin a wreck if only good brains was set to work to do it   it would pay if we was to succeed  if you happen to be on the loose   just now as is likely run over an see what you think of ityours   to command    jb  our hero received the letter at once acted on it and in a few days was on the spot  what a change there is in you my dear sir said joe looking with admiration at the browned stalwart youth before him why youve grown moustaches  i couldnt help it joe replied edgar they would come and i had no time to shave on boardbut now tell me about this wreck  when edgar heard that the vessel belonged to mr hazlit his first impulse was to have nothing to do with it  he felt that any interference in regard to it would seem like a desire to thrust himself before the merchants noticeand that too in a needy manner as if he sought employment at his hands but on consideration he came to the conclusion that he might act as a wirepuller give baldwin the benefit of his knowledge and allow him to reap the credit and the emoluments but for a long time the honest diver would not listen to such a suggestion and was only constrained to give in at last when edgar threatened to leave him altogether  by the way have you seen miss aileen since you came home asked baldwin while the two friends were seated in the cabin of the divers vessel poring pencil in hand over several sheets of paper on which were sundry mysterious designs  no i was on the point of paying a visit to my good aunt miss pritty with ulterior ends in view when your letter reached me and brought me here  to say truth your note arrived very opportunely for i was engaged at the time in rather a hard struggle between inclination and dutynot feeling quite sure whether it was right or wise to throw myself in her way just now for as you may easily believe i have not during my comparatively short absence made a fortune that is at all likely to satisfy the requirements of her father  i suppose not returned the diver  no doubt at golddiggins an diamondfields an suchlike one does hear of a man makin a find that enables him to set up his carriage an four and ride mayhap at a tremendous pace straight on to ruin by means of it but as a rule people dont pick up sovereigns like stones either at home or abroad its the experience of most men that steady perseverance leads by the shortest road to competence if not to wealthbut thats beside the question  i think you did right mister eddyexcuse an old servant sir if its taking too much liberty to use the old familiar nameyou did right in coming here instead of going there  so thought i baldyyou see that i too can take libertieselse i should not have come  your letter solved the difficulty for when i was at the very height of the struggle before mentionedat equipoise so to speakand knew not whether to go to the right or to the left that decided me  i regarded it as a leading of providence  baldwin turned a rather sudden look of surprise on his young companion  a leading of providence mr eddy  i never heard you use such an expression before  true but i have learned to use it since i went to sea replied our hero quietly  thats strange rejoined the diver in a low voice as if he feared to scare the young man from a subject that was very near his own heart very strange for goin to sea has not often the effect of makin careless young fellows seriousthough it sometimes has no doubt  how was it if i  yes baldy interrupted edgar with a pleasant smile laying his hand on the divers huge shoulder i dont mind making a confidant of you in this as in other matters  ill tell youthe story is short enough when i parted from aileen she made me a present of a new testament from a pile that she happened to have by her to give to the poor people  to be more particular i asked for one and she consented to let me have it  you see i wanted a keepsake  well when at sea i read the testament regularly night and morning for aileens sake but god in his great love led me at last to read it for the sake of him whose blessed life and death it records  then youve fairly hauled down the enemys colours and hoisted those of the lord asked baldwin  i have been led to do so replied the youth modestly but firmly  bless the lord said the diver in a low tone as he grasped edgars hand while he bowed his head for a moment  presently he looked up and seemed about to resume the subject of conversation when edgar interrupted him  have you seen or heard anything of aileen since i left  nothing except that shes been somewhat out of sorts and her father has sent her up to london for a change  has he gone to london with her  no i believe not hes taken up a good deal wi the cargo o this ship and comes down to see us now and then but for the most part he remains at home attendin to business  have you spoken to him about raising the hull of the ship  not yet  he evidently thinks the thing impossiblebesides i wanted to hear your opinion on the matter before sayin anything about it  well come let us go into it at once said the youth turning to the sheets of paper before him and taking up a pencil  you see baldwin this trip of mine as second engineer has been of good service to me in many ways for besides becoming practically acquainted with everything connected with marine engines i have acquired considerable knowledge of things relating to ships in general and am all the more able to afford you some help in this matter of raising the ship  ive been studying a book written by a member of the firm whose dresses you patronise note the conquest of the sea by henry siebe which gives a thorough account in detail of everything connected with diving and in it there is reference to the various modes that have hitherto been successful in the raising of sunken vessels  ive heard of it but not seen it said baldwin  of course i know somewhat about raisin ships havin once or twice lent a hand but ive no head for engineerin  what are the various modes you speak of thats not one of em is it  he pointed with a grave smile as he spoke to the outline of a female head which edgar had been absently tracing on the paper  well no replied the youth scribbling out the head thats not one of siebe and gormans appliances and yet i venture to prophesy that that head will have a good deal to do with the raising of the seagull however dont lets waste more time  here you are  the first methodthat of putting empty casks in the hold so as to give the hull a floating tendency and then mooring lighters over it and pushing chains under itwe may dismiss at once as being suitable only for small vessels but the second method is worth considering namely that of fixing airbags of indiarubber in the hold attaching them to the sides and then inflating them all at the same time by means of a powerful airpump  we could get your divers to pass chains under her and when she began to rise could haul on these chains by means of lighters moored above and so move the wreck inshore till she grounded what say you to that  baldwin shook his head  shes too big i fear for such treatment  goodsized vessels have been raised by these airbags of late said edgar  let me see there were the brig ridesdale of 170 tons burthen sunk off calshot castle and her majestys gunbrig partridge 180 tons and the brig dauntless 179 tons and last but not least the prince consort at aberdeen an iron paddlesteamer of 607 tons and the dead weight lifted was 560 tons including engines and boilers  still baldwin shook his head remarking that the seagull was full 900 tons  well then resumed the young engineer here is still another method we might send down your men to make all the openingsports windows etceterawatertight fix a shield over the hole she knocked in her bottom on the cliffs and then by means of several waterpumps reaching from above the surface to the hold clear her of water  when sufficiently floated by such means a steamtug could haul her into port the iron steamship london was not long ago raised and saved at dundee in that way  she rose four feet after the pumps had been worked only two hours and while she was being towed into dock the pumps were still kept going  it was a great successand so may it be in this case  then you know we might construct a pontoon by making a raft to float on a multitude of empty barrels pass chains under the seagull and fix them to this pontoon at low water so that when the tide rose she would rise perforce along with the pontoon and tide and could be moved inshore till she grounded then waiting for low tide we could taughten the chains again and repeat the process till we got her ashore  or better still we could hire siebe and gormans patent pontoon which if i mistake not is much the same thing that i now suggest carried out to perfection  im not sure that the pontoon you speak of has been launched yet  im afraid its only in model said baldwin  mores the pity rejoined edgar but i can go to london and ascertain  in any case i shall have to go to london to make inquiries and secure the necessary apparatus  are you sure said baldwin with a look of great solemnity that your going to london has nothing whatever to do with apparatus of that sort  he placed a blunt forefinger as he spoke on the obliterated sketch of the female head  oh you suspicious old fellow replied edgar come you are presuming nowwe will change the subject and go on deck  human naturs the same everywhere observed baldwin with a quiet laugh as he rose  same with me exactly when i was after susan  for one glance of her black eye id have gone straight off to china or timbuctoo at halfanhours notice  well wellnow mister eddy dont you think it would be as well for you to go down and have a look at the wreck  youll then be better able to judge as to whats best to be done an ive got a noo dress by the firm of denayrouze with a speakinapparatus whichll fit you  i got it for myself and were much about a sizebarrin the waist in which i have the advantage of you as to girth  their noo pump and lamp too will interest you  see here is the pump  as he spoke the diver pointed to a pump which commended itself at first sight by its extreme simplicity  whether or not it was better than the more complex but welltried pumps of other makers our hero was well aware could only be proved by time and experience  meanwhile he was favourably impressed with it  the peculiarities of the pump referred to were first and most obvious that it had no outer wooden case or box and the parts were exceedingly few and simple  it was on the lever principle the cylinders instead of the pistons being movable  the pistons were fixed to a bedplate and pointed upwards so that the pump was as it were turned upside down a position which among other advantages allowed of the plungers being covered with water through which the air was forced and partially cooled  another and important peculiarity was an airreservoir which received air from the pump direct and then passed it on to the diver so that even if the pumps should stop working there would still be a supply of air flowing down to the diver for several minutes  the lamp referred to was also a novelty inasmuch as it was supplied with air by a separate tube from the reservoir in the same way as if it were a separate human diver  the henkie and davis lamp burns on the other hand entirely without air by means of certain acids  that of siebe and gorman is an electriclamp  both are said to be effective and economical  putting on the new dress our hero was soon ready to descend with the lamp burning in his hand  there are three men down just now said baldwin as he was about to screw on the mouthpiece two of em bein your old friends maxwell and rooney machowl  theyve been down about three hours and wont be up for an hour yet  see that you dont foul them in your wanderings below the other man jem hoggan hes well namedis the laziest chap i ever had to do with  i do believe he sometimes goes to sleep under water  is that possible asked edgar  possible  ay ive caught em takin a snooze before now  why ive known a man smoke under water  there was one of our fellows once got a comrade to let him keep his pipe in his mouth while he screwed on the frontglass you see he couldnt have put it in his mouth after that was fixed but he was well paid  for a time he smoked away well enough and the draught of air carried off the smoke through the escapevalve but an extra strong puff sent a spark out o the bowl which went straight into his eye  he spat out the pipe and nearly drove in the glasses in his useless efforts to get at his eye and then he tugged at the lines like fury and when we got him on deck he danced about like wildfire as if hed been shod with indyrubber instead of bein weighted with lead  we thought he had gone mad and held him fast till we got his helmet off  it cost him a month in hospital before that eye was cured  that being the case i wont smoke while below said edgar laughing screw away  the glass was fastened and our hero quickly disappeared under the sea    chapter six  a sunken wreck inspected sundry wonderful doings under water recorded and various plans successfully carried out  the vessel which edgar berrington had left his native element to inspect was a large barque  it had gone to the bottom only a few months after having been launched  the cargo being intended for the cape of good hope colony was of a miscellaneous character and some of it was of course ruined by water but much remained almost uninjured or only a little damaged  it was for the purpose of raising the latter portion of the cargo that baldwin and his men had been engaged by mr hazlit  hitherto the divers had been extremely successful  with the usual appliances of slings chains shears and windlasses etcetera they had already recovered a large quantity of goods and were still busy in the hold when edgar went down  as we have said the wreck lay in comparatively deep waterabout ten fathoms  the ladder which descended from the side of the divers vessel was not two fathoms in length so that after reaching the lowest round edgar had to continue his descent by slipping down the rope which hung from the ladder and was weighted at the bottom with a stone  on reaching the ground he knelt set down the lamp and attached his guideline to the stone  while thus engaged he looked with much interest at his little lamp which burned as brightly and steadily down in the depths of ocean as if on land while from its chimney the air which gave it life rose upwards in a constant stream of bubbles  the water being dense and very dark its light did not penetrate far but close to the bullseye it was sufficiently strong to enable our hero to see what he was about  having fixed the line he was about to move in the direction of the wreck when he received one pull on his lifeline replying to it with one pullall righthe was again about to move when a strange unearthly sound filled his ears and he smiled to think that in his interest about the lamp and fastening his guideline he had totally forgotten the speaking apparatus connected with his helmet  how dee git on down there inquired the voice which sounded strangely mysterious not to say unpleasant in his confined metal headpiece  splendidly he replied not applying his mouth to any orifice in his helmetfor there was no opening into the speakingtubebut simply giving utterance to the word in his usual manner  ive just fixed my line and am going to move on  go ahead and luck go with ee was the prompt reply from joe baldwin  we have said that there was no opening into the helmet in connection with the speaking apparatus such not being necessary  it was quite sufficient that the speakingtube was fastened to the outside of the helmet just over a sort of cavity formed inside by means of what we may style an interior patch of metal  the sound passed through the headpiece and up the tubeor vice versaand thus even though the tube should get broken and filled with water no evil result could follow to the diver  suddenly berrington was again arrested  hallo shouted baldwin  hallo  well was sent up in reply and the voice that came from below came out at the mouthpiece above so soft and faint and farfarawaylike that it seemed to joe to belong to another world and had to be listened to attentively to be understood  dyou think you could read by the light of your lamp  yes im sure i could  look out then im sending you down a copy o the times  the youth looked up and now perceived the advantage of the fourth hole or window just over the forehead which is peculiar to the denayrouze helmet most others having only three openings  he could look up by merely raising his eyes whereas with the other helmets it is necessary to bend well back in order to get the frontglass to face upwards  afterwards he found that there were some who objected to this glass on the ground that as divers when below and in total or partial darkness are constantly butting their heads against beams and other portions of wrecks the upper glass would be in frequent danger of being broken but to this it was replied that it might be well guarded by powerful crossbars  the point we believe is still an open question at all events the upper glass was found useful on the occasion to which we refer for looking up through it our amateur diver saw a stone coming down to him  it was lowered by a piece of twine and tied to it was an old times newspaper  detaching and unfolding it berrington set his lamp on the sand and seating himself beside it found that he could read with perfect ease  intimating the fact to his friend above he returned the paper and began his explorations  he had been lowered close beside the stern of the wreck that he might be as far as possible from the divers who were at work in the hold and had taken only half a dozen steps in the direction of it when its vast bulk appeared above him looming through the dark water like a darker cloud  for some time he went carefully round it minutely examining the rudder and sternpost and the parts connected therewith all of which he found to be uninjured  then passing along the starboard side he proceeded in his inspection until he reached a point which he judged to be nearly amidships  glancing upwards he thought he could see the lifelines and airpipes of the other divers  to make sure he signalled for more air  this he did by means of the airpipetwo pullsinstead of using the speakingtube because the airpipe and lifeline are never for a single instant let go or neglected by the attendants above whereas the speakingtube on that occasion was merely tried for the first time by these divers as an experiment  immediately the puffing at the airhole showed that the men at the pumps were on the alert  edgar now closed his frontvalve so that no air at all was suffered to escape through it the dress began to inflate and in a few seconds was swelled out pretty tightly  up to that period he had felt no further inconvenience than a slight pressure on the drums of his ears which was relieved by the usual method of swallowing the saliva which action has the effect of opening a small and not easily opened internal orifice or passage to the drum and thus by admitting the condensed air to the interior of the ear enables it to resist the pressure on the outside  each inspiration of air has the same effect on the lungs and the pressure inside and outside being at once equalised is in their case unfelt although it remains and tests the strength of the animal tissues  hence it is a recognised rule that a man who has at any time spat blood is unsuited to a divers work as his weak bloodvessels are apt to burst  but now under the increased pressure our hero felt his ears affected considerably and other disagreeable sensations came onsuch as singing in the head etcetera nevertheless confident in his strength he persevered  presently the amount of air in his dress more than counterbalanced the weight of lead about himgreat though it wasand he began to rise like a corkslowly  in a few seconds his head was close to the lines and airpipes which he observed passing over the bulwarks of the wreck and down into the hold  afraid lest he should get entangled in them he caught hold of the end of a piece of iron which projected near him and checked his upward rise  at the same time he opened his valves the air rushed out and he immediately descended  on reaching the bottom he regulated the valves so as to give himself just enough of air to permit of his keeping the ground and moving about as before  he had observed while up that one set of lines diverged away from the wreck but this did not strike him at the time as being noteworthy after a few minutes he signalled his friends above and shouted by means of the speakingtube  pay out the airpipe and lifelines and give me free play  this being done he could pass under the lines of the other divers and examined the wreck as far as the bow where he found an immense hole partially filled by a mass of the rock which had originally driven it in  this of itself was sufficient to have sunk the vessel  in order to examine the port side of the wreck he returned towards the stern and signalled for more air  as before he rose to the bulwarks over which he passed by a slight effort and opening the valves dropt gently like a bird upon the deck  walking across it slowly and with some difficulty owing to the broken spars and cordage with which it was encumbered he passed over the port bulwarks and lowered himself again to the bottom  a careful examination showed him that no injury worth mentioning had been sustained on that side and he finally came to the conclusion that the large hole in the starboard bow was the only serious damage done to the hull  to make sure of this he returned to it and satisfied himself as to its exact nature and extent  while thus engaged his attention was again directed to the diverging line and airpipe before referred to following these up he came to a mass of rocks in a snug corner of which he found a diver fast asleep  at first he could scarcely believe his eyes but when he cautiously held the lantern close to the mans frontglass all doubt was removed for not only were the eyes of the sleeper tightly closed but the opening and shutting of his nostrils coupled with certain regular motions about the lips gave unquestionable evidence that the man was snoring vigorously although of course no sound passed the metal covering that hermetically sealed his head  while edgar gazed at the slumberer around whose form a number of small fish were prying inquiringly he observed that his lifeline received a jerk and came to the correct conclusion that the attendants above alarmed at the absence of motion in the divers lifeline and airpipe had signalled to know if all was right  of course he expected that the sleeper would give no reply and would according to rule in such cases be hauled up without delay  what then was his astonishment to see the man slowly lay hold of his lifeline with his left hand give it a single tug to indicate that all was right and then settle himself more comfortably to continue his submarine slumbers  our hero gave vent to an uncontrollable burst of laughter which however resounded so horribly in his ears that he checked it suddenly and began to consider what he should do in order to punish the idler  remembering to have heard it said that divers might communicate with each other with their voices by bringing their helmets into contact so that the sound should vibrate through both he resolved to test this and try an effect  hooking the lantern to his belt behind in such a way that its light was concealed he kneeled down beside the diverwho he had no doubt was the jem hogg mentioned to him by baldwinand rested his helmet on the rock in such a way that the side of it was brought into contact with the back of jems headpiece  no sooner did it touch than the snoring became audible  feeling assured therefore of success our hero drew in a long breath and gave vent to a redindian yell that rendered himself completely deaf  its effect on the sleeper was electric  edgar could just hear the beginning of a responsive yell of terror when jems springing up separated the helmets and produced silence  at first the scared man stood up and stared right before him in a state of wild amazement while edgar took care to stand directly behind him out of sight  a man in a divingdress cannot turn his head round so as to look over his shoulder  when he wishes to see behind him he must needs turn round  seeing nothing in front to account for the alarming sound jem began to turn but edgar knew that this motion would have the effect of twisting their lines and pipes together  he therefore seized jem suddenly round the chest and being a much larger and stronger man held him like a vice in the grasp of his left arm while he pommelled him heartily with his right all over the back and ribs  at the same time he punished him considerably with his knees and then a sudden fancy striking him he placed his helmet against that of jem and began to laugh howl and yell like a maniac the laughter being rendered very real and particularly effective owing to the shrieks of terror which he then heard issuing from the horrified diver  not content with this he seized his lantern and passed it smartly in front of his victims frontglass in the hope that the unwonted and unaccountable glare might add to his consternation  that he had not failed in his intention was made plain by the shock which he immediately felt thrilling jems frame from head to foot  strong though he was however our hero was not powerful enough to prevent the struggle from agitating the airpipes and lines to such an extent that those in charge above became alarmed and signalled down to jem to know if all was right  edgar observed the jerk and felt the diver make a violent effort to disengage one hand with the intention no doubt of replying he therefore held him all the tighter and seizing the line replied for himall right  at the same moment his own line received one jerk to which he quickly replied in the same manner and then resumed his belabouring which being delivered under water required to be done vigorously in order to have any satisfactory effect  while thus engaged and during a momentary pause in his howlings he heard a faint voice come down his speakingtube and instantly removed his head from jims in order to prevent the latter hearing it  what on earth are you about down there  never mind all right attend to signals answered edgar sharply then being pretty well fatigued with his exertions he suddenly gave four pulls at jems line with such goodwill as almost to haul the attendant at the other end into the sea  at the same instant he relaxed his grip and jem hogg shot upwards like a submarine rocket  while this struggle was going on at the bottom the attendants above were as we have said greatly perplexed and it is certain that they would have hauled both divers up but for the reassuring signals of young berrington  i say bill remarked one of the couple who held jem hoggs lines jem seems to be doin somethin uncommon queerhes either got hold of a congereel by the tail or hes amoosin himself by dancin a hornpipe  why boys answered bill who was one of the attendants on edgar i do believe mr berrington has got hold o somethin o the same sort see here his line is quiverin as if a grampus was nibblin at the end of it  hadnt we better haul im up sir  he addressed joe baldwin who chanced to come on deck at the moment  haul im upno why  why sir just look at the lines an pipes  have you signalled down asked joe  yes sir an hes answered all right  sos jem sir signalled the same said one of the latters attendants  baldwin looked anxiously at the lines and went quickly to the speakingtube to which he applied his ear  a look of surprise mingled with the anxiety as he put his lips to the tube  it was at this moment that he sent down the message before referred to and received edgars prompt reply  all right said baldwin turning gravely to his men while a little gleam of intelligence and humour twinkled in his grey eyes  when a man signals all right he must be all right you know  let em alone but stand by and mind your signals  he had scarcely finished speaking when the man at jems lifeline gave a shout and held on as if to an angry shark  hallo  hi  haul in  lend a hand  he said no more and did not require to for willing hands came to the rescue  in a few seconds poor jem hogg was hauled inboard and tumbled on the deck where he lay rolling about for some time and kicking as if in a fit  hold him fast bill  off with his mouthpiece cried baldwin kneeling on the writhing diver why whats wrong jem  wrong gasped jem as soon as his glass was off wrong  heyhaul me up  hi  these exclamations terminated in a fearful yell and it was plain that jem was about to relapse into hysterics or a fit when baldwin lifting him in his arms planted him sittingwise and with some violence on a seat  come none o that he said sternly  off with his helmet bill  if you dont quiet yourself ill chuck you overboarddee hear  somewhat reassured by this remark and having his helmet and weights removed jem hogg looked about him with bloodshot eyes and a countenance that was almost seagreen with terror  theres nothin bust about your dress said baldwin examining it nor broken about the helmet  what on earths wrong with you  wrong shouted jem again while a horrible grin distorted his unhandsome visage wrong  hey  oh  ive seenseen theho  another relapse seemed imminent but baldwin held up a warning finger which restored him and then the poor man went on by slow degrees and with many gasping interruptions to tell how when busily engaged at work in the hold of the wreck he had been suddenly seized by a zanthripologus or some such hideous creature with only one eye like a glaring carbuncle in its stomach and dragged right out o the hold overboard taken to the bottom and there bashed and battered among the rocks until all his bones were smashed squeezed by the monsters tentaclessixteen feet long at the very leastuntil all his ribs were broke and his heart nigh forced out of his mouth and finally pitched right up to the surface with one tremendous swing of its mighty tail  all this and a great deal more was related by the unfortunate diver while having his dress removed his volubility increasing as his fears were allayed but he was not fairly restored to his wonted state of mind until he had swallowed a stiff glass of grog and been put into his hammock where in his sleep he was heard to protest with great fervour that he wouldnt go under water again for any sum short of ten hundred thousand million pounds  meanwhile our amateur diver continued his inspection of the wreck returning to the deck he went down into the hold  the idea occurred to him that the other divers might also be indulging in a siesta  he therefore left his lamp on the deck behind him  the hold was very dark and at first he could see nothing  as he could hear nothing he fancied that the men could not be there but he was somewhat rudely corrected in this error by receiving a severe blow on the helmet from a large box which having just been attached to the slings was being hauled up by the men at the windlass overhead  the blow knocked him off a beam on which he stood and he fell on the cargo below fortunately however without evil result owing to the medium in which he halffloated  presently his eyes became accustomed to the faint light that penetrated from above and he saw an indistinct figure moving slowly towards him with a sprawling motion  as it drew near the huge head and distended form proved it to be a diver  he was guiding the box above mentioned and had let it slip when it came so violently against edgars helmet  not wishing to be recognised at first our amateur drew back into a darker spot and watched  the diver bent his head close to the slings apparently to see that all was secure and gave a signal with his line on which the box moved slowly up  a few minutes later it was deposited on the deck of the vessel overhead and added to the heap of goods which had previously been recovered from the deep  the diver sprawled slowly back into darkness again  as he disappeared a similar figure became faintly visible guiding another box of goods the box was sent up as before and now edgar was convinced that rooney machowl and his comrade david maxwellunlike their sleepyheaded companionwere busy at work  thousands of pounds worth of property is saved in this manner by divers every yearnot only on the coasts of england but all over the world whereever human enterprise and commerce have touched or costly ships gone down  as we have said a large portion of the cargo of the seagull had already been recovered  during the process a healthy spirit of emulation had arisen among the men as to which of them should send up most of the sunken property  rooney and maxwell were confessedly the best divers among them but the rivalry between these two had degenerated on the part of maxwell into a spirit of jealousy  under the influence of this even rooneys goodnature had to some extent given way and frequent disputes and semiquarrels were the result  but these quarrels were always made up and the two were soon as good friends as ever  at this time however while edgar berrington stood watching them these two men seemed to have found an apple of discord of unusual sizeto judge from the energetic display of feeling which it occasioned  edgar never ascertained what the bale in dispute contained but he saw them appear rather suddenly and simultaneously dragging it between them the violent gesticulations of the two showed that their spirits were greatly roused both having evidently resolved to claim and keep possession of the bale  at last one of them struck the other a severe blow on the chest which though it did not hurt him caused him to stumble and fall  from his smaller size edgar judged the striker to be rooney  before the other could recover he had fastened his slings to the bale and given the signal to hoistintending to go up with it but maxwell caught him by the legs and attempted to drag him off whereupon rooney kicked as hard as his suspended position would admit of and in his struggles kicked in one of the glasses of his comrades helmet  the water instantly began to rush in and he would certainly have been suffocated had he not signalled quickly and been hauled up to the surface without delay  at the same time rooney machowl signalled to be hauled up in haste and appeared on deck of the attendant vessel in dreadful anxiety as to the consequence of his violent conduct under water  but maxwell was not seriously injured  he had indeed been halfsuffocated and had to be invalided for a few days but soon he and rooney were at work again as goodor if you will as badfriends as ever  after this incident edgar received a pull on his lifeline to which he replied all right  immediately after and while he was in the act of rising from the hold of the wreck by the process of retaining his air until it floated him he heard baldwins voice saying  youve kicked up a pretty shindy among my men mister edgar since you went under  dont you think youd better come up  yes im coming directly he replied  theres a letter here for youjust brought off by a boat  all right send me more air  while this order was being obeyed edgar made his way to the ladderline being guided thereto by his guideline and then shutting his valves he quickly inflated his dress which soon floated him so that he used the rope depending from the ladder merely to guide him upwards  as he ascended the light became gradually stronger the pressure of water also decreased obliging him to open his valves and let out air which was becoming superabundant  at last he emerged from the sea was assisted over the side and two men began to divest him of his dress  while thus occupied he read his letter  it was from the owners of the steamer in which he had made his recent voyage  not being aware of his distance from london they merely asked him to call as they wished to talk with him on a matter of importance  i wish they had mentioned what the matter was said edgar with a troubled look as he and baldwin descended to the cabin  it may be important enough to justify my returning to london at once and yet may not be worth more than a walk of half a mile  true mister edgar said baldwin  however as you say youve examined the hull well and feel sure it can be raised theres no reason why you shouldnt go see about the apparatus required and so kill two birds with one stone  meanwhile ill write to mr hazlit recommending him to try to raise the wreck and hes pretty sure to take my advice  in accordance with this plan edgar returned to london  we will not however trace his future steps in regard to the seagull  it is sufficient to say that his advice was acted on  the divers tightly closed the hole in the bow of the wreck they also stopped up every other orifice in her and then pumped her out until at last she floated was towed into dock and finally repaired  thus were several thousands of pounds saved to mr hazlit and not only to him but to the world for a lost shipunlike a dropt purseis a total loss to the human race    chapter seven  historical but not heavy  there can be no question of the fact that authentic history sends its roots into the subsoil of fabulous antiquity  in turning to the records of submarine exploration we are staggered on the very threshold of the question with obvious absurdity  we are depressed  we seek to dive into our subject but find it too deep for us  if we were to put on the latest patent improved divingdress with all its accompaniments of doubleextra pumps pipes powers and purchases and descend to a depth of antiquity that would suffice to collapse a whale we should find nothing but idiotic speculation in the midst of chaotic darkness  in this chapter we shall give a mere outline and even that somewhat disjointed of the subject of diving  we feel tempted to pass by the fabulous period altogether but fear lest in our effort to eschew the false we do damage to the true  perhaps therefore it were well to walk humbly in the beaten path of our forefathers and begin at the beginning  it is not certain whether adam was a diver  there is reason to believe that he wore no dress of any kind at first so that if he dived at all he must have used his natural powers alone  these powers we learn from the best authorities are barely sufficient to enable a man to stay under water for two minutes at the furthest  experience corroborates these best authorities  it has been asserted that pearldivers can sometimes stay under water as long as three four and even five minutes but we dont believe the assertion  if the reader does we have no hesitation in pronouncing himor hercredulous  to return to adam  we have no doubt whatever that heperhaps eve alsocould dive  it is possible though not probable that they guddled small trout in the streams of paradise and dived for the big ones in the deeper pools  we may be wrong in supposing that they did but he would certainly be bold who should assert that they did not unfortunately neither adam nor eve used the pen therefore we have no authentic records as to the art of diving at that period of the worlds history  the first writer who makes reference to diving is homer who is supposed to have lived somewhere about a thousand years before the christian era and he refers to it not as a novelty but in an offhand way that proves it to have been at that time a wellknown art practised for the purpose of obtaining oysters  then we find aeschylus comparing mental vision to the strong natural eye of the deep diver  but thucydides speaks more definitely of divers having been employed at the siege of syracuse to cut down barriers which had been constructed below water to damage the grecian vessels while attempting to enter the harbour and generally to go under and injure the enemys ships  all this inclines us to think they must at that time have learned to supplement their natural powers with artificial  livy mentions the fact that the ancients employed divers for the purpose of recovering property from the sea  the rhodians had a law fixing the share of the recovered treasure which was due to the divers who saved it  according to this law the remuneration was in proportion to the depth from which it was brought up and the risk incurred  but as these divers considered four fathoms or thereabouts an extreme and dangerous depth it is probable that they did their work in the natural way without the aid of apparatus  for the benefit of the credulous we may mention several statements which have been more or less received  the dutch were once celebrated divers and it is reported that some of them have remained under water more than an hour  from this report some have argued that these dutchmen must have possessed artificial means of maintaining life below water  to this we reply if that were so is it likely that the reporter who made reference to the length of time spent below water was ignorant as to the meansif anyby which this apparent miracle was accomplished  and if he was not ignorant would he have passed over such means in silence the idea is absurd  the probability is rather that the reporter had been gulled or was fond of drawing the long bow  again mention is made by one mersennius of a man who could remain six hours under water  if mersennius were in a position to become acquainted with that divers powers how comes it that he failed to become acquainted with his apparatus  simply because there was no such apparatus and the whole affair is a fable  but the most remarkable of these stories is recorded by a certain father kircher who might appropriately be styled a father of lies  here is his fabrication  in the time of frederick of sicily there lived a man named nicolo pescenicholas the fish  this mans powers seem to have been decidedly superhuman  he was evidently an amphibious animal  he appears to have acted the part of oceanpostman in these old times for it is related of him that he used to carry letters for the king far and wide about the mediterranean  on one occasion a vessel found him out of sight of land in the discharge of oceanpostal dutybearing despatches of the king from sicily to calabria  they took him on board and had a chat with him  it is not said that they smoked a friendly pipe with him or gave him a glass of grog but we think it probable that they did after a little rest and refreshment nicholas the fish bade them goodbye jumped overboard and continued his voyage  the end of this poor man was very sad  the king being seized with an insane desire to know something about the depths of the terrible gulf of charybdis offered nicholas a golden cup if he would dive down and explore them he dived accordingly remained below nearly an hour and brought back a glowing account of the wonders and horrors of the seething whirlpool the king far from being satisfied became more than ever desirous of knowledge  he asked nicholas to dive again and tempted him with the offer of another and larger cup as well as a purse of gold  the poor fish after some hesitation again dived into the gulf and was never more heard of  we dont wonder at it  the greatest wonder is that nicolo pesce ever obtained a place in the encyclopaedias of the world  from the fact however that he has been thus rescued from oblivion we conclude that although much that is said of him is false the man himself was not a myth but a fact that he was a man of the captain webb type who possessed extraordinary powers of swimming perhaps of diving to the extent it may be of nearly three minutes and that he possibly lost his life by rashly venturing into the vortex of some dangerous whirlpool  that he did not use diving apparatus of any kind is clear from the fact that nothing is said about such apparatus which had it really existed would have claimed as much attention and caused as much talk as did the man himself  the earliest authentic records we have of the use of diving apparatus belong to the beginning of the sixteenth century  in an edition of vegetius on the art of war published in 1511 there is an engraving of a diver walking in the sea with a cap over his head and shoulders from which a flexible tube rises to the surface  this was no doubt the embryo of our divingdress  john taisner in 1538 says that he saw two greeks at toledo in spain make experiments with diving apparatus in presence of the emperor charles the fifth and ten thousand spectators  gaspar schott of numberg in 1664 refers to this greek machine as an aquatic kettle but mentions as preferable in his estimation a species of aquatic armour which enabled those who wore it to walk under water  the aquatic kettle was doubtless the embryo of the divingbell  from that time onward inventive minds have been turned with more or less success towards the subject of submarine operations and many are the contrivancesclever queer absurd and usefulwhich have been the outcome  not content with kettles and bells by means of which they could descend into the deep and remain there for an hour or more at a time and with armour and dresses with which they could walk about at the bottom of the sea men have constructed several submarine boats and machines in which shut up like jonah in the whale they purposed to move about from place to place sink to the bottom and rise to the surface at will or go under the bottoms of enemys ships and fix torpedoes wherewith to blow them up and otherwise do them damage these latter machines have not attained to any noteworthy degree of successat least they have not yet done either much good or much harm to the human race but the formerthe kettles and the armourin other words the divingbells and dresseshave attained to a high degree of perfection and efficiency and have done incalculable good service  the divingbell was so styled owing to the first machines being made in the shape of a gigantic bell  an inverted wineglass thrust mouth downwards into water will not fill with water owing to the air which it contains keeping the water out  it will partially fill however because air is compressible and the deeper down it is thrust the more will the air be compressed  at a depth of thirtythree feet the air will be compressed to half its bulkin other words the glass will be halffull of water  it is clear that a fly or any small insect could live in the air thus confined although thrust to great depths under water  but it could not live long because air becomes unfit for use after being breathed a certain time and cannot sustain life  hence if we are to preserve the life of our fly we must send fresh air down to it  the first divingbells were made so large that the air contained in them sufficed for a considerable periodan hour or more  when this air had lost its lifesustaining qualities the bell had to be drawn up and the air renewed  this was so inconvenient that ingenious men soon hit on various plans to renew the air without raising the bells  one plan that of dr halley was to send air down in tight casks which were emptied into the bell and then sent up full of water for a fresh supply of air while the foul air was let out of the bell by a valve in the top  another plan was to have tubes from the bell to the surface by which air was made to circulate downwards at first being forced down by a pair of bellows and afterwards by means of airpumps  round the inside of the bell ran a seat for the divers  one or more holes fitted with thick plateglass gave them light and enabled them to use the various tools and implements required in their vocation  from some of these bells a man could be sent out when at or near the bottom having on a watertight headpiece connected by a tube with the air inside the bell  he could thus move about with more freedom than his comrades inside but of course could not travel further than the length of his tube while being wet he could not endure the cold for any great length of time  as time went on the form of the bell was improved until that of a square or oblong box of iron came to be generally adopted  the bell now in use is that which was made in 1788 by the celebrated engineer smeaton who applied the air forcingpump to it and otherwise brought the machine to a high degree of perfection  he used it with great advantage in the works at ramsgate harbour and smeatons divingbell improved by rennie has continued in constant and general use on all submarine works until a very recent period  it has now been almost entirely supersededexcept in the case of some special kinds of workby the divingdressthe value and the use of which it is the province of our tale to illustrate and expound  in regard to the divingdress we may say that it has grown out of the aquatic armour of the olden time but no great advance in its improvement was made until the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the present centuries when the names of rowe halley spalding bushwell and colt appear in connection with various clever contrivances to facilitate diving operations  benjamin martin a london optician made a dress of strong leather in 1778 which fitted his arms and legs as well as his trunk and held half a hogshead of air  with this he could enter the hold of a sunk vessel and he is said to have been very successful in the use of it  mr kleingert of breslau in 1798 designed a dress somewhat like the above part of which however was made of tinplate  the divingdress was greatly improved by mr deane and in the recovery of guns etcetera from the wreck of the royal george in 1834 to 1836 as well as in many other operations this dressmuch improved and made by mr siebe under deanes directionsdid signal service  it has now been brought to a high state of perfection by the wellknown submarine engineers siebe and gorman heinke and davis and others of london and denayrouze of paris  it encases the diver completely from head to foot is perfectly watertight and is made of thick sheet indiarubber covered on both sides with tanned twillthe helmet and breastplate being metal  for further information on this subject we refer the inquisitive reader to the encyclopaedia britannica to the descriptive pamphlets of the submarine engineers above named and to an admirable little book styled the conquest of the sea by henry siebe which contains a full and graphic account in detail of almost everything connected with diving and submarine engineering  see note 1    note 1  it may interest practical spirits to know that they can see the divingdress and apparatus in operation by going to number 17 mason street westminster bridge road london where messrs siebe and gorman have erected a large tank for the purpose of illustrating their apparatus  at the alexandra palace also messrs denayrouze and company have a tank for the same purpose    chapter eight  the grinding of the screw  it is proverbial that incidents in themselves trivial frequently form the hinges on which great events turn  when edgar berrington went to london he learned that the owners of the fine oceansteamer the warrior wished him to become their chief engineer for that voyage the previous chief having been suddenly taken ill and obliged to leave them although flattered by the proposal and the terms in which it was made edgar declined it for having acquired all the knowledge he desired about marine engines during the voyage out and home he did not wish to waste more time at sea  the owner however being aware of his worth was not to be put off with a first refusal  he took edgar into his private room and reasoned with him  come now mr berrington consider my proposal again  youll go wont you  impossible replied edgar  you are very kind and i assure you that i fully appreciate your offer but  he was interrupted by a clerk who entered at the moment and spoke a few words in an under tone to the owner  excuse me one minute mr berrington said the latter rising quickly i shall return immediately  there is a newspaper to looknowhere is it  ah  no matter here is a list of the passengers going out to china in the warrior  it may amuse you  perhaps you may find a friend amongst them  left alone edgar ran his eye carelessly over the namesthinking the while of the disagreeables of another long seavoyage and strengthening his resolves not to be tempted to go  now the careless glance at this passengerlist was the apparently trifling incident on which hinged the whole of our heros future career his careless glance became suddenly fixed and attentive his eyebrows lifted to their utmost elevation and his face flushed crimson for there he beheld the names of charles hazlit esquire and his daughter miss aileen hazlit  just at that moment the owner of the warrior returned  this owner was an intelligent shrewd manquick to observe  he noted the flush on edgars countenance and edgar immediately blew his nose with violence to account for the flush  well now mr berrington what say you he resumed  poor edgar knew not what to say  a reply had to be given at once  he had no time to think  aileen going to china  an offer of a situation in the same vessel  well sir said our hero with sudden decision i will go  of course the owner expressed himself well pleased and then there followed a deal of nauticoscientific talk after which edgar ventured to say  i observe the name of mr charles hazlit on your list  he is an acquaintance of mine  do you happen to know what takes him so far from home  cant say exactly replied the other  i think some one told me his affairs in china require looking after and his daughters health necessitates a long seavoyage  health exclaimed edgar striving to look and speak in a comparatively indifferent manner  she was quite well when i saw her last  very likely said the owner with a smile but it does not take long to make a young lady illespecially when her heart is touched  some sort of rumour floats in my mind to the effect that miss hazlit is going out to china to be married or requires to go out because she doesnt want to be marriedi forget which  but it comes pretty much to the same thing in the end  hah said edgar shortly  if he had said oh in tones of agony it would have been more truly expressive of his feelings  the moment he got out of the office and felt the cool air of the street he repented of his decision and pronounced himself to be a consummate donkey  there thought he ive made a fool of myself  ive engaged for a long voyage in a capacity which precludes the possibility of my associating with the passengers for not only must nearly all my waking hours be spent down beside the engine but when i come up to cool myself i must perforce do so in dirty costume with oily hands and face quite in an unfit state to be seen by aileen and without the slightest right to take any notice of her  oh  donkeygoose that you are eddy  but youve done it now and cant undo it therefore you must go through with it  thinking of himself in this lowly strain he went home to the solitude of his lodging sat down before his teatable thrust both hands into his pockets and in a by no means unhappy frame of mind brooded over his trials and sorrows  let us change the scene now  we are out upon the seain a floating palace  and oh how that palace rushes onward ever onward without rest without check night and day cleaving its way irresistibly through the mighty deep  mighty  ah how mighty no one on board can tell so well as that thin gentle evidently dying youth who leans over the stern watching the screws and the wake that seems to rush behind marking off as it were mile by mile the vast and everincreasing spacenever to be retraversed he knows full wellthat separates him from home and all that is dear to him on earth  the palace is made of ironhard unyielding unbeautiful uncompromising ironbut her cushions are soft her gilding is gorgeous her fittings are elegant her food is sumptuous her society at least much of itis refined  of course representatives of the unrefined are also therein the aftercabin toojust as there are specimens of the refined in the forecabin  but taking them all in all they are a remarkably harmonious band the inhabitants of this iron palace from the captain to the cabinboy inclusive  the latter is a sprightly imp the former isto use the expression of one of the unrefineda brick  he is not tallfew seacaptains seem to be so but he is very broad and manly and as strong as an elephant  he is a pattern captain  gallant to the lady passengers chatty with the gentlemen polite to the unrefined sedately grave among the officers and crew and jocular to the children in short he is all things to all menand much of the harmony on board is due to his unconscious influence  he has a handsome face glittering black eyes an aquiline nose that commands respect and a black beard and moustache that covered a firm mouth and chin  grinding is one of the prominent ideas that are suggested on board the iron palace  there are many other ideas no doubt  among seventy or eighty educated and intelligent human beings of both sexes and all ages it could not be otherwise  we allude however to the boatnot to the passengers  the screw grinds and the engine grinds incessantly  when one thinks of a thing or things going round and round or up and down regularly uninterruptedly vigorously doggedly obstinately hour after hour one is impressed to say the least and when one thinks of the said thing or things going on thus night and day without rest one is solemnised but when one meditates on these motions being continued for many weeks together one has a tendency to feel mentally overwhelmed  the great crank that grinds the screw and is itself ground by the pistonnot to mention the cylinder and boilerworks in a dark place deep down in the engineroom like a giant hand constantly engaged on deeds of violence and evil  here edgar berrington clothed in white canvas and oil finds genial companionship  he dotes on the great crank  it is a sympathetic thing it represents his feelings wonderfully  returning from the deck after inhaling a little fresh air he leans against the iron bulkhead in these clanking depths and gazes gloomily and for prolonged periods at the crank while it grinds with a sort of vicious energy that seems in strange harmony with his soul  sometimes he grinds his teeth as a sort of obbligato accompanimentespecially if he has while on deck during a wistful gaze at the distant perspective of the aftregions beheld or fancied he has beheld a familiar and adored form  at first the passengers were sickvery sick most of theminsomuch that there were some who would gladly if possible have surrendered their lives with their dinners but by degrees they began to improve and to regard meals with anticipation instead of loathing  when the sunny and calm latitudes near the line were reached every one grew well and hearty and at last there was not a sad soul on board except the poor sick lad who studied the screw and measured the everincreasing distance from home  one of the first evidences of the return of health was the sound of song  when the nights were clear and calm and naught was audible save the grinding of the screw the passengers crystallised naturally into groups in the same way that iceparticles arrange themselves in sympathetic stars and from several such constellations the music of the spheres was naturally evolved  one of these crystals was formed usually in a tent on deck by the attractive influence of smoke  it was consequently not a bright crystal and included particles both refined and otherwise  its music was gruff for the most part sometimes growly  there was another crystal which varied its position occasionallyaccording to the position of the moon for it was a crystal formed of romantic elements one of its parts was a scottish maiden whose voice was melodious flexible and very sweet  her face and spirit had been made to match she had many admirers and a bosomfriend of kindly heart and aspect with wealth of golden hair in some respects like herself  our heroine aileen being passionately fond of music and herself a sweet singer attached herself to this crystal and became as it were another bosomfriend  two bearded men were also much given to seek attachment to this crystal they also seemed knit to each other in bosomfriendshipif we may venture to use such a term with reference to bearded men  one was amateurly musical the other powerfully sympathetic  a pastor of unusually stalwart proportions with a gentle pretty wife and lovable family also had a decided leaning to this crystal  one evening the group finding its favourite part of the deck occupied was driven to a position near the tent of the smoky crystal and sitting down not far from the engineers quarters began to indulge in song  grave and gay alternated  duets followed trios ensued and miscellaneous new forms of harmony sometimes intervened  do sing a solo miss hazlit said the scottish maiden  i like your voice so much and want to hear it alone  will you sing  aileen had an obliging spirit  she at once began in a low contralto voice i cannot sing the old songs  sometimes in private life one hears a voice so sweet so thrilling with a something so powerful in it that one feels amid other sensations of pleasure great satisfaction to think that none of the public singers in the world could bat that if they were to try their best and that few of them could equal it  such a voice was that of our heroine  it drew towards her the soul body and spirit of the musiclovers who listened  of course we do not deny that there were some who could not be drawn thus  there were a few among the smoky crystals for whom a draw of the pipe or a mildly drawn pot of bitter beer had greater charms than sweet sounds however melting  with the exceptions of these nearly all who chanced to be within hearing drew near to the musical group and listened while that most beautiful of songs was being warbled in tones not loud but inexpressibly pathetic  among the listeners was our friend edgar berrington  seated as usual in front of the great crank with bare muscular arms folded on his broad chest and a dark frown on his forehead he riveted his eyes on the crank as if it were the author of all his anxieties  suddenly the terminating lines i cannot sing the old songs they are too dear to me rising above the din of machinery floated gently down through iron latticework beams rods cranks and bars and smote upon his ear  like a galvanised man he sprang on his legs and stood erect  then if we may say so like a human rocket he shot upwards and stood on the margin of the crowd  being head and shoulders over most of them he observed a clear space beside the singer  the night was dark features could not be discerned even forms were not easily recognisable  he glided into the open space and silently but promptly sat down on the deck beside aileen  his elbow even touched one of the folds of her garment  he went straight into paradise and remained there  as for aileen if she observed the action at all she probably set it down to the enthusiasm of a more than usually musical member of the ships crew  while she was still dwelling on the last note a grinding sound was heard and a slight tremor felt that not only stopped the song abruptly but checked the applause that was ready to burst from every lip and hand  edgar vanished from the spot where he sat quite as quickly as he had appeared and in a moment was at his station  the captains voice was heard on the bridge  the signal was given to stop the enginesto back themto stop again  eager inquiries followedwhats that  did you feel it  hear it  could it be a rock  impossible surely  no one could answer with knowledge or authority save those who were too busy to be spoken to  accustomed as they all were for many weeks past to the ceaseless motion of the engines the sudden stoppage had a strange and solemnising effect on most of the passengers  presently the order was given to steam ahead and once more they breathed more freely on hearing again the familiar grinding of the screw  to the anxious inquiries afterwards made of him the captain only smiled and said he could not tell what it wasperhaps it might have been a piece of wreck  but it did not feel like that captain objected one of the passengers who having frequently been to sea before was regarded as being seminautical it was too like a touch on something solid  youve heard i suppose of coral reefs growing in places where none are marked on our charts  i have answered the captain drily  might it not be something of the kind  it might replied the captain  we are not far from the coast of china are we asked the seminautical passenger  not very far  seeing that the captain was not disposed to be communicative the seminautical passenger retired to persecute and terrify some of the ladies with his surmises  meanwhile the well was sounded and a slight increase of water ascertained but nothing worth speaking of and the pumps were set to work  the anxiety of the passengers was soon allayed everything going on as smoothly as before  the evening merged into night  the moon rose slowly and spread a path of rippling silver from the ship to the horizon  the various groups began to uncrystallise  sleepy ones went below and melted away somehow  sleepless ones went to their great panacea smoke  lights were put out everywhere save where the duties of the ship required them to burn continually  at last the latest of the sleepless turned in and none were wakeful through the iron palace except the poor youth who mentally measured the distance from home and the officers and men on duty  among the latter was edgar berrington who standing at his accustomed post down in his own iron depths pondered the events of the evening while he watched the motions of the great crank and listened to the grinding of the screw    chapter nine  treats of a leak and consequent difficulties  it turned out on investigation that whatever the object by which the vessel had been touched some degree of injury had been done to her ironplating for the pumps were found to be insufficient to prevent the rising of water in the hold  this was a serious matter because although the rise was very slow it was steady and if not checked would sooner or later sink the ship  everything that could be done was attempted in order to discover and stop the leak but without success  fortunately it happened that the warrior had among her other goods a quantity of diving apparatus on board consigned to a firm in hongkong that had lost valuable property in a wreck and meant to attempt the recovery of it by means of divers  the men had gone out by a previous vessel but their dresses having been accidentally delayed had been sent after them in the warrior  bethinking himself of these dresses the captain conceived that he was justified in the circumstances in making temporary use of them but he was disappointed to find on inquiry that not a man of his ordinary crew had ever seen a divingdress put on or its attendant airpumps worked  in these circumstances he sent for the chief engineer  edgar berrington was busy about some trifling repairs to the machinery when the message reached him  the place being very hot he was clad only in shirt and trousers with a belt round his waista by no means unbecoming costume for a wellmade figure  his shirtsleeves were rolled up to the shoulders displaying a pair of very muscular and elegantly moulded armssuch as hercules might have been pleased with and apollo would not have disdained  his hands were black and oily and his face was similarly affected  expecting to meet the captain at the entrance to his domains edgar merely rolled down his sleeves and seized a bundle of waste with which he hastily wiped his hands and face thereby drawing on the latter which had previously been spotty a series of varied streaks and blotches that might have raised the envy of a querikoboo savage  but the captain was not where he expected to find him and on looking aft he saw him on the quarterdeck in converse with one of the passengers edgar would rather not have appeared in public in such guise but being in haste to return to the work from which he had been called he pulled on a light linen jacket and foragecap and walked quickly aft  to his horror he saw aileen seated on a basketwork easychair close to the captain  it was too late however to retreat for the latter had already observed him  fortunately aileen was deeply engaged with a book  edgar quickly advanced and took such a position that his back was turned to her  excuse my appearance sir he said in a low voice touching his cap to the captain i am in the midst of a job that requires to be  no matter interrupted the captain with a laugh you look very well in your warpaint  well excuse you  attracted by the laugh aileen looked up at the tall form in front of her  what a very handsome figure she whispered to her bosomfriend who sat beside her reading  the bosomfriend put her book in front of her mouth and whispered  yes very  i wish he would turn round and show his face  but her wish was not granted for the captain walked slowly forward in conversation with the very handsome figure which obstinatelywe might almost say carefullykept its back turned towards them  great was the satisfaction of the captain when he found not only that one of the subordinate engineers understood a good deal about diving but that the chief himself was a diver  it was accordingly arranged that a descent should be made without delay  the dresses were got up and unpacked and one was found suitable for a large man  soon the airpumps were set up and rigged on deck  one of the subengineers was set to work them with one of the crew while another sub and an officer having been previously instructed by our hero were detailed to the important duty of holding the lifeline and airpipe thereafter the engines were stopped and the deadcalm that followed that feeling of unnatural quietude to which we have referred elsewheredid more perhaps to arouse all the sleepers readers and dreamers on board than if a cannon had been fired  of course the descent of a diver over the side was a point of great interest to the passengers coupled as it was with some anxiety as to the leak of the existence of which all were fully aware though only a select few had been informed of its serious natureif not checked  they crowded round the apparatus therefore and regarded its arrangement with the deepest interest  when all was ready edgar issued from the deckcabin in which he meant to dress to take a final look at the airpumps  in the flutter of excitement he had for one moment and for the first time since the beginning of the voyage totally forgotten the existence of aileen now she and lintie the scottish maiden who sang so well chanced to be looking with much interest at the helmet which lay on the deck when his eye fell on them  at once he turned on his heel and retreated towards his cabin  thats the man who is to go down i believe observed one of the passengers pointing to him  lintie looked up and saw his back  oh she whispered to aileen it is the very handsome man  is it replied aileen with indifference for she was engrossed with the helmet just then  greatly perplexed as to how he should escape observation poor edgar began to dressor rather to be dressed by his assistantsdelaying the operation as long as possible but delay did not seem to increase his inventive powers and could not prevent the completion of the process  the guernsey drawers and outside stockings were drawn on and edgars brain worked the while like the great crank of his own engine but no feasible plan of escape was evolved  then the crinoline was drawn on but it added no feminine sharpness to his wits though it seriously modified and damaged the shape of his person  the crinoline as we have said elsewhere is seldom used except at great depths where the pressure of water is excessive  it was put on edgar at this time partly because it formed a portion of the dress and partly because his mind being preoccupied he did not observe with sufficient care what his attendants were about  after this came the shoulderpad and then the thick dress itself was drawn on and the attendants hitched it up with difficulty over his spreading shoulders but they could not hitch up an idea along with it the forcing of his hands through the tight indiarubber wrists of the sleeves was done with tremendous power but it was nothing compared with the energy he put forth to force himself through his mental difficulty yet all in vain  the outside stockings and the canvas overalls followed and he finally put on the red nightcap which seemed to extinguish all capacity for thought  you seem to be a little nervous sir remarked one of the attendants as he affixed the back and chest weights while the other put on his ponderous boots  am ieh said edgar with a grim smile then he added as a sudden idea flashed on him go fetch me the dirtiest bundle of waste you can find below and give it a good scrape on the blackest part of the boiler as you pass  sir exclaimed the attendant  go do what i bid you said edgar in a tone that did not brook delay  the attendant vanished and speedily returned with the desired piece of waste  edgar at once rubbed it over his face and became so piebald and hideous that both the attendants laughed  not heeding them and only half sure of the completeness of the disguise edgar issued boldly from his cabin and walked with heavy tread towards the place where he had to sit down to have the helmet screwed on  a loud roar of laughter greeted him  why youve been kissing the funnel exclaimed one of the mates  thatll do me no harm growled edgar stooping to catch hold of the airtube and making an excuse for sidling and backing towards his seat  oh  what a fright  and such a figure exclaimed lintie come round let us try to get a nearer view of him  she dragged the laughing aileen with her for she was an impulsive little woman but at whatever opening in the crowd she and her friend presented themselves they were sure to find the divers ridiculously broad and now inelegant back turned towards them  plague on him she exclaimed for she was an impatient little woman just then i dont believe hes got a front at all  come round again quick  why what are you turning about like that for exclaimed one of the exasperated attendants who stood ready with the helmet  his heads turned wi fear an hes afollerin of it growled the boatswain  why dont you sit down said the attendant  are you ready asked edgar in a low gruff voice  of course i amdont you see me  another happy idea came into edgars head at that moment  he pulled his red nightcap well down over his eyes and sat down with a crash while another hearty laugh greeted his supposed eccentricity  hallo i say youre not going to be hangedno need to draw it down like that said the first officer  drowning comes much to the same thing lets do it decentlyaccording to rule retorted edgar with a grin that displayed a brilliant set of teeth  hm  we shant see him now whispered lintie in disappointment forcing her way once more to the front  this time there was no reply from aileen for a strange shock passed through her as she observed the momentary smileand no wonder for many a time had that same mouth smiled upon her with winning tenderness  of course she did not for a moment suspect the truth but she thought it strange nevertheless that the divers mouth should have such a strong resemblance toshe knew not precisely what  afterwards she confided to lintie that it had struck her as bearing a faintvery faint resemblance to the mouth of a friend  of a very particular friend inquired lintie who was sharpwitted  aileen blushed and hid her face on the neck of her friend and suddenly poured out her soul which the other drank up with avidity  that same night lying in her berth which was a top one and looking languidly over the side at her friend who lay in the berth below looking sympathetically up she revealed her hopes and fears and sentiments to the edification it is to be hoped of a meanspirited passenger in the saloon who stood on the other side of the very thin partition and tried to overhear  if he succeeded it must have been a new sensation to him to listen to the gentle streams of hope and love that flowed through to himfor aileens thoughts were gems as pure and beautiful as the casket which contained them  we are not quite sure but we more than half suspect that if his presence there had been discovered and himself had been within easy reach the caskets palm would have evoked something resembling a pistolshot from his dirty cheek  but to return to our diver  the moment his helmet was on he breathed freely recovered his equanimity and went down the ropeladder that hung over the side with an air of easy decision that checked the criticisms of the men and aroused the admirationnot to mention the alarmof the women  the puir fellyll be droond pitifully observed a forecabin passenger from edinburgh as she gazed at the mass of airbubbles that arose when edgars iron head had disappeared  nothink of the sort responded a forecabin passenger from london who had taken an immense liking to the forecabin passenger from edinburgh in virtue of their total mental moral and physical dissimilarity divers are never drownded  we need scarcely observe to the intelligent reader that both females were wrongas such females in regard to such matters usually are edgar was not droond and divers are sometimes drownded  so far from being drowned he was remarkably successful in discovering the leak on his first descent  it was caused by one of the ironplates near the keel having been badly torn by a coral rock  thoroughly to repair this was a difficulty  our diver did indeed stuff it with oakum in a way that at once diminished the influx of water but this was merely a makeshift  it now became a question whether it were possible to effect the necessary repairs while at sea  our young engineer removed the difficulty  he undertook to rivet an ironplate over the holeat least to make the attempt  in order to effect this a ropeladder was constructed long enough to pass entirely under the ships bottom to which it was tightly pressed by means of tackle at both ends  the rounds of this ladder were made of wood and all along its course were fastened rough balls or blocks of wood about four inches in diameter which prevented it coming too close to the ships bottom  thus there was secured space for the diver to place his feet on the rounds  this ladder having been affixed so as to pass close to the injured plate a boat was lowered and from this boat descended a small ladder hung in such a way that the diver when a few feet under water could easily step from it to the fixed ropeladder in addition to this a small plank suspended to a rope somewhat after the fashion of a familiar style of bedroom bookshelf was taken down by the diver and hung to the ropeladder by a hook so that he could sit on it while at work and move it about at pleasure  all having been prepared our engineer descended with the necessary tools and to make a long story short riveted a new plate over the old one in such a way as effectually to close the leak so that thereafter it gave no further trouble or anxiety  but for this the vessel would certainly have been lost unless they had succeeded in beaching her before the final catastrophe on some part of the neighbouring coast in which case they would have run the chance of being taken by the pirates who at that time infested the china seas  delivered from this threatened danger the good ship sped merrily on her course most of the crystallised groups grew closer togetherin some instances however they burst asunder  musical tendencies also developed though in some cases the sublime gave place to the ridiculous and music actually once or twice became a nuisance  as the end of the voyage drew near the hearty captain grew heartier the bosomfriends drew closer the shy passengers opened up the congenial passengers began to grieve over the thought of parting charades were acted concerts were given the meanspirited passenger became a little less vile the forecabin passenger from edinburgh observed to her friend that the goins on aboord were wonderfu to which the forecabin passenger from london replied that they certainly was flyingfish and porpoises and sharks and albatrosses and tropical heat ceased to furnish topics of interest and men and women were thrown back on their mental resources which were among other things largely wid pleasantlysometimes even hotlyexercised on religious discussion  in short the little community thus temporarily thrown together became an epitome of human life  as calm and storm alternated outside the iron palace so inside there was mingled joy and sorrow friendships were formed and cemented  love and folly and hate and pride and all the passions were representeday and death was also there  in the silent night when nothing was heard save that ceaseless music of the screw the destroying angel cameso silently that only a few were aware of his dread presenceand took away the youth whose sole occupation seemed to have been the watching of the everincreasing distance from that home which he was destined never again to see  it was inexpressibly sad to those left behind when his coffin was committed to the deep amid the solemn silence that once again ensued on the stoppage of the engines while the low voice of a pastor prayed for those who wept his departure but it was not sad for him who had been takenhe had reached the better home and sitting by the side of jesus could doubtless afford to think at last without longing of the old home beyond the sea    chapter ten  anxieties disasters hopes  standing in his accustomed place on the iron floor of the iron chamber edgar berrington watched the grinding of the great crank and pondered  he had now been many weeks at sea and had not once spoken a word to aileenhad not even seen her more than halfadozen times in the far vista of the quarterdeck  each sabbathday indeed dressed like his former self he had worshipped with her in the same saloon but on these occasions he had kept carefully in the background had crept quietly down after the others had assembled had kept in the shadow of the door and had left before the worshippers had time to rise  an event however was now pending which was destined to remove his present difficulties in a very unexpected manner and to saddle on the shoulders of charles hazlit esquire difficulties which he had never in all his previous business calculations taken into account  during most part of the voyage out to china mr hazlits visage had presented a seagreen aspect edged with yellow  the great demon of the sea had seized upon and held him with unwonted avidity and perseverance it appeared to regard him as fair gameas one whose life had been largely devoted to ploughing up its peculiar domainor rather inducing others to plough thereand who was therefore worthy of special attention  at all events the wealthy merchant did not appear aboveboard until the lapse of two weeks after leaving his native land at the end of that period something like the ghost of him crawled on deck one rather fine day but a demoniac squall rudely sent him below where he remained until those charming regions of the equatorial calms were entered  here a bad likenessa sort of spoiled photographof him again made its appearance and lay down helplessly on a mattress or smiled with pathetic sarcasm when food was offered  but soon the calm regions were passed the cape of storms was doubled and the fierce southeasters of the indian seas were encountered during which period mr hazlit passed away as one of the things that had been from the memory of all on board with the exception of aileen the captain the bedroom steward and a christian pastor who with his amiable wife had done much during the voyage for their fellowpassengers  at last when the shores of china were approached and people began to talk earnestly about the end of the voyage mr hazlits shade once more made its appearance with a spot of dark red on each cheek and on the point of his nose  these spots were hopefully regarded as signs of returning health  they did not appear too soon for the shade would infallibly have vanished altogether if it had been subjected to further attenuation  oh papa dear you look so much better today said aileen arranging his shawls as he lay on deckquite rosy  if she had said portwiny it would have been more in accordance with truth but aileen was rather apt to diverge from truth unintentionally in speaking of her father  i am thankful dear replied the shade in a faint voice and with a fainter smile  the captain says we shall be in port in a few days and then we shall be all right and  ha  shall you exclaimed the demon of the sea giving the ship a little lurch to starboard which cut short the merchants remarks abruptly you think so do you  ho  we shall see  following up this inaudible speech with one of those audible howls for which demons are so justly celebrated he went off in a gust of wind and summoned to his aid one of those simooms or monsoons or typhoons which are in the habit of ravaging the southern seas  these spirits quickly obeying the summons sent not only mr hazlit but many of the other passengers to their berths blew into ribbons the few sails that chanced to be hoisted boiled up the sea as if in a huge caldron caused the blackened sky to mingle with the world of waters rent the firmament with gleaming fire and crashing thunder and hissed or yelled everywhere in the spirit of wildest revelry  the warrior was a splendid steamer and her commander an able seaman but neither splendour of material nor power of mind can avert what is decreed  the storm was prolonged and raged with unwonted fury the captain did his best the good ship behaved nobly and things went well until the night of the third day  it was at that time so very dark that nothing could be seen farther off than a few yards beyond the bulwarks where the whitecrested waves loomed high in air in a sort of ghostly fashion as if they meant to fall on the deck unawares and sink the ship  the passengers had by degrees got used to the mad plunging and rolling of their iron home and even the timid among them began to feel hopeful that after all the gale would be weathered and the harbour gained  what the captain thought no one could tell  he remained on the bridge night and day clad from head to foot in oilskin garments facing the furious blast as if it were his native air watching every motion of his vessel and gazing intently into the world of ebony ahead as if trying to read his fate there  the darkness around was almost palpable  sometimes it seemed as if the vessel were rushing against a mighty rock that towered high above the masts but this was only optical illusion or perhaps a denser stormcloud than usual passing by for the steamer continued to plough her onward way unchecked save now and then by the bursting on her bows of a monster billow which caused her to quiver from stem to stern and swept the decks with green seas fore and aft  one such sea had carried away part of the bulwarks and swept overboard all the loose material on the decks  presently there was a slight diminution in the force of the seas  the captain noted this and gave orders to get the lead ready to heave  deep in the iron chambers below edgar berrington stoodnot in his wonted dreamy mood beside the great crank but close to the steeringwheel of the enginealert steady with his hand on the wheel his eye on the index  suddenly the order came halfspeedthen abruptly followed stop  these orders were obeyed instantly  the lead was hovethe result no bottom at thirty fathoms  again edgar was signalledhalfspeed thenas the captain looked into the darkness ahead and saw or thought he saw it deepen horriblycame the sharp order astern fullspeed  full well did edgar know that this implied imminent danger  quick as lightning he reversed the engines  next moment there was an appalling crash that overturned everything in the vessel  our hero was himself wrenched from his position and hurled against the bulkhead of the boilerroom the masts went over the sides as if they had been pipestems and the wireropes snapt like packthread  a moment of appalling silence followed as if the very elements had suspended their strife then there came shriek and cry from fore and aft as the passengers rushed frantically about while above all yelled the escaping steam when edgar opened the safetyvalves  the spot where they had struck was partially protected by cliffs that rose like a wall in front  these cliffs turned off the direct force of the gale but the general turmoil of the sea raised a surf around them which rendered the prospect of effecting a landing a very poor one even if the vessel should hold together for any length of time  they had not struck on the shore of the mainland but on a solitary islet or rock not far from the coast which rose abruptly out of deep water  hence the silence of the lead as to its presence  it were vain to attempt a description of the confusion that followed the few cool and collected men in the ship were powerless at first but gradually they succeeded in restoring some degree of order  then the captain explained that being hard and fast on the rocks they could not sink and that the vessel being strong was likely to hold together perhaps for several hours  were not hard and fast captain said the seminautical passenger in an undertone as he stood by the afterhatch where most of the cabin passengers were assembled  he referred to a swinging motion of the wreck which however was so very slight as to be almost imperceptible  i know that replied the captain also in an undertone but somewhat sternly we may slip back into deep water but were hard and fast just now and i shall do my best to keep her so  dont you go sir and raise needless alarm in the minds of the passengers  see he added aloud pointing towards the east day is already breaking we shall soon have light enough to commence landing  go below ladies and get your bonnetboxes packed  the captains mind was far enough from jesting at that moment but he knew that a quiet joke possessing a modicum of truth in it would do more to calm the fears of the timid than solemn advice or reasoning  he was right  many went to their cabins to look after their most precious treasures while the officers and men commenced active preparations for escaping to the islet whose towering cliffs now began to loom heavily through the driving mist and foam  from the first it was evident that only one mode of escape offered namely by means of a rope to the shore and a running tackle  this material was easily procured and arranged but the connecting of the rope with the shore was another question  as daylight increased the island was recognised as a mere uninhabited rock from which therefore no assistance could be expected and the terrible turmoil of waters that leaped and seethed between the wreck and the cliffs seemed to all on board including the captain himself to be impassable  at last it became necessary to make an effort for it was soon discovered that the vessel hung on the edge of a ledge outside of which the water deepened suddenly to twenty fathoms and a slip back into that would have been equivalent to certain and immediate death to all on board  my lads said the captain to the crew most of whom were assembled with the passengers near the port bow where the preparations for escaping were going on we must have a man to go ashore with that line i cannot swim myself else i would not ask for a volunteer  come who has got the heart to do a gallant deed and save these women and children  he turned as he spoke and glanced at the female passengers and children who crowded under the lee of the cookhouse wet dishevelled and terrified aileen and her musical friend being among them  there was no response at first  the men turned with doubtful looks at the furious sea in the midst of whose white surges black forbidding rocks seemed to rise and disappear and the surface of which had by that time become much cumbered with portions of wreckage  if i could only swim growled the boatswain id try but i cant float no more than a stone  others who looked stout and bold enough to make the venture seemed to think it might be better to stick to the ship until the sea should go down  indeed one of them said as much but the captain interrupted him and was about to make another appeal when there was a movement in the crowd and one of the subengineers pushed towards him with the information that a volunteer was ready and would appear immediately  who is it asked the captain  mr berrington sir hes getting ready  the chief engineer exclaimed the captain  good if theres a man in the ship can do it he is the man  aileen standing somewhat back in the crowd thought she had caught a familiar sound  who is going to make the venture she inquired of a man near her  the chief engineer miss i believe  at the moment the crowd opened and our hero came forward clothed only in a shirt and duck trousers  his face was not streaked with professional paint on this occasion  it beamed with the flush and the latent fire of one who feels that he has made up his mind deliberately to face death  oh  its the man with the handsome figure gasped lintie with a wild look of surprise  aileen did not now require to be told who it was  unlike heroines she neither screamed nor fainted but through the wonder which shone in her eyes she shot forth another lookone of proud confidencewhich edgar caught in passing and it rendered his power and purpose irresistible the stern work before him however was not compatible with soft emotions  seizing the end of the light line which was ready he tied it firmly round his waist and leaped into the raging sea while an enthusiastic cheer burst from the crew  at first it seemed as if the youth had been endowed with superhuman powers so vigorously and with such ease did he push through the surf and spurn aside the pieces of wreck that came in his way but as his distance from the vessel increased and the surging foam bore him in among the rocks he received several blows from a piece of the floating bulwarks  once also he was launched with terrible violence against a rock  this checked him a little  still however he swam on apparently unhurt while the people on board the wreck gazed after him with inexpressible eagerness  they not only thought of the imminent danger of the gallant youth but fully realised the probability that his failure would be the sealing of their own doom  as he drew near to the rocks on shore a mass of wreck was seen to rise on the crest of the surf close to the swimmers side and fall on him an irresistible cry of despair burst from those in the ship  some one shouted to haul on the line and pull him on board and several seamen sprang to do so but the captain checked them for through his glass he could see edgar struggling to free himself from the wreck  in a few minutes he succeeded and the next wave hurled him on the rocky shore to which he clung until the retreating water had lost its power  then he rose and struggling upwards gained a ledge of rock where he was safe from the violence of the waves  it need scarcely be said that his success was hailed with three tremendous cheers and not a few deep and fervent exclamations of thank god from some who regarded the young engineers safety as a foretaste of their own  some there were however who knew that the work which yet remained to be done was fraught with danger as well as difficulty this work was commenced without delay  by means of the light line which he had carried ashore edgar hauled the two ends of a stouter line or small rope from the wreck  these two ends he quickly spliced together thus making the rope an endless one or as seamen have it an endless fall  the other loop or bight of this endless doublerope was retained on the wreck having been previously rove through a block or pulley which was attached to the broken foremast about ten feet above the deckin accordance with our rocket apparatus directions  in fact the whole contrivance got up so hastily at this time was just an extemporised rocket apparatus without the rocketedgar having already performed the duty of that projectile which is to effect communication between wreck and shore  by means of the endless fall our hero now hauled a heavy rope or cable from the wreck the end of which he fastened round a large boulder this rope being hauled taut remained suspended between the wreck and the cliffs some feet above the sea  previous to fixing it a large block had been run upon it and to this block was suspended one of those circular cork lifepreservers which one usually sees attached to the bulwarks of ships  it was made into a sort of bag by means of a piece of canvas  the endless fall was then attached to this bag so that it could travel with its block backwards and forwards on the thick cable  the first who passed from the wreck to the shore by means of this contrivance was a stout seaman with two very small children in charge the man was sent partly to give the passengers confidence in the safety of the mode of transit and partly that he might aid edgar in the working of the tackle  the next who passed was the mother of the children  then followed aileen and after her the sweet singer  thus one by one all the females and children on board were borne in safety to land  after these the male passengers commenced to go ashore  a few of the older men were sent first  among them was mr hazlit  the unfortunate merchant was so weak as to be scarcely equal to the exertion of getting over the side into the lifebuoy or bag and he was so tall that despite the efforts he made to double himself together there was so much of him above the machine that he had a tendency to topple over  this would have mattered nothing if he had possessed even a moderate degree of power to hold on but his hands were as weak as those of a child  however the case being desperate he made the attempt and was sent away from the wreck with many earnest cautions to hold on tight and keep cool  you may be sure that his progress was watched with intense anxiety by aileen who stood close to edgar as he hauled in the rope carefully  oh  he will fall out she cried in an agony as the rope dipped a little and let him just touch the roaring surf when he was somewhat more than half way over  edgar saw that her fears were not unlikely to be realised  he therefore gave the rope to the seaman who had first come ashore with orders to haul steadily  owing to its position and the dipping of the lifebuoy with its burden the cable formed a pretty steep slope from the shore  throwing himself on the cable edgar slid swiftly down this incline until stopped by the buoy  the effect of course was to sink the machine deeper than ever insomuch that poor mr hazlit unable any longer to withstand the buffeting threw up his arms with a cry of despair  edgar caught him as he was falling over  here put your arms round my neck he cried struggling violently to fix himself firmly to the lifebuoy  the merchant obeyed instantly giving the youth an embrace such as he had never expected to receive at his hands  even in that moment of danger and anxiety edgar could not help smiling at the gaze of unutterable wonder which mr hazlit cast on him through the salt water if not tearsthat filled his eyes for he had not seen the youth when he jumped overboard  haul away shouted our hero but the words were stifled by a sea which at the moment overwhelmed them  the man at the line however knew what to do  he and some of the passengers hauled steadily but swiftly on the line and in a few seconds the buoy with its double freight was brought safe to land  mr hazlit was carried at once by his rescuer to a recess in the cliffs which was partially protected from the storm and edgar after doing what he could to place him comfortably on the ground left him to the care of his daughter  on his return to the beach he found the passengers who had been saved in a state of great alarm because of the slipping backwards of the wreck which strained the cable so much that it had become as rigid as a bar of iron  he began therefore to ply the means of rescue with redoubled energy for there were still some of the passengers and all the crew on board but suddenly while the buoy was being sent out for another freight the cable snapt the wreck slid off the shelf or ledge on which it had hung so long and sank in deep water leaving nothing save a momentary whirlpool in the surf to tell where the splendid ocean palace had gone down  the horror that filled the minds of those who witnessed the catastrophe cannot be described  a feeling of dreary desolation and helplessness followed the sudden cessation of violent energy and hopeful toil in which most of them had been previously engaged  this was in some degree changed if not relieved by the necessity which lay on all to lace the vicissitudes of their new position  that these were neither few nor light soon became apparent for edgar and the seaman after an hours investigation returned to their friends with the information that they had been cast on a small rocky islet which was uninhabited and contained not a vestige of wood or of anything that could sustain the life of man  thus they were left without shelter or food or the means of quitting the inhospitable spotnot however without hope for one of the seamen said that he knew it to be an isle lying not very far from the mainland and that it was almost certain to be passed ere long by ships or native boats  on further search too a spring of fresh water was discovered with sufficient grass growing near it to make comfortable beds for the women and children  the grass was spread under the shelter of an overhanging cliff and as the weather was warm though stormy the feelings of despair that had at first overwhelmed young and old soon began to abate during the day the gale decreased and a hot sun came out at intervals enabling them to dry their soaking garments  that night taking edgar aside mr hazlit thanked him warmly for preserving his life  but said he seriously forgive me if i at once broach a painful subject and point out that our positions are not changed by this disaster  much though i love my life i love my daughters happiness more and i would rather die than allow her to marryexcuse me mr berringtona penniless man  of course continued the merchant with a sad smile as he looked around him it would be ridiculous as well as ungrateful were i to forbid your holding ordinary converse with her here but i trust to your honour that nothing more than ordinary converse shall pass between you  my dear sir replied the youth you greatly mistake my spirit if you imagine that i would for one moment take advantage of the position in which i am now placed  i thank god for having permitted me to be the means of rendering aid to you and aiyour daughter  depend upon it i will not give you reason to regret having trusted my honour  but he hesitated here you have referred to my position  if in time and through gods goodness i succeed in improving my position in gaining by industry a sufficiency of this worlds pelf to maintain aileen in a condition of comfort approaching in some degree that in which she has been brought up may i hopemay i  mr hazlit took the young mans hand and said you may but he said it sadly and with a look that seemed to imply that he had no expectation of edgar ever attaining to the required position  satisfied with the shake of the hand our hero turned abruptly away and went off to ruminate by the seashore  at first he was filled with hope then as he thought of his being penniless and without influential friends and of the immense amount of money that would have to be made in order to meet the wealthy merchants idea of comfort he began to despair  presently the words came to his mindcommit thy way unto the lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass  this revived him and he began to run over in his mind all sorts of wild plans of making a huge fortune quickly  again a word came to himmake not haste to be rich  but what is making haste he thought and his conscience at once replied taking illegitimate coursesventuresome speculation without meansdevotion of the soul and body to business in such a way as to demoralise the one and deteriorate the otherengaging in the pursuit of wealth hastily and with eager anxieties which imply that you doubt gods promise to direct and prosper all works committed to him  my plan then thought edgar is to maintain a calm and trusting mind to be diligent in fulfilling present duty whatever that may be to look about for the direction that is promised and take prompt advantage of any clear opportunity that offers  god helping me ill try  strong in his resolves but happily stronger in his trust he returned to the cavern in which his companions in misfortune had already laid them down to rest and throwing himself on a bed of grass near the entrance quickly fell into that profound slumber which is the perquisite of those who unite a healthy mind to a sound body    chapter eleven  tells of bold plans followed by bolder deeds  months passed away and miss pritty sitting in her little boudoir sipping a cup of that which cheers received a letter  i know that hand of course i do  how strange it is there should be such a variety of handsno two alike just like faces though for my part i think that some faces are quite alike so much so that there are one or two people who are always mistaken for each other so that people dont know which is which  dear me  what an awful thing it would be if these people were so like that each should forget which was the other nobody else being able to put them right there would be irretrievable confusion  what do you want eh  the first part of miss prittys mutterances was a soliloquy the query was addressed to her small and only domestic with the dishevelled head who lingered at the door from motives of curiosity  nothink maam  do you wish me to wait maam  nogo  she went and miss pritty opening the letter exclaimed from my nephew edgar  i knew it  dear fellow  i wonder why he writes to me  the letter ran as follows    dear auntyou will doubtless be surprised to receive a letter from   me  it must be brief the post leaves in an hour  since i saw you we   have had a charming voyage out but at the last we ran on a rocky   island off the coast of china and became a total wreck in a few   minutes  at this point miss pritty gasped oh and faintedat least she went into a perfect semblance of the state of coma but as she recovered suddenly and appealed to the letter again with intense earnestness it may have been something else that was the matter  she resumed her perusal    we succeeded in getting a hawser on shore by means of which through   gods mercy nearly all the passengers were saved including of   course your friend miss hazlit and her father  it is mournful to   have to add however that before the work was finished the wreck   slipped into deep water and sank with all her crew on board  we   remained only one day on the rock when a passing ship observed our   signals took us off and carried us safely into hongkong    mr hazlit and his daughter immediately left fori know not where   i remained here to make some inquiries about the wreck which i am   told contains a large amount of gold coin  now i want you to take   the enclosed letter to my fathers old servant joe baldwin help him   to read it if necessary and to answer it by return of post  it is   important therefore dear aunt dont delay  i think you know   baldwins address as ive been told he lives in the district of the   town which you are wont to visit  excuse this shabby scrawl and the   trouble i ask you to take and believe me to be your loving nephew   edgar berrington  miss pritty was a prompt little woman  instead of finishing her tea she postponed that meal to an indefinite season threw on her bonnet and shawl and left her humble abode abruptly  joe baldwin was enjoying a quiet pipe at his own firesidein company with his buxom wife and his friends mr and mrs rooney machowlwhen miss pritty tripped up to his door and knocked  she was received warmly for joe sympathised with her affectionate and selfdenying spirit and mrs joe believed in her  woe to the unfortunate in whom mrs joealias susandid not believe  come away missglad to see youalways so said joe wiping a chair with his cap and extinguishing his pipe out of deference sit down miss  miss pritty bowed all round wished each of the party goodevening by name and seating herself beside the little fire as easily and unceremoniously as though it had been her own drew forth her letter  this is for you mr baldwin she said it came enclosed in one to me and is from my nephew edgar berrington who says it is important  thank you maam said joe taking the letter opening it and looking at it inquiringly  now miss said he its of no manner o use my tryin to make it out you mustnt suppose miss that divers cant read  theres many of em who have got a good education in the three rs an some who have gone further  for the matter of that i can read print easy enough as you know but i never was good at pothooks and hangers dee see therefore ill be obliged miss if youll read it to me  miss pritty graciously acceded to the request and read    dear baldwinmy aunt miss pritty who will hand this letter to   you will tell you about our being wrecked  now in regard to that i   have a proposal to make  first let me explain  the wreck of the   warrior after slipping off the ledge on which she struck sank in   twenty fathoms water  on our arrival at hongkong the agent of the   owners sent off to see what could be done in the way of recovering the   treasure on boardthere being no less than fifty thousand pounds   sterling in gold in her treasureroom besides valuables belonging to   passengers  a lloyds agent also visited the place and both came to   the conclusion that it was utterly impossible to recover anything from   such a depth by means of divers  this being so and i happening to be   on the spot offered to purchase the right to recover and appropriate   all the gold i could fish up  they laughed at me as a wild   enthusiast but regarding the thing as hopeless themselves were   quite willing to let me have the wreck etcetera for what you would   call an old song  now although nominally a penniless man i do   happen to possess a small property in the form of a block of old   houses in newcastle which were left to me by an uncle and which i   have never seen  on these i have raised sufficient money for my   purpose and i intend to make the venture being convinced that with   the new and almost perfect apparatus now turned out in london by our   submarine engineers bold divers may reach even a greater depth than   twenty fathoms  my proposal then is that you should come to my aid   i will divide all we bring up into three equal portions  one of these   you shall have one ill keep to myself and the third shall be shared   equally by such divers as you think it advisable to employ  what say   you  do the prospects and terms suit and will you come without   delay  if so reply at once and send all the requisite material to   this place  be particular to bring dresses made by the first makers   in london  i wish this to be a sort of semiscientific experimentto   recover property from a great depth to test the powers and properties   of the various apparatus now in use and recently invented and while   so doing to make my fortune as well as yours and that of all   concerned  perhaps you think the idea a wild one  well it may be   so but wilder ideas than this have been realised  remember the noble   house of mulgraveyours truly    edgar berrington  the last sentence in the letter referred to a fact in the history of diving which is worthy of mention  in or about the year 1683 a man named phipps the son of an american blacksmith was smitten with a mania then prevalent for recovering treasure from sunken wrecks by means of diving  he succeeded in fishing up a small amount from the wreck of a spanish galleon off the coast of hispaniola which however did not pay expenses  being a man of indomitable perseverance as well as enthusiasm phipps continued his experiments with varying success and on one occasionif not moresucceeded in reducing himself to poverty  but the blacksmiths son was made of tough materialas though he had been carefully fashioned on his fathers anvil  he was a man of strong faith and this in material as well as spiritual affairs can remove mountains  he was invincibly convinced of the practicability of his schemes  as is usual in such men he had the power to impart his faith to others  he had moved charles the second to assist him in his first efforts which had failed but was unable to similarly influence the cautiousnot to say closefistedjames the second  the duke of albemarle however proved more tractable  through his aid and influence and with funds obtained from the public phipps was enabled in 1687 once more to try his fortune  he set sail in a 200ton vessel and after many fruitless efforts succeeded in raising from a depth of between six and seven fathoms considered but a small depth nowadays property to the value of about 300000 pounds  of this sum the usurious earl obtained as his share 90000 pounds while phipps received 20000 pounds  although james the second had refused to aid in the expedition he had the wisdom to recognise the good service done to mankind in the saving of so much valuable property at so great personal risk  he knighted phipps who thus became the founder of the house of mulgrave now represented by the marquis of normanby  when miss pritty had concluded the letter joe baldwin turned to rooney machowl  what think you lad he said would you venture down to twenty fathom  to twenty thousand fathom if youll consint to watch the pumps and howld the lifeline replied the daring son of erin  will you let me go susan said baldwin turning to his wife  how could i hinder you joe answered mrs baldwin with a face reddened by suppressed emotion at the bare idea  and will you go with me susan  id sooner go to the she stopped unable to decide as to what part of earth she would not sooner go to than china but not being versed in geography she finished by asserting that shed sooner go to the moon  pretty little mrs machowl on the contrary vowed that no power on earth should separate between her and her rooney and that if he went she should go and the baby too  well then miss said baldwin to his visitor if youll be so kind as to write for me ill be obliged  say to mister eddyi cant forget the old name you seethat im agreeable that ill undertake the job along with rooney machowl here and mayhap another man or two  ill get all the dresses and apparatus he requires and will set sail as soon as i can but you see i cant well start right off because ive a job or two on hand  ive a well to go down an putt right an ive some dock repairs to finish  however to save time ill send rooney off at once with one dress and apparatus so that they can be tryin experiments till i arrivewhich will be by the following steamer  now miss dyou think you can tell him all that  i will try said miss pritty making rapid entries in a small notebook after completing which and putting a few more questions she hurried home  meanwhile rooneys wife went off to make arrangements for a long voyage and a probably prolonged residence in foreign parts and joe baldwin went to visit the well he had engaged to descend taking rooney as his assistant  during his visit to this well joe underwent some experiences both physical and mental which tried his nerve and courage more severely than any descent he had ever made in the open sea  it is a wellknown fact among divers that various temperaments are suited to various works and that among other things many men who are bold enough in open water lose courage in confined places such as wells they sayso powerful is imaginationthat they cannot breathe down in a well though of course the means of breathing is the same in all cases  joe baldwin being gifted with cool blood and strong nerves and possessing very little imagination was noted among his fellows for his readiness and ability to venture anywhere under water and do anything  the well in question was connected with the waterworks of a neighbouring town  having got himself and his apparatus conveyed thither he spent the night in the town and proceeded on the following morning at daybreak to inspect the scene of his operations  the well was an old one and very deepabout fifteen fathoms  that however was a matter of small importance to our diver  what concerned him most was the narrowness of the manhole or entrance at the top and the generally dilapidated state of the whole affair  the well instead of being a circular hole in the ground lined with brick like ordinary wells was composed of huge iron cylinders four feet in diameter fitted together and sunk ninety feet into the ground this vast tube or circular iron well rested on a foundation of brickwork  when sunk to its foundation its upper edge was just level with the ground  inside of this tube there were a variety of crossbeams and a succession of iron ladders zigzagging from top to bottom so that it could be descended when empty  at the time of joes visit it was found nearly full of water  down the centre of the well ran two iron pipes or pumps each having a rose at its lower end through which the water could be sucked and pumped up to a reservoir a hundred feet high for the supply of the town  these two pumps were worked by an engine whose distinguishing features were noise and rickets  it could however just do its work but recently something had gone wrong with one of the pumpsno water was thrown up by it  two results followed  on the one hand the watersupply to the town became insufficient and on the other the surplus water in the well could not be pumped out so as to permit of a man descending to effect repairs  in these circumstances a diver became absolutely necessary  hence the visit of baldwin and machowl  now then diver said the managing engineer of the works to joe after he had examined everything above ground with care you see it is impossible to pump the well dry because of the defective pump and the strength of the spring which feeds it  water is admitted into the great cylinder through a number of holes in the bottom  these holes therefore must be stopped  in order to this you will have to descend in the water with a bag of wooden pegs and a hammerall of which are ready for youand plug up these holes  you see the work to be done is simple enough  ay asserted baldwin but the way how to set about it aint so simple or clear  how for instance is a man of my size to squeeze through that hole at the top  you are large said the engineer regarding the diver for a moment but not too large i should think to squeeze through  what  with a divin dress on  ah true i fear that is a puzzling difficulty at the outset for you see the well is frail and we dare not venture to enlarge the hole by cutting the beams that support the pumps  while he was speaking the diver put his head through the hole in question and gazed down into darkness visible where water was dripping and gurgling and hissing a sort of accompaniment to the discordant clanking and jarring of the pumprods  the rickety engine that worked them kept puffing close alongsidegrinding out a horrible addition to the din  as his eyes became more accustomed to the subdued light baldwin could see that there was an empty space between the surface of the water and the top of the well great part of the first length of zigzag ladder being visible and also the crossbeams on which its foot rested  he also observed various green slimy beams which being perpetually moistened by droppings from the pumps seemed alive like water snakes  well said the diver withdrawing his head ill try it  ill dress inside there  youre sure o the old ingine i fancy  it has not yet failed us answered the engineer with a smile  what would happen if it broke or stopped working asked joe  the well would fill to the brim and overflow in a minute or two  so that rejoined the diver if it caught me in the middle o dressin me and my mate would be drownded  youd stand a good chance of coming to that end replied the engineer with a laugh  your mate might get out in time but as you say the dress would prevent you getting back through the hole there would be no hope for you  well then well begin said baldwin come rooney get the gear in order  so saying the adventurous man went to work with his wonted energy  the airpumps were set up and two men of the works instructed in the use of them  then baldwin squeezed himself with difficulty through the manhole and the dress was passed down to him  rooney then squeezed himself through and both went a few steps down the iron ladder until they stood on the crossbeams behind and underneath it  the position was exceedingly awkward for the ladder obliged them to stoop and they did not dare to move their feet except with caution for fear of slipping off the beams into the waterin which even as it was they were ankledeep while standing on the beams  they were soon soaked to the skin by the drippings and spirtings from the pipes and almost incapable of hearing each other speak owing to the din  if rooney had dropped the leadsoled boots or the shoulderweights they would have sunk at once beyond recovery and have rendered the descent of the diver very difficult if not impossible  realising all this the two comrades proceeded with great care and slowness  dressing a diver in the most favourable circumstances involves a considerable amount of physical exertion and violence of action  it may therefore be well believed that in the case of which we write a long time elapsed before baldwin got the length of putting on his helmet  at last it was screwed on  then a hammer and a bagful of wooden pins were placed in his hands  now joe are ye aisy asked rooney holding the frontglass in his hand preparatory to sealing his friend up  all right answered baldwin  set agoin the airpumps up there shouted rooney from whose face the perspiration flowed freely as much from anxiety about his friend as from prolonged exertion in a constrained attitude  in a few seconds the air came hissing into the helmet showing that the two men who wrought it were equal to their duty though inexperienced  all right asked rooney a second time  the reply was given yes and the bullseye was screwed on  rooney then sprang up the ladder and through the manhole took his station at the signalline and airpipe while the engineer of the works watched the airpump  the rickety steamengine was then stopped and as had been predicted the water rose quickly  it rose over baldwins knees waist and head and finally rushed out at the manhole deluging rooneys legs  our diver was now fairly imprisoned an accident however trifling in itself that should stop the airpump would have been his deathknell fully impressed with this uncomfortable assurance he felt his way slowly down the second ladder knocking his head slightly against crossbeams as he went holding on tightly to his bag and hammer and getting down into darkness so profound as to be felt  he soon reached the head of the third ladder and then the fourth  but here at a depth of about thirty feet an unexpected difficulty occurred which had wellnigh caused a failure  the head of the fourth ladder was covered with wood through which a square manhole led to the bottom of the well  of course joe baldwin discovered this only by touch and great was his anxiety when passing his hand round it he found the hole to be too small for his broad shoulders to pass  at this point he afterwards admitted he felt rather curious the whole structure being very frail  however with characteristic determination he muttered to himself never mind joe do it if you can and down he went through the hole putting one arm down with his body and holding the other up and drawing it down after him by which process he squeezed his shoulders through at an angle  after reaching the bottom of the well a feeling of alarm seized him lest he should be unable to force his way upwards through the hole  to settle this question at once he ascended to it forced himself through and then being easy in mind he redescended to the bottom and went to work with the hammer and wooden pegs  at first he had some difficulty in finding the holes in the great cylinder but after a dozen of them had been plugged it became easier as the water rushed in through the remaining holes with greater force while thus engaged his foot suddenly slipped  to save himself from fallinghe knew not whitherhe let go the bag of pegs and the hammer the first of which went upwards and the latter down  to find the hammer in total darkness among the brickwork at the bottom was hopeless therefore joe signalled that he was coming up and started for the top after the bag but failed to find it  in much perplexity he went to the upper manhole and put up one of his hands  to those who were inexperienced it was somewhat alarming to see the hand of an apparently drowning man with the fingers wriggling violently but rooney understood matters  arrah now said he giving the hand a friendly shake its somethin youre wantin sure  what a pity it is wan cant spake wid his fingers  presently the hand shut itself as if grasping something and moved in a distinct and steady manner  och  its a hammer he wants  hes gone an lost it  here you are boytheres another  the hand disappeared transferred the implement to the left hand and reappeared evidently asking for more  what now boy muttered rooney with a perplexed look  doubtless he wants more pegs said the engineer of the works coming up at the moment  sure sur that cant be it for if hed lost his pegs wouldnt they have comed up an floated  theyve caught somewhere no doubt among the timbers on the way up anyhow i had provided against such an accident said the engineer putting another bag of pegs into the impatient hand  it seemed satisfied and disappeared at once  joe returned to the bottom and succeeded in plugging every hole so that the water from the outside spring could not enter  that done he ascended and signalled to the engineer to begin pumping  the rickety engine was set to work and soon reduced the water so much that rooney was able to redescend and undress his friend  thereafter in about five hours the well was pumped dry  the engineer then went down and soon discovered that one of the pumprods had been broken near the foot and that its bucket lay useless at the bottom of the pipe  the repairs could now be easily made and our divers having finished their difficult and somewhat dangerous job returned home  see note 1  next day joe baldwin paid a visit to the neighbouring harbour where a new part of the pier was being built by divers  his object was to sound our surly friend david maxwell about joining him in his intended trip to the antipodes for maxwell was a firstrate diver though a somewhat crossgrained man  maxwell was under water when he arrived  it was baldwins duty to superintend part of the works  he therefore went down and met his man at the bottom of the sea  joe took a small schoolslate with him and a piece of pencilfor the depth being not more than a couple of fathoms it was possible to see to read and write there  the spot where maxwell wrought was at the extreme end of the unfinished part of the breakwater  he was busily engaged at the time in laying a large stone which hung suspended to a travellingcrane connected with the temporary works overhead  joe refrained from interrupting him another man assisted him  in the diver fraternity there are men who thoroughly understand all sorts of handicraftsthere are blacksmiths carpenters stonemasons etcetera  maxwell was a skilled mechanic and could do his work as well under water as many a man does above it perhaps better than some  the bed for the stone had been carefully prepared on a mass of solid masonry which had been already laid  by means of the signalline maxwell directed the men in charge of the crane to move it forward backward to the right or to the left as required at last it hung precisely over the required spot and was lowered into its final restingplace  then baldwin tapped maxwell on the shoulder  the latter looked earnestly in at the windowif we may so call itof his visitor and recognising joe shook hands with him  joe pointed to a rock and sat down  maxwell sat down beside him and then ensued the following conversation  using the slate baldwin wrote in large printed letters  ive got a splendid offer to go out to dive in the china seas  are you game to go  taking the slate and pencil maxwell wrotegame for anything  we must finish this job first wrote joe and i shall send rooney out before us with some of the gearto be ready  all right was maxwells laconic answer  baldwin nodded approval of this but the nod was lost on his comrade owing to the fact that his helmet was immovably fixed to his shoulders maxwell evidently understood it however for he replied with a nod which was equally lost on his comrade  they then shook hands on it and joe touching his signalline four times spurned the ground with a light fantastic toe and shot to the realms above like a colossal cherub    note 1  a job precisely similar to this was undertaken and successfully accomplished by corporal falconer of the royal engineers and assistantinstructor in diving from whom we received the details the gallant corporal was publicly thanked and promoted for his courage and daring in this and other diving operations    chapter twelve  diving practice extraordinary in the east  in a certain street of hongkong there stands one of those temples in which men devote themselves to the consumption of opium that terrible drug which is said to destroy the natives of the celestial empire more fatally than strong drink does the peoples of the west  in various little compartments of this temple many celestials lay in various conditions of debauch  among them was a stout youth of twenty or so he was in the act of lighting the little pipe from which the noxious vapour is inhaled  his fat and healthy visage proved that he had only commenced his downward career  he had scarce drawn a single whiff however when a burly sailorlike man in an english garb entered the temple went straight to the compartment where our beginner reclined plucked the pipe from his hand and dashed it on the ground  i knowd ye was here said the man sternly an i said you was here an sure havent i found you hereyou spalpeen  you pigfaced bag o fat  what dee mane by it chokfoo  didnt i say id give you as much baccy as ye could chaw or smoke an yed only kape out o this place  come along wid ye  it is perhaps scarcely necessary to say that the man who spoke and who immediately collared and dragged chokfoo away was none other than our friend rooney machowl  that worthy had been sent to china in advance of the party of divers with his wife and babyfor in the event of success he said hed be able to affoord it and in the event of failure he meant to try his luck in furrin parts and would on no account leave either wife or chick behind him  on his arrival a double misfortune awaited him  first he found that his employer edgar berrington was laid up with fever in the house of an english friend and could not be spoken to or even seen and second the lodging in which he had put up caught fire the second night after his arrival and was burnt to the ground with all its contents including nearly the whole of his diving apparatus  fortunately the unlucky irishman saved his wife and child and money the last having been placed in a leathern belt made for the purpose and worn night and day round his waist  being a resolute and hopeful man rooney determined to hunt up a diving apparatus of some sort if such was to be found in china and he succeeded  he found in an old ironandragstore sort of place a very ancient headpiece and dress which were in good repair though of primitive construction fortunately his own pumps and airpipes having been deposited in an outhouse had escaped the general conflagration  rooney was a man of contrivance and resource  he soon fitted the pump to the new dress and found that it worked well though the helmet was destitute of the modern regulating valves under the divers control and he knew that it must needs therefore leave the diver who should use it very much at the mercy of the men who worked the pumps  after the fire rooney removed with his family to the house of a chinese labourer named chokfoo whose brother ramstam dwelt with him  they were both honest hardworking men but chokfoo was beginning as we have seen to fall under the baleful influence of opiumsmoking ramstam may be said to have been a teetotaler in this respect  they were both men of humble spirit  chokfoo took the destruction of his pipe and the rough collaring that followed in good part protesting in an extraordinary jargon which is styled pidginenglish that he had only meant to have a very littee smokee not being able just then to resist the temptation  blathers said rooney as they walked along in the direction of the lower part of the town you could resist the timptation aisy av youd only try for youre only beginnin an it hasnt got howld of ee yit look at your brother ram now why dont ee take example by him  yis ramstams firstchop boy said chokfoo with a penitential expression on his fat visage  well then you try and be a firstchop boy too chok an itll be better for you  now you see youve kep us all waiting for full half an hour though we was so anxious to try how the dress answers  in a few minutes the son of erin and the chinaman entered the half ruinous pagoda which was their habitation  here little mrs machowl was on her knees before an airpump oiling and rubbing up its parts ramstam with clasped hands head a little on one side and a gentle smile of approbation on his lips admired the progress of the operation  now then chok and ram said rooney sitting down on a stool and making the two men stand before him like a small awkward squad im goin to taich you about pumps an pumpin so pay attintion av ye plaze  hids up an ears on full cock  now then  here the vigorous diver began an elaborate explanation which we will spare the reader and which his pupils evidently did not comprehend though they smiled with ineffable sweetness and listened with close attention  when however the teacher descended from theory to practice and took the pump to pieces put it up again and showed the manner of working the chinamen became more intelligent and soon showed that they could turn the handles with great vigour  they were hopelessly stupid however in regard to the use of the signalline insomuch that rooney began to despair  niver mind boys he cried hopefully well try it  accordingly he donned the divingdress and teaching his wife how to screw on the bullseye he gave the signal to pump away  of course chokfoo and ramstam though anxious to do well did ill continually  when rooney standing in the room and looking at them signalled to give more air they became anxious and gave him less until his dress was nearly empty  when he signalled for less air they gave him more until his dress nearly burst and then not having the breastvalve he was obliged to unscrew his frontglass to prevent an explosion  at last the perplexed man resolved to make his wife do duty as attender to signals and was fortunate in this arrangement at first for molly was quick of apprehension  she soon understood all about it and receiving her husbands signals directed the chinamen what to do in order to test his assistants better he then went out on the verandah of the pagoda where the pumpers could not see him nor he them  he was of course fully dressed only the bullseye was not fixed  now molly dear said he go to work just as if i was goin under water  molly dimpled her cheeks with a smile as she held up the glass and said are ye ready  not yet putt your lips here first  he stooped molly inserted part of her face into the circular hole and a smack resounded in the helmet  now cushla im ready  pump away boys shouted the energetic little woman  as soon as she heard the hiss of the air in the helmet she screwed on the bullseye and our diver was as much shut off from surrounding atmosphere as if he had been twenty fathoms under the sea  then she went to where the pumpers were at work and taking the airpipe in one hand and the lifeline in the other awaited signals  these were soon sent from the verandah  more air was demanded and given less was asked and the pumpers wrought gently  molly gave one pull at the lifeline all right  rooney replied all right  this was repeated several times  then came four sharp pulls at the line  molly was on the alert she bid ramstam continue to pump while chokfoo helped her to pull the diver forcibly out of the verandah into the interior of the pagoda amid shouts of laughter in which rooney plainly joined though his voice could not be heard  capital molly exclaimed the delighted husband when his glass was off i always belavedan i belave it now more than iverthat a purty woman is fit for anything  after a few more experiments like that ill go down in shallow wather wid an aisy mind  rooney kept his word  when he deemed his assistants perfect at their work he went one morning to the river with all his gear hired a boat pushed off till he had got into two fathoms water and then dressing himself with the aid of the chinamen prepared to descend  are you ready asked his wife  yis cushla but youve forgot the kiss  am i to kiss all the divers we shall have to do with before sending them down she asked  if you want all the divers to be kicked you may was the reply  molly cut short further remark by giving the order to pump and affixing the glass  for a few seconds the diver looked earnestly at the chinamen and at his better half who may have been said to hold his life in her hands  then he stepped boldly on the short ladder that had been let down outside the boat and was soon lost to view in the multitude of airbells that rose above him  now rooney had neglected to take into his calculations the excitability of female nerves  it was all very well for his wife to remember everything and proceed correctly when he was in the verandah of the pagoda but when she knew that her bestbeloved was at the bottom of the sea and saw the airbells rising her courage vanished and with her courage went her presence of mind  a rush of alarm entered her soul as she saw the boiling of the water and fancying she was giving too much air she said hurriedly pump slow boys but immediately conceiving she had done wrong she said pump harder boys  the chinamen pumped with a will for they also had become excited and were only too glad to obey orders  a signalpull now came for less air but molly had taken up an idea and it could not be dislodged  she thought it must be more air that was wanted  pump away boyspump she cried in rapidly increasing alarm  chokfoo and ramstam obeyed  the signal was repeated somewhat impatiently  pump away boys for dear lifepump cried the little woman in desperate anxiety  perspiration rolled down the cheeks of chokfoo and ramstam as they gasped for breath and turned the handles with all the strength they possessed  pumpoh  pumpfor pitys sake  she ended with a wild shriek for at that moment the waves were cleft alongside and rooney machowl came up from the bottom feet foremost with a bounce that covered the sea with foam  he had literally been blown up from the bottomhis dress being filled with so much compressed air that he had become like a huge bladder and despite all his weights he rolled helplessly on the surface in vain attempts to get his head up and his feet down  of course his distracted wife hauled in on the lifeline with all her might and chokfoo and ramstam forsaking the pump lent their aid and soon hauled the luckless diver into the boat when his first act was to deal the chinamen a cuff each that sent one into the sternsheets on his nose and the other into the bow on his back  immediately thereafter he fell down as if senseless and molly with trembling hands unscrewed the bullseye  her horror may be imagined when she beheld the countenance of her husband as pale as death while blood flowed copiously from his mouth ears and nostrils  niver mind cushla he said faintly ill be all right in a minute this couldnt have happened if id had one o the noo helmetsgit off my  ochone  hes fainted cried mrs machowl help me boys  in a few minutes rooneys helmet was removed and he began to recover but it was not until several days had elapsed that he was completely restored so severe had been the consequences of the enormous pressure to which his lungs and tissues had been subjected by the powerful working of the pump on that memorable day by ramstam and chokfoo    chapter thirteen  treasure recoveredaccidents encounteredan unexpected discovery enemies met and circumvented  it is pleasant to loll in the sunshine on a calm day in the stern of a boat and gaze down into unfathomable depths as one listens to the slow regular beating of the oars and the water rippling against the prow and especially pleasant is this when one in such circumstances is convalescent after a prolonged and severe illness  so thought edgar berrington one lovely morning some months after the events related in the last chapter as he was being rowed gently over the fair bosom of the china sea  the boata large one with a little one towing asternwas so far from the coast that no land could be seen a few seagulls sported round them dipping their wings in the wave or putting a plaintive question now and then to the rowers  nothing else was visible except a rocky isle not far off that rose abruptly from the sea  well were nearing the spot at last said edgar heaving that prolonged sigh which usually indicates ones waking up from a pleasant reverie  what a glorious world this is baldwin  how impressively it speaks to us of its maker  ay whether in the calm or in the storm responded joe  yes it was under a very different aspect i saw this place last returned edgar  yonder is the cliff now coming into view where the vessel we are in search of went down  an ugly place remarked joe who was steering the boat  come boys give way  the mornings gittin on an we must set to work as soon as ever we can  time an tide you know etcetera  rooney maxwell chokfoo and ramstam who were rowing bent to their work with a will but the heavy boat did not respond heartily being weighted with a large amount of diving gear  just then a light breeze arose and the boat obedient to the higher power bent over and rippled swiftly on  the only other individual on board was a malaythe owner of the boat he sat on the extreme end of the bow looking with a vacant gaze at the island  he was a man of large size and forbidding though wellformed features and was clothed in a costume half european half oriental which gave little clew to the nature of his professionexcept that it savoured a good deal of the sea  his name dwarro was like his person nondescript  probably it was a corruption of his eastern cognomen  at all events it suffered further corruption from his companions in the boat for baldwin and maxwell called him dworro while rooney machowl named him dwarry  this diversity of pronunciation however seemed a matter of no consequence to the stolid boatman who when directly addressed answered to any name that people chose to give him  he was taciturnnever spoke save when spoken to and at such times used english so broken that it was difficult to put it together so as to make sense  he was there only in capacity of owner and guardian of the boat  those who hired it would gladly have dispensed with his services but he would not let them have it without taking himself into the bargain  having reached the scene of the wreck of the warrior the party at once proceeded to sound and drag for it and soon discovered its position for it had not shifted much after slipping off the ledge where it had met its doom on the night of the storm  its depth under the surface was exactly twentythree fathoms or 138 feet  it will try our metal observed baldwin for the greatest depth that the admiralty allow their divers to go down is twenty fathom  what o that growled maxwell ive worked myself many a time in twentythree fathom water anll do it again any day  we dont need to mind what the admiralty says  the submarine engineers of london tell us they limit a man to twentyfive fathom an they ought to know whats possible if any one should  thats true david remarked rooney as he filled his pipe but ive heard of a man goin down twintyeight fathom an comin up alive  oh as to that said berrington i have heard of one man who descended to thirtyfour fathom at which depth he must have sustained a pressure of 88 and a half pounds on every square inch of his bodyand he came up alive but his case is an exception  it was foolhardy and he could do no effective work at such a depth  however here we are and here we must go to work with a will whatever the depth be you and i joe shall descend first  the others will look after us ill put on a siebe and gorman dress  you will don one of heinke and davis and well take down with us one of denayrouzes lamps reserving siebes electric light for a future occasion  in pursuance of these plans the boat was moored over the place where the wreck lay a short ladder was hung over the side of a smaller boat they had in tow with its pendent line and weight the pumps were set up and rigged the dresses were put on and in a short time our hero found himself in his old quarters down beside the great crank  but ah  what a change was there  the grinding had ceased for ever the great cranks labours were over and its surface was covered with mud sand barnacles and seaweed and involved in a maze of twisted iron and wrecked timbersfor the ship had broken her back in slipping into deep water and wrenched her parts asunder into a state of violent confusion  thick darkness prevailed at that depth but denayrouzes lamp rendered the darkness visible and sufficed to enable the divers to steer clear of bristling rods and twisted ironbands that might otherwise have torn their dresses and endangered their lives  the work of inspection was necessarily slow as well as fraught with risk for great difficulty was experienced while moving about in preventing the entanglement of airpipes and lifelines  the two men kept together partly for company and partly to benefit mutually by the lamp  presently they came on human bones tightly wedged between masses of timber  turning from the sad spectacle they descended into the cabin and made their way towards the place where berrington knew that the treasure had been stowed  here he found with something like a shock of disappointment that the stern of the vessel had been burst open and the contents of the cabin swept out  on further inspection however the treasureroom was found to be uninjured  putting down the lamp on an adjacent beam edgar lifted a heavy mass of wreck from the ground and dashed the door in  the scene that presented itself was interesting  on the floor lay a number of little barrels which the divers knew contained the gold they were in search of  most of these were so riddled by worms that they were falling to pieces  some indeed had partially given way so that the piles of coin could be seen through the staves and two or three had been so completely eaten away as to have fallen off leaving the masses of gold in unbroken piles  there were also bags as well as kegs of coin all more or less in a state of decay  the divers gazed at this sight for a few moments quite motionless  then edgar with one hand turned the lamp full on his companions frontglass so as to see his face while with the other hand he pointed to the treasure  joes eyes expressed surprise and his mouth smiling satisfaction  turning the light full on his own face to show his comrade that he was similarly impressed edgar motioned to joe to sit down on an iron chest that stood in a corner and giving the requisite signal with his lifeline went up to the surface  he did this very slowly in order to accustom his frame to the change of pressure both of air and water for he was well aware of the danger of rapid ascent from such a depth  soon after he redescended bearing several canvas sacks some cord and a couple of small crowbars  placing the lamp in a convenient position and throwing the bags on the floor of the treasureroom edgar and baldwin set to work diligently with the crowbars broke open the kegs and emptied their golden contents into one of the bags until it was quite full tied up the mouth fastened it to a rope which communicated with the boat above and gave the signal to hoist away  the bag quickly rose and vanished  previous to redescending our hero had arranged with rooney to have pieces of sailcloth in readiness to wrap the bags in the instant of their being got into the small boat so that when being transferred to the large boats locker their form and contents might be concealed from the pilot dwarro  the precaution however did not seem to be necessary for dwarro was afflicted with laziness and devoted himself entirely to the occupations of alternately smoking in a dreamy way and sleeping  for three hours the divers wrought under great excitement as well as pressure and then feeling much exhausted returned to the surface having sent up the contents of about twenty boxes and kegs of treasure rooney and maxwell then took their turn under water and were equally successful  that night being very calm and clear they ran the boat into a sheltered crevice among the cliffs and slept on board of her  next morning at daybreak they were again at work but were not equally fortunate for although plenty of treasure was sent up several accidents occurred which were severe though happily not fatal  in the first place baldwin tore his left hand badly while attempting to raise a heavy mass of ragged ironplate that prevented his reaching some loose coin lying under it  this though painful did not render him altogether incapable of working  then while edgar berrington was passing from one part of the wreck to another threading his way carefully a mass of wireropes and other wreckage suddenly dropt from a position where it had been balanced and felled him to the deck with such violence that for a few moments he was stunned  on recovering he found to his horror that he was pressed down by the mass and had got inextricably entangled with it  if his dress had been torn at that time or his helmet damaged it is certain that his adventures would have been finally cut short and there can be no doubt that his preservation was largely owing to the excellence of the material of which his dress was made  but how to escape from his wirecage was a difficulty he could not solve for the lamp had been extinguished and the entanglement of his line and airpipe rendered signalling impossible  he continued to struggle helplessly therefore in total darkness  that the airtube continued all right was evident from the fact that air came down to him as before  in this dilemma he remained for a short time occasionally managing to clear himself partially and at other times becoming more and more involved  at last rooney machowl who was attending to the lines above bethought him that he had not received any signals for some time or observed any of those motions which usually indicate that a diver is busy below  he therefore gave a pull to the lifeline  of course no answer was received  hallo exclaimed rooney with a start for in diving operations life and death frequently stand elbowing each other  he gave another and still more decided pull but no answer was returned  jumping up in excitement he attempted to haul on the line so as to bring edgar to the surface by force but to his consternation he found it to be immovably fixed  hooroo  man alive he yelled rather than shouted to maxwell who was attending the other line signal for joe to come uplook sharp  maxwell obeyed with four strong quick pulls on joes line and joe appeared at the surface rather sooner than was consistent with safety on learning the cause of his being called he infixed his bullseye hastily went down again with a heavy plunge and discovering his companion soon removed the wreck by which he was entangled and set him free  experience it is said teaches fools much more does it instruct wise men  after this event our hero became a little more careful in his movements below  when a considerable amount of treasure had been recovered it was thought advisable to return to the shore and place it in security  it wont be easy to manage this said edgar to baldwin in a low tone as they sailed away from the rocky islet under a light breeze  i have an uncomfortable belief that that fellow dwarro suspects the nature of the contents of these bags despite our efforts at concealment  i dont think he does whispered baldwin  he seems to me to be one o these miserable opiumsmokers whose brains get too much fuddled to understand or care for anything  whist now dont spake so loud said rooney advancing his head closer to his companions and glancing doubtfully at the object of their suspicion sure hes got a sharp countenance fuddled or not fuddled  the pilot had indeed an intelligent cast of countenance but as he sat in a careless attitude in the bow of the boat smoking listlessly and gazing dreamily almost stupidly towards the shore it did seem as though he had indulged too freely in the noxious drag which poisons so many inhabitants of these unhappy lands  as he was out of earshot the four adventurers drew their heads still closer together and talked eagerly about their prospects  sure our fortins is made already said rooney how much dee think weve fished up mr berrington  i cannot say but at a rough guess i should think not less than twenty thousand pounds  ye dont main it  och  molly astore  ye shall walk in silks an satins from this day forwardto say nothin of a carridge an four if not six  but wherell we putt it sir asked baldwin  ive been thinking of that replied edgar  you see i dont like the notion of running right into port with it where this pilot has probably numerous friends who would aid him in making a dash for such a prize supposing he has guessed what we are about  now i happen to have a trusty friend here a young scotchman who lives in a quiet outotheway part  well run up to his place land the gold quickly and get him to carry it off to some place of security  whist not so loud  i do belave said rooney that rascal is cocking his weather ear  he dont understand a word of english muttered baldwin  dwarro looked so intensely absent and sleepy as he sat lounging in the bow that the divers felt relieved and continued though in more cautious tones to discuss their plans  meanwhile the boat ran into the hongkong river  as it proceeded a small light boat or skiff was observed approaching  baldwin who steered sheered out a little in the hope of avoiding her but the man who sculled her conformed to the movement and quickly shot past their bowso closely that he could exchange salutations with the pilot nothing more appeared to pass between the twoindeed there seemed no time for further communicationnevertheless rooney machowl declared that some telegraphic signals by means of hands and fingers had certainly been exchanged  in a short time the boat was turned sharp round by baldwin and run into a cove near a wall in which was a little wooden gate  a flight of dilapidated steps led to this gate  what if your friend should not be at home asked joe in a whisper  ill land the bags in any case and await him while you return to the port with dwarro replied edgar  if the pilot was interested in their proceedings he must have been a consummate actor for he took no notice whatever of the sudden change of the boats course but continued to smoke languidly and to gaze abstractedly into the water as if trying to read his fortune there while edgar and rooney landed the bags and carried them through the little gate into the scotchmans garden  in a few minutes edgar returned to the boat stepped in and pushed off while the two chinamen in obedience to orders rowed out into the river  its all right whispered edgar sitting down beside joe wilson is at home and has undertaken to have the bags carried to a place of safety long before any attempt to capture them could be organised even if dwarro knew our secret and were disposed to attempt such a thing besides we will keep him under our eyes tonight as long as possible  that night highly elated at the success of their labours our four friends sat round their evening meal in the pagoda and related their various diving adventures and experiences to the admiring and sympathetic molly machowl  they had previously entertained the pilot with unlimited hospitality and tobacco and that suspected individual so far from showing any restless anxiety to shorten his stay had coolly enjoyed himself until they were at last glad when he rose to go away  on the following morning too he was ready with his boat before daybreak and the party returned to the scene of operations at the wreck in high spirits  it is certain that their enthusiasm would have been considerably damped had they known that exactly three hours after their gold was landed a party of six stout nauticallooking malays entered the residence of wilson the scotchman knocked down wilsons servants gagged wilsons mouth drank up the claret with which wilson had been regaling himself and carried off the bags of gold before his very eyes  fortunately for their peace of mind and the success of their labours our adventurers did not know all this but descending to the wreck with heavy soles and light hearts they proceeded to recover and send up additional bags of gold  that day they were not quite so successful  unforeseen difficulties lay in their way  some of the gold had been washed out of the treasureroom in their absence and was not easily recovered from the sand and seaweed  in order the better to find this the electriclamp was brought into requisition and found to be most effective its light being very powerfulequal to that of fifteen thousand candlesand so arranged as to direct the light in four directions one of these being towards the bottom by means of a reflecting prism  it burned without air and when at the bottom could be lighted or extinguished from the boat by means of electricity  still notwithstanding its aid they had not collected treasure beyond the value of about eight thousand pounds when the time for rest and taking their midday meal arrived  this amount was however quite sufficient to improve their appetites and render them sanguine as to the work of the afternoon  youd better signal mr berrington to come up said joe who with all the others of the party were assembled in the stern of the boat anxiously waiting to begin their dinner  sure ive done it twice aready replied rooney who was attending to our heros lifeline while ramstam and chokfoo toiled at the airpumps  what does he reply asked joe  he replies all right but nothin more  if he knew the imptiness of myoch  there he goes at last four tugs  come along my hearty said rooney coiling away the slack as edgar rose slowly to the surface  presently his helmet appeared like a huge round goblet ascending from the mighty deep  then the surface was broken with a gurgle and the goggleeyes appeared  rooney unscrewed the frontglass and the chinamen were free to cease their weary pumping  when edgar was assisted into the boat it was observed that he had a small peculiarlyshaped box under his arm  he made no reference to this until relieved of his helmet when he took it up and examined it with much curiosity  what have you got there sir asked joe baldwin coming forward  that is just what i dont know answered edgar  it seems to me like an iron or steel box much encrusted with rust and i shouldnt wonder if it contained something of value  one thing is certain that we have not got the key and must therefore break it open  while he was speaking david maxwell gazed at the box intently  he did not speak but there was a peculiar motion about his lips as if he were licking them  a fiend happened just then to stand at maxwells ear  it whispered you know it  ay said maxwell under his breath in reply i knows itwell  i wonder if there are valuables in it said edgar  shouldnt wonder if there wor said rooney  eight or nine thousand pounds more or less whispered the fiend quoting words used by mr hazlit on a former occasion  ahjis so muttered maxwell  dont you say a word more david said the fiend  i wont muttered maxwells heart for the hearts of men are desperately wicked  thats right continued the fiend for if you keep quiet you know the contents will fall to be divided among you and the loss wont be felt by a rich fellow like old hazlit  maxwells heart approved and applauded the sentiment but a stronger power moved in the rough mans heart and softly whispered shame  why maxwell said edgar smiling you look at the box as if it were a ghost  an so it is said maxwell with a sudden and unaccountable growl at the sound of which the fiend sprang overboard and diving into the sea disappeared from maxwells view for ever  why what dee mean david asked baldwin in surprise  i mean sir said maxwell turning to edgar with a look of unwonted honesty on his rugged face that that box is the ghost of one that belongs to miss hazlit if it aint the box itself  to miss hazlit exclaimed edgar in surprise explain yourself  in reply to this the diver told how he had originally become acquainted with the box and its contents and said that he had more than once searched about the region of miss hazlits cabin while down at the wreck in hope of finding it but without success  strange said edgar i too have more than once searched in the same place in the hope of finding something or anything that might have belonged to her but everything had been washed away  of course knowing nothing about this box i did not look for it and found it at last by mere chance some distance from the berth she occupied  why did you not mention it before  maxwell was silent and at that moment the drift of thought and conversation was abruptly turned by rooney machowl shouting dinner ahoy with impatient asperity  while engaged in the pleasant duty of appeasing hunger our divers chatted on many subjects chiefly professional  among other things rooney remarked that he had heard it said a divingdress contained sufficient air in it to keep a man alive for more than five minutes  i have heard the same said edgar  come david suggested joe baldwin lets test it on you  ready said maxwell rising and wiping his huge mouth  the proposal which was made in jest was thereupon carried out in earnest  dinner being over maxwell put on his divingdress the chinamen set the pump going and the frontglass was screwed on  air was forced into the dress until it was completely inflated and looked as if ready to burst while maxwell stood on the deck holding on to a backstay  at a given signal the pumpers ceased to work and the adventurous man was thus cut off from all further communication with the outward air  at first the onlookers were amused then they became interested and as the minutes flew by a little anxious but maxwells grave countenance as seen through the bullseye gave no cause for alarm  thus he stood for full ten minutes and then opening the escapevalve signalled for more air  this was a sufficient evidence that a man might have ample time to return to the surface from great depths even if the airpumps should break down  but perhaps said edgar as they conversed on the subject you might not be able to hold out so long under water where the pressure would be great  sure thats true  what dee say to try david said rooney  again maxwell expressed willingness to risk the attempt  the glass was once more screwed on the pumps set agoing and down the bold diver went to the bottom  on receiving a prearranged signal the pumps were stopped  this let the reader fully understand is a thing that is never done with the ordinary pumps which are not permitted to cease working from the time the bullseye is fixed on until after it is taken off on the divers return to the surface  it was therefore with much anxiety that the experimenters awaited the resultanxiety that was not allayed by rooney machowls expression of countenance and his occasional suggestion that he must be dead by this time or och  hes gone entirely now  for full five minutes maxwell stayed under water without a fresh supply of airthen he signalled for it and the anxious pumpers sent it down with a will  thus it was found that there was still sufficient time for a man to return to the surface with the air contained in his dress in the event of accident to the pumps  see note 1  while the divers were engaged with these experiments chokfoo was sent on shore in the small boat for a supply of fresh water from a spring near the top of the island  having filled his keg the chinaman turned his fat goodhumoured countenance toward the sea for the purpose of taking an amiable view of nature in general before commencing the descent  as he afterwards gazed in the direction of the mainland he observed what appeared to be a line of seagulls on the horizon  he looked intently at these after shouldering his waterkeg  chokfoos visage was yellow by nature  it suddenly became pale green  he dropped his burden and bounded down the hillside as if he had gone mad  the waterkeg followed him  being small and heavy it overtook him swept the legs from under him and preceded him to the beach where it was dashed to atoms  chokfoo recovered himself continued his wild descent sprang into the boat rowed out to his companions in furious haste and breathlessly gave the information that pirates were coming  those to whom he said this knew too well what he meant to require explanation  they were aware that many socalled traders in the eastern seas become pirates on the shortest notice when it suits their convenience  edgar berrington immediately drew a revolver from his pocket and stepping suddenly up to dwarro said sternly  look here  the pilot did look and for the first time his calm cool imperturbable expression deserted him for he saw that he had to deal with a resolute and powerful man  at the same time his right hand moved towards his breast but it was arrested from behind in the iron grip of joe baldwin  now pilot said edgar submit and no one shall harm you  resist and you are a dead man  search him joe  the diver opened dwarros pilotcoat and found beneath it a brace of pistols and a long sheath knife which he quietly removed and transferred to his own person  the other men in the boat looked on meanwhile in silence  dwarro continued edgar you have planned this i know but ill thwart you  i wont tie or gag you  ill make you sit at the helm and steer while we evade your friends  i shall sit beside you and you may rely on it that if you disobey an order in the slightest degree or give a signal by word or look to any one ill blow out your brains  dyou understand me  the pilot made no reply save by a slight inclination of the head while a dark frown settled on his features  it was obvious that fear found no place in the mans breast for a deep flush of indignation covered his countenance  he merely felt that he must obey or die and wisely chose the former alternative  meanwhile the fleet of boats which had appeared to the chinaman on the hilltop was now seen by the party in the boat as they drew nearer under the influence of a land breezetheir high sails rendering them visible before the low boat of our divers could be seen by them  the wind had not yet reached the island but even if it had the divers would not have hoisted sail lest they should have been seen  ship your oars now lads and pull for life cried edgar seizing the tiller with one hand while with the other he held the revolver  you take this oar dwarro and pull with a will  in a few seconds the pilot boat was creeping pretty swiftly along the rugged shore of the island in the direction of the open sea  to lighten her the little boat astern was cut adrift  continuing their course they rowed quite past the island and then turning abruptly to the southward they pulled steadily on until the first catspaw of the breeze ruffled the glassy sea  by this time the fleet of boats was distinctly visible making straight for the island  edgar now ordered the sails to be set and bade dwarro take the helm  the pilot obeyed with the air of a stoic  it was clear that his mind was made up  this had the effect of calling up a look of settled resolution on edgars face  in a few minutes the sails filled and then to the surprise not only of dwarro but all on board edgar ordered the pilot to steer straight for the line of advancing boats  two of these had changed their course on first observing the divers boat but when they saw it steering straight down as if to meet or join them they resumed their course for the island  presently the breeze increased and the pilot boat leaped over the waves as if it had received new life  its a bowld thing to try muttered rooney machowl but im afeard sir  he was silenced by a peremptory hush from edgar  get down so as to be out of sight he continued all of you except the chinamenyou two come and sit by dwarro  as he spoke edgar himself sat down on an oar so as to be able to see over the gunwale without himself being seen  to those in the fleet it would thus appear that their vessel was a pilot boat returning from seaward with its skipper and two chinamen  whatever dwarros intentions had been he was evidently somewhat disconcerted and glanced more than once uneasily at the calm youth who sat pistol in hand at his side directing him how to steer  although there was a considerable fleet of the piratical boats they were spread out so that a space of several hundred yards intervened between each  edgar steered for the centre of the widest gap and his bold venture was favoured by a sudden increase of wind which caused the waves to gurgle from the bow  just as they passed between two of the boats they were hailed by one of them  edgar kept his eyes fixed on dwarro who became slightly pale the click of the pistol at the moment caused the pilot to start  you may inform and we may be caught said edgar sternly but whatever happens you shall die if you disobey  speak not but wave your hand in reply  dwarro obeyed  those who had hailed him apparently thought the distance too great for speech they waved their hands in return and the boat passed on  a few minutes more and our divers were safely beyond the chance of capture making for the mainland under a steady breeze    note 1  the pump used by denayrouze of paris besides being very simple in its parts and action possesses an airreservoir which renders a cessation of the pumpaction for a few minutes of no importance    chapter fourteen  miss prittys worst fears are more than realised  turn we now to miss prittyand a pretty sight she is when we turn to her  in her normal condition miss pritty is the pink of propriety and neatness  at the present moment she lies with her mouth open and her eyes shut hair dishevelled garments disordered slippers off and stockings not properly on  need we say that the sea is at the bottom of it  one of the most modest gentle unassuming amiable of women has been brought to the condition of calmly and deliberately asserting that she doesnt caredoesnt care for appearances doesnt care for character doesnt care for past reminiscences or future prospects doesnt care in short for anythinglife and death included  it is a sad state of mind and bodyhappily a transient  stewardess  yes miss  i shall die  oh no miss dont say so  youll be quite well in a short time the stewardess has a pleasant motherly way of encouraging the fainthearted  dont give way to it miss  youve no idea what a happytite youll ave in a few days  youll be soon able to eat hoceans of soup and eaps of fat pork and  she stops abruptly for miss pritty has gone into sudden convulsions in the midst of which she begs the stewardess quite fiercely to go away  let us draw a veil over the scene  miss pritty has been brought to this pass by mr charles hazlit whose daughter aileen has been taken ill in china  being a man of unbounded wealth and understanding that miss pritty is a sympathetic friend of his daughter and an admirable nurse he has written home to that lady requesting her in rather peremptory terms to come out to them  miss pritty resenting the tone of the request as much as it was in her nature to resent anything went off instanter in a gush of tender love and sympathy and took passage in the first ship that presented itself as being bound for the china seas  she did not know much about ships her maritime ideas were vague  if a washingtub had been advertised just then as being a1 at lloyds and about to put forth for that region of the earth with every possible convenience on board for the delight of human beings she would have taken a berth in it at once  we do not intend to inflict miss prittys voyage on our reader  suffice it to say that she survived it reached china in robust health and found her sick friendwho had recoveredin a somewhat similar condition  after an embrace such as women alone can bestow on each other miss pritty holding her friends hand sat down to talk  after an hour of interjectional exclamatory disconnected irrelevant and largely idiotical conversesustained chiefly by herselfmiss pritty said  and oh  the pirates  she said this with an expression of such awful solemnity that aileen could not forbear smiling as she asked  did you see any  gracious  no exclaimed miss pritty with a look of horror but we heard of them  only think of that  if i have one horror on earth which transcends all other horrors in horribleness that horror is pirates  i once had the misfortune to read of them when quite a girl they were called buccaneers i think in the bookand i have never got over it  well one day when we were sailing past the straits of malaccai think it wasour captain said they were swarming in these regions and that he had actually seen themmore than that had slain them with his ownoh  it is too horrible to think of  and our captain was such a dear good man too  not fierce one bit and so kind to everybody on board especially the ladies  i really cannot understand it  there are such dreadfully strange mixtures of character in this world  no he did not say he had slain them but he used nautical expressions which amount to the same thing i believe he said he had spiflicated lots of em and sent no end of em to somebodys locker  it may be wrong in me even to quote such expressions dear aileen but i cannot explain myself properly if i dont  it is fearful to know there are so many of them swarming as our captain said  the worst of it is that many of the boatmen and small traders on the coast said aileen are also pirates or little better  dreadful exclaimed her friend  why oh why do people go to sea at all  to transport merchandise i suppose said aileen  we should be rather badly off without tea and silk and spices and such things shouldnt we  tea and silk  aileen  i would be content to wear cotton and drink coffee or cocoawhich latter i hateif we only got rid of pirates  even cotton coffee and cocoa are imported i fear suggested aileen  then id wear wool and drink wateranything for peace  oh how i wish said miss pritty with as much solemn enthusiasm as if she were the first who had wished it that i were the queen of englandthen id let the world see something  what would you do dear asked aileen  do  well ill tell you  being the head of the greatest nation of the earthexcept of course the americans who assert their supremacy so constantly that they must be rightbeing the head i say of the greatest earthly nation with that exception i would order out all my gunships and turretboats and build new ones and send them all round to the eastern seas attack the pirates in their strongholds andand blow them all out o the water or send the whole concern to the bottom you neednt laugh aileen  of course i do not use my own language  i quote from our captain  really you have no idea what strong and to me quite new expressions that dear man used  so powerful too but never naughty  no never  i often felt as if i ought to have been shocked by them but on consideration i never was for it was more the manner than the matter that seemed shocking  he was so gentle and kind too with it all  i shall never forget how he gave me his arm the first day i was able to come on deck after being reduced to a mere shadow by seasickness and how tenderly he led me up and down preventing me as he expressed it from lurching into the leescuppers or going slap through the quarterrails into the sea  after a little more desultory converse aileen asked her friend if she were prepared to hear some bad news  miss pritty declared that she was and evinced the truth of her declaration by looking prematurely horrified  aileen although by no means demonstrative could not refrain from laying her head on her friends shoulder as she said well then dear laura we are beggars  dear papa has failed in business and we have not a penny in the world  miss pritty was not nearly so horrified as she had anticipated being poor thing she was so frequently in the condition of being without a penny that she had become accustomed to it  her face however expressed deep sympathy and her words corresponded therewith  how did it happen she asked at the close of a torrent of condolence  indeed i dont know replied aileen looking up with a smile as she brushed away the two tears which the mention of their distress had forced into her eyes  papa says it was owing to the mismanagement of a head clerk and the dishonesty of a foreign agent but whatever the cause the fact is that we are ruined  of course that means i suppose that we shall have no more than enough to procure the bare necessaries of life and shall now alas  know experimentally what it is to be poor  miss pritty when in possession of enough to procure the bare necessaries of life had been wont to consider herself rich but her powers of sympathy were great  she scorned petty details and poured herself out on her poor friend as a true comfortercounselled resignation as a matter of course but suggested such a series of bright impossibilities for the future as caused aileen to laugh despite her grief  in the midst of one of these bursts of hilarity mr hazlit entered the room  the sound seemed to grate on his feelings for he frowned as he walked in an absent mood up to a glass case full of gaudy birds and turned his back to it under the impression apparently that it was a fire  aileen he said jingling some loose coin in his pocket with one hand while with the other he twisted the links of a massive gold chain your mirth is illtimed  i am sorry miss pritty to have to announce to you so soon after your arrival that i am a beggar  as he spoke he drew himself up to his full height and looked on the whole like an overfed highly ornamented and welltodo beggar  yes he said repeating the word with emphasis as if he were rather proud of it a beggar  i have not a possession in the world save the clothes on my back which common decency demands that my creditors should allow to remain there  now i have all my life been a man of action promptitude decision  we return to england immediatelyi do not mean before luncheon but as soon as the vessel in which i have taken our passage is ready for sea which will probably be in a few days  i am sorry miss pritty that i have put you to so much unnecessary trouble but of course i could not foresee what was impending  all i can do now is to thank you and pay your passage back in the same vessel with ourselves if you are disposed to go  that vessel i may tell you has been selected by me with strict regard to my altered position  it is a very small one a mere schooner in which there are no luxuries though enough of necessaries  you will therefore my child prepare for departure without delay  in accordance with this decision mr and miss hazlit and miss pritty found themselves not long afterwards on board the fairy queen as the only passengers and in process of time were conveyed by winds and currents to the neighbourhood of the island of borneo where we will leave them while we proceed onward to the island of ceylon  time and distance are a hindrance to most people  they are fortunately nothing whatever in the way of writers and readers  here a strange scene presents itself numerous pearldivers are at workmost of them native some european  but with these we have nothing particular to do except in so far as they engage the attention of a certain man in a small boat whose movements we will watch  the man had been rowed to the scene of action by two malays from a large junk or chinese vessel which lay in the offing  he was himself a malaytall dark stern handsome and of very powerful build  the rowers were perfectly silent and observant of his orders which were more frequently conveyed by a glance or a nod than by words  threading his way among the boats of the divers the malay skipper for such he seemed signed to the rowers to stop and directed his attention specially to one boat  in truth this boat seemed worthy of attention because of the energy of the men on board of it  a diver had just leaped from its side into the sea  he was a stalwart man of colour quite naked and aided his descent by means of a large stone attached to each of the sandals which he wore  these sandals on his desiring to return to the surface could be thrown off being recoverable by means of cords fastened to them  just as he went down another naked diver came up from the bottom and was assisted into the boat  a little blood trickled from his nose and ears and he appeared altogether much exhausted  no wonder  he had not indeed remained down at any time more than a minute and a half but he had dived nearly fifty times that day and sent up a basket containing a hundred pearl oysters each time  presently the man who had just descended reappeared  he also looked fagged but after a short rest prepared again to descend  he had been under water about ninety seconds  few divers can remain longer  the average time is one minute and a half sometimes two minutes  it is said that these men are shortlived and we can well believe it for their work although performed only during a short period of each year is in violent opposition to the laws of nature  directing his men to row on our skipper soon came to another boat which not only arrested his attention but aroused his curiosity for never before had he seen so strange a sight  it was a large boat with novel apparatus on board of it and white menin very strange costume in fact it was a party of european divers using the divingdress among the pearlfishers of ceylon and great was the interest they created as well as the unbelief scepticism misgiving and doubt which they drew forthfor although not quite a novelty in those waters the dress was new to many of the natives present on that occasion and easterns not less than westerns are liable to prejudice  a large concourse of boats watched the costuming of the divers and breathless interest was aroused as they went calmly over the side and remained down for more than an hour sending up immense quantities of oysters  of course liberalminded men were made converts on the spot and equally of course the narrowminded remained of the same opinion still  nevertheless that days trial of western ingenuity has borne much fruit for we are now told by the best authorities that at the present time the divingdress is very extensively used in sponge pearl and coral fisheries in many parts of the world where naked divers alone were employed not many years ago and that in the greek archipelago and on the turkish and barbary coasts alone upwards of three hundred diving apparatuses are employed in the sponge fisheries with immense advantage to all concerned and to the world at large  leaving this interesting sight our malay skipper threaded his way through the fleet of boats and made for the shores of the bay of condatchy which was crowded with eager men of many nations  this bay on the west coast of ceylon is the busy scene of one of the worlds great fisheries of the pearl oyster  the fishing being in the hands of government is kept under strict control  it is farmed out the beds of oysters are annuallysurveyed and reported on  they are divided into four equal portions only one of which is worked each year as the fishing produces vast wealth and affords scope for much speculation during the short period of its exercise the bay during february march and april of each year presents a wondrous spectacle for here jews indians merchants jewellers boatmen conjurors to charm off the dreaded sharks brahmins roman catholic priests and many other professions and nationalities are represented all in a state of speculation hope and excitement that fill their faces with animation and their frames with activity  the fleet of boats leaves the shore at 10 pm on the firing of a signalgun and returns at noon next day when again the gun is fired flags are hoisted and babel immediately ensues  it was noon when our malay skipper landed  the gun had just been fired many of the boats were in others were arriving  leaving his boat in charge of his men the skipper wended his way quickly through the excited crowd with the wandering yet earnest gaze of a man who searches for some one  being head and shoulders above most of the men around him he could do this with ease  for some time he was unsuccessful but at last he espied an old greybearded jew and pushed his way towards him  ha  pungarin my excellent friend exclaimed the jew extending his hand which the skipper merely condescended to touch how do you do  i am so overjoyed to see you you have business to transact eh  you may be quite sure moses that i did not come to this nest of sharpers merely for pleasure replied pungarin brusquely  ah my friend you are really too severe  no doubt we are sharp but that is a proper business qualification  besides our trade is legitimate while yours my friend is  the jew stopped and cast a twinkling glance at his tall companion  is not legitimate you would say observed pungarin but that is open to dispute  in my opinion this is a world of robbers the only difference among us is that some are sneaking robbers others are open every man to his taste  i have been doing a little of the worlds work openly of late and i come here with part of the result to give you a chance of robbing me in the other way  nay nay you are altogether too hard returned the jew with a deprecating smile but come to my little office  we shall have more privacy there  how comes it pungarin that you are so far from your own waters  it is a longish way from ceylon to borneo  how comes it replied the malay that the seamew flies far from home  there is no limit to the flight of a searover save the seashore  true true returned the jew with a nod of intelligence but here is my place of business  enter my humble abode and pray be seated  pungarin stooped to pass the low doorway and seated himself beside a small deal table which although destitute of a cloth was thickly covered with inkstains  the malay rover was clad in a thin loose red jacket a short petticoat or kilt and yellow trousers  a red fez with a kerchief wound round it turban fashion covered his head  he was a wellmade stalwart man with a handsome but fiercelooking countenance  from beneath the loose jacket pungarin drew forth a small richly chased metal casket  placing it on the table he opened it and turning it upside down poured from it a little cataract of glittering jewellery  ha  my friend exclaimed his companion you have got a prize  where did you find it  i might answer what is that to you but i wont for i wish to keep you in good humour till our business is concluded  here then are the facts connected with the case  not long ago some englishmen came out to hongkong to dive to a vessel which had been wrecked on an island off the coast  my worthy agent there dwarro cast his eyes on them and soon found out all about their plans  dwarro is a very intelligent fellow  like yourself he has a good deal of the sneaking robber about him  he ascertained that the wreck had much gold coin in it and so managed that they hired his boat to go off to it with their diving apparatus  somewhat against their will he accompanied them  they were very successful  the first time they went on shore they took with them gold to the value of about twenty thousand pounds  dwarro cleverly managed to have this secured a few hours after it was landed  he also made arrangements to have a fleet of my fellows ready so that when more gold had been recovered from the wreck they might surround them on the spot and secure it  but the young englishman at the head of the party was more than a match for us  he cowed dwarro and cleverly escaped to land  there however another of my agents had the good fortune to discover the englishmen while they were landing their gold  he was too late indeed to secure the gold which had been sent on inland in charge of two chinamen but he was lucky enough to discover this casket in the sternsheets of their boat  the englishmen fought hard for it especially the young fellow in command who was more like a tiger than a man and knocked down half a dozen of our men before he was overpowered we would have cut his throat then and there but a party of inhabitants guided by one of the chinamen came to the rescue and we were glad to push off with what we had got  now moses this casket is worth a good round sum  dwarro wisely took the trouble to make inquiries about it through one of the chinamen who happened to be an honest man and fortunately also very stupid  from this man chokfoo who is easily imposed on he learned that the casket belongs to a very rich english merchant who would give anything to recover it because it belonged to his wife who is dead  a rich english merchant interrupted moses we jews are acquainted pretty well with all the rich english merchants  do you know his name  yes charles hazlit answered the malay  indeed  wellgo on  well said pungarin abruptly i have nothing more to say except what will you give for these things  one thousand pounds would be a large sum to offer said the jew slowly  and a very small one to accept returned pungarin as he slowly gathered the gems together and put them back into the casket  nay my friend be not so hasty said moses what do you ask for them  i shall ask nothing replied the malay the fact is i think it probable that i may be able to screw more than their value out of mr hazlit  i am sorry to disappoint your expectations returned the jew with something approaching to a sneer as he rose and selecting one from a pile of english newspapers slowly read out to his companion the announcement of the failure of the firm of hazlit and company  you see my good friend we jews are very knowing as well as sharp  it were better for you to transact your little business with me  knowing and sharp as he was the jew was not sufficiently so to foresee the result of his line of conduct with the malay rover  instead of giving in and making the best of circumstances that freebooter with characteristic impetuosity shut the steel box with a loud snap put it under his arm rose and walked out of the place without uttering a word  he went down to the beach and rowed away leaving moses to moralise on the uncertainty of all human affairs  favouring gales carried the malay piratejunk swiftly to the east  the same gales checked baffled and retarded the schooner fairy queen on her voyage to the west  darling aileen said miss pritty recovering from a paroxysm did you ever hear of any one dying of seasickness  i never did answered aileen with a languid smile  both ladies lay in their berths their pale cheeks resting on the woodwork thereof and their eyes resting pitifully on each other  it is awfulhorrible sighed miss pritty at at the end of another paroxysm  aileen who was not so ill as her friend smiled but said nothing  miss pritty was past smiling but not quite past speaking  what dreadful noises occur on board ships she said after a long pause such rattling and thumping and creaking and stamping perhaps the sailors get their feet wet and are so cold that they require to stamp constantly to warm them  aileen displayed all her teeth and said perhaps  at that moment the stamping became so great and was accompanied by so much shouting that both ladies became attentive  a few moments later their door opened violently and mr hazlit appeared with a very pale face  he was obviously in a state of great perturbation  my dears he said hurriedly excuse my intrudingwe areattacked piratesget up put on your things  his retreat and the closing of the door was followed by a crash overhead and a yell  immediately after the schooner quivered from stem to stern under the shock of her only carronade which was fired at the moment the shot being accompanied by a loud cheer  oh horror exclaimed miss pritty my worst fears are realised  poor miss pritty was wrong  like many people whose worst fears have been engendered at a civilised fireside she was only beginning to realise a few of her fears  she lived to learn that her worst fears were mere childs play to the worlds dread realities  her seasickness however vanished as if by magic and in a few minutes she and her companion were dressed  during those few minutes the noise on deck had increased and the shouts yells and curses told them too plainly that men were engaged in doing what we might well believe is the work only of devils  then shrieks of despair followed  presently all was silent  in a few minutes the cabin door opened and pungarin entered  go on deck he said in a quiet tone  the poor ladies obeyed  on reaching the deck the first sight that met them was mr hazlit standing by the binnacle  a malay pirate with a drawn sword stood beside him but he was otherwise unfettered  they evidently thought him harmless  near to him stood the skipper of the fairy queen with the stern resolution of a true briton on his countenance yet with the sad thoughtful glance of one trained under christian influences in his eye  his hands were bound and a malay pirate stood on either side of him  he was obviously not deemed harmless  the decks were everywhere covered with blood but not a man of the crew was to be seen  you are the captain of this schooner asked pungarin  yes replied the prisoner firmly  have you treasure on board  no  we shall soon find out the truth as to that  meanwhile who is this pointing to mr hazlit  the captain was silent and thoughtful for a few moments  he was well aware of the nature of the men with whom he had to do  he had seen his crew murdered in cold blood  he knew that his own end drew near  this gentleman he said slowly is a wealthy british merchant wellknown and respected in england  he has rich friends  it may be worth your while to spare him  and this added the pirate captain pointing to aileen  is his only child answered the other  your name asked pungarin  charles hazlit said the hapless merchant  a sudden flash of intelligence lit up for a moment the swarthy features of the pirate  it passed quickly  then he spoke in an undertone to one of his men who with the assistance of another led the captain of the schooner to the forward part of the ship  a stifled groan followed by a plunge was heard by the horrified survivors  that was all they ever knew of the fate of their late captain  but for what some would term a mere accident even that and their own fate would have remained unknown to the worldat least during the revolution of time  the romances of life are often enacted by commonplace people  many good ships with ordinary people on board like you and me reader leave port and are never again heard of  who can tell what tales may be revealed in regard to such in eternity  the fairy queen was one of those vessels whose fate it was to have her fate revealed in time  we cannot state with certainty what were the motives which induced pungarin to spare the lives of mr hazlit and his family all we know is that he transferred them to his junk  after taking everything of value out of the schooner he scuttled her  not many days after he attacked a small hamlet on the coast of borneo massacred most of the men saved a few of the young and powerful of themto serve his purposesalso some of the younger women and children and continued his voyage  the poor english victims whom he had thus got possession of lived meanwhile in a condition of what we may term unreality  they could not absolutely credit their senses  they felt strangely impelled to believe that a hideous nightmare had beset themthat they were dreaming that they would unquestionably awake at last and find that it was time to get up to a substantial and very commonplace english breakfast  but mingled with this feeling or rather underlying it there was a terrible assurance that the dream was true  so is it throughout life what is fiction to you reader is fact to some one else and that which is your fact is some one elses fiction  if any lesson is taught by this surely it is the lesson of sympathythat we should try more earnestly than we do to throw ourselves out of ourselves into the place of others  poor miss pritty and aileen learned this lesson  from that date forward instead of merely shaking their heads and sighing in a hopeless sort of way and doing nothingor nearly nothingto check the evils they deplored they became redhot enthusiasts in condemning piracy and slavery which latter is the grossest form of piracy and despotism of every kind whether practised by a private pirate like pungarin or by a weak pirate like the sultan of zanzibar or by comparatively strong pirates like the nations of spain and portugal  in course of time the piratejunk anchored at the mouth of a river and much of her freight with all her captives was transferred to native boats  these were propelled by means of numerous oars and the male captives were now set to work at these oars  mr hazlit and his daughter and miss pritty were allowed to sit idle in the stem of one of the boats and for a time they felt their drooping spirits revive a little under the influence of the sweet sunshine while they rowed along shore but as time passed these feelings were rudely put to flight  the captives were various in their character and nationality as well as in their spirits and temperaments  these had all to be brought into quick subjection and working order  there were far more captives than the pirates knew what to do with  one of those who sat on the thwart next to the hazlits had been a policeman in one of the china ports  he was a highspirited young fellow  it was obvious that his soul was seething into rebellion  the pirate in charge of the boat noted the fact and whispered to one of his men who thereupon ordered the policeman to pull harder and accompanied his order with a cut from a bamboo cane  instantly the youth sprang up and tried to burst his bonds  he succeeded but before he could do anything he was overpowered by half a dozen men and rebound  then two men sat down beside him each with a small stick with which they beat the muscles of his arms and legs until their power was completely taken away  this done they left him a living heap of impotent flesh in the bottom of the boat and a salutary warning to the rebellious  but it did not end here  as soon as the poor fellow had recovered sufficiently to move he was again set to the oar and forced to row as best he could  the voyage along the coast and up a river into which they finally turned occupied several days  at first on starting aileen and her companions had looked with tender pity on the captives as they toiled at the heavy oars but this deepened into earnest solicitude as they saw them after hours of toil gasping for want of water and apparently faint from want of food  next day although they had lain down in the bottom of the boat supperless the rest had refreshed most of them and they pulled on with some degree of vigour  but noon came and with it culminated the heat of a burning sun  still no water was served out no food distributed  mr hazlit and his party had biscuit and water given them in the morning and at noon  during the latter meal aileen observed the native policeman regarding her food with such eager wolfish eyes that under an impulse of uncontrollable feeling she held out her can of water to him  he seized and drank the half of it before one of the pirates had time to dash it from his lips  presently a youth who seemed less robust than his comrades uttered a wild shriek threw up his hands and fell backwards  at once the pirates detached him from his oar threw him into the sea and made another captive fill his place  and now to their inexpressible horror the hazlits discovered that the practice of these wretcheswhen they happened to have a superabundance of captiveswas to make them row on without meat or drink until they dropt at the oar and then throw them overboard  reader we do not deal in fiction here we describe what we have heard from the mouth of a trustworthy eyewitness  in these circumstances the harrowing scenes that were enacted before the english ladies were indeed fitted to arouse that horror which poor miss pritty in her innocence had imagined to have reached its worst we will pass it over  many of the captives died  a few of the strongest survived and these at last were fed a little in order to enable them to complete the journey  among them was the native policeman who had suddenly discovered that his wisest course of action in the meantime was submission  at last the boats reached a village in one of those rivers whose low and wooded shores afford shelter to too many nests of malay pirates even at the present timeand no wonder  when the rulers and grandees of some eastern nations live by plunder what can be expected of the people  the few captives who survived were sent ashore  among them were our english friends    chapter fifteen  sudden and bad news induces sudden and good action  about this time there hung a dark cloud over the pagoda in hongkong even the bright eyes of molly machowl could not pierce through this cloud  rooney himself had lost much of his hopeful disposition  as for edgar berrington joe baldwin and david maxwell they were silently depressed for adversity had crushed them very severely of late  immediately after their losses as already detailed or referred to stormy weather had for several weeks prevented them from resuming operations at the wreck and when at last they succeeded in reaching the old locality they found themselves so closely watched by shore boats that the impossibility of their being able to keep anything they should bring up became obvious  they were forced therefore to give up the idea of making further attempts  its too bad growled maxwell one morning at breakfast that all our trouble and expense should end in nothinor next to nothin  come maxwell said edgar dont say nothing  it is true we lost our first great find that luckless night when we left it with wilson but our second haul is safe and though it amounts only to eight thousand pounds sterling that after all is not to be sneezed at by men in our circumstances  make not haste to be rich muttered joe baldwin in an undertone  did we make haste to be rich asked edgar smiling  it seems to me that we set about it in a cool quiet businesslike way  humph thats true but we got uncommon keen over itsomethin like what gamblers do  our overkeenness returned edgar was not right perhaps but our course of action was quite legitimatefor it is a good turn done not only to ourselves but to the world when we save property and the salvor of propertywho necessarily risks so muchis surely worthy of a good reward in kind  troth an thats true said rooney with a wry grin i had quite made up me mind to a carridge and four with molly astore sittin in silks an satins inside  molly would much rather sit in cotton said the lady referred to as she presided at the breakfasttable have another cup rooney an dont be talking nonsense  but it does seem hard continued maxwell in his growling voice after all our trouble in thin venture to be obliged to take to divin at mere harbourworks in eastern waters just to keep body and soul together  never mind boy exclaimed rooney with a successful effort at heartiness it wont last longits only till we get a suitable chance of a ship to take us an our small fortins back to ould irelandor england if ye prefer itthough its my own opinion that england is only an irish colony  never say die  sure weve seen a dale of life too in them parts  come ill give ye a sintiment an well drink it in tay  before the hopeful irishman could give the sentiment he was interrupted by the sudden opening of the door and the abrupt entrance of a chinaman who looked at the breakfast party with keen interest and some anxiety  if its your grandmother youre lookin for said rooney she dont live here young man  paying no attention to this pleasantry the chinaman closed the door with an air of mystery and going up to edgar looked him inquiringly in the face as he said interrogatively  is pleeceman  yous eggirbringting  not a bad attempt exclaimed edgar with a laugh  i suppose that is my name translated into chinese  took me mucheelongtime for learn him from young missee said the chinaman with a hurt look  at the mention of a young lady edgars amused look changed into one of anxiety for he had through an english acquaintance in the port become aware not only of mr hazlits failure but of his sudden departure for england with his daughter and miss pritty and a vague suspicion of bad news flashed upon him  you bring a message i see he said rising and speaking hurriedly let me hear it  quick  thus invoked the chinaman spoke so quickly and in such a miraculous jumble of bad english that edgar could not comprehend him at allonly one thing he felt quite sure of namely that his anxiety was well found  ho  chokfoo he shouted  the domestic entered and to him the chinaman delivered his message which was to the following effect  he was a native policeman who had been captured on the coast when in discharge of his duties  many others had been taken by the same pirates at different times and among them an english gentleman named hazlit with his daughter and a lady friend  these latter had been spared probably with a view to ransom at the time the crew of their vessel was massacred and were at that moment in one of the strongholds belonging to the pirates up one of the intricate rivers on the coast of borneo he the policeman having resolved to make his escape and being in virtue of his wise wily and constabular nature well able to do so had mentioned the circumstance to the young lady and under promise of a handsome reward had agreed to travel and voyage night and day by boat or vessel as fortune should favour him in order to convey immediate intelligence of these facts to a youth named eggirbringting whom the young lady described as being very tall and stout and extremely handsome  it may easily be imagined with what mingled feelings of anxiety and impatience the tall stout and extremely handsome young man listened to this narrative as it was volubly delivered by the pleeceman and slowly translated by chokfoo  when at last he was fairly in possession of all that the messenger had to relate edgar paced up and down the room for a few seconds with rapid strides  we must go into action at once sir suggested joe baldwin  of course of course but how  thats the point exclaimed edgar with a look of impatient vexation  borneo is a long way off  there are no steamers running regularly to it that i know of  however its of no use talking lets go at once and make inquiry  ill go see our consulperhaps  plhaps interrupted the messenger plhaps the pleeceman can talkee  if he can let him speak cried edgar with impatience  pleece he nevir too muchee quick returned the man coolly  we knows what wes can do  hai yach  edgar sat down with a sharp sigh of discontent and waited for more  well  well repeated the policeman there be steamboat here nowgo for borneo quick  at once cried edgar starting up and seizing his hat why did you not  sh  keepee cool you no casion makes so fashion interrupted the policeman who thereupon went on to explain that on his arrival in hongkong he had gone at once to headquarters before delivering his message to edgar in order to make himself master of all the news about town that was worth knowing or likely in any way to advance the interest of those whom he sought to serve  among other things he had learned the important fact that two days before his arrival a small gunboat belonging to a certain rajah of borneo and commanded by a certain scotchman and employed for the express purpose of hunting up and rooting out the pirates of the china seas had put in to the port for repairs  he had hurried down to the gunboat in time to prevent her departure had told his story and had just come from her to say that her captain would like much to see mr berrington  on hearing this edgar again started up and eagerly ordered the native policeman to guide him to the gunboat in question without another moments delay  he was followed of course by his male companions who were nearly as much interested in the matter as himself  they were soon on the deck of the gunboat  it was a neat trim screwsteamer of small size 180 tons burthen and manned by about sixty malays and a few englishmen  everything on board was as bright and orderly as if it had been a british manofwar  her commander received the visitors on the quarterdeck  he looked like one who was eminently well qualified to hunt up run down cut out or in any other mode make away with pirates  there was much of the bullterrier in himsolid broad short largechestedno doubt also largeheartedactive in the prime of life with short black curly hair a short black beard and moustache a square chin a pleasant smile a prominent nose and an eagle eye  indeed he might himself have made a splendid chief of the very race against which he waged war to the knife  glad to make your acquaintance mr berrington said the captain holding out his hand  the native policeman has told me all about your friendsi understand them to be such  yesintimate friends  well this business is quite in my way  i shall be glad to take you with me  but who are these he added looking at edgars companions  they are comrades and might do good service if you will allow them to volunteer  my crew is complete said the captain doubtfully except indeed that my chief engineer is just dead but none of your men look as if they could fill his shoes  that is true but i can fill them myself said edgar eagerly  indeed  yes i am an engineer by profession my comrades are professional divers  we have been engaged on a wreck here for some time past  good said the captain are your dresses and apparatus at hand  some of them are  then bring them aboard at once  i leave in an hour  just bring what you have handy  lose no time  i will take your men also  they may be of use  within an hour after the foregoing conversation molly machowl was left disconsolate in the pagoda under the care of chokfoo while the rajahs gunboat was steaming out to sea with edgar baldwin rooney maxwell and ramstam added to her warlike crew    chapter sixteen  bearding the lion in his den  steam has pretty well subdued time  fifty years ago it was a mighty feat to put a circle round the globe  nowadays a cookby no means a captainwill take or send you round it in a few weeks  romantic reader dont despair  by such means romance has undoubtedly been affected in some degree but let not that grieve thee  romance has by no means been taken out of the world nor has it been to use an unromantic phrase reduced in quantity or quality  human inventions and appliances alter the aspects of romance and transfer its influences but they cannot destroy a creators gift to the human race  they have indeed taken the romance out of some things which were once romantic but that is simply because they have made such things familiar and commonplace  they have not yet touched other things which still remain in the hallowed region of romance  romance is a region things crowd out of it but other things crowd into it  the romantic soul dwells perpetually in it and while perhaps with regret it recognises the fact that many things depart from that region it also observes with pleasure that many things enter into it and that the entrances are more numerous than the exits  the philosophicoromantic spirit will admit all this and be grateful  the unphilosophicoromantic spirit will not quite see through it and may perchance be perplexed but be of good cheer  have faith  do not let the matteroffact steamengine and the telegraph and the postoffice rob thee of thy joys  they have somewhat modified the flow of the river of romance but they have not touched its fountainheadand never can  why what is romance  despite the teachings of the dictionarieswhich often give us the original and obsolete meaning of wordswe maintain that romance signifies the human souls aspirations after the high and the grand and the good  in its fallen condition the poor soul undoubtedly makes wondrous mistakes in its romantic strainings but these mistakes are comparatively seldom on the side of exaggeration our dictionary says that romance is extravagancea fiction which passes beyond the limits of real life  now we maintain that no onenot even the most romantic of individualsever comes up to real life  we have been a childat least we incline to that beliefand we have been like other children in the habit of romancing as it is called that is according to dictionaries passing beyond the limits of real life into extravagance  we are now a manit is to be hopedhave travelled far and seen much and yet we can say conscientiously that the wildest fancies of our most romantic moods in childhood have been immeasurably surpassed by the grand realities of actual life  what are the most brilliant fancies of a child or of a mere ignorant romancer compared to the amazing visions of the arctic regions or the high alps which we have seen  fictions and extravagance  all our wildest sallies are but intravagance and feeble fancy compared with the sublimity of fact no doubt there are men and women gifted with the power of burlesquing reality and thus not going beyond its limits but causing much dust and confusion within its limits by the exaggeration and falsification of individual facts  this however is not romance  we stand up for romance as being the bright staircase that leads childhood to reality and culminates at last in that vision which the eye of man hath not yet seen nor his mind conceived a vision which transcends all romance is itself the greatest of all realities and is laid up for the people of god  we return from this divergence to the point which led to itthe power of steam to subdue time  no doubt it was unromantic enough to be pushed propelled thrust willing or not willing against or with wind and tide so that you could gauge your distance runand to be runalmost to a foot but it was very satisfactory nevertheless especially to those whose hearts were far in advance of their vessel and it was more than satisfactory when at the end of their voyage of a few days they found themselves gliding swiftly almost noiselessly up the windings of a quiet river whose picturesque scenery romantic vistas and beautiful reflections might have marked it the entrance to a paradise instead of a human pandemonium  it was very early when the gunboat entered the stream  the mists of morning still prevailed and rendered all nature fairylike weirdlooking mangrove bushes rose on their leglike roots from the water as if independent of soil  vigorous parasites and creepers strove to strangle the larger trees but strove in vain  thick jungle concealed wealth of feathered insect and reptile life including the reptile man and sundry notes of warning told that these were awaking to their daily toilthe lower animals to fulfil the ends of their being the higher animal to violate some of the most blessed laws of his creator  gradually the sun rose and dispelled the mists while it warmed everything into strong vitality  as they passed up clouds of waterfowl rose whirring from their lairs and luxuriant growth of weeds threatened to obstruct the progress of the steamer  come here policeman said the captain to the native functionary how far above this did you say is the nest of the vipers  bout tree mile  humph ejaculated the captain turning to berrington who had come on deck at the moment  i never went higher up the river than this point for just ahead there are reeds enough to stop the screw of a three thousand ton ship but if youll get your divingdresses ready ill try it  it would be much better to bring our big guns to bear on them than to attack in boats  ill have em ready directly said edgar  perhaps wed better stop the engines now  just so stop them  the engines were stopped and the gunboat glided slowly over the still water until it came to rest on its own inverted image  meanwhile the airpump was rigged and joe baldwin put on his dress to the great interest and no little surprise of the malay crew  ready sir said edgar when joe sat costumed with the helmet at his side and his friends rooney and maxwell at the pumps  go ahead thenfull steam said the captain  just in front of the vessel the river was impeded quite across by a dense growth of rank reeds and sedges a little further on there was clear water  into this the gunboat plunged under full steam  as was expected the screw soon became choked and finally stopped  had the pirates expected this they would probably have made a vigorous attack just then  but the danger being so obvious had never before been incurred and was therefore not prepared for or taken advantage of by the pirates  nevertheless the captain was ready for them if they had attacked  every man was at his station armed to the teeth  the moment the boat began to work heavily joes helmet was put on and when she came to a stand he went over the stern by means of a ropeladder prepared for the purpose  be as active as you can joe  got everything you want said edgar taking up the bullseye  all right sir said joe  pump away cried edgar looking over his shoulder  next moment joe was under water and the malays with glaring eyes and open mouths were gazing at the confusion of airbubbles that arose from him continually  from their looks it seemed as though some of them fancied the whole affair to be a new species of torture invented by their captain  joe carried a small hatchet in his girdle and a long sharp knife in his hand  with these he attacked the reeds and weeds and in ten minutes or less had set the screw free  he soon reappeared on the ropeladder and edgar who had been attending to his lines removed the bullseye  what now joe he asked  all clear said joe coming inboard  what  done it already  ay steam ahead when you like sir  the order was given at once  the assistant engineer put on full steam and the gunboat crashing through the remaining obstruction floated into the comparatively clear water beyond  the screw had been again partially fouled of course but ten minutes more of our divers knife and axe set it free and the vessel proceeded on her way  scouts from the piratecamp had been watching the gunboat for they had counted on nothing worse than an attack by boats which strong in numbers they could easily have repelled  great therefore was the consternation when these scouts ran in and reported that the vessel had cleared the obstructions by some miraculous power which they could not explain or understand and was now advancing on them under full steam  while the operations we have described were being carried out on board the gunboat in the pirate village poor mr hazlit was seated on a stump outside a rude hut made chiefly of bamboos and palm leaves  he wore only his trousers and shirt both sadly tornone of the pirates having taken a fancy to his coat and vest the former of which he wore round his loins with his legs thrust through the sleeves  the captive merchant sat with his face buried in his hands and bowed on his knees  inside the hut sat aileen with poor miss pritty resting on her bosom miss pritty was of a tender confiding nature and felt it absolutely necessary to rest on somebodys bosom  she would rather have used a cats or dogs than none  aileen being affectionate and sympathetic had no objection  nevertheless not being altogether of angelic extraction she was a little put out by the constant tremors of her friend  come dear dont shudder so fearfully she said in a half coaxing half remonstrative tone  is he gone asked miss pritty in a feeble voice with her eyes tight shut  she referred to a halfnaked warrior who had entered the hut had half shut his great eyes and had displayed a huge cavern of red gum and white teeth in an irresistible smile at the woebegone aspect of miss pritty  he had then silently taken his departure  gone repeated aileen rather sharply of course he is and if he were not what then  sure his being dark and rather lightly clothed is not calculated to shock you so much  aileen exclaimed miss pritty raising her head suddenly and gazing with anxiety into the face of her friend has our short residence among these wretches begun to remove that delicacy of mind and sentiment for which i always admired you  no returned aileen firmly but your excessive alarms may have done something towards that end  nay forgive me dear she added gently as miss prittys head sank again on her shoulder with a sob i did not mean to hurt your feelings but really if you only think of it our present position demands the utmost resolution caution and fortitude of which we are capable and you know love that this shuddering at trifles and imagining of improbabilities will tend to unfit you for action when the time arrives as it surely will sooner or later for my father has taken the wisest steps for our deliverance and besides a greater than my father watches over us  that is true dear assented miss pritty with a tender look  now you speak like your old self but you must not blame me for being so foolish  indeed i know that i am but then have not my worst fears been realised  are we not in the handsactually in the handsof piratesreal pirates buccaneersugh  again the poor lady drooped her head and shuddered  your worst fears may have been realised said aileen but we have certainly not experienced the worst that might have happened  on the contrary we have been remarkably well treatedwhat do you say  fed on rats and roast puppies  well the things they send us may be such for they resemble these creatures as much as anything else but they are well cooked and very nice you must allow and  at that moment aileens tongue was suddenly arrested and figuratively speaking miss prittys blood curdled in her veins and her heart ceased to beat for without an instants warning the woods resounded with a terrific salvo of artillery grape and canister shot came tearing hissing and crashing through the trees and fierce yells mingled with fiendlike shrieks rent the air  both ladies sat as if transfixedpale mute and motionless  next moment mr hazlit sprang into the hut glaring with excitement while a stream of blood trickled from a slight wound in his forehead  uttering a yell no whit inferior to that of the fiercest pirate near him and following it up with a fit of savage laughter that was quite appalling the once dignified and selfpossessed merchant rolled his eyes round the hut as if in search of something  suddenly espying a heavy pole or species of warclub which lay in a corner he seized it and whirled it round his head as if he had been trained to such arms from childhood  just then a second salvo shook the very earth  mr hazlit sprang out of the hut shouted to the rescue  aileen to the rescue in the voice of a stentor plunged wildly into a forestpath and disappeared almost before the horrified ladies could form a guess as to his intentions    chapter seventeen  recounts the wild fierce and in some respects peculiar incidents of a bush fight  although the pirates were taken aback by this unexpected advance of the rajahs gunboat to within pistolshot of their very doors they were by no means cowed  malays are brave as a race and peculiarly regardless of their lives  they manned their guns and stood to them with unflinching courage but they were opposed by men of the same mettle who had the great advantage of being better armed and led by a man of consummate coolness and skill whose motto wasconquer or die  we do not say that the captain of the gunboat professed to hold that motto for he was not a boaster but it was clearly written in the fire of his eye and stamped upon the bridge of his nose  the pirateguns were soon dismounted their stockade was battered down and when a party at last landed with the captain at their head and edgar with his diving friends close at his heels they were driven out of their fortification into the woods  previously to this however all the women and children had been sent further into the bush so that the attacking party met none but fightingmen  turning round a bend in a little path among the bushes edgar who had become a little separated from his friends came upon a halfnaked malay who glared at him from behind a long shield  the pirates style of fighting was that of the malay race in general and had something ludicrous as well as dangerous about it  he did not stand up and come on like a man but with his long legs wide apart and bent at the knees he bounded hither and thither like a monkey always keeping his body well under cover of the shield and peering round its edges or over or even under it according to fancy while his right hand held a light spear ready to be launched at the first favourable moment into the unprotected body of his adversary  edgar at once rushed upon him snapping his revolver as he ran but all the chambers having been already emptied no shot followed  brandishing his cutlass he uttered an involuntary shout  the shout was unexpectedly replied to by another shout of aileen to the rescue which not only arrested him in his career but seemed to perplex the pirate greatly  at that moment the bushes behind the latter opened a man in ragged shirtsleeves and torn trousers sprang through whirled a mighty club in the air and smote the pirates uplifted shield with such violence as to crush it down on its owners head and lay him flat and senseless on the ground  mr hazlit gasped edgar  the merchant bounded at our hero with the fury of a wild cat and would have quickly laid him beside the pirate if he had not leaped actively aside  a small tree received the blow meant for him and the merchant passed on with another yell to the rescue  of course edgar followed but the bush paths were intricate  he unfortunately turned into a wrong one when the fugitive was for a moment hidden by a thicket and immediately lost all trace of him  meanwhile rooney machowl hearing the merchants shout turned aside to respond to it  he met mr hazlit right in the teeth and owing to his not expecting an assault had like edgar wellnigh fallen by the hand of his friend  as it was he evaded the huge club by a hairsbreadth and immediately gave chase to the maniacfor such the poor gentleman had obviously become  but although he kept the fugitive for some time in view he failed to come up with him owing to a stumble over a root which precipitated him violently on his nose  on recovering his feet mr hazlit was out of sight  rooney caressing with much tenderness his injured nose now sought to return to his friends but the more he tried to do so the farther he appeared to wander away from them  sure its a quare thing that i cant git howld of the road i comed by he muttered as with a look of perplexity he paused and listened  faint shouts were heard on his left and he was about to proceed in that direction when distinct cries arose on his right  he went in that direction for a time then vacillated and finally came to a dead stand as well as to the conclusion that he had missed his way which belief he stated to himself in the following soliloquy  rooney me boy youve gone an lost yoursilf  ah bad scran to ee isnt it the fulfilment of your grandmothers owld prophecy that youd come to a bad ind at last  its little id care for your misfortin myself if it warnt that you ought to be helpin poor mr hazlit whos gone as mad as blazes an whose daughter cant be far off  och  man alive he added with sudden enthusiasm niver give in while theres a purty girl in the case  under the impulse of this latter sentiment rooney started off at a run in a new and totally unconsidered direction which strange to say brought him into sudden and very violent contact with some of those individuals in whom he was interested  here we must in hunters language hark back on our course for a few minutesif indeed that be hunters language  we do not profess to know much thereof but the amiable reader will understand our meaning  just after the attack had begun and mr hazlit had sallied from the hut with his warclub as already related aileen became deeply impressed with the fact that all the women and children who had been wont to visit and gaze at her in wonder had vanished  the rattling of shot over her head too and the frequent rush of pirates past her temporary abode warned her that the place was too much exposed in every way to be safe she therefore sought to rouse her companion to attempt flight  laura she said anxiously as a round shot cut in half the left cornerpost of the building come we must fly  we shall be killed if we remain here  i care not exclaimed miss pritty clasping her friend closer than ever and shuddering my worst fears have been realised  let me die  but i dont want to die yet remonstrated aileen think of me dear if you can and of my father  ah true exclaimed miss pritty with sudden calmness as she unclasped her arms and arose  forgive my selfishness  come let us fly  if the poor lady had owned a private pair of cherubic wings she could not have prepared for flight with greater assurance or activity  she tightened her waistbelt wrapped her shawl firmly round her fastened her bonnet strings in a gordian knot and finally holding out her hand to her friend as if they had suddenly changed characters said come are you ready with a tremendous show of decision  she even led the wondering aileen along a winding path into the jungle for a considerable distance then as the path became more intricate she stopped burst into tears laid her head again on its old restingplace and said in a hollow voiceyes all is lost  come laura dont give way theres a dear  just exert yourself a little and we shall soon be safe atatsomewhere  miss pritty made a vigorous struggle  she even smiled through her tears as she repliedwell lead on love i will follow youto death  with her eyes tightly shut lest she should see something hideous in the woods she stumbled on holding to her friends arm  where are we going to she asked feebly after a few minutes during which aileen had pulled her swiftly along  i dont know dear but a footpath must lead to something or somewhere  aileen was wrong  the footpath led apparently to nothing and nowhere at all events it soon became so indistinct that they lost it and finally after an hours wandering found themselves hopelessly involved in the intricacies of a dense jungle without the slightest clew as to how they should get out of it  aileen stopped at last  laura she said anxiously we are lost  i told you so returned miss pritty in a tone that was not quite devoid of triumph  true dear but when you told me so we were not lost  now we are i fear we shall have to spend the night here she added looking round  miss pritty opened her eyes and also looked round  the sight that met her gaze was not encouraging  afternoon was drawing on  thick bushes and trees formed a sort of twilight there even at noonday  nothing with life was visible  not a sound was to be heard save such little rustlings of dry leaves and chirpings as were suggestive of snakes and centipedes  the unhappy laura was now too frightened to shudder  what shall we do she asked shriek for help  that might bring pirates to us instead of friends said aileen listen do you hear no sound  nothing replied miss pritty after a few moments of intense silence save the beating of my own heart  aileen she continued with sudden anxiety are there not serpents in these woods  yes i believe there are  and tarantulas  probably  and tortoises  iim not sure  darling how can we sleep among tortoises tarantulas and serpents  even aileen was at a loss for a reply though she smiled in spite of herself  ill tell you what she said cheerfully if we must spend the night in the bush we shall get into a tree  that will at least save us from all the venomous creatures as well as dangerous beasts that crawl upon the ground  can you climb  climb repeated miss pritty with a hysterical laugh you might as well ask me if i can dive  well you must learn  come i will teach you  here is a capital tree that seems easy to get into  saying this aileen ran to a gnarled old tree whose trunk was divided into two parts and from which spread out a series of stout branches that formed a sort of network of foliage about eight or ten feet from the ground  climbing actively up to these branches she crept out upon them and from that position parting the twigs she looked down laughingly at her friend  her bright spirit was contagious  miss pritty almost forgot her anxieties smiled in return and walked towards the tree in doing which she trod on something that moved in the grass  a piercing shriek was the result  it was immediately replied to by a wild yell at no great distance  it was only a frog look i see it now hopping away  do be quick laura i am sure that was the yell of a savage  no further spur was needed  miss pritty scrambled up into the tree and crept towards her friend with such reckless haste that one of her feet slipped off the branch and her leg passing through the foliage appeared in the regions below  recovering herself she reached what she deemed a place of security  now dear we are safeat least for a time said aileen arranging her friends disordered dress  take care however you must be careful to trust only to limbs of the tree the foliage cannot bear you  look you can see through it to the ground  lean your back against this fork here sit on this placeso put your foot on this branch therewhy it is almost like a chairhush  it was quite unnecessary to impose silence  they both sat among the branches as motionless as though they had been parts of the tree  they scarce dared to breathe while they peered through the foliage and beheld the dim form of a man advancing  whoever he was the man seemed to growl as though he had been allied to the beasts of the jungle  he came forward slowly looking from side to side with caution and stopping directly under the tree of refuge said  musha with great emphasis then placing both hands to his mouth he gave vent to a roar that would have done credit to a south african lion  as neither of the ladies understood the meaning of musha they listened to the roar with a thrill of unutterable horror  miss pritty as if fascinated leant forward the better to observe her foe suddenly like the lightningflash and without even a shriek of warning she lost her balance and dived headforemost into the bosom of rooney machowl  well was it for the bold irishman that miss pritty was a light weight else had he that day ended his career in the jungles of borneo  as it was he went down like a shock of corn before the scythe grasped miss pritty in an embrace such as she had never before even imagined and proceeded to punch her poor head  then indeed she made herself known by a powerful scream that caused the horrified man to loose his hold and spring up with a torrent of apologies and selfabuse  och its not possible  baste that i am  oh ma cushla astore forgive me  its a gorilla i thought ye was sure for i hadnt time to look dee see  its wishin you had staved in my timbers intirely i am  rooneys exclamations were here cut short and turned on another theme by the sudden appearance of aileen hazlit who soon found that her friend was more alarmed than hurt  i am so glad you have found us and so surprised said aileen who had met rooney in england during one of her visits to joe baldwins abode for we have quite lost ourselves  rooney looked a little awkwardly at the fair girl  sure its glad i am myself that ive found you he said but faix im lost too  i do belave howiver that somebodys goin to find us  he turned his head aside and listened intently  presently a cry was heard at no great distance  it was replied to by another  pirates said rooney in a hoarse whisper drawing a cutlass from his belt  as he spoke another cry was heard in an opposite direction  friends exclaimed rooney  sure were surrounded by friends and foes  come git into the tree ladies  ill give a hail an if the varmin should come up first ill kape them in play  dont show yer purty faces dears an be as aisy as ye can  so saying rooney gave vent to a true british cheer while the ladies ascended once more into the tree  the cheer was instantly replied to by countercheers and howls  a minute more and two halfnaked malays armed with spears and long shields bounded into the clear space and attacked the irishman but rooney had placed his back to the tree and was ready for them  although he was scarcely a match for two such men whose peculiar and bounding mode of fighting he did not understand rooney nevertheless quickly disabled one by the sheer strength of a blow which cut through the shield and wounded his enemys head  the other he sprang upon like a wild cat and grappled with him  at that moment a third malay glided on the scene brandished his spear and stood by the swaying combatants awaiting a favourable opportunity to thrust his weapon into the white mans back  he stood right under the branch in which the ladies were concealed  miss pritty saw his intention and felt convinced he would succeed  in desperate alarm at the danger of her protector and horrified at what she was about to do she grasped the pirate by the hair and tore out a large handful at the same time uttering shriek upon shriek mingled with appalling bursts of hysterical laughter  this saved rooney who turned just in time to protect himself but as he did so six more pirates leaped upon the scene and overpowered him  they also sprung up the tree and quickly brought down the ladies  poor miss pritty had gone fairly off into violent hysterics by that time  she was carried down in the arms of a pirate into whose hair she had permanently fastened her ten fingers while she filled the woods with unearthly cries  before any advantage however could be taken of this success a cheer was heard close at hand  next moment edgar berrington burst on the scene followed by the captain of the gunboat and a body of men  the pirates did not await them but fled instantly  fire a volley lads shouted the captain  the men obeyed and one or two yells told that it had not been without effect nevertheless all the miscreants escaped with the exception of miss prittys captive who unable to clear himself from her close embrace with sufficient speed was collared and throttled into submission by edgar  well divide our force here said the captain  ill follow them up a while with some of the boys and you mr berrington will return with the rest to the gunboat in charge of the ladies  edgar was about to object but the captain silenced him at once with  come sir youre under my orders  do what i bid you  there was no resisting this so edgar turned not unwillingly and gave his arm to aileen who seized it with a grateful eagerness that sent a thrill of delight through all his frame  come along my lads he cried  take care of miss pritty poor thing he added turning to rooney  the irishman obeyed  he stooped and lifted her in his arms  she had been lying in a state of semiinsensibility with her eyes tightly shut the moment she felt herself being lifted she clutched her protector by the hair and held on shrieking  ay tug away cushla said rooney as he moved after his friends its not much of that yell manage to root up  have you seen my father asked aileen anxiously as they moved on together  he is safe answered edgar i found him exhausted in the hut which he told me you had occupied and had him conveyed on board the gunboat  thank god exclaimed aileen fervently but she added with a slight shudder it seemed to me as if his mind had been unhingedand and he was wounded  a mere scratch on the temple said edgar yet sufficient with surrounding circumstances to account for the temporary madness that assailed him  fear not aileen he is safe now through gods mercy and you shall soon be safe beside him  a feeling of deep gratitude and restfulness stole over the poor girls spirit and she almost wept for joy as they stepped into a small boat and were rowed over the calm water to the gunboat which lay black and still under the deep shadow of a bank of luxuriant foliage  my child said mr hazlit sadly as they reclined together on the couches of the little cabin while edgar sat on a campstool near them miss pritty having been consigned to the captains berth they tell me that this fearful work is not yet over  there is to be more fighting and bloodshed  how  what do you mean papa  tell her mr berrington  we have just had news sent us by a fast rowboat from a town about sixty miles along the coast that a large fleet of pirateprows have been seen off the coast  they have taken several trading prows and captured many men belonging to the sarawak territory besides several chinamen when our captain completes his work on shore here he intends to start at once in chase of these pirates in the hope of destroying them and freeing their slaves  god help us said aileen it seems as if men in this part of the world gloried in pouring out blood like water  some of them undoubtedly do  perhaps it may reconcile your mind to the destruction of these miscreants to know that for every one killed there will probably be saved the lives of dozensif not hundredsof innocent men and women whom he would have murdered or doomed to hopeless slavery in the course of his wicked career  as edgar spoke the sound of oars was heard  presently the captain and his men leaped on deck  the moorings were cast loose our hero took his station at the engine and the gunboat glided swiftly down the river leaving the pirate stronghold in flames    chapter eighteen  lifts the curtain slightly as to piratical doings in the nineteenth century  silently they glided on until the shades of evening fell and the brilliant stars came out  silently for the gunboat went at halfspeed silently for her engines were good and new and worked softly without the jarring of age or malconstruction silently because those on board were in a tranquil mood and did not raise their voices above a low murmur  how romantic said aileen in a low tone as she sat by the sternrail and watched the gleaming track left by the screw how enjoyable if we could only forget what has just passed and the object we have in view the world is a mystery  is this the first time you have thought so asked edgar who leaned on the rail near her  well i think it is she replied with a sad smile at least it is the first time i have been deeply impressed with the thought  it is a very old thought returned the youth musingly  philosophers from the earliest times have recorded it  thoughtful men and women of all ages have expressed it  young people of all generations fancy they have discovered it  the bible is a key which opens up much of it and makes it plain but much still remains in mystery and i suppose will continue so to remain till time merges in eternity  do you think such mystery undesirable asked aileen  no  it is desirable else god would not have left it there  shall not the judge of all the earth do right  there is a need be i doubt not for mystery and there is no need for our being distressed by it for what we know not now we shall know hereafter  but there is much cause for anxiety lest we either through wilful ignorance or carelessness or stupidity should allow that to remain involved in mystery which is made plain by revelation  the way of salvation was an insurmountable mystery to me once but since you gave me that poor mans testament aileen it has become very plain and very dear to me through jesus christ  aileen thanked god in her heart and a thrill of gladness filled her but before she could utter a word in reply the captain came forward and said in a low tone  stop the engine mr berrington  well lie by in this creek till daybreak  edgar went below  the vibrating of the boat ceased and an awful stillness seemed to sink down upon her as she glided into a little creek or bay which was deeply shaded by mangrove trees  but the silence did not last long  it was still three hours from daylight and the captain employed the time in preparations for the action which he anticipated on the following day  the yards were sent down the decks were cleared of all useless incumbrances the guns were got ready and an attempt was made to some extent to disguise the vessel so that in the event of the pirates being found the gunboat might get as near as possible without her true character being discovered  the men meanwhile who were not engaged in such work busied themselves in sharpening cutlasses and cleaning small arms while they conversed in an undertone  all was activity and order without fuss or needless noisethe result of a man of the right stamp being in command  its a brush well be havin soon said rooney machowl with a flash of the eye which told that he inherited a little of his nations love of fighting  looks like it replied maxwell who sat beside his friend in the midst of a group of the malay crew rubbing up his cutlass with much interest  does anybody know how many of a crew we have altogether asked rooney  i heard the captain say to mr berrington answered joe baldwin who was busy cleaning a rifle that weve got ninety men all told which is quite enough for a 180ton vessel  with these and seven guns we should be more than a match for all the pirates of the eastern seas  ho exclaimed ramstam looking up from the weapon he was engaged on with an amused expression you know noting of pirits of dem seas  hi hi  wait  ramstam said this with the air of one who held the decided opinion that when he had waited joe would have his views enlarged  what are they such bold fellows  ho yis vely muchee bold  caes for noting  flaid of noting  doos amost anytingcept whats good  swate cratures murmured rooney i hope well be introdooced to aich other soon  as it is desirable that the reader should have a little more extended knowledge of the miscreants referred to we will retrace our steps in time a little and change the scene  on one of those sweltering mornings in which the eastern seas appear to have a tendency to boil under the influence of the sun three piratical junks might have been seen approaching a small island which lay on the sea as if on a mirror  they were propelled by oars  the largest of these junks was under command of our redjacketed acquaintance pungarin  it was what is termed doublebanked and the oars were pulled by slaves that is to say the crews of trading vessels recently captured  pungarin had more slaves than he knew what to do with on that occasion he had been unusually successful in his captures  all the white men taken had at once been slaughtered also all who attempted to give the pirates trouble in any way including those who chanced to be too weak ill or old to work  in regard to the rest each man was secured to his place at the oar by means of a strip of cane called rattan fastened round his neck and a man was appointed to lash them when they showed symptoms of flagging  this the unhappy wretches frequently did for as on a former occasion to which we have referred they were made to pull continuously without food or water and occasionally after dropping their oars through exhaustion it took severe application of the lash and the discovery of some unusually sensitive spot of the body to rouse some of them again to the point of labour  the junks were strange uncouth vessels of considerable size capable each of containing a very large crew  they might almost have been styled lifeboats as they had hollow bamboos wrought into their structure in a manner which gave them great buoyancy besides projecting beyond the hulls and forming a sort of outside platform  on these platforms the slaves who rowed were fastened  in each vessel there were at least forty or fifty rowers  pungarin walked up and down his poopdeck as if in meditation paying no regard to what was going on around him until a feeble cry was heard from one of the rowersa middleaged and sickly man  the pirate captain looked carelessly on while the overseer flogged this man but the lash failed to arouse him and the captain ordered the man to desistbut not in mercy  over with him he said curtly and then resumed his walk  the slavedriver drew his knife and cut the rattan that bound the man who turned his dying eyes on him with an imploring look  at that moment one of the pirates who from his dress and bearing seemed to occupy a position of authority stepped upon the platform and looked at him  he gave a brief order to one of his comrades who brought a large piece of cork and fastened it to the slaves neck  he also brought a short spear with a little flag at its handle  this he thrust a few inches into the fleshy part of his shoulder and then pushed him off the platform into the sea  thus the wretched creature was made to float and as he went astern some of the pirates amused themselves by shooting at him with their muskets  now gentle reader dont shut your eyes and exclaim oh  too horrible  it is very much because of that expression of yours and the shutting of your gentle we would rather say selfish eyes that these accursed facts exist  yes we charge it home on you socalled soft ones of the earth that your actionnamely shutting your eyesdoes probably as much if not more to perpetuate horrible evil as does the action of open godlessnessthat condition which is most aptly expressed by the worlds maxim every man for himself and the devil for us all  do not imagine that we presume to invent such things or to exaggerate for the sake of sensation  we relate wellauthenticated facts  we entertain strong doubts as to whether devils are in any degree worse than some among the unsaved human race  there is great occasion for you reader whoever you are to know and ponder such facts as we now relate  we are too apt to regard as being applicable only to the past these words the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty  if we were to fill our book with horrors from beginning to end we should only have scratched the surface of the great and terrible truth  assuredly now not less than in days of old there is urgent need of redhot philanthropy  but we gladly pass from the cruel to the cunning phase of piratical life  these villains had at that time been about six months on their cruise  they had made the entire circuit of borneo murdering and plundering and striking terror and desolation wherever they went  the scenes enacted by norse pirates in the tenth century were repeated in the middle of the nineteenth by a people who unlike the norsemen had no regard whatever for law and now they were returning home laden with booty  the piratechiefs usual mode of procedure on such occasions was to go to an unfrequented island in the neighbourhood of singapore land all his warlike stores and prisoners and leaving them under a strong guard proceed with two of his prows loaded to the gunwale with merchandise to the port  the merchantboats which he had previously sunk and whose crews he had murdered provided him with portclearances which enabled him to personate the trader and regularly enter and clear the customs at singapore so as to cause no suspicion then returning to his place of rendezvous with a fresh supply of guns ammunition etcetera he divided his illgotten gains and recommenced his piratical expeditions  on the present occasion however pungarin had received intelligence which induced him to modify his plans  hearing that a gunboat was in pursuit of him he determined to change his rendezvous for the time  the weary slaves were therefore again set to work at the oars but kind nature took pity on them  a breeze sprang up and increased into a gale under the influence of which the prows sped out to sea and soon left the islands far behind them  it was while thus attempting to evade their enemy that the pirates had the misfortune to run at last into the very jaws of the lion    chapter nineteen  a fight with malay pirates  at six oclock in the morning the tide suiting the gunboat crept out to sea and steamed slowly along the coast to the southward keeping a good lookout  they soon discovered sundry prows but after ordering them to come alongside found that they were legitimate traders  thus the day was spent in a vain search and at night they returned to their anchorage as it was not possible to make any discoveries in the dark  next morning at the same hour they steamed out to sea again intending to keep about twelve miles off the coast so as to be able to command a broad expanse of water in every direction but before they had got two miles from the anchorage three prows were observed about four or five miles to seaward  that looks like the rascals observed the captain as he surveyed them through the glass  indeed said mr hazlit who rather pale and weak from his recent unwonted experiences leaned in a helpless manner on the quarterrails  yes they pull forty or fifty oars doublebanked returned the captain wiping his glass carefully  theyve got heavy guns on board no doubt  we shall have to protect our boiler  the gunboat was so small that a portion of her steamcase was unavoidably exposed above deck  a shot into this would have been disastrous  orders were therefore given to surround it with bags of coal which was promptly done  and one of you said the captain turning to the man who chanced to be nearest him go into the cabin and bring up the sofa cushions we shall want them to protect the legs of the men stationed on the poop  rooney machowl happened to be the man who received this order  he at once descended  by your lave miss he said with a bashful air im sorry to ask a lady to git up but its the captings ordershe wants the cushions  by all means said aileen with a smile why does he want them  plaze miss to protect our legs savin yer presence  somewhat puzzled and not a little amused by the reply aileen rose and allowed the cushion on which she sat to be removed  these cushions were placed in the nettings on the poop which was much exposed to arrest the enemys bullets  in a few minutes it was seen that the three prows were doing their best to get into shoal water where the steamer could not have followed them in this effort one of them was successful for although the gunboats course was changed in order to cut her off she managed to run on shore whence the pirates immediately opened fire  the other two seeing there was no possibility of accomplishing the same feat ceased rowing and also opened fire at a distance of about five or six hundred yards  we shall attack from our port side said the captain to his chief officer let the guns be laid accordingly  the armament of the gunboat consisted of two ninepounder guns one on the forecastle and one on the poop one twelvepounder just before the bridge and four sixpound brass carronades  these were all soon ready but the order was not given to fire till they had got to within a hundred yards of the pirates who were now pelting them smartly with small arms  the captain stood on the bridge the most commanding and at the same time the most exposed position in the vessel  he wore a cap from under which his black eyes seemed to twinkle with fire and mischief  he soon observed that the two prows wincing under his fire were edging for the shore  with that reckless resolution therefore to which all true heroes give way at timesnot excepting nelson himselfhe resolved to run them down  the recklessness of this consisted in the fact that his vessel was not a ram but built of comparatively thin plates  the necessity for it lay in the certainty that a few minutes more would enable the prows to gain shallow water and escape  besides thought the captain to himself as he walked up and down the bridge with his hands in his pockets while bullets whistled round his head even a thin plate can stand a good strain when struck endon never venture never win  giving the order fullspeed to the engineer and port your helm a littlesteady to the man at the wheel the captain quietly awaited the result  the result was most effective  the gunboat went at the prow like a warhorse her sharp bow struck one of the pirate vessels fair amidships and cut her in two pieces launching her crew and captives into the sea  she then backed astern and made for the other prow but she laying to heart the fate of her companion made for the shore as fast as possible it was in vain  the gunboat ran into her and sank her immediately but so nearly had they succeeded in their intention that there were only six inches of water under the steamers keel when she backed out  lower the boats shouted the captain the instant his object had been accomplished and it was not a moment too soon for the sea all round was alive with human beings some of whom evidently waited to be picked up while others swam vigorously for the shore  in a short time about a hundred men were rescued most of whom were slavesonly ten being pirates  there was no difficulty in distinguishing between pirates and slaves because the latter wore the rattan round their necks in addition to which their spitting on the pirates and furiously abusing them for past cruelty and their falling down and kissing the feet of their deliverers made the distinction abundantly clear  most of the other pirates gained the shore but we may here finally dismiss them and relieve the readers mind by stating that they were afterwards hunted down and slain to a man by the natives of that district who entertained a deadly and very natural hatred of them having suffered much at their hands in time past  while the rescued captives were going about excitedly telling of the shocking barbarities that had been practised on them the captain discovered among them a singapore native who could speak a little english  taking this man aft he questioned him closely  are there any more piratejunks hereabouts he said  yis tree more  whereaway  hout seaward  not know how far  longish way off me tink  we was sent off from dem last night after all de goods an money was tooked out of us  what for no kin tell  where tothers go no kin tell  theyve got lots of captives aboard i suppose said the captain  ho  great lots replied the singapore man  and lots of treasure too no doubt  ho  very greater lots of dat  after obtaining all the information he could from this man and from the other passengers the captain steamed out to sea in a westerly direction keeping a man at the masthead to look out  the captives were in the meanwhile made as comfortable as circumstances would admit of and the ten pirates were put in irons in the hold  as the morning advanced the sun increased in power and splendour  not a breath of wind ruffled the sea which shone like a mirror reflecting perfectly the seabirds that accompanied them  everything was so calm and peaceful that the captain sent a message to mr hazlit and his daughter to request them to come up and enjoy the fresh air  during the brief action described they had been sent below to be out of danger  they obeyed the summons and even miss pritty was induced by aileen to come on deck  poor miss pritty  her hysterical fit was now quite over but pale cheeks and a trembling exhausted frame told eloquently of her recent sufferings  mr hazlits limbs were also shaky and his face cadaverous showing that his temporary aberration of reason had told upon him  oh how delicious exclaimed miss pritty referring to the atmosphere as she sank into an easychair which the captain placed for her  are these the pirates she added shuddering as her eyes fell on some of the rescued people  no miss pritty answered the captain these are the freed captives the pirates are in irons in the hold  you had to fight i suppose continued miss pritty shutting her eyes and pursing her mouth with the air of one who braces herself to face the inevitable  well we could hardly call it fighting answered the captain with a smile as he cleaned the glasses of his telescope and swept the horizon carefully we had a round or two of the guns and a few bullets whistled about our ears for a littlethat was all  was any one woundedkkilled asked miss pritty opening her eyes with an anxious look and oh she added with a sudden expression of horror as she drew up her feet and glanced downwards perhaps the decks areno she continued sinking back again with a sigh they are not bloody  at that moment the man at the masthead reported three prows just visible on the horizon ahead  i suppose we must go below again said aileen sadly after the captain returned from the bridge to which he had gone to examine the prows in question  not yet miss hazlit  it will probably be an hour ere we come up with them  youd better enjoy the morning air while you may  ill warn you in good time  aileen therefore remained on deck for some time with her father but poor miss pritty on the first intimation that more pirates were in sight got up hastily staggered with a face expressive of the utmost horror into the cabin flung herself into the captains berth thrust her head under the pillow piled the clothes over that and lay there quaking  she quaked for full half an hour before anything happened  then she felt a hand trying to remove her superincumbent headgear  this induced her to hold on tight and shriek but recognising aileens voice she presently put her face out  dont be so terrified dear said aileen scarce able to repress a smile  i cant help it answered her friend whimpering are thethe pirates  they are not far off now  but dont give way to needless alarm dear our captain sent me below because he is going to fight them and you know he is sure to win for he is a brave man  he says hell run them all down in a few minutes  oh groaned miss pritty and with that pulling her head in like a snail she resumed quaking  poor aileen although talking thus bravely to her friend was by no means easy in her own mind for apart from the fact that they were about to engage three piratejunks manned by hundreds of desperate men she could not repress her shrinking horror at the bare idea of men talking coolly about shedding human blood  to one of her imaginative nature too it was no small trial to have to sit alone and inactive in the cabin while the bustle of preparation for war went on overhead we say alone because her father although there was too much exhausted to act the part of companion or comforter in any degree  meanwhile the gunboat approached close to the enemy and it soon became apparent that they meant to fighttrusting no doubt to their very decided superiority in numbers  they mean mischief said the captain as he shut up his telescope  faix an theyll git it too replied rooney machowl who chanced to be near at the time though the remark was not addressed to him  to this the captain made no reply save by a grim curl of his black moustache as he once more ascended to his exposed position on the bridge  from this outlook he could see plainly that the pirates were lashing their three prows together and training all their guns on one side where the attack was expected  as each prow mounted twelve guns they could thus fire a broadside of thirtysix heavy pieces besides small arms  the men of the gunboat were now all at their quarters eagerly awaiting the order to begin  the captain descended and went round among them so as to inspect everything with his own eye  now lads he said in passing remember not a single shot till i give you positive orders  he returned to the bridge  although naturally disinclined to parley with scoundrels he felt that he had a duty to perform and resolved to go close up and if possible induce them to surrender  but he was saved the trouble of attempting a parley for while yet six hundred yards off a regular volley burst from the sides of the pirate vessels  again the black moustache curled but this time with a touch of ferocity for the shot partly took effect cutting the rigging to some extent killing one man of the crew and wounding several  a musketball also struck his own cap and knocked it off his head  just hand that up he said pointing to the cap  one of the men obeyed and the captain taking a look at the hole replaced it  still he gave no order to fire although the pirates were seen to be busily reloading  hanging up to within a hundred yards the captain looked quickly at his men  port a little said he to the man at the wheel  are you ready  ay ay sur from rooney machowl in a deep bass undertone  fire  as if but one piece had been fired the whole broadside burst from the side of the gunboat shaking the little vessel violently  miss prittys voice came up responsive with an unearthly yell  load was instantly ordered and so quickly was it obeyed that before the enemy were ready with their second volley the gunboat had charged and fired again doing great damage  there being no wind a dense cloud of smoke from the three volleys settled down on the water and completely hid them and their enemy from each other  steam ahead fullspeed signalled the captain to edgar berrington  the screw instantly whirled and under cover of the dense veil the active little vessel moved away just in time to escape a murderous volley of shot shrapnel and ball which was poured into the smoke she had left behind her  the pirates followed this up with a wild cheer and a brisk fire of musketry which only ceased when discovering their mistake they beheld the gunboat emerge from the smoke steer round the end of their line and slewing to port deliver another volley of great guns and small arms that raked them all from stem to stern doing terrible execution both to the prows and their crews  thus the gunboat played round and round the enemy always maintaining the distance of about a hundred yards and keeping up the action as fast as they could load and fire  the pirates on their part fought with the courage of trained men of war and with the ferocity of tigers at baywho ask and expect no mercy  and thus they fought for no less than three hours  one reason why the pirates were able to hold out so long lay in the fact that their prows were surrounded by a thick matting made from a certain palmleaf which although it could not prevent shot from passing through concealed the men who lay behind it and so prevented the riflemen of the gunboat crew from taking aim  in order to get the better of this difficulty the latter fell into the way of watching for the puffs of smoke that came through the matting and firing at these puffs  conspicuous among the pirates for his coolness daring and utter disregard of his life was one tall powerful fellow in a red jacket every one guessed him at once to be a chief among the pirates and this question was soon settled by some of the recently freed captives who recognised him as being the great chief of the fleetpungarin  he went about the deck of his prow which occupied the centre of the line encouraging his men to rapid action and often pointing the guns with his own hands  many rifleshots were fired at him but in vain  he seemed to bear a charmed life  can none of you pick him off said the captain of the gunboat  twenty rifles replied to the words and the mans red jacket was seen to be torn in many places but himself remained unhurt  at last the pirateguns were silenced in two of the prows only the chiefs maintaining an obstinate fire  this vessel would have been much sooner silenced no doubt but for the ferocity of pungarin  when his men driven at last by the deadly fire of the assailants forsook a gun and sought refuge behind the matting the piratechief would promptly step forward and serve the gun himself until very shame sometimes forced his men to return  at last all the guns were disabled but one and that one pungarin continued to serve uninjured amid a perfect storm of shot  the fellow has got the lives of twenty cats growled the captain as he turned to give directions to the steersman which brought the gunboat still closer to the enemy  the effect of a welldelivered volley at this shorter range was to cut the fastenings of the three prows thus permitting them to separate  this was precisely what was desired the captain having resolved to run the pirates down one at a time as he had done before  he would not board them because their superior numbers and desperate ferocity would have insured a handtohand conflict which even at the best might have cost the lives of many of his men  the instant therefore that the prows were cut adrift he gave the order to back astern  at the same moment pungarin was heard to give an order to his men which resulted in the oars being got out and manned by the surviving pirates and slaves who rowed for the land as fast as possible  their escape in this way however the captain knew to be impossible for they were now fully twentyfive miles from shore  he therefore went about his work leisurely  backing a considerable distance so as to enable his little warhorse to get up fullspeed he took careful aim as he charged  it was interesting to watch the swart faces and glaring eyeballs of those on board the first prow as the gunboat bore down on them  some glared from hate others obviously from fear and all seemed a little uncertain as to what was about to be done  this uncertainty was only dispelled when the prow was struck amidships and with a tremendous crash cut clean in two  simultaneous with the crash arose a yell of mingled anger and despair as pirates and prisoners were all hurled into the sea  again the order was given to go astern  the steamer immediately backed out of the wreck  after gaining a sufficient distance the engines were reversed and the little vessel bore down on another prow  this one made violent efforts to evade the blow but the captain had anticipated as much  his orders were sharp his steersman was prompt the cutwater did its duty nobly and in a few seconds another pirate vessel was sent to the bottom  the sea was now swarming with human beings in all directions some clinging to any scrap of wreck they could lay hold of some paddling about aimlessly and roaring for help while others swam steadily in the direction of the land  these last were chiefly pirates who had evidently made up their minds to escape or drown rather than be captured  as it was evident that many of those struggling in the water would be drowned in a few minutes the captain delayed his attack on the third prow and ordered the boats to be lowered  this was done promptly and many of the poor victims captured by the pirates were rescued and brought on board  a few of the pirates were also picked up  these had jumped overboard with their creases and other weapons in their hands and were so vindictive as to show fight furiously in the water when the sailors attempted to save them  many of the men suffered from this poor rooney machowl was among the number  he pulled the bowoar of his boat and hauled it in on drawing near to any one so as to be ready to catch the hand of the swimmer or make a grasp at him  as they approached one of the swimmers rooney observed that he had a short twisted sword in his hand and that he looked over his shoulder with a fierce scowl  nevertheless as he leaned over to the rescue it did not occur to the worthy man that the swimmer meant mischief until he saw the twisted sword leap from the water and felt the point of his nose almost severed from his face  och  you spalpeen cried rooney with a yell of intense indignation and pain  he was about to follow this up with a blow from his powerful fist that would have sent the pirate at least a fathom of the way down to the bottom but the sword again leaped upwards causing him to start back as it flashed close past his cheek and went right over the boat into the sea  at the same moment a malay seized the pirate by an ear another grasped him by an arm and he was quickly hauled inboard and bound here joe baldwin cried rooney to his comrade who pulled an oar near the stern of the boat for anny favour lind a hand to fix on the pint o my poor nose  it was niver purty but och  its ruinated now past redimption  not a bit man said joe as he bound up the injured member by the simple process of tying a kerchief right round his friends face and head itll be handsomer than ever  there was always too much of it you can afford to have it reduced  rooney did not quite seem to appreciate this comforting remark however after his nose was bound he and the rest of the boats crew continued their work and soon returned on board the gunboat with a mixed lot of pirates and captives  of course the rescuers were more careful in approaching the swimmers after rooneys misfortune but in spite of this many of them were wounded by the pirates slashing at them with their swords and knives or flinging these weapons violently into the boats  in a short time all were saved who yet remained above water  then the boats were hauled up and the steamer gave chase to the prow in charge of the pirate captain which was by that time far away on the horizon    chapter twenty  the fight concluded  the nautical proverb saith that a stern chase is a long one but that proverb to make it perfect and universally applicable should have been prefaced by the words all things being equal  in the present case all things were not equal  the gunboat was a fast steamer the chase was a slow rowboat insufficiently manned by tired and wounded men  but many of them were desperate men  their leader was an archfiend of resolution and ferocity  he knew that escape in the circumstances was impossible  he was well aware of the fate that awaited him if taken  he therefore made up his mind to give his enemies as much trouble as possible to delay their triumph and cause it to cost them dear and in every practicable way that might occur to thwart and worry them to the end  animated by such a spirit he managed to encourage his men and to terrify and lash his slaves to almost superhuman exertions so that before being overtaken they approached considerably nearer to the shore than would otherwise have been the case  this as it afterwards turned out resulted in a benefit to some of those in the gunboat which they did not think of at the time  as they overtook the prow pungarin ordered the starboard rowers to cease  those on the port side continued to pull and in a few seconds the prows broadside was brought to bear on the approaching enemy  not till they were within a hundred yards did the pirate leader again speak  then his powerful voice resounded through his vessel  fire  at the word every piece on board the prow great and small belched forth a volume of smoke flame and metal but the result was trifling in his anxiety to do deadly execution the pirate had overdone his work he had allowed his foe to come too close and most of the discharge from the heavy guns passed over her while the men with small arms rendered nervous by prolonged delay fired hastily and therefore badly  a few wounds were suffered and many narrow escapes were made but in other respects the discharge passed by harmlessly  the captain in his exposed and elevated position on the bridge felt indeed as if a thundershower of iron hail had passed not only round but through him  he paid no regard to it however but held straight on  next moment there was a dire collision the prow went under water and the surface of the sea was covered with shouting and struggling men  the boats were quickly lowered as on the previous occasion and most of the people were rescued though of course some who could not swim were drowned  the scene that now ensued was very exciting and in some respects very terrible for besides the gurgling cries of the perishing there were the defiant yells of the pirates who more fiercely than those in the other prows resisted being taken alive and used their creases and knives with deadly effect  this naturally filled the conquerors with such indignation that in many cases they killed the pirates who showed fight instead of disarming and capturing them  at last every one in the water was either saved killed drowned or captured with the exception of one man whose red jacket clearly pointed him out as the piratechief  being greatly superior to his fellows in mental and physical powers it was natural that he should excel them in his efforts to escape  even after the whole affair was over this man who might have been a hero in other circumstances continued to baffle his pursuers  in the boat which finally captured him was the singapore man already mentioned  this man for reasons best known to himself had a bitter hatred of pungarin and was the chief cause of the boat in which he pulled an oar being kept in close pursuit of the piratechief  dis way he cried when the general melee was drawing to a close yonder is de redcoat  he make for de shore  the steersman at once turned in the direction indicated which brought them close to the gunboat  pungarins keen eye quickly observed that they were making towards him although the water around him swarmed with other men  he at once dived and came up close to the side of the vessel under its quarter and in dangerous proximity to its screw  the boldness of the course might have diverted attention from him for a time but his one touch of vanitythe red jacketbetrayed him  he was soon observed  a cry was given  his sharpeyed enemy the singapore man saw him and the boat was once more pulled towards its mark  but pungarin dived like an otternot only under the boat but under the steamer also coming up on the other side and resting while they sought for him  again they discovered him again he passed under the ships bottom and this time continued his dive onwards towards the shore  when his power of remaining under water failed he came gently to the surface turning on his back so that only his mouth and nose appeared  one full breath sufficed and he dived again without having been observed  if pungarin had adopted this plan while the boats were busy capturing his comrades it is possible that he might have escaped for his swimming powers and endurance were very great but it was now too late  when he rose the second time to the surface the affair was over and mens minds were free to fix entirely on himself  just then too he thought it advisable to put his head fully out of the water in order to see that he had kept in the right direction  he was instantly observed by his singapore enemy and the chase was resumed  it is almost unnecessary to say that it terminated unfavourably for the piratechief  for several minutes he continued to dive under the boat while they tried to seize him and wounded some of the men nearest to him but his herculean powers began at last to fail and he finally floated on the surface as if helpless  even this was a ruse for no sooner was the boat near enough and the singapore man within reach of his arm than he raised himself and made a cut at that individual with such good will that he split his skull across down nearly to the ears  next moment he was hauled into the boat and bound hand and foot  the scene on board the gunboat now was a very terrible one  every man there was more or less begrimed with powder and smoke or bespattered with blood and soaked with water while all round the decks the wounded were sitting or lying awaiting their turn of being attended to and groaning more or less with pain  on calling the roll after the action was over it was found that the loss suffered by the gunboat crew was two men killed and eighteen woundeda very small number considering the time during which the affair had lasted and the vigour with which the pirates had fought  and now was beautifully exemplified the advantage of a man possessing a little knowledgefalsely styled a dangerous thingover a man who possesses no knowledge  now also was exhibited the power and courage that are latent in true womanhood  there was no surgeon on board of that gunboat and with the exception of edgar berrington there was not a man possessed of a single scrap of surgical knowledge deeper than that required for the binding up of a cut finger  as we have already shown our hero had an inquiring mind  while at college he had become intimately acquainted with and interested in one or two medical students with whom he conversed so much and so frequently about their studies that he became quite familiar with these and with their medical and surgical phraseology so that people frequently mistook him for a student of medicine  being gifted with a mechanical turn of mind he talked with special interest on surgery discussed difficulties propounded theories and visited the hospitals the dissectingrooms and the operatingtheatres frequently  thus he came unintentionally to possess a considerable amount of surgical knowledge and when at last he was thrown providentially into a position where no trained man could be found and urgent need for one existed he came forward and did his best like a man  aileen hazlit also on being told that there was need of a womans tender hand in such work at once overcame her natural repugnance to scenes of blood she proceeded on deck and with a beating heart but steady hand went to work like a trained disciple of florence nightingale  to the credit of the timid and for the encouragement of the weak we have to add that miss pritty likewise became a true heroine  no average individual male or female can by any effort of imagination attain to the faintest idea of poor miss prittys horror at the sight of bloodhuman gore particularly  nevertheless miss pritty encouraged by her friends example rose to the occasion  with a face and lips so deadly pale that one might have been justified in believing that all the blood on the decks had flowed therefrom she went about among the wounded assisting aileen in every possible way with her eyes shut  she did indeed open them when it was absolutely necessary to do so but shut them again instantly on the necessity for vision passing away  she cut short bandages when directed so to do she held threads or tapes she tore up shirts and slips and other linen garments with the most reckless disregard of propriety she wiped away blood from wounds under direction and moistened many dry lips with a sponge and brushed beads of perspiration from pale browslike a heroine  meanwhile edgar went about actively rejoicing in his newfound capacity to alleviate human suffering  what the faculty would have thought of him we know not  all on board the gunboat venerated him as a most perfect surgeon  his natural neatness of hand stood him in good stead for men were bleeding to death all round him and in order to save some it was necessary that he should use despatch with others  of course he attended to the most critical cases first except in the case of those who were so hopelessly injured as to be obviously beyond the reach of benefit from man  from these he turned sadly away after whispering to them an earnest word or two about the saviour of mankindto those of them at least who understood english  to waste time with these he felt would be to rob hopeful cases of a chance  all simple and easy cases of bandaging he left to the captain and his chief officer  joe baldwin being a cool steady man was appointed to act as his own assistant  from one to another he passed unweariedly cutting off portions of torn flesh extracting bullets setting broken bones taking up and tying severed arteries sewing together the edges of gaping wounds and completing the amputation of limbs in regard to which the operation had been begunsometimes nearly finishedby cannon shot  how terribly some of the poor wretches have been starved muttered edgar as he bent over one of the captives attempting to draw together the edges of a swordcut in his arm why there is not enough of flesh on him to cover his wound  there ant much sir assented joe baldwin in a sympathetic tone as he stood close by holding the needle and thread in readiness  theres one man forard sir that i saw in passing to the chest for this thread that has scarcely as much flesh on him as would bait a rattrap but he seems quite contented poor fellow at bein freed from slavery and dont seem to mind much the want o flesh and blood  perhaps he counts on gettin these back again  hm  these are not so easily regained when lost as you seem to imagine my friend exclaimed a pompous but rather weak voice  joe looked up it was mr hazlit whose bloodless countenance and shrunken condition had become more apparent than ever after he had been enabled to reclothe himself in the garments of civilisation  why sir said joe gently you seem to have bin badly shaken  not bin wounded i hope sir  noat least not in body replied the merchant with a faint smile and shake of the head but ive been sadly bruised and broken in spirit  joe remembering somewhat of mr hazlits former state of spirit had almost congratulated him on the beneficial change before it occurred that his meaning in doing so might have been misunderstood  he therefore coughed slightly and said ahindeed  yes indeed my man returned the merchant but i have reason to be supremely thankful that i am here now in any condition of mind and body worthy of being recognised  as the amateur surgeon here desired joe to assist him in moving his patient a little mr hazlit turned away in a stooping attitude because of weakness and with his vest flapping against the place where his chief development had once been shuffled slowly towards the quarterdeck  it was at this time that the boat which captured pungarin came alongside and there was a general movement of curiosity towards the gangway as he was passed on board  the hands of the piratechief were tied behind his back but otherwise he was free the cords that had bound his legs having been cast loose  a howl of execration burst from the captives when they saw him and several ran forward with the evident intention of spitting on him but these were promptly checked by the sailors  pungarin drew himself up and stood calmly but not defiantly as if waiting orders  there was no expression on his bold countenance save that of stern indifference for the crowd around him over whose heads he gazed quietly out to sea  his brow remained as unflushed and his breathing as gentle as though his struggles for life had occurred weeks ago though the wet garments and the ragged red jacket told eloquently of the share he had taken in the recent fight  take him below and put him in irons said the captain  please sir remarked the man whose duty it was to secure the prisoners weve got no more irons on board  we had only thirty pair and theres now thirtyeight prisoners in the hold  secure him with ropes then returned the captainwhere is mr berrington he added looking round hurriedly  forard sir lookin after the wounded answered a sailor  while the piratechief was led below the captain walked quickly to the place where edgar was busy  can you spare a minute he asked  not easily said edgar who had just finished the dressing with which we left him engaged there are several here who require prompt attention but of course if the case is urgent  it is urgent come and see  without a word our amateur surgeon rose and walked after the captain who led him to the companionhatch leaning against which he found the singapore man with his head split across and apparently cut down nearly from ear to ear  from this awful wound two small spouts of blood about the thickness of a coarse thread rose a foot and a half into the air we use no exaggeration reader in describing this  we almost quote verbatim the words of a most trustworthy eyewitness from whose lips we received the account  the man looked anxiously at edgar who turned at once to the captain and said in an undertone but hurriedly i can be of no use here  it is quite impossible that he can live  to attempt anything would really be taking up time that is of vast importance to more hopeful cases  sir do try faltered the poor man in english  ha  you speak english said edgar turning quickly towards him forgive me my poor fellow i did not know that you understood  yis me speak engleesh  me singapore man  go for vist me friends here  cotch by pirits  do try doctir  while he was speaking edgar quickly took off the mans necktie and bound it round his head then using a little piece of wood as a lever he passed it through the tie and twisted it until the two sides of the gaping gash were brought together which operation stopped the bleeding at once  this done he hastily left him but it will interest the reader to know that this singapore man actually recovered from his terrible wound after a month of hospital treatment  he was afterwards taken over to singapore as a natural curiosity and exhibited there to several doctors who had refused to believe the story  for aught we know to the contrary the man may be alive and well at the present day  certain it is that his cure at that time was complete  note  we were told this fact by a trustworthy eyewitness  it was evening before all the wounds were dressed and it was dark night ere the disorder caused by the action and its consequences were removed and the gunboat restored to somewhat of its wonted tidiness and appearance of comfort  but there was little comfort on board during the silence of that long night which seemed to many as though it would never end and which in the case of a few ended in eternity  although silence began to descend on all sleep was not there excitement fatigue and the awful scenes they had witnessed drove it from the pillows of aileen and her friend  frequent calls for the aid of the surgeon put anything like refreshing restmuch though he required itquite out of the question and at whatever hour of the night or early morning he entered the temporary hospital where the sufferers lay he was sure to be met by the white flash of the many eyes in haggard swart faces that turned eagerly and expectantly towards him proving that sleep had little or no influence there  there was less of this want of repose strange to say in another part of the vessel  down in the dark hold where one feeble lamp cast a mere apology for light on the wretched surroundings many of the pirates slept soundly their days were numberedeach one knew that full wellyet they slept their hearts ought to have been fall of dark forebodings but they slumberedsome of them with the profound quietude of infants  one might wonder at this were it not a familiar fact  this condition of the wicked has been observed in every age and is stated in holy writ  but all were not asleep in that dismal prisonhouse  there were among them it seemed a few who were troubled with fearsperhaps some who had consciences not yet utterly seared  at all events two or three of them moved uneasily as they sat huddled together for there was little room for so many in such a confined space and now and then a bursting sigh escaped  but such evidences of weakness if such it may be called were few  for the most part silence reigned  in mercy the captain had ordered a chink of the hatch to be left open and through this the stars shone down into the dark chamber  looking up at these in statuelike silence sat the piratechief  no one had spoken to him and he had spoken to none since his entry there sleep did not visit his eyes nor rest his heart yet he sat perfectly still hour after hour  perchance he experienced the rest resulting from an iron will that abides its approaching time for action  the tending of the wounded the cleansing of the ship the feeding of survivors the shutting up and arranging for the night had passed awayeven the groaning of sufferers had dwindled down to its lowest ebblong before pungarin moved with the intent to carry out his purpose  the nightwatch had been set and changed the guard over the prisoners had been relieved the man in charge of them had gone his rounds and examined their fetters the careful captain had himself inspected themall was perfectly quiet and deemed safe when pungarin at last moved and gave vent to one deep prolonged sigh that seemed to be the opening of the escapevalve of his heart and the outrush of its longpentup emotions  slowly but persistently he began to struggle and in the darkness of the place it seemed to those of his comrades who observed him as if he were writhing like a snake  but little did his fellowpirates heed their hearts had long ago ceased to be impressible by horrid fancies they could not help but see what went on before their eyesit did not require an effort to help caring  we have already said that some of the prisoners had been bound with ropes for want of irons  pungarin was among the number and his almost superhuman efforts were directed to freeing himself from his rope either by tearing his limbs out of it or by snapping it asunder  in both attempts he failed  sailors are of all men least likely to tie a knot badly or to select a rope too weak for its purpose  the pirate at length made this discovery and sank down exhausted  but he rose again ere long  those of the prisoners who had been secured by ropes were fastened to a beam overhead  the place was very low  none of them could have stood erect under this beam  while endeavouring to free himself pungarin had struggled on his knees  he now raised himself as high as possible on his knees  his hands although tied in front of him could be raised to his head  he quickly made a loop on the rope and passed it over his head  just then the guard removed the hatchway and descended to make the last inspection for the night  pungarin hastily removed the rope sank down and lay quite still as if in slumber  night passed slowly on  the morningstar arose  the sun soon chased away the shadows and brought joy to the awaking world  it even brought some degree of comfort to the comfortless on board the gunboat  the sleepers began to rouse themselves the wounded to move and relieve themselves if possible by change of position  the cook set about his preparations for the morning meal and the captain who being dangerously close to shore had taken no rest whatever during the night gave up the charge of his vessel to the first officer and went below to seek that repose which he had so well earned  ere he had closed an eye however his attention was arrested by a cry and by a peculiar noise of voices on deck  there are tones in the human voice which need no verbal explanation to tell us that they mean something serious  he jumped up and sprang on deck  as if by instinct he went towards the hatchway leading to the hold  hes dead sir were the first words that greeted him  a glance into the hold was enough to explain  the piratechief had hanged himself  with difficulty but with inflexible resolution he had accomplished his purpose by fastening the rope round his neck and lifting his legs off the ground so that he was actually found suspended in a sitting posture  his comrades in guilt little impressed apparently by his fate sat or reclined around his body in callous indifference    chapter twenty one  difficulties of various kinds also troubles and a discovery  gentlemen said the captain of the gunboat to mr hazlit and edgar as they sat that morning at breakfast it is my intention to run to the nearest town on the coastwhich happens to be mukuhave these pirates tried and shot then proceed to singapore and perhaps run thence to the coast of china  i will take you with me if you wish it or if you prefer it will put you on board the first homewardbound passengership that we can find  what say you  now reader we possess the happy privilege of knowing what mr hazlit and edgar thought as well as what they said and will use that privilege for purposes of our own  in the first place edgar thought he should very much like to hear mr hazlits views on that subject before speaking  he therefore said nothing  the course being thus left clear to him the merchant thought as follows  its very awkward excessively awkward and vexatious  here am i ever so many thousands of miles away from home without a single sovereign in my purse and without even the right to borrow of the captain for i have nothing certainly available even at homesome  why i have no home  at this point the poor mans thoughts took form in words  ahem he said clearing his throat i am much obliged by your kindness dont mention it sir from the captain and should prefer if possible to reach hongkong and ship thence for england  you see i have some business friends there and as i shall have to replenish my purse before  oh dont let that stand in the way said the captain promptly i shall be happy to lend what you may require and  excuse my interrupting you captain and thanks for your obliging offer said mr hazlit holding up his large hand as if to put the suggestion away but for reasons that it is not necessary to explain i wish to recruit my finances at hongkong  and i said edgar breaking in here wish to go to the same place not so much on my own account as on that of one of my companions who has left two very pretty little pieces of property there in the shape of a wife and a child who might object to being left behind  this settled the question and the breakfast party went on deck  mr hazlit said edgar will you walk with me to the stern of the vessel  i wish to get out of earshot of others  mr hazlit replied certainly mr berrington but he thought a good deal more than he said  among many other things he thought ah  here it comes at last  he thinks this a good time to renew his suit having just rendered us such signal assistance  i think he might have waited besides his saving our lives does not alter the fact that he is still a penniless youth and i will not give my daughter to such  it is true i am a more thoroughly penniless man than he for these villains have robbed me and aileen of our rings chains and watches on which i counted a good dealalas  but that does not mend matters  it makes them rather worse  no it must not be  my childs interests must be considered even before gratitude  i must be firm  thought is wondrously rapid  mr hazlit thought all that and a great deal more during the brief passage from the companionhatch to the sternrail  i wish to ask you to do me a favour mr hazlit the young man began  the merchant looked at him with a troubled expression  mr berrington you have been the means of saving our lives  it would be ungrateful in me to refuse you any favour that i can with propriety grant  i am aware continued edgar that you havehavemet with losses that your circumstances are changed  mr hazlit coloured and drew himself proudly up  be not offended my dear sir continued the youth earnestly i do not intrude on private mattersi would not dare to do so  i only speak of what i saw in english newspapers in hongkong just before i left and therefore refer to what is generally known to all  and while i sincerely deplore what i know i would not presume to touch on it at all were i not certain that the pirates must have robbed you of all you possess and that you must of necessity be in want of present funds i also know that some of a mans socalled friends are apt to fall off and fail him in the time of financial difficulty  now the favour i ask is that you will consider meas indeed i amone of your true friends and accept of a loan of two or three hundred pounds  impossible sirimit is very kind of youvery mr berrington but impossible said mr hazlit struggling between kindly feeling and hurt dignity  nay but pleaded edgar i only offer you a loan  besides i want to benefit myself he added with a smile  the fact is i have made a little money in a diving venture which i and some others undertook to these seas and i receive no interest for it just now  if you would accept of a few hundredswhat you require for present necessitiesyou may have them at three or five per cent  i would ask more but that you know would be usurious  still the fallen merchant remained immovable  he acknowledged edgars pleasantry about interest with a smile but would by no means accept of a single penny from him in any form  edgar had set his heart upon two things that morning and had prayed not for success but for guidance in regard to them  in the first he had failedapparently  not much depressed and nothing daunted he tried the second  captain he said pacing up and down by the side of that blackbearded blackeyed and powerful piratekiller what say you to run back to the spot where you sank the pirates and attempt to fish up some of the treasure with our diving apparatus  ive thought of that two or three times replied the captain shaking his head but they went down in deep watersforty fathoms at leastwhich is far beyond your powers  true returned edgar but the prow of the piratechief was you know run down in only nineteen fathoms and that is not beyond us  is it not  no we have already been deeper than twenty fathoms with the dress i have on board  there is only one objection said the captain pausing in his walk i have learned from the prisoners that before we came up with them pungarin had had all the money and chief treasure transferred from his own prow to another which was a faster boat intending to change into it himself but that after our appearing he deferred doing so until the fight should be over  if this be true then the treasure went down in deep water and the chiefs prow has nothing in it worth diving for  but we are not sure that this story is true and at all events it is probable that at least some of the treasure may have been left in pungarins boat urged edgar  well ill make the trial but first i must dispose of my prisoners  so saying the captain resumed his walk and edgar went below to look after his engine having in passing given rooney machowl instructions to overhaul the diving gear and get it into good working order  this rooney did with much consequential display for he dearly loved to bring about that condition of things which is styled astonishing the natives  as the malays on board seamen and captives were easily astonished by the novelties of the western hemisphere he had no difficulty in attracting and chaining their attention to the minutest details of his apparatus  he more than astonished them  with the able assistance of baldwin and maxwell and ramstam he drew out uncoiled rubbed examined inch by inch and recoiled the lifeline and the airtube unscrewed the various piecesglasses nuts and valvesof the helmet carefully examined them oiled them and refastened them much to the interest and curiosity of the natives the helmet itself he polished up till it shone like a great globe of silver to the intense admiration of the natives  the pump he took to pieces elaborately much to the anxiety of the natives who evidently thought he had wantonly destroyed it but who soon saw it gradually put together again much to their satisfaction and brought into good working order  rooney even went the length of horrifying one or two of the natives by letting one of the heavy shoulderweights fall on their naked toes  this had the effect of making them jump and howl while it threw the others into ecstasies of delight which they expressed by throwing back their heads shutting their eyes opening their mouths and chuckling heartily  aileen and miss pritty in the meantime lay on the sofas in the cabin and at last obtained muchneeded refreshment to their weary spirits by falling into deep dreamless and untroubled slumber  thus the gunboat with its varied freight sped on until it reached sarawak where the pirates were sent ashore under a strong guard  with these our tale has now nothing more to do but as this cutting short of their career is not fiction it may interest the reader to know that they were afterwards tried by a jury composed half of native chiefs and half of europeans who unanimously found them guilty  they were condemned to be shot and the sentence was carried out immediately in the jungle two miles outside of the town  they were buried where they fell and thus ended one of the sharpest lessons that had ever been taught to a band of miscreants who had long filled with terror the inhabitants of borneo and the neighbouring archipelago  some idea may be formed of the service done on this occasionas estimated by those who were well able to judgewhen we say that the captain of the gunboat afterwards received in recognition of his prowess a handsome sword and letter of thanks from the rajah sir james brooke a certificate with a pocket chronometer from the netherlandsindian government a commanders commission from the sarawak government and letters of grateful thanks from the resident governor of the west coast of borneo the council of singapore for the netherlands government and othersall expressive of his gallant conduct in utterly routing so large a body of pirates liberating two hundred and fifty slaveschiefly of the dutch settlementsand clearing the borneon coast of a curse that had infested it for many years  see note 1  having disposed of the pirates the gunboat proceeded immediately to sea and in a short time reached the scene of her recent victory  it had previously been proposed to mr hazlit that he might remain in sarawak if he chose during the short period of the gunboats intended absence but the unfortunate manowing to financial reasonsdecided to remain in the vessel  it happened to be a calm lovely morning not unlike that on which the action had been fought when they reached the scene of their intended operations and began to drag for the sunken prow  the difficulty of finding it was much greater than had been anticipated for the land although visible was much too far off to be of any service as a guide  at last however it was discovered the diving apparatus was got out the anchor cast and maxwell being esteemed the most enduring among the divers prepared to go down  it feels quite like old times sir dont it said joe baldwin to edgar berrington as he assisted to dress the diver and manipulated the various parts of the costume with a fondness that one might feel towards a favourite dog from which one had been for some time parted  it does indeed joe replied edgar smiling i almost envy maxwell the pleasure of a dipespecially in such a clear cool sea in this hot weather  how is he to breathe asked miss pritty who with aileen and her father as well as the captain and crew of the gunboat watched the process of robing with as much interest as if they had never before seen it performed  sure miss observed rooney machowl with great simplicity of aspect he does it by drawin in an puffin out the air through his mouth an nose  very true observed miss pritty with a goodnatured smile for even she could see that the irishman was poking fun at her but how is air conveyed to him  it is sent down by means of an airpump said edgar who took on himself the duty of explaining  dear me returned miss pritty elevating her eyebrows in surprise i always thought that pumps were used only for pumping up water  och  no miss said rooney theyre largely used for pumping up beer in london  now david are you all right asked joe  all right said maxwell as he rose and shook himself to settle the weights comfortably on his back and breast  come along then me boy said rooney  maxwell went to the side of the vessel where a ropeladder had been prepared and his two attendants assisted him to get over  all right asked joe again after giving the order to pump which ramstam commenced with the steady coolness and regularity of a veteran  all right replied maxwell who immediately afterwards slowly disappeared  after an hours absence he signalled that he was coming up  in a few minutes his helmet was seen far down in the depths  then it emerged from the surface  i want a crowbar he said on the glass being removed  if youd had on a helmet with a speakintube observed rooney you might have said that without comin up  true lad growled maxwell but not havin on a helmet with a speakintoobe here i am so please look alive  any sign of treasure asked edgar  not as yet sir  the crowbar having been brought the diver again went down  for some time all went on quietly for it was expected that deep though the water was maxwells power of enduring pressure would enable him to remain below for at least two hours if not longer  after looking for some time inquiringly at the spot where he had disappeared most of the malays resumed their various duties about the vessel though a few remained a little to regard ramstam with much interest as being one who in a measure held the life of a fellowbeing in his hands  suddenly a loud hissing noise was heard over the side  it sounded to those on deck as if the great seaserpent had put his head out of the sea close alongside and sent a violent hiss into the air  joe baldwin was attending to the airtube while rooney held the lifeline  he looked quickly down  the airpipes burst he shouted and both he and his comrade without a moments delay began to haul up the diver as fast as they possibly could  that the reader may properly appreciate what had happened it is necessary to remind him that at nineteen fathoms maxwells body was subjected to a pressurefrom water outside his dressof about 50 pounds to the square inch and that to prevent such a tremendous pressure from crushing in and collapsing all the cavities of his body an equal pressure of air had to be forced into his dress so that the pressure of water outside the dress was met and counteracted by the pressure of air inside  this highly condensed air of course tended to crush the diver as did the water but with this important difference that the air entered his lungs windpipe ears nose etcetera and thus prevented these organs from collapsing and confined the absolute pressure to their walls of flesh so to speak and to the solid muscular parts of his frame  maxwell being a very muscular man and tough was as we have said able to stand the pressure on these parts better than many men  when therefore the airtube burstwhich it happened to do at a weak point just a foot or so above waterthe divers dress was instantaneously crushed tight round him in every part the air was driven completely out of it and also largely out of poor maxwells body  the moment he appeared at the surface it was seen that he was insensible for he swung about by his lifeline and tube in a helpless manner  seeing this edgar who had anxiously watched for him got out on the ladder and passed the loop of a rope under his arms  it was quickly done  he was laid on deck and the bullseye was unscrewed by rooney who instantly exclaimed hes dead  no hes not i see his lips move said joe baldwin aiding edgar to unscrew the helmet  this was soon removed and a frightful sight was revealed to the spectators  maxwells face and neck were quite livid and swelled out to an almost bursting extent blood was flowing profusely from his mouth and ears and his eyes protruded horribly as if they had been nearly forced out of their sockets  it is right to observe that the helmet worn by maxwell on this occasion was an oldfashioned one which in the haste of departure from hongkong they had taken with them instead of one of their new ones most of the helmets now in use possess a valve which shuts of itself in the event of the airtube bursting and prevents the air from being crushed out of the dress  a dress full of air will as we have already said keep a man alive for at least five minutes  he has time therefore to reach the surface so that danger from this source is not nearly so great as it used to be  such restoratives as suggested themselves to the chief onlookers were applied and to the surprise of every one the diver began to show signs of returning life  in a few minutes he began to retch and soon vomited a large quantity of clotted blood  after a time he began to whisper a few words  cheer up my lad said the captain in a kindly voice as he went down on one knee beside the prostrate man dont attempt to speak or exert yourself in any way  youll be all right in a few days  well have your dress taken off and send you below where you shall be taken good care of  with returning vitality came back maxwells inbred obstinacy  he would not hold his tongue but insisted on explaining his sensations to his comrades as they busied themselves taking off his dressa rather violent operation at all times and very difficult in the circumstances  wy messmates he said i hadnt even time to guess wot ad appened got no warnin wotsomedever  i just felt a treemendous shock all of a suddent that struck me motionlessas if tom sayers had hit me a doublehanded cropper on the top o my beak an in the pit o my breadbasket at one an the same moment  then came an orrible pressure as if a twothousandton ship ad bin let down atop o me an arter that i remembers nothin  it is probable that the poor fellow would have gone on with his comments though he spoke with difficulty and in a feeble voice in which none of his characteristic gruffness remained if he had not been cut short by joe baldwin and rooney machowl lifting him up and carrying him below  rooney who carried his shoulders took occasion to say while on the way down  david boy did ye find anny treasure  noseed nothin  ow ow worse luck sighed rooney  maxwell was made comfortable with a glass of weak brandy and water hotand his comrades returned on deck where they found edgar berrington commencing to put on the divingdress  goin down sir inquired joe  yes  we have fortunately another airtube and i want to complete the work we have begun  is there not a risk whispered aileen to her father that the same accident may happen again  ah true answered mr hazlit aloud the water appears to be very deep mr berrington  do you not think it probable that the airtube may burst a second time  i think not replied edgar as he sat down to have his helmet affixed to the dress  the best made articles are liable to possess flaws even the most perfect railwaywheel in which the cleverest engineer alive might fail to detect a fault may conceal a dangerous flaw  there is no certainty in human affairs  all we can say is that when we consider the thousands of divers who are daily employed all over the world accidents of the kind you have just witnessed are not numerous if i were to refrain from going down because this accident has occurred i might as well refrain evermore from entering a railwaycarriage  we must risk something sometimes in our progress through life mr hazlit  it was intended that we should  why were we gifted with the quality of courage if risk and danger were never to be encountered  the screwing on of the bullseye put a stop to further remark and a few seconds later our hero went over the side while ramstam smiling benignant indifference as to the event which had so recently happened steadily performed his duty  as mr hazlit and aileen watched the bubbles that rose in multitudes to the surface the former repeated to himself mentally yes we must risk something sometimes in our progress through life  he went on repeating this until at last he followed it up with the sudden reflectionwell perhaps i must risk my daughters happiness in this youths hands even though he is penniless  he seems an able fellow will doubtless make his way anywhere  at all events it is quite evident that he will risk his life anywhere  besides now i think of it he said something about lending me some hundred pounds or so perhaps he is not absolutely penniless  it is quite certain that i am curious sentiment that of his we must risk something sometimes  very curious and quite newat least exhibited to me in quite a new light  while mr hazlits mind ran on thus and his eyes dreamily watched the bubbles on the surface of the sea our hero was grubbing like a bigheaded goblin among the wreckage at the bottom  he moved about from place to place in that slow leaning fashion which the resistance of water renders unavoidable but he found nothing whatever to repay him for his trouble  there were beams and twisted ironwork and overturned guns and a few bales but nothing that bore the least resemblance to boxes or bags of money  one or two large cases he discovered and forced them open with the crowbar which maxwell had dropped when he was struck insensible but they contained nothing worth the labour of having them hoisted up  at last he was about to leave after a careful search of more than an hour when he espied something shining in a corner of what had once been the piratechiefs cabin  he took it up and found it to be a small box of unusual weight for its size  his sense of touch told him that it was ornamented with carving on its surface but the light was not sufficient to enable him to see it distinctly  his heart beat hopefully however as he hastened as fast as the water would permit out of the cabin and then to his joy he found that it was aileen hazlits jewelbox  how it came there he could not guess but the reader partly knows the truth and can easily imagine that when the piratechief sent his other valuables to the swift prow as before mentioned he kept thisthe most precious of them allclose to his own person to the last desiring no doubt to have it always under his own eye  not troubling himself much however with such speculations edgar returned to the cabin placed the box where he found it and spent full halfanhour more in plying his crowbar in the hope of discovering more of the pirates horde  while thus engaged he received two or three signals to come up from joe baldwin who held his lifeline but he signalled back all rightlet me alone and went on with his work  at last there came the signal come up given with such a peremptory tug that he was fain though unwilling to comply  taking the box under his arm he began to ascend slowly  on gaining the surface he was made at once aware of the reason of the repeated signalling for a sudden squall had burst upon the eastern sea which by that time although perfectly calm below was tumbling about in waves so large that the gunboat was tossing like a cork at her anchor and it was found to be almost impossible to work the airpump  in fact it was only by having two men stationed to keep ramstam on his legs that the thing could be done  with some difficulty edgar was got on board and the order was immediately given to weigh anchor  expressing great surprise at the state of things he found above water and regret that he had not sooner attended to orders edgar placed the box on the deck  then he unrobed and drawing on his trousers and a canvas jacket he issued from behind the funnelwhich had been his robingroomand went aft where he found aileen seated between her friend miss pritty and her father  miss hazlit he said with a peculiar smile allow me to introduce you to an old friend  he held up before her the carved steel box  my mothers jewelcase she exclaimed with a look of intense surprise  mymy wifes jewels stammered mr hazlit in equal surprise whereon earthwhyhowwhereyoung man did you find them  i found them at the bottom of the sea replied edgar  it is the second time strange to say that i have had the pleasure of fishing them up from that vast repository of riches where i doubt not many another jewelcase still lies and will continue to lie unclaimed for ever  meanwhile i count myself peculiarly fortunate in being the means of restoring this case to its rightful owner  so saying he placed it in the hands of aileen  the captain who had watched the whole scene with quiet interest and a peculiar curl about his black moustache as well as a twinkle in his sharp black eye uttered a short laugh thrust his hands into his pockets and walked away to give the order that the steamers head should be laid precisely sou souwest and by south halfsouth with a slightalmost a shadowyleaning in the direction of southerly    note 1  we may as well state here that our information on this subject was obtained from captain john hewat formerly in command of the steam gunboat rainbowbelonging to sir james brooke kcb rajah of sarawakin which he had six years experience of piratehunting in the eastern seas and now captain of one of donald currie and companys magnificent line of cape steamers  perhaps we ought to apologise for thus dragging the gallant captain into fiction but we trust he will find that in regard to his own particular doings we have stuck pretty closely to fact    chapter twenty two  miscellaneous matters ending with a scrimmage under water  we are back again in hongkongin the pagodawith our old friends seated comfortably round their little table enjoying a good supper  pretty little mrs machowl has prepared it and is now assisting at the partaking of it  young master teddy machowl is similarly engaged on his fathers knee  the child has grown appallingly during its fathers absence  ramstam and chokfoo are in waitinggazing at each other with the affection of chinese lovers reunited  what a sight you are rooney said mrs machowl pausing between bites to look at her husband  sure its the same may be said of yoursilf cushla replied rooney stuffing his childs mouth with sweet potato  yes but its what a fright you are i mane said mrs machowl  an its what a purty cratur you are that i mane replied rooney repeating the dose to teddy who regarded his father with looks of deep affection  ah  go long wid you  sure its your nose is spoilt entirely said mrs machowl  an its your own that is swaiter than iver which more than makes up the difference retorted her lordhowld it open as wide as ye can this time ted me boy there thats your sortbut dont choke ye spalpeen  there seemed indeed some occasion for the latter admonition for teddy unused to such vigorous treatment was beginning to look purple in the face and apoplectic about the eyes  in short there is every probability that an attack of croup or something dreadful would have ensued if the childs mother had not risen hastily and snatched it away from the wouldbe infanticide  now then ramstam and chokfoo said edgar berrington putting down his spoon clear away the ratstail soup and bring on the roast puppy  grinning from ear to ear and with almost closed eyes the chinese servitors obeyed  while they cleared the table and laid the second course the conversation became general  previously it had been particular referring chiefly to the soup and the free circulation of the salt  so then observed joe baldwin leaning back in his chair we must make up our minds to be content with what we have got  well it ant so bad after all  let me see  how much did you say the total is mister eddy  close upon eight thousand five hundred pounds  a tidy little sum observed rooney with an air of satisfaction  eight thousandeh repeated joe hum well well cut off the five hundred for expenses and passage home and that leaves eight thousand clear which according to agreement gives each of us two thousand pounds  maxwell who still looked pale and thin from the effects of his late accident nodded his head slowly and growled two thousandjus so  an that molly my dear said rooney if properly invisted gives you an me a clair incomeonly think an income mollyof wan hundred a year  its true cushla  that ye wont be able to rowl in yer carridge an walk in silks an satins on that income but itll pay the rint an taxes owld girl an help teddy to a collidge eddication to say nothin o pipes an baccy  ochoneif wed only not lost the first haul wed have bin millerinaires be this time  i wouldnt have called the quane me grandmother  come rooney be grateful for what youve got said edgar  enough is as good as a feast  ah  sur itll be time to say that when weve finished the puppy replied the irishman as chokfoo placed on the board a savoury roast which bore some resemblance to the animal named though having had its head and legs amputated there could be no absolute certainty on the point  whatever it was the party attacked it with relish and silence reigned until it was finished after which conversation flowed again somewhat languidly at first  when however pipes were got out by those who smoked and chairs were placed in the verandah and no sound was heard around save the yelling of chinese children who were romping in the chinese kennel that skirted the pagoda and the champing of the jaws of ramstam and chokfoo as they masticated insidethen came the feast of reason not to mention the flow of soul  i wonder what our friends at whitstable will say to this ventur of ours said maxwell  have you many friends there asked edgar  manyof course i has  wy i suppose every english diver must have friends there  where is it asked edgar  why sir dont you know whitstable exclaimed joe baldwin in surprise  you forget joe replied edgar with a smile that although i have learnt how to dive and have read a good deal about the history of diving i am only an amateur after all and cannot be supposed to know everything connected with the profession  all i know about whitstable is that it is a port somewhere in the south of england  right sir said joe but its more than that it lies on the coast of kent and is famous for its oysterbeds and its divers  how it came to be a place of resort for divers i dont know but so it is an i have heard say it was divin for oysters in days of old that gave the natives a taste for the work  anyhow theyve got the taste very decided somehow an after every spell o dirty weather theyre sure to have telegrams from all parts of the coast and youll see lloyds agents huntin up the divers in the publichouses an packin em off wi their gear right and left by rail to look after salvage  these men continued joe are most of em handicraftmen as well as divers because you know sir it would be of no use to send down a mere labourer to repair the bottom of a ship no matter how good he was at divin so youll find among em masons and shipbuilders and carpenters and engineers  ah interrupted edgar i was just wondering how they would manage if it were found necessary to have the engines of a sunk steamer taken to pieces and sent up  well sir rejoined joe theyve got men there who can dive and who know as much about marine engines as you do yourself  and these men make lots of tin for a good diver can earn a pound a day an be kept in pretty regular employment in deep water  in shallow water he can earn from ten to fifteen shillings a day  besides this they make special arrangements for runnin extra risks  then the savin they sometimes effect is amazin  why sir although you do know somethin of the advantages of diving you can never know fully what good they do in the world at large  just take the case of the agamemnon at sebastopol  och interrupted rooney whose visage was perplexed by reason of his pipe refusing to draw well wasnt puff that a good job intirely puff  there youre all right at last  he was a friend o mine that managed that job  tarry we called himthough that wasnt his right name  this is how it was  the fleet was blazin away at the fortifications an of coorse the fortificationsout o politeness if nothin elsewas blazin away at the fleet and smoke was curlin up like a chimbley on fire an big balls was goin about like pais in a rattle an small shot like hail was blowin horizontal an men was bein shot an cut to pieces an them as warnt was cheerin as if there was any glory in wholesale murtherbah  i wouldnt give a day at donnybrook wid a shillelah for all the sieges of sebastopool as ever i heard tell of  well suddintly bang goes a round shot slap through the hull of the agamemnon below the waterline  here was a pretty to do the ordinary coorse in this case would have bin to haul out of action go right away to malta an have the ship docked and repaired there but what does they do  why they gets from under fire for a bit and sends down my friend tarry to look at the hole  he goes down looks at it then comes up an looks at the commodorebowld as brass  i can repair it says tarry  well do says the commodore  so down he goes an does it an very soon after that the agamemnon went into action again and blazed away at the walls o the owld place harder than ever  that was a good case an a true one said joe baldwin with an approving nod  and these divers mr edgar continued joe sometimes go on their own hook like we have done this time with more or less luck  there was one chum of mine who took it into his head to try his chances at the wreck of the royal charter long after all hope of further salvage had been abandoned and in a short time he managed to recover between three and four hundred pounds sterling  an immense amount of money they do say was recovered from the royal charter by divers observed maxwell  that is true and it happens said edgar sadly that i know a few interesting facts regarding that vessel  i know of some people whose hearts were broken by the loss of relatives in that wreck  there were many suchgod comfort them  but that is not what i meant to speak of the facts i refer to are connected with the treasure lost in the vessel just before leaving london i had occasion to call on the gentleman who had the management of the recovered gold and he told me several interesting things  first of all the whole of the gold that could be identified was handed at once over to its owners but this matter of identification was not easy for much of the gold was found quite loose in the form of sovereigns and nuggets and dust  the dust was ordered to be sent up with the dirt that surrounded it and a process of goldwashing was instituted after the regular diggings fashion with a bowl and water  tons of dirt were sent up and washed in this way and a large quantity of gold saved  the agent showed me the bowl that was used on this occasion  he also showed me sovereigns that had been kept as curious specimens  some of them were partly destroyed as if they had been caught between ironplates and cut in half others were more or less defaced and bent and a few had been squeezed almost into an unrecognisable shape  in one place he told me the divers saw a pile of sovereigns through a rent in an ironplate  the rent was too small to admit a mans arm and the plates could not be dislodged  the divers therefore made a pair of iron tongs with which they picked out the sovereigns and thus saved a large sum of money  one very curious case of identification occurred  a bag of sovereigns was found with no name on it  a claimant appeared but he could tell of no mark to prove that he was the rightful owner  of course it could not be given up and it appeared as if the unfortunate man who was indeed the owner must relinquish his claim when in a happy moment his wife remembered that she had put a brass token into the bag with the gold  the bag was searched the token was found and the gold was immediately handed to them  molly my dear said rooney machowl at this point you make a note o that an if ever you have to do with bags o goold just putt a brass token or two into em  ah  shut up rooney said mrs machowl in a voice so sweet that the contrast between it and her language caused edgar and joe to laugh  well then continued edgar in many other curious ways gold was identified and delivered to its owners thus in one case an incomplete seal bearing part of the legs of a griffin was found on a bag of two thousand sovereigns and the owner showing the seal with which he had stamped it established his claim  of course in all cases where bars of gold were found with the owners names stamped on them the property was at once handed over but after all was done that could be done by means of the most painstaking inquiry an immense amount of gold necessarily remained unclaimed  and i spose if it wasnt for us divers said maxwell the whole consarn would have remained a dead loss to mankind  true for ye responded rooney its not often ye come out wid such a blaze of wisdom as that david  it must be the puppy as has stirred ye up boy or mayhap the baccy  take care you dont stir me up lad else it may be worse for you growled maxwell  och  im safe returned the irishman carelessly id putt molly betwain us an sure yed have to come over her dead body before yed git at meit wasnt you was it david continued rooney with sudden earnestness that got knocked over by a blast at the works in ringwall harbour two or three years ago  no it warnt me responded maxwell it was long tom skinclip  he was too tall for a diverhe was  they say he stood six futt four in his socks moreover he was as thin as a shadow from a bad gaslamp  he was workin one day down in the arbour layin stones at the foundations of the noo breakwater when they set off a blast about a hundred yards off from where he was workin an so powerful was the blast that it knocked him clean on his back  he got such a fright that he signalled violently to haul up an they did haul im up expectin to find one of his glasses broke or his toobes busted  there was nothin wotsomedever the matter with im but he wouldnt go down again that day  owsever he got over it an after that went down to work at a wreck somewhere in the eastern seasnot far from ceylon im told when there e got another fright that wellnigh finished him an from that day he gave up divin an tuck to gardening for which he was much better suited  what happened to him asked edgar  im not rightly sure answered maxwell refilling his pipe but ive bin told he had to go down one day in shallow water among seaweed  it was a beautiful sort o submarine garden so to speak an long tom skinclip was so fond o flowers an gardens natrally that he forgot hisself an went wanderin about what he called the submarine groves till they thought he must have gone mad  they could see him quite plain you see from the boat an they watched him while he wandered about  the seaweed was upard of six feet high tufted on the top with a sort o thing you might amost fancy was flowers  the colours too was bright  among the branches o this submarine forest or grove small lobsters an shrimps an other sorts o shellfish were doin dooty as birdshoppin from one branch to another an creepin about in all directions  after a time long tom skinclip he sat down on a rock an wiped the perspiration off his browat least he tried to do it which set the men in the boat all off in roars of laughter for dee see skinclip was an absent sort of a feller an used to do strange things  no doubt when he sat down on the rock he felt warm an bein a narvish sort o chap i make no question but he was asweatin pretty hard so without thinkin he up with his arm quite natral like an drawed it across where his brow would have bin if the helmet hadnt been on  it didnt seem to strike him as absurd however for he putt both hands on is knees an sat lookin straight before im  he hadnt sat long in this way when they seed a huge fishabout two futt longcomin slowly through the grove behind im  it was one o them creeters o the deep as seems to have had its head born five or six sizes too big for its tailwith eyes an mouth to match  it had also two great horns above its eyes an a cravat or frill o bristles round its neck  its round eyes and halfopen mouth gave it the appearance o bein always more or less in a state of astonishment  praps it was at the fact of its havin bin born at all  anyhow it swumd slowly along till it cotched sight o skinclip when it went at him an looked at the back of his helmet in great astonishment an appeared to smell it but evidently it could make nothin of it  then it looked all down his back with an equal want of appreciation  arter that it came round to the front and looked straight in at skinclips bullseye  they do say it was a sight to see the start he gave  he jump up as smart amost as if hed bin in the open air an they obsarved when he turned round that a huge lobster of some unbeknown species was holdin on to his trousers with all its claws like a limpet the fishor ripslang as one of the men called it who said he knowed it wellturned out to be a pugnaceous creetur for no sooner did it see skinclips great eyes lookin at it in horror than it set up its frill of spikes threw forard the long horns an went slap at the bullseye fit to drive it in  skinclip he putt down his head an the ripslang made five or six charges at the helmet without much effect  then it changed its tactics turned on its side wriggled under the helmet an looked in at skinclip with one of its glarin eyes close to the glass at the same time the lobster gave him a treemendious tug behind  this was more than skinclip could stand  they seed him jump round seize the lifeline an give it four deadly pulls but his comrades paid no attention to it  the lobster gave him another tug an the ripslang prepared for another charge  it seemed to have got some extra spikes set up in its wrath for its whole body was bristlin more or less by this time  again skinclip tugged like a maniac at the line  the ripslang charged the lobster tugged the poor feller stepped back hastily got his heels entangled in seaweed and went down head first into the grove  the men got alarmed by this time so they pulled him up as fast as they could an got him inboard in a few minutes but they do say added maxwell with emphasis that that ripslang leaped right out o the water arter him an the lobster held on so that they had to chop its claws off with a hatchet to make it let go  they supped off it the game night and long tom skinclip who owned an over strong appetite had a bad fit of indisgestion in consikence    chapter twenty three  more about the sea  once more we beg our reader to accompany us to seaout into the thick darkness over the wild waves far from the abodes of man  there one night in december a powerful steamer did battle with a tempest  the wind was against her and as a matter of course also the sea  the first howled among her rigging with what might have been styled vicious violence  the seas hit her bows with a fury that caused her to stagger and bursting right over her bulwarks at times swept the decks from stem to stern but nothing could altogether stop her onward progress  the sleepless monster in the hold with a heart of fervent heat and scalding breath of intense energy and muscles of iron mould and an indomitableyet to man submissivewill wrought on night and day unweariedly driving the floating palace straight and steadily on her coursehomewardbound  down in the cabin in one of the side berths lay a female form opposite to it in a similar berth lay another female form  both forms were very limp  the faces attached to the forms were pale yellow edged here and there with green  my dear sighed one of the forms this is dreadful  after a long silence as though much time were required for the inhalation of sufficient air for the purpose the other form replied  yes laura dear it is dreadful  ave a cup of tea ladies said the stewardess opening the door just then and appearing at an acute angle with the doorway holding a cup in each hand  miss pritty shuddered and covered her head with the bedclothes  aileen made the form of no thanks with her lips and shut her eyes  do ave a cup said the stewardess persuasively  the cups appeared at that moment inclined to ave a little game of hideandseek which the stewardess nimbly prevented by suddenly forming an obtuse angle with the floor and following that action up with a plunge to starboard and a heel to port that was suggestiveat least to a landsmanof an intention to baptise miss pritty with hot tea and thereafter take a header through the cabin window into the boiling sea  she did neither however but muttered something about ow she do roll to be sure and seeing that her mission was hopeless left the cabin with a balked stagger and a sudden rush which was appropriately followed up by the door shutting itself with a terrific bang as though it should say you might have known as much goose why did you open me  laura dear said aileen did you hear what the captain said to some one just now in the cabin when the door was open  nno replied miss pritty faintly  i distinctly heard some one ask how fast we were going but i could not make out his reply  oh exclaimed the other brightening for a brief moment yes i did hear him  he said we were going six knots  now i do not understand what that means  did you mean that asked aileen turning her eyes languidly on her friend while a faint smile flickered on her mouth  mean what said miss pritty in evident surprise  no i see you didnt  well a knot means i believe a nautical mile  a notticle mile aileen what is that  a nautical mile dear me how stupid you are laura  oh  i understand  but really the noise of that screw makes it difficult to hear distinctly  and after all it is no wonder if i am stupid for what between eating nothing but pickles for six weeks and this dreadfulthere  oh  it comes ag  poor miss pritty stopped abruptly and made a desperate effort to think of home  aileen albeit full of sympathy turned her face to the wall and lay with closed eyes  after a time the latter looked slowly round  are you asleep laura  miss pritty gave a sharp semihysterical laugh at the bare idea of such an impossible condition  well i was going to say resumed aileen that we cannot be very far from land now and when we do get there  happy day murmured miss pritty  we intend continued aileen to go straight homeii mean to our old home sell everything at once and go to live in a cottagequite a tiny cottageby the sea somewhere  now i want you to come and visit us the very day we get into our cottage  i know you would like it would like being with me wouldnt you  like it  i should delight in it of all things  i knew you would  well i was going to say that it would be such a kindness to dear papa too for you know he will naturally be very lowspirited when we make the changefor it is a great change laura greater perhaps than you who have never been very rich can imagine and i doubt my capacity to be a good comforter to him though i have all the will  two little spots of red appeared for the first time for many weeks on miss prittys cheeks as she said in a tone of enthusiasm  what  you not a good comforter  ive a good mind to refuse your invitation since you dare to insinuate that i could in any degree supplement you in such a matter  well then we wont make any more insinuations returned aileen with a sad smile but youll comethats settled  you know dear that we had lost everything but ever since our jewelcase was found byby  by edgar said miss pritty why dont you go on  yes by mr berrington continued aileen ever since that papa has been very hopeful  i dont know exactly what his mind runs on but i can see that he is making heaps of plans in regard to the future and oh  you cant think how glad and how thankful i am for the change  the state of dull heartbreaking weary depression that he fell into just after getting the news of our failure was beginning to undermine his health  i could see that plainly and felt quite wretched about him but now he is comparatively cheerful and so gentle too  do you know i have been thinking a good deal lately of the psalmists saying it is good for me that i have been afflicted and in the midst of it all our heavenly father remembered mercy for it was he who sent our jewelbox as if to prevent the burden from being too heavy for papa  miss prittys kind face beamed agreement with these sentiments  now continued aileen these jewels are it seems worth a great deal of moneymuch more than i had any idea offor there are among them a number of very fine diamond rings and brooches  in fact papa told me that he believed the whole were worth between eight and nine thousand pounds  this you know is a sum which will at least raise us above want poor miss pritty well did she know thatthough of course it will not enable us to live very luxuriously  how fortunate it was that these pirates  oh screamed miss pritty suddenly as she drew the clothes over her head  whats the matter exclaimed aileen are you going to be  oh  no no no said miss pritty peeping out again how could you bring these dreadful creatures to my remembrance so abruptly  i had quite forgotten them for the time  why oh why did you banish from my mind that sweet idea of a charming cottage by the sea and all its little unluxurious elegancies and call up in its place the hhhorrors of that villagenestpigstyof the dreadful buccaneers  but it cant be helped now added miss pritty with a resigned shudder and we have the greatest reason to be thankful that their hope of a good ransom made them treat us as well as they didbut go on dear you were saying that it was fortunate that these ppirates  that they did not sell the jewels or take any of them out of the box or send them into the other prow which was sunk in deep water where the divers could not have gone down to recover them  very true assented miss pritty  at this point the cabin door again burst open and the amiable stewardess appeared bearing two cups of fresh tea which she watched with the eyes of a tigress and the smile of an angel while her body kept assuming sudden and one would have thought impossible attitudes  now ladies do try some tea  really you must  i insist on it why youll both die if you dont  impressed with the force of this reasoning both ladies made an effort and got up on their respective elbows  they smiled incredulously at each other and then becoming suddenly grave fell flat down on their backs and remained so for some time without speaking  now try again do try it will do you so much goodreally  thus adjured they tried again and succeeded  aileen took one sip of tea spilt much of the rest in thrusting it hurriedly into the ready hands of the all but ubiquitous stewardess and fell over with her face to the wall  miss pritty looked at her tea for a few seconds earnestly  the stewardess not being quite ubiquitous failed to catch the cup as it was wildly held towards her  miss pritty therefore capsized the whole affair over her bedclothes and fell back with a deadly groan  the stewardess did not lose temper  she was used to such things  if miss pritty had capsized her intellect over the bedclothes the stewardess would only have smiled and wiped it up with a napkin  youll be better soon miss said the amiable woman as she retired with the debris  the selfacting door shut her out with a bang of contemptuous mockery and the poor ladies were once more left alone in their misery    chapter twenty four  taking the tide at the ebb  when things in this world reach their lowest ebb it is generally understood or expected that the tide will turn somehow and rise  not unfrequently the understanding and the expectation are disappointed still there are sufficiently numerous instances of the fulfilment of both to warrant the hope which is usually entertained by men and women whose tide has reached its lowest  mr hazlit was naturally of a sanguine temperament  he entertained we had almost said majestic views on many points  esteeming himself a beggar on three hundred a yearthe remains of the wreck of his vast fortunehe resolved to commence business again  being a man of strict probity and punctuality in all business matters and being much respected and sympathised with by his numerous business friends he experienced little difficulty in doing so  success attended his efforts the tide began to rise  seated in a miniature parlour before a snug fire in his cottage by the sea with one of the prettiest girls in all england by his side knitting him a pair of inimitable socks the beggar opened his mouth slowly and spake  aileen said he ive been a fool  had mr hazlit said so to some of his cynical male friends they might have tacitly admitted the fact and softened the admission with a smile as it was his auditor replied  no papa you have not  yes my love i have  but i do not intend to prove the point or dispute it  there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the ebb leads on to fortune  aileen suspended her knitting and looked at her sire with some surprise for being a very matteroffact unpoetical man this misquotation almost alarmed her  taken at the flood is it not papa  it may be so in shakespeares experience  i say the ebb  when first i was reduced to beggary  you never were that papa  we have never yet had to beg  of course of course said mr hazlit with a motion of his hand to forbid further interruption  when i say beggary you know what i mean  i certainly do not mean that i carry a wallet and a staff and wear ragged garments and knock at backdoors  well when i was reduced to beggary i had reached the lowest ebb  at that time i was ledmark me i was ledto take the tide  i took it and have been rising with the flood to fortune ever since  and yet strange to say though i am now rich in a way i never before dreamed of i have still an insane thirst for earthly gold  what was the passage dear that you quoted to me as being your text for the day  owe no man anything replied aileen  yes it is curious  i have never mentioned the subject to you my child but some months agowhen as i have said the tide was very lowi was led to consider that passage and under the influence of it i went to my creditors and delivered up to them your box of jewels  you are aware no doubt that having passed through the insolvency court and given up all that i possessed i became legally free  this box was recovered from the deep and restored to me after my effects had been given up to my creditors so that i might have retained it  but i felt that this would have been unjust  i respect the law which after a man has given up all he possesses sets him free to begin life again with some degree of hope but i cannot avoid coming to the conclusion that moral duties cannot be abrogated by human laws  i take advantage of the law to prevent inhuman creditors from grinding me to death but i refuse to take advantage of the law so as to escape from the clear duty that i ought to pay these creditorsgradually and according to my abilityto the uttermost farthing  having been led to act on this opinion i gave up the box of jewels  to my surprise my creditors refused to take them  they returned them to me as a gift  i accepted the gift as a trust  on the proceeds as you see we manage to live comfortably and i am now conducting a fairly successful business in the old lineon a small scale  mr hazlit smiled sadly as he uttered the last words  and the debts papa which you told me once were so heavy do you mean to pay them all asked aileen anxiously  i do replied her father earnestly by slow degrees it may be but to the last farthing if i live  i shall try to owe no man anything  a glad smile lit up aileens face as she was on the point of throwing her arms round her fathers neck when the door opened and a small domestictheir only one besides the cookput a letter into the hands of her young mistress  aileens countenance assumed a troubled look a she handed it to her father  it is for you papa  mr hazlits visage also assumed an expression of anxiety as he opened and read the letter  it ran thus    deer suri thinks it unkomon ard that a man shood ave is beed   sold under im wen anuther man oas im munny speshally wen is wifes   illpraps adyinthe law has washt yoo sur but it do seam ard on   me if yoo cood spair ony a pownd or two id taik it kindyoors to   komand john timms  this is very much to the point said mr hazlit with a faint smile handing the letter to aileen  it is as you see from our old greengrocer who must indeed be in great trouble when he who used to be so particularly civil could write in that strain to me  now aileen i want your opinion on a certain point  in consequence of your economical ways my love i find myself in a position to give fifty pounds this halfyear towards the liquidation of my debts  the merchant paused smiled and absolutely looked a little confused the idea of commencing to liquidate many thousands of pounds by means of fifty was so inexpressibly ridiculous that he half expected to hear his own respectful child laugh at him  but aileen did not laugh  with her large earnest eyes she looked at him and the unuttered language of her pursed grave little mouth was well go on  the liquidation of my debts repeated mr hazlit firmly  the sum is indeed a small onea paltry onecompared with the amount of these debts but the passage which we have been considering appears to me to leave no option save to begin at once even on the smallest possible scale  now my love duty requires that i should at once begin to liquidate  observe the law of the land requires nothing  it has set me free but the law of god requires that i should pay at once as i am able  conscience echoes the law and says pay  what therefore am i to do  mr hazlit propounded this question with such an abrupt gaze as well as tone of interrogation that the little pursed mouth relaxed into a little smile as it said i suppose you must divide the sum proportionally among your creditors or something of that sort  just so said mr hazlit nodding approval  now he continued with much gravity if i were to make the necessary calculationwhich i may remark would be a question in proportion running into what i may be allowed to style infinitesimal fractionsi would probably find out that the proportion payable to one would be a shilling to another half a sovereign to another a pound or so while to many would accrue so small a fraction of a farthing that no suitable coin of this realm could be found wherewith to pay it  if i were to go with say two shillings and offer them to my good friend granby as part payment of my debt to him the probability is that he would laugh in my face and invite me to dinner in order that we might celebrate the event over a bottle of very old port  dont you think so  aileen laughed and said that she did think so  well then continued her father what in these circumstances says common sense  aileens mouth became grave again and her eyes very earnest as she said quickly  pay off the greengrocer  mr hazlit nodded approval  you are right  mr timms account amounts to twenty pounds  to offer twenty pounds to mr granbyto whom i owe some eight thousand more or lesswould be a poor practical joke  to give it to mr timms will evidently be the saving of his business at a time when it appears to have reached a crisis  put on your bonnet and shawl dear and we will go about this matter without delay  aileen was one of those girls who possessed the rare and delectable capacity to throw on her bonnet and shawl  one glance in the mirror sufficed to convince her that these articles although thrown on had fallen into their appropriate places neatly  it could scarcely have been otherwise  her bonnet and shawl took kindly to her like all other things in natureanimate and otherwise  she reappeared before her sedate father had quite finished drawing on his gloves  mr john timms dwelt in a back lane which wriggled out of a back street as if it were anxious to find something still further back into which to back itself  he had been in better circumstances and in a better part of the town when mr hazlit had employed him  at the time of the rich merchants failure the house of timms had been in a shaky condition that failure was the removal of its last prop it fell and timms retired as we have seen into the commercial background  here however he did not find relief  being a trustful man he was cheated until he became untrustful  his wife became ill owing to bad air and low diet  his six children became unavoidably neglected and riotous and his business started on the wreck of the old one again came to the brink of failure  it was in these circumstances that he sat down under the impulse of a fit of desperation and penned the celebrated letter to his old customer  when mr hazlit and his daughter had with great difficulty discovered mr timms residence and approached the door they were checked on the threshold by the sound of men apparently in a state of violent altercation within  git out wid ye an look sharp you spalpeen cried one of the voices  oh pray dontdont fight cried a weak female voice  no i wont git out till im paid or carry your bed away with me cried a mans voice fiercely  you wont eh  arrah thenhup  the last sound which is not describable was immediately followed by the sudden appearance of a man who flew down the passage as if from a projectile and went headlong into the kennel  he was followed closely by rooney machowl who dealt the man as he rose a sounding slap on the right cheek which would certainly have tumbled him over again had it not been followed by an equally sounding slap on the left cheek which brought him up all standing  catching sight at that moment of mr hazlit and aileen rooney stopped short and stood confused  murder shrieked the injured man  hooray  heres a lark screamed a small streetboy  go it  plice  a skrimmage yelled another streetboy in an ecstasy of delight which immediately drew to the spot the nucleus of a crowd  mr hazlit was a man of promptitude  he was also a large man as we have elsewhere said and by no means devoid of courage  dropping his daughters arm he suddenly seized the illused and noisy man by the neck and thrust him almost as violently back into the greengrocers house as rooney had kicked him out of it  he then said go in to the amazed rooney and dragging his no less astonished child in along with him shut and locked the door  now said mr hazlit sitting down on a broken chair in a very shabby little room and wiping his heated brow what is the meaning of all this mr timms  well sir answered timms with a deprecatory air im sorry sir it should ave appened just wen you was agoin to favour me with the unexpected honour of a wisit but the truth is sir i couldnt elp it this ere scman is my landlord sir an e wouldnt wait another day for is rent sir though i told im he was pretty sure o avin it in a week or so wen i ad time to clect my outstandin little bills  more nor that sur burst in the impatient and indignant rooney he would ave gone into that there room surif i may miscall a dark closet by that namean ave pulled the bed out from under mrs timms whos adyin sur if i adnt chanced to come in sur an kick the spalpeen into the street as you seed  for wich youll smart yet growled the landlord who stood in a dishevelled heap like a bad boy in a corner  how much rent does he owe you asked mr hazlit of the landlord  thats no business o yours replied the man sulkily  if i were to offer to pay it perhaps youd allow that it was my business  so i will wen you offers  well then i offer now said mr hazlit taking out his purse and pouring a little stream of sovereigns into his hand  have you the receipt made out  the landlord made no reply but with a look of wonder at his interrogator drew a small piece of dirty paper from his pocket and held it out  mr hazlit examined it carefully from beginning to end  is this right mr timms he asked  the greengrocer examined the paper and said it wasthat five pounds was the exact amount  you can put the receipt in your pocket said mr hazlit turning round and counting out five sovereigns on the table which he pushed towards the landlord  now take yourself off as quietly as you can else ill have you taken up and tried for entering a mans premises forcibly and endeavouring to obtain money by intimidation  go  this was a bold stroke on the part of the merchant whose legal knowledge was not extensive but it succeeded  the landlord pocketed the money and moved towards the door  rooney machowl followed him  rooney said mr hazlit calling him back  maynt i show him out sur said rooney earnestly  by no means  ah sur maynt i give him a farewell kick  certainly not  mr hazlit then expressed a desire to see mrs timms and the greengrocer thanking the merchant fervently for his timely aid lighted a candle and led the way into the dark closet  poor mrs timms a delicatelooking woman not yet forty who had evidently been pretty once lay on a miserable bed apparently at the point of death  aileen glided quickly to the bed sat down on it and took the womans hand while she bent over her and whispered  dont be distressed  the rent is paid  he will disturb you no more you shall be quiet now and i will come to see you sometimes if youll let me  the woman gazed at the girl with surprise then as she felt the gentle warm pressure of her hand a sudden rush of faith seemed to fill her soul  she drew aileen towards her and looked earnestly into her face  come here timms said mr hazlit abruptly as he turned round and walked out of the closet i want to speak to you  i am no doctor but depend upon it your wife will not die  there is a very small buildingquite a hut i may saynear my houseahem  near my cottage close to the sea which is at present to let  i advise you strongly to take that hut and start a greengrocery there  im not aware that there is one in the immediate neighbourhood and there are many respectable families about whose custom you might doubtless count on at all events you would be sure of ours to begin with  the seaair would do your wife a world of good and the seabeach would be an agreeable and extensive playground for your children  the greengrocer stood almost aghast  the energy with which mr hazlit poured out his words and as it seemed to timms the free and easy magnificence of his ideas were overpowering  wy sir i aint got no money to do sitch a thing with he said at last with a broad grin  yes you have said mr hazlit again pulling out his purse and emptying its golden contents on the table in a little heap from which he counted fifteen sovereigns  my debt to you amounts i believe to twenty pounds five i have just paid to your landlord here is the balance  you neednt mind a receipt  send me the discharged account at your leisure and think over what i have suggested  aileen my dear we will go now  aileen said goodnight at once to the sick woman and followed her father as he went out repeatinggoodevening timms think over my suggestion  they walked slowly home without speaking  soon they reached the cottage by the sea  as they stood under the trelliswork porch the merchant turned round and gazed at the sun which was just dipping into the horizon flooding sea and sky with golden glory  aileen he said in a low voice i have commenced life at lastlife in earnest  i was a poor fool once  through grace i am a rich man now    chapter twenty five  shows how our hero formed plans how miss pritty formed plots and how the small domestic amused herself  on a certain cold raw bleak biting bitter day in november our hero found himself comfortably situated at the bottom of the sea  we say comfortably advisedly and comparatively for as compared with the men whose duty it was to send air down to him edgar berrington was in a state of decided comfort  above water nought was to be seen but a bleak rocky forbidding coast a grey sky with sleet driving across it and an angry indigo sea covered with white wavelets  nothing was to be felt but a stiff cutting breeze icy particles in the air and cold blood in the veins  below water all was calm and placid groves of seaweed delighted the eye patches of yellow sand invited to a siesta the curiouslytwisted and smashedup remains of a wreck formed a subject of interesting contemplation while a few wandering crabs and an erratic lobster or two gave life and variety to the scene while the temperature if not warm was at all events considerably milder than that overhead  in short strange though it may seem edgar was in rather an enviable position than otherwise on that bleak november day  some two years or so previous to the day to which we refer edgar with his diving friends had returned to england  mr hazlit had preceded them by a month  but edgar did not seek him out  he had set a purpose before him and meant to stick to it  he had made up his mind not to go near aileen again until he had made for himself a position and secured a steady income which would enable him to offer her a home at least equal to that in which she now dwelt  mr hazlit rather wondered that the young engineer never made his appearance at the cottage by the sea but coming to the conclusion that his passion had cooled he consoled himself with the thought that after all he was nearly penniless and that it was perhaps as well that he had sheered off  aileen also wondered but she did not for a moment believe that his love had cooled being well aware that that was an impossibility  still she was perplexed for although the terms on which they stood to each other did not allow of correspondence she thought sometimes that he might have written to her fatherif only to ask how they were after their adventures in the china seas  miss prittyto whom aileen confided her troublescame nearer the mark than either of them  she conceived and stoutly maintained that edgar had gone abroad to seek his fortune and meant to return and marry aileen when he had made it  edgar however had not gone abroad  he had struck out a line of life for himself and had prosecuted it during these two years with untiring energy  he had devoted himself to submarine engineering and having an independent spirit he carved his way very much as a freelance  at first he devoted himself to studying the subject and ere long there was not a method of raising a sunken vessel of building a difficult breakwater of repairing a complicated damage to a pier or a well or anything else subaqueous with which he was not thoroughly acquainted and in regard to which he had not suggested or carried out bold and novel plans and improvements both in regard to the machinery employed and the modes of action pursued  after a time he became noted for his success in undertaking difficult works and at last employed a staff of divers to do the work while he chiefly superintended  joe baldwin became his righthand man and constant attendant  rooney and maxwell preferring steadier and less adventurous work got permanent employment on the harbour improvements of their own seaport town  thus engaged edgar and his man joe visited nearly all the wild places round the stormy shores of great britain and ireland  they raised many ships from the bottom of the sea that had been pronounced by other engineers to be hopelessly lost  they laid foundations of piers and breakwaters in places where old ocean had strewn wrecks since the foundation of the world  they cleared passages by blasting and levelling rocks whose stern crests had bid defiance to winds and waves for ages and they recovered cargoes that had been given up for years to neptunes custody  in short wherever a difficult submarine operation had to be undertaken edgar berrington and his man joe with perhaps a gang of divers under them were pretty sure to be asked to undertake it  the risk we need scarcely say was often considerable hence the remuneration was good and both edgar and his man speedily acquired a considerable sum of money  at the end of two years the former came to the conclusion that he had a sufficient sum at his credit in the bank to warrant a visit to the cottage by the sea and it was when this idea had grown into a fixed intention that he found himself as we have mentioned in rather comfortable circumstances at the bottom of the sea  the particular part of the bottom lay off the west coast of england joe and a gang of men were hard at work on a pier when edgar went down he carried a slate and piece of pencil with him  the bottom was not very deep down  there was sufficient light to enable him to find his man easily  joe was busy laying a large stone in its bed  when he raised his burly form after fixing the stone edgar stepped forward and touching him on the shoulder held out the slate whereon was written in a bold running hand  joe im going off to get engaged and after that as soon as possible to be married  through the window of his helmet joe looked at his employer with an expression of pleased surprise  then he took the slate obliterated the information on it and printed in an equally bold but very sprawly hand  indeed  i wish you joy sir  thereupon edgar took the slate and wrote  thank you joe  now i leave you in charge  keep a sharp eye on the menespecially on that lazy fellow who has a tendency to sleep and shirk duty  if the rock in the fairway is got ready before my return blast it at once without waiting for me  you will find one of siebe and gormans voltaic batteries in my lodging also a frictional electrical machine which you can use if you prefer it  in the store there is a large supply of tincases for gunpowder and compressed guncotton charges  there also you will find one of heinke and daviss magnetoelectric exploders  i leave it entirely to your own judgment which apparatus to use  all sorts are admirable in their way quite fresh and in good working order  have you anything to say to me before i go  all right sir replied joe in his sprawly hand ill attend to orders  when do you start and when do you expect to be back  i start immediately  the day of my return is uncertain but ill write to you  rubbing this out joe wrote  youll praps see my old ooman sir  if you do just give her my respects an say the last pair o divin drawers she knitted for me was fustrate  tightish if anything round the waist but a bit o ropeyarn putt that all righttheyre warm an comfortable  goodbye i wish you joy again sir  goodbye replied edgar  it was impossible that our hero could follow his inclination and nod with his stiffnecked iron headpiece at parting  he therefore made the motion of kissing his hand to his trusty man and giving the requisite signal spread his arms like a pair of wings and flew up to the realms of light  joe grinned broadly and made the motion of kissing his hand to the ponderous soles of his employers leaden boots as they passed him then turning to the granite masonry at his side he bent down and resumed his work  arrived at the region of atmospheric air edgar berrington clambered on board the attending vessel took off his amphibious clothing and arrayed himself in the ordinary habiliments of a gentleman after which he went ashore gave some instructions to the keeper of his lodgings ordered his horse galloped to the nearest railway station flashed a telegraphic message to miss pritty to expect to see him that evening and soon found himself rushing at forty miles an hour away from the scene of his recent labours  receiving a telegraph envelope halfanhour later miss pritty turned pale laid it on the table sank on the sofa shut her eyes and attempted to reduce the violent beating of her heart by pressing her left side tightly with both hands  it must be deathor accident she murmured faintly to herself for she happened to be alone at the time  poor miss pritty had no near relations in the world except edgar and therefore there was little or no probability that any one would telegraph to her in connection with accident or death nevertheless she entertained such an unconquerable horror of a telegram that the mere sight of the wellknown envelope with its largetype title gave her a little shock the reception of one was almost too much for her  after suffering tortures for about as long a time as the telegram had taken to reach her she at last summoned courage to open the envelope  the first words edgar berrington induced a little scream of alarm the next to miss pritty quieted her a little  when however she learned that instead of being visited by news of death and disaster she was merely to be visited by her nephew that same evening all anxiety vanished from her speaking countenance and was replaced by a mixture of surprise and amusement  then she sat down on the sofafrom which in her agitation she had risenand fell into a state of perplexity  now i do wish she said aloud that eddy had had the sense to tell me whether i am to let his friends the hazlits know of his impending visit  perhaps he telegraphed to me on purpose to give me time to call and prepare them for his arrival  on the other hand perhaps he wishes to take them by surprise  it may be that he is not on good terms with mr hazlit and intends to use me as a gobetween  what shall i do  as her conscience was not appealed to in the matter it gave no reply to the question having little or no common sense to speak of she could scarcely expect much of an answer from that part of her being  at last she made up her mind and according to a habit induced by a life of solitude expressed it to the fireplace  yes thats what ill do  i shall wait till near the time of the arrival of the last train and then go straight off to sea cottage to spend the evening leaving a message that if any one should call in my absence i am to be found there  this will give him an excuse if he wants one for calling and if he does not want an excuse he can remain here till my return  ill have the fire made up and tell my domestic to offer tea to any one who should chance to call  miss pritty thought it best on the whole to give an ambiguous order about the tea to her small domestic for she knew that lively creature to be a compound of inquisitiveness and impudence and did not choose to tell her who it was that she expected to call  she was very emphatic however in impressing on the small domestic the importance of being very civil and attentive and of offering tea insomuch that the child protested with much fervour that she would be sure to attend to orders  this resulted in quite an evenings amusement to the small domestic  after miss pritty had gone out the first person who chanced to call was the spouse of mr timms the greengrocer who had obviously recovered from her illness  is miss pritty at ome she asked  no maam she aint shes hout answered the small domestic  ah  well it dont much matter  i ony called to leave this ere little present of cabbidges an cawliflowerswith mr timms kind compliments and mine  shes been wery kind to us as miss pritty an we wishes to acknowledge it  please maam said the domestic with a broad smile as she took the basket of vegetables would you like a cup of tea  what dyou mean girl asked the greengrocers wife in surprise  please maam miss pritty told me to be sure to offer you a cup of tea  did she indeed  thats was wery kind of her wery kind though ow she come for to know i was agoin to call beats my comprehension owever tell her im greatly obleeged to her but avin ad tea just afore comin out an bein chockfull as i can old id rather not best thanks all the same  mrs timms went away deeply impressed with miss prittys thoughtful kindness and the small domestic shutting the door indulged in a fit of that species of suppressed laughter which is usually indicated by a series of spurts through the top of the nose and the compressed lips  she was suddenly interrupted by a tap at the knocker  allowing as many minutes to elapse as she thought would have sufficed for her ascent from the kitchen she once more opened the door  it was only a beggara ragged disreputable manand she was about to shut the door in his face with that summary politeness so well understood by servant girls when a thought struck her  oh sir she said would you like a cup of tea  the man evidently thought he was being made game of for his face assumed such a threatening aspect that the small domestic incontinently shut the door with a sudden bang  the beggar amused himself by battering it with his stick for five minutes and then went away  the next visitor was a lady  is miss pritty at home child she asked regarding the domestic with a halfpatronising halfpitying air  no maam shes hout  oh  thats a pity said the lady taking a book out of her pocket will you tell her that i called for her subscription to the new hospital that is about to be built in the town  your mistress does not know me personally but she knows all about the hospital and this book which i shall call for tomorrow will speak for itself  be sure you give it to her child  yes maam  and please maam would you like a cup of tea  the lady who happened to possess a majestic pair of eyes looked so astonished that the small domestic could scarcely contain herself  are you deranged child asked the lady  no maam if you please but miss pritty told me to be sure to offer you a cup  to offer me a cup child  yes maam  at least to offer a cup to any one who should call  it need scarcely be added that the lady declined the tea and went away observing to herself in an undertone that she must be deranged  the small domestic again shut the door and spurted  it was in her estimation quite a rare delicious and novel species of fun  to one whose monotonous life was spent underground with a prospect of bricks at two feet from her window and in company with pots pans potatopeelings and blackbeetles it was as good as a scene in a play  the next visitor was the butchers boy who came round to take orders for the following day  this boy had a tendency to chaff  well my lady has your ladyship any orders  nothink today answered the domestic curtly  what  nothink at all  goin to fast tomorrow eh  or to live on stooed hatmospheric hair with your own sauce for graveyhey  no we doesnt want nothink repeated the domestic stoutly  missus said so an she bid me ask you if youd like a cup of tea  the butchers boy opened his mouth and eyes in amazement  to have his own weapons thus turned as he thought against him by one who was usually rather soft and somewhat shy of him took him quite aback  he recovered however quickly and made a rush at the girl who as before attempted to shut the door with a bang but the boy was too sharp for her  his foot prevented her succeeding and there is no doubt that in another moment he would have forcibly entered the house if he had not been seized from behind by the collar in the powerful grasp of edgar berrington who sent him staggering into the street  the boy did not wait for more  with a wildindian warwhoop he turned and fled  excited and to some extent exasperated by this last visit the small domestic received edgar with a onethird timid onethird gleeful and onethird reckless spirit  what did the boy mean asked edgar as he turned towards her  please sir e wouldnt ave a cup of tea sir she replied meekly then with a gleam of hope in her eyeswill you ave one sir  youre a curious creature answered edgar with a smile  is miss pritty at home  no sir she aint  this answer appeared to surprise and annoy him  very odd he said with a little frown  did she not expect me  no sir i think she didnt  leastways she didnt say as she did but she was very partikler in tellin me to be sure to hoffer you a cup of tea  edgar looked at the small domestic and as he looked his mouth expanded  her mouth followed suit and they both burst into a fit of laughter  after a moment or two the former recovered  this is all very pleasant no doubt he said but it is uncommonly awkward  did she say when she would be home  no sir she didnt but she bid me say if any one wanted her that theyd find her at sea cottage  at sea cottagewho lives there  i dont know sir  where is it  on the seashore sir  which waythis way or that way asked edgar pointing right and left  that way answered the girl pointing left  the impatient youth turned hastily to leave  please sir said the domestic  well said edgar stopping  youre sure sir she stopped  wellgo on  that you wouldnt like to ave a cup of tea  child said edgar as he turned finally away youre madas mad as a march hare  thank you sir  the small domestic shut the door and retired to the regions below where taking the pots and pans and blackbeetles into her confidence she shrieked with delight for full ten minutes and hugged herself    chapter twenty six  a climax is reached  when edgar berrington discovered the cottage by the sea and ascertained that miss pritty was within he gave his name and was ushered into the snug little room under the name of mr briggington  aileen gave a particularly minute but irrepressible and quite inaudible scream mr hazlit sat bolt up in his chair as if he had seen a ghost and miss prittyfeeling somehow that her diplomacy had not become a brilliant successshrank within herself and wished it were tomorrow  their various expressions however were as nothing compared with edgars blazing surprise  mr hazlit he stammered pray pardon my sudden intrusion at so unseasonable an hour but really i was not aware thatdid you not get my telegram aunt  he turned abruptly to miss pritty  why yees but i thought that youin facti could not imagine that  never mind explanations just now said mr hazlit recovering himself and rising with a bland smile you are welcome mr berrington no hour is unseasonable for one to whom we owe so much  they shook hands and laughed then edgar shook hands with aileen and blushed no doubt because she blushed then he saluted his aunt and took refuge in being very particular about her receipt of the telegram this threw miss pritty into a state of unutterable confusion because of her efforts to tell the truth and conceal the truth at one and the same time  after this they spent a very happy evening together during the course of which mr hazlit took occasion to ask edgar to accompany him into a little pigeonhole of a room which in deference to a few books that dwelt there was styled the library  mr berrington he said sitting down and pointing to a chair be seated  i wish to have a little private conversation with you  we are both practical men and know the importance of thoroughly understanding each other  when i saw you lastnow about two years agoyou indicated some disposition toto regardin fact to pay your addresses to my daughter  at that time i objected to you on the ground that you were penniless  whether right or wrong in that objection is now a matter of no importance because it turns out that i was right on other grounds as i now find that you did not know your own feelings and did not care for her  did not care for her interrupted edgar in sudden amazement not unmingled with indignation  of course continued mr hazlit with undisturbed calmness i mean that you did not care for her sufficiently that you did not regard her with that unconquerable affection which is usually styled love and without which no union can be a happy one  the proof to me that your feeling towards her was evanescent lies in the fact that you have taken no notice either of her or of me for two years  had you gained my daughters affections this might have caused me deep regret but as she has seldom mentioned your name since we last saw you save when i happened to refer to you i perceive that her heart has been untouched for which i feel exceedingly thankful knowing as i do only too well that we cannot command our affections  mr hazlit paused a moment and edgar was so thunderstruck by the unexpected nature of his hosts discourse that he could only stare at him in mute surprise and unbelief in the evidence of his own ears  now resumed mr hazlit as things stand i shall be very happy indeed that we should return to our old intimacy  i can never forget the debt of obligation we owe to you as our rescuer from worse than deathfrom slavery among brutalised men and i shall be very happy indeed that you should make my little cottage by the seaas aileen loves to style ityour abode whenever business or pleasure call you to this part of the country  the merchant extended his hand with a smile of genuine urbanity  the youth took it mechanically shook it let it fall and continued to stare in a manner that made mr hazlit feel quite uneasy  suddenly he recovered and looking the latter earnestly in the face said  mr hazlit did you not two years ago forbid me to enter your dwelling  true true replied the other somewhat disconcerted but the events which have occurred since that time warranted your considering that order as cancelled  but you did not say it was cancelled  moreover your first objection still remained for i was nearly penniless then although in the good providence of god i am comparatively rich now  i therefore resolved to obey your injunctions sir and keep away from your house and from your daughters distracting influence until i could return with a few of those pence which you appear to consider so vitally important  mr berrington exclaimed the old gentleman who was roused by this hit you mistake me  my opinions in regard to wealth have been considerably changed of late  but my daughter does not love you and if you were as rich as croesus sir you should not have her hand without her heart  mr hazlit said this stoutly and just as stoutly edgar replied  if i were as rich as croesus sir i would not accept her hand without her heart but mr hazlit i am richer than croesus  what do you mean sir  i mean that i am rich in the possession of that which a worlds wealth could not purchaseyour daughters affections  impossible  mr berrington your passion urges you to deceive yourself  you will believe what she herself says i suppose asked edgar plunging his hand into a breastpocket  of course i will  well then listen said the youth drawing out a small threecornered note  a good many months ago when i found my business to be in a somewhat flourishing condition i ventured to write to aileen telling her of my circumstances of my unalterable love and expressing a wish that she would write me at least one letter to give me hope that the love which she allowed me to understand was in her breast before you forbade our intercourse still continued  this he added handing the threecornered note to the old gentleman is her reply  mr hazlit took the note and with a troubled countenance read    dear mr berringtoni am not sure that i am right in replying to   you without my fathers knowledge and only prevail on myself to do so   because i intend that our correspondence shall go no further and what   i shall say will i know be in accordance with his sentiments  my   feelings towards you remain unchanged  we cannot command feelings   but i consider the duty i owe to my dear father to be superior to my   feelings and i am resolved to be guided by his expressed wishes as   long as i remain under his roof  he has forbidden me to have any   intercourse with you i will therefore obey until he sanctions a   change of conduct  even this brief note should not have been written   were it not that it would be worse than rude to take no notice of a   letter from one who has rendered us such signal service and whom i   shall never forgetyours sincerely aileen hazlit  the last sentenceand whom i shall never forgethad been carefully scribbled out but edgar had set himself to work with the care and earnest application of an engineer and a lover to decipher the words  dear child exclaimed mr hazlit in a fit of abstraction kissing the note this accounts for her never mentioning him then recovering himself and turning abruptly and sternly to edgar he saidhow did you dare sir to write to her after my express prohibition  well replied edgar some allowance ought to be made for a lovers anxiety to know how matters stood and i fully intended to follow up my letter to her with one to you but i confess that i did wrong  no sir no cried mr hazlit abruptly starting up and grasping edgars hand which he shook violently you did not do wrong  you did quite right sir  i would have done the same myself in similar circumstances  so saying mr hazlit feeling that he was compromising his dignity shook edgars hand again and hastened from the room  he met aileen descending the staircase  brushing past her he went into his bedroom and shut and locked the door  much alarmed by such an unwonted display of haste and feeling aileen ran into the library  oh  mr berrington what is the matter with papa  if you will sit down beside me aileen said edgar earnestly tenderly and firmly taking her hand i will tell you  aileen blushed stammered attempted to draw back but was constrained to comply  edgar on the contrary was as cool as a cucumber  he had evidently availed himself of his engineering knowledge and fitted extra weights of at least seven thousand tons to the various safetyvalves of his feelings  your father he began looking earnestly into the girls downcast face is  but hold  reader we must not go on  if you are a boy you wont mind what followed if a girl you have no right to pry into such matters we therefore beg leave at this point to shut the lids of our dexter eye and drop the curtain    chapter twenty seven  the last  one day joe baldwin assisted by his old friend rooney machowl was busily engaged down at the bottom of the sea off the irish coast slinging a box of gold specie  he had given the signal to haul up and rooney had moved away to put slings round another box when the chain to which the gold was suspended snapt and the box descended on joe  if it had hit him on the back in its descent it would certainly have killed him but it only hit his collarbone and broke it  joe had just time to give four pulls on his lines and then fainted  he was instantly hauled up carefully unrobed and put to bed  this was a turningpoint in our divers career  the collarbone was all right in the course of a month or two but mrs baldwin positively refused to allow her goodman to go under water again  the little fortin you made out in chiny she said one evening while seated with her husband at supper in company with rooney and his wife pays for our rent an somethin over  youre a handy man and can do amany things to earn a penny and i can wash enough myself to keep us both  youve bin a ard workin man joe for many a year  youve bin long enough under water  youll git rheumatiz or somethin o that sort if you go on longer so im resolved that you shant do it there  molly cushla said machowl in a modest tone i hope you wont clap a stopper on my goin under water for some time yitplaze  molly laughed  oh  its all very well for you to poke fun at me mister machowl said mrs baldwin but youre young yet an my joes past his prime when youve done as much work as hes donethere now youve done it at last  i told you so  this last remark had reference to the fact that young teddy machowl having been overfed by his father had gone into a stiff blueintheface condition that was alarming to say the least of it mrs machowl dashed at her offspring and giving him an unmerciful thump on the back effected the ejection of a mass of beef which had been the cause of the phenomena  what a buster it isthe spalpeen observed rooney with a smile as he resumed the feeding process much to teddys delight youll niver do for a diver if you give way to appleplectic tendencies o that sort hereopen your mouth wide and shut your eyes  well well itll only be brought in manslaughter so he wont swing for it remarked mrs baldwin with a shrug of her shoulders  now joe she continued turning to her husband youll begin at once to look out for a situation above water  david maxwell can finish the job you had in handspeakin of that does any one know where david is just now  hes down at the bottom of a gasometer answered joe leastwise he was there this afternoonan a dirty place it is  a badsmellin job that i should think observed rooney  well it aint a sweetsmellin one returned joe  hes an adventurous man is david  i dont believe theres any hole of dirty water or mud on the face o this earth that he wouldnt go down to the bottom of if he was dared to it  hes fond of speculatin too ever since that trip to the china seas  you must know mrs rooney if your husband hasnt told you already that we divers many of us have our pet schemes for makin fortunes and some of us have tried to come across the spanish dubloons that are said to lie on the seabottom off many parts of our coast where the armada was lost  its jokin ye are said mrs machowl looking at joe with a sly twinkle in her pretty eyes  jokin  no indeed i aint rejoined the diver  did rooney never tell ye about the spanish armada  och  hes bin sayin somethin about it now an again but hes such a man for blarney that i never belave more nor half he says  sure aint that the very raison i tell ye always at laste twice as much as i know said rooney lighting his pipe  well my dear continued joe the short an the long of it is that about the year 1588 the spaniards sent off a huge fleet of big ships to take great britain and ireland by stormonce for alland have done with it but providence had work for britain to do and sent a series o storms that wrecked nearly the whole spanish fleet on our shores  many of these vessels had plenty of gold dubloons on board so when divin bells and dresses were invented men began to try their hands at fishin it up and sure enough some of it was actually found and brought up especially off the shores of the island of mull in scotland  they even went the length of forming companies in this country and in holland for the purpose of recovering treasure from wrecks  well ever since then up to the present time there have been speculative men among divers who have kept on tryin their hands at it  some have succeeded others have failed  david maxwell is one of the lucky ones for the most part and even when luck fails he never comes by any loss for hes a hardworkin man an keeps a tight hold of whatever he makes whether by luck or by labour  but what about the badsmellin job hes got on hand just now asked rooney  why hes repairin the bottom of a gas tank  he got the job through recoverin some gold watches that were thrown into the thames by some thieves as they were bein chased over london bridge  david found ten of emone bein worth fifty pounds  well just at that time an experienced and hardy fellow was wanted for the gaswork business so david was recommended  you know a gas tank as to look an smell is horrible enough to frighten a hippopotamus but david went up to the edge of this tank by a ladder and jumped in as cool as if hed bin jumpin into a bed with clean sheets  he stopped down five hours  of course in such filthy water a light would have been useless  he had to do it all by feelin nevertheless they say he made a splendid job of itthe bed of clay and puddle at the bottom bein smoothed as flat amost as a billiard tablebesides fixin sixteen ironplates for the gasholder to rest on  he was to finish the job this afternoon i believe  see note 1  ah hes a cute feller is david observed rooney reflectively as he watched a ring of smoke that rose from his pipe towards the ceiling what dee intind to turn your hand to if you give up divin joe  if said mrs baldwin with a peculiar intonation  well when you give it up said rooney with a bland smile  im not rightly sure replied joe  in the first place ill watch for the leadings of providence for without that i cannot expect success  then ill go and see mr berrington who has just returned they say from his wedding trip  my own wish is to become a sort of missionary among the poor people hereabouts  why joe said his friend youve bin that more or less for years past  ay at odd times returned joe but i should like to devote all my time to it now  in pursuance of his plan the exdiver went the following morning to the seashore and walked in the direction of sea cottage following the road that bordered the sands  near to that cottage about two hundred yards from it stood a small but very pretty villa  joe knew its name to be seabeach villa and understood that it was the abode of his former master and friend edgar berrington  there was a lovely garden in front full to overflowing with flowers of every name and hue and trelliswork bowers here and there covered with jessamine and honeysuckle  a seashell walk led to the front door  up this walk the diver sauntered and applied the knocker  the door was promptly opened by a very small sharpeyed domestic  is your master at home my dear asked joe kindly  i aint got no master replied the girl  no returned joe in some surprise  your missus then  my missus dont live ere  im ony loaned to this ouse said the small domestic loaned by miss pritty for two days till they find a servant gal for themselves  oh said joe with a smile is the gentleman who borrowed you within  no e aint replied the small domestic  at that moment mr hazlit walked up the path and accosted joe  ah you want to see my soninlaw  he had not yet returned  i expect him however today  perhaps if you call in the afternoon or tomorrow morning you may  he was interrupted by the sound of wheels  next moment a carriage dashed round the corner of the garden wall and drew up in front of the house  before the old gentleman had clearly realised the fact he found himself being smothered by one of the prettiest girls in all england and joe felt his hand seized in a grasp worthy of a diver  while aileen dragged her father into the villa in order to enable him to boast ever after that he had received the first kiss she ever gave under her own roof edgar led joe to a trelliswork arbour and sitting down beside him there said  come joe i know you want to see me about something  while these two are having it out indoors you and i can talk here  first mister eddy said joe holding out his big horny hand let me congratulate you on comin home  may the lord dwell in your house and write his name in your two hearts  amen returned edgar again grasping the divers hand  my dear wife and i expect to have that prayer answered in our new home for we put up a similar one before entering it  and now joe what is it that you want  well sir the fact is that my old woman thinks since i smashed my shoulder that its high time for me to give up divin and take to lighter work but i didnt know you were comin home today sir  i thought youd been home some days already else i wouldnt have come to you but  never mind joe  theres no time like the presentgo on  thus encouraged joe explained his circumstances and desires  when he had ended edgar remained silent for some minutes  joe he said at length you used to be fond of gardening  have you forgotten all about it  why not quite sir but  stayill come back in a few minutes said edgar rising hastily and going into the house  in a few minutes he returned with his wife  joe said he mrs berrington has something to say to you  mr baldwin said aileen with a peculiar smile i am greatly in want of a gardener  can you tell me where i am likely to find one or can you recommend one  joe who was a quickwitted fellow replied with much gravity  no missmaam i meani cant  thats a pity returned aileen with a little frown of perplexity i am also much in want of a cookdo you know of one  no maam said joe i dont  what a stupid unobservant fellow you must be joe said edgar not to be able to recommend a cook or a gardener and you living as i may say in the very midst of such useful personages  now aileen i can recommend both a cook and a gardener to you  you see maam interrupted joe with profound gravity and an earnestness of manner that quite threw his questioners off their guard this is an occasion when you may learn a valuable lesson at the outset of wedded life so to speaknamely that it is much safer an wiser when you chance to be in a difficulty to apply to your husband for information than to the likes of me you see hes ready with what you want at a moments notice  aileen and edgar were upset by this they both laughed heartily and then the former said  now mr baldwin we wont beat any longer about the bush  we have not succeeded in getting a cook being in the meantime obliged to content ourselves with a temporary loan of the greengrocers wife and of miss prittys small domestic therefore i want to engage your wife who is at present i believe open to an engagement  we are also unprovided with a man to tend our garden look after our pony and help me in the missionary work in which i hope immediately to be engaged in this town do you accept that situation  aileen said this with such an earnest irresistible air that joe baldwin struck his colours on the spot and said i do with nearly as much fervour as edgar had said these words six weeks before  the thing was settled then and there for joe felt well assured that his amiable susan would have no objection to such an arrangement  now while this was going on in the bower mr hazlit observing that his children were occupied with something important sauntered down the seashell road in the direction of his own cottage  here he met miss pritty  the sight of her mild innocent face called up a thought  dozens of other thoughts immediately seized hold of the first thought and followed it  mr hazlit was sometimes though not often impulsive  he took miss prittys hand without saying a word drew her arm within his own and led her into the cottage  miss pritty he said sitting down and pointing to a chair you have always been very kind to my daughter  she has always been very kindvery kindto me answered miss pritty with a slight look of surprise  truethere is no doubt whatever about that returned mr hazlit but just now i wish to refer to your kindness to her  you came unselfishly at great personal inconvenience to china at my selfish request and for her sake you endured horrors in connection with the sea of which i had no conception until i witnessed your sufferings  i am grateful for your selfsacrificing kindness and am now about to take a somewhat doubtful mode of showing my gratitude namely by asking you to give up your residence in town and come to be my housekeepermy companion and friend  mr hazlit paused and miss pritty looking at him with her mild eyes excessively wide open gave no audible expression to her feelings or sentiments being for the moment bereft of the power of utterance  you see continued mr hazlit in a sad voice looking slowly round the snug parlour i shall be a very lonely man now that my darling has left my roof  and you must not suppose miss pritty that i ask you to make any engagement that would tie you even for a year to a life that you might not relish  i only ask you to come and try it  if you find that you prefer a life of solitude unhampered in any way you will only have to say so at any timea month a week after coming hereand i will cheerfully and without remonstrance reinstate you in your old homeor a similar oneexactly as i found you even to your small domestic who may come here and be your private maid if you choose  miss pritty could not find it in her heart to refuse an offer so kindly made  the matter was therefore settled then and there just as that of the diver and his wife had been arranged next door  is it necessary to say that both arrangements were found in course of time to answer admirably  miss pritty discovered that housekeeping was her forte and that she possessed powers of comprehension in regard to financial matters connected with the payment of debts and dividends such as she had all her previous life believed to be unattainable anywhere save in the bank of england or on the stock exchange  mrs baldwin discovered that cooking was her callingthe end for which she had been bornalthough discovered rather late in life  joe made the discovery that gardening and stablework were very easy employments in the berrington household and that his young mistress kept him uncommonly busy amongst the poor of the town encouraging him to attend chiefly to their spiritual wants though by no means neglectful of their physical  in these matters he became also agent and assistant to mr hazlitso that the gardening and stabletending ultimately became a mere sham and it was found necessary to provide a juvenile assistant in the person of the greengrocers eldest boy to fill these responsible posts  the greengrocer himself and his wife discovered that christian influence good example and kind words were so attractive and powerful as to induce them insensibly to begin a process of imitation which ended quite naturally in a flourishing business and a happy home  the small domestic also made a discovery or two  she found that a kitchen with a view of the open sea from its window and a reasonable as well as motherly companion to talk to was on the whole superior to a kitchen with a window opening up a near prospect of bricks and the companionship of black pots and beetles  at first aileen travelled a good deal with her husband in his various business expeditions and thus visited many wild romantic and outotheway parts of our shores but the advent of a juvenile berrington put a sudden stop to that and the flow of juvenile berringtons that followed induced her to remain very much at home  this influx of little strangers induced the building of so many wings to seabeach villa that its body at last became lost in its wings and gave rise to a prophecy that it would one day rise into the air and fly away up to the present time however this remains a portion of unfulfilled prophecy  mr hazlit became rich again not indeed so rich as at first but comfortably rich  nevertheless he determined to remain comparatively poor in order that he might pay his debts to the uttermost farthing his cottage by the sea had comforts in it but nothing that could fairly be styled a luxury except of course a luxurious army of welltrained grandchildren who invaded his premises every morning with terrific noise and kept possession until fairly driven out by force of arms  rooney machowl and david maxwell stuck to their colours manfully  they went into partnership and continued for years struggling together at the bottom of the sea  mrs machowl tended the amiable teddy during the early or chokable period of infancy but when he had safely passed that season his father took him in hand and taught him to dive  he began by tumbling him into a washingtub at odd times in order to accustom him to water  then when a little older he amused himself by occasionally throwing him off the end of the pier and jumping in to save him  afterwards he initiated him into the mysteries of the dress the helmet the lifeline the airpipe etcetera and finally took him down bodily to the bottom of the sea  at last teddy became as good and fearless a diver as his father  he was also the pride of his mother  one afternoona bright glowing afternoonin the autumn of the year mr hazlit sat in a favourite bower in the garden of his cottage with aileen on one side of him and edgar on the other  at the foot of the garden a miscellaneous group of boys girls and babies of all ages romped and rolled upon the turf  in front lay the yellow sands and beyond the glorious glittering sea rolled away to the horizon  mr hazlit had just been commenting on their happy condition as compared with the time when they knew not god  the children having just romped themselves into a state of exhaustion were reasonably quiet and the sun was setting in floods of amber and gold  what a peaceful evening remarked aileen  how different said edgar from that of which it is the anniversary dont you remember that this is the evening of the day in which we attacked the malay pirates long ago  so it is  i had forgotten said mr hazlit  dinner sir said a boy in buttons who bore a marked resemblance to the greengrocers wife  as he spoke a stout gentleman opened the garden gate and walked up the path leading to the bower  at the same moment miss pritty issued from the house and echoed the greengrocers boys announcement  they were all silent as the stout gentleman approached  what can it be cried edgar starting up in excitement  the captain exclaimed mr hazlit  impossible murmured aileen  pirates cried miss pritty turning deadly white and preparing to fall into edgars arms but curiosity prevented her  there could be no mistake  the bright glittering eyes the black beard and moustache the prominent nose the kindly smile the broad chest and shoulders revealed unquestionably the captain of the rajahs gunboat  miraculous cried edgar as he wrung the captains right hand  we were just talking of the great fight of which this is the anniversary  amazing coincidence exclaimed mr hazlit seizing the other hand  not so much of a coincidence as it seems however said the captain with a laugh as he shook hands with the ladies for i made arrangements on purpose to be here on the anniversary day thinking that it might add to the interest of my visit  and to come just at dinnertime too said miss pritty who had recovered  another coincidence observed aileen with an arch look  comecome inhere this way captain cried mr hazlit dragging his friend by the hand  welcomeheartily welcome to sea cottage  the captain submitted to be dragged to be placed by the side of aileen to be overwhelmed with kindness by the elder members of the family and with questions by the younger members who regarded him as a hero of romance quite equal if not superior to jack the giantkiller  but how can we describe what followed  it is impossible  we can only say that the evening was one of a thousand  all the battles were fought over again  the captain came out strong for the benefit of the youngsters and described innumerable scenes of wild adventure in which he had been personally engaged  and to cap it all after dinner when they went out into the garden and were seated in floods of moonlight in the bower two men opened the garden gate and made for the back kitchen with the evident intention of calling on the cook  these were discovered to be rooney machowl and david maxwell  of course they were made to come and shake hands with their old commander the captain and gradually got into a talk and laughed a good deal at the recollection of old times insomuch that the noise they made drew joe baldwin to the scene and as a natural result this led the conversation into divers channelsamong others to life and adventure at the bottom of the sea and there is no saying how long they might have talked there if a cloud had not obliterated the moon and admonished them that the night was at hand  and now good reader with regret we find that our tale has reached its close  we may not have added much to your knowledge but if we have in any degree interested you in the characters we have summoned to our little stage or in the incidents that have been enacted thereon we shall not have wrought in vain for the subject into which you have consented to dive with us is not only an interesting but a dangerous oneinvolving as it does the constant risking of manly lives the wellbeing of large communities the progress of important industries and the salvation of much valuable property to the world at large  the end    note 1  something similar to the job above mentioned was accomplished by g smith a diver on the staff of messrs heinke and davis of london
