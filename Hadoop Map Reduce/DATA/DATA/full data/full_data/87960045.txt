country    chapter i the arrival  is this the station granpa jim inquired a young girl as the train began to slow up  i think so mary louise replied the handsome old gentleman addressed  it does look very promising does it she continued glancing eagerly out of the window  the station no my dear but the station isnt craggs crossing you know it is merely the nearest railway point to our new home  the conductor opened their drawingroom door  the next stop is chargrove colonel he said  thank you  the porter came for their hand baggage and a moment later the long train stopped and the vestibule steps were let down  if you will refer to the timetable of the d r  g railway you will find that the station of chargrove is marked with a character dagger picture character dagger meaning that trains stop there only to let off passengers or when properly signaled to let them on mary louise during the journey had noted this fact with misgivings that were by no means relieved when she stepped from the sumptuous train and found before her merely a shedlike structure open on all sides that served as stationhouse  colonel hathaway and his granddaughter stood silently upon the platform of this shed their luggage beside them and watched their trunks tumbled out of the baggage car ahead and the train start gather speed and go rumbling on its way then the girl looked around her to discover that the primitive station was really the only barren spot in the landscape  for this was no western prairie country but one of the oldest settled and most prosperous sections of a great state that had been one of the original thirteen to be represented by a star on our national banner chargrove might not be much of a railway station as it was only eleven miles from a big city but the country around it was exceedingly beautiful great oaks and maples stood here and there some in groups and some in stately solitude the land was well fenced and carefully cultivated roadssmooth or ruttyled in every direction flocks and herds were abundant half hidden by hills or splendid groves peeped the roofs of comfortable farmhouses that evidenced the general prosperity of the community  uncle eben is late isnt he granpa jim asked the girl as her eyes wandered over the pretty peaceful scene  colonel hathaway consulted his watch  our train was exactly on time he remarked which is more than can be said for old eben but i think mary louise i now see an automobile coming along the road if i am right we have not long to wait  he proved to be right for presently a small touring car came bumping across the tracks and halted at the end of the platform on which they stood it was driven by an old colored man whose hair was snow white but who sprang from his seat with the agility of a boy when mary louise rushed forward with words of greeting  my uncle ebe but its good to see you again she exclaimed taking both his dusky hands in her own and shaking them cordially how is aunt polly and how is your rheumtics  rheumtics done gone foh good may weeze he said his round face all smiles dis shuah am one prosterous country foh health nobuddy sick but de invahlids an dey jus magines deys sick dats all  glad to see you uncle said the colonel a little late ehas usual but perhaps you had a tire change  no seh kunl no tire change i was jus tryin to hurry long dat lazy joe brennan whos done comin foh de trunks niggehs is slow kunl dey aint no argyment bout dat but when a white mans a regleh loaf eh seh dey ain no niggeh kin keep behind him  joe brennan is coming then  dats right kunl hes comin done start befoh daylight in de lumbehwagin but when i done ketch up wi dat joea mile n a half awayhe wont lisn to no reason so i dodged on ahead to tell youuns dat joes on de way  how far is it from here to craggs crossing then inquired mary louise  they call it ten miles replied her grandfather but i imagine its nearer twelve  and this is the nearest railway station  yes the nearest but usually the crossing folks who own motor cars drive to the city to take the trains we alighted here because in our own case it was more convenient and pleasant than running into the city and out again and it will save us time  we be home in halfn hour mos likely added uncle eben as he placed the suit cases and satchels in the car colonel hathaway and mary louise followed and took their seats  is it safe to leave our trunks here asked the girl  undoubtedly replied her grandfather joe brennan will doubtless arrive before long and really there is no person around to steal them  ive an idea i shall like this part of the country said mary louise musingly as they drove away  i am confident you will my dear  is craggs crossing as beautiful as this  i think it more beautiful  and how did you happen to find it granpa jim it seems as isolated as can be  a friend and i were taking a motor trip and lost our way a farmer told us that if we went to craggs crossing we would find a good road to our destination we went there following the mans directions and encountered beastly roads but found a perfect gem of a tiny antiquated town which seems to have been forgotten or overlooked by mapmakers automobile guides and tourists my friend had difficulty in getting me away from the town i was so charmed with it before i left i had discovered by dint of patient inquiry a furnished house to let and you know of course that i promptly secured the place for the summer thats the whole story mary louise  it is interesting she remarked as a result of your famous discovery you sent down uncle eben and aunt polly with our car and a lot of truck you thought we might need and nowwhen all is readyyou and i have come to take possession  rather neatly arranged i think declared the colonel with satisfaction  do you know anything about the history of the place granpa or of the people who live in your tiny forgotten town  nothing whatever i imagine there are folks craggs crossing who have never been a dozen miles away from it since they were born the village boasts a hotelthe funniest little inn you can imaginewhere we had an excellent homecooked meal and there is one store and a blacksmiths shop one church and one schoolhouse these with half a dozen ancient and curiously assorted residences constitute the shy and retiring town of craggs crossing ah think we have found joe brennan  uncle eben drew up beside a rickety wagon drawn by two sorry nags who just now were engaged in cropping grass from the roadside on the seat half reclined a young man who was industriously eating an apple he wore a blue checked shirt open at the throat overalls suspenders and a straw hat that had weathered many seasons of sunshine and rain his feet were encased in heavy boots and his bronzed face betokened an outofdoor life there are a million countrymen in the united states just like joe brennan in outward appearance  joe did not stop munching he merely stared as the automobile stopped beside him  say you joe shouted uncle eben indignatly wha foh yo done settn heah  restn said joe brennan taking another bite from his apple  aint yo gwine git dem trunks home today demanded the old darkey  joe seemed to consider this question carefully before he ventured to commit himself then he looked at colonel hathaway and said  what i want t know boss is whether im hired by the hour er by the day  didnt uncle eben tell you  naw he didnt he jes said t go git the trunks an hed gimme a dollar fer the trip  well that seems to settle the question doesnt it  not quite boss i ben thinkin it over on the way an a dollars too pesky cheap fer this trip sometimes i gits twentyfive cents a hour fer haulin things an this looks to me like a days work  if you made good time said colonel hathaway you might do it easily in four hours  joe shook his head  not me sir he replied i haint got the constitution fer it an them hosses wont trot less i lick em an ef i lick em im guilty o crulty ter animalsincludin myself no boss the jobs too cheap so i guess ill give it up an go home  but youre nearly at the station now protested the colonel  i know but its half a mile futher an the hosses is tired i guess ill go home  oh granpa whispered mary louise itll never do to leave our trunks lying there by the railroad tracks  the colonel eyed joe thoughtfully  if you were hired by the day said he i suppose you would do a days work  id hev to admitted joe thats why i asked ye how about it jes now it looks to me like i aint hired at all the black man said hed gimme a dollar fer the trunks thats all  how much do you charge a day asked the colonel  dollar n a quarters my reglar price an i wont take no less asserted joe  mary louise nearly laughed outright but the colonel frowned and said  joe brennan youve got me at your mercy im going to hire you by the day at a dollar and a quarter and as your time now belongs to me i request you to go at once for those trunks you will find them just beyond the station  the mans face brightened he tossed away the core of his apple and jerked the reins to make the horses hold up their heads  a bargains a bargain boss he remarked cheerfully so ill get them air trunks to yer house if it takes till midnight  very good said the colonel drive on uncle  the old servant started the motor  dats what i calls downright robbery kunl he exclaimed highly incensed didnt i ask de stoahkeepeh what to pay joe brennen foh bringin oveh dem trunks an didnt he say a dolleh is big pay foh suchlike a trip if wes gwine live in dis town where day don unstand city prices an de high cost o livin yit we gotta hol em down an keep em from speckilatin with us or else well spile em fer de time when wes gone away  very true uncle has joe a competitor  uncle eben reflected  ef he has kunl i aint seen it he presently replied but i guess all hes got is dat lumbehwagin  mary louise had enjoyed the controversy immensely and was relieved by the promise of the trunks by midnight for the first time in her life the young orphaned girl was to play housekeeper for her grandfather and surely one of her duties was to see that the baggage was safely deposited in their new home  this unknown home in an unknown town had an intense fascination for her just now her grandfather had been rather reticent in his description of the house he had rented at craggs crossing merely asserting it was a pretty place and ought to make them a comfortable home for the summer nor had the girl questioned him very closely for she loved to discover things and be surprisedwhether pleasurably or not did not greatly interfere with the thrill  the motor took them speedily along a winding way to craggs crossing a toy town that caused mary louise to draw a long breath of delight at first sight the crossing of two country roads had probably resulted at some farback period in farmers building their residences on the four corners so as to be neighborly farm hands or others built little dwellings adjoiningnot many of them thoughand some unambitious or misdirected merchant erected a big frame store and sold groceries dry goods and other necessities of life not only to the community at the crossing but to neighboring farmers then someone started the little hotel mainly to feed the farmers who came to the store to trade or the drummers who visited it to sell goods a church and a schoolhouse naturally followed in course of time and then as if its destiny were fulfilled the sleepy little townten miles from the nearest railwaygradually settled into the comatose state in which colonel hathaway and his granddaughter now found it    chapter ii the kenton place  the tiny town however was not all that belonged to the craggs crossing settlement barely a quarter of a mile away from the village a stream with beautifully wooded banks ran diagonally through the countryside it was called a river by the natives but it was more of a creek halfway between a small rivulet and a brook perhaps but its banks afforded desirable places for summer residences several of which had been built by welltodo families either retired farmers or city people who wished for a cool and quiet place in which to pass the summer months  these residences all having ample grounds and facing the creek on either side were sufficiently scattered to be secluded and it was to one of the most imposing of these that uncle eben guided the automobile he crossed the creek on a primitive but substantial bridge turned to the right and the first driveway led to the house that was to be mary louises temporary home  this is lovely exclaimed the girl as they rolled up a winding drive edged by trees and shrubbery and finally drew up before the entrance of a low and rambling but quite modern house there was aunt polly her round black face all smiles standing on the veranda to greet them and mary louise sprang from the car first to hug the old servantuncle ebens spouseand then to run in to investigate the establishment which seemed much finer than she had dared to imagine it  the main building was of two stories but the wings several of which jutted out in various directions were one story in height somewhat on the bungalow plan there was a goodsized stable in connectionnow used as a garageand down among the oaks toward the river an open pavilion had been built all the open spaces were filled with flowers and ferns in beds and borders and graveled paths led here and there in a very enticing way but the house was now the chief fascination and the other details mary louise gleaned by sundry glances from open windows as she rambled from room to room  at luncheon which aunt polly served as soon as her young mistress could be coaxed from her tour of inspection the girl said  granpa jim who owns this place  a mrs joselyn he replied  a young woman  i believe so it was built by her mother a mrs kenton some fifteen years ago and is still called the kenton place mrs kenton died and her daughter who married a city man named joselyn has used it as a summer home until this year i think mrs joselyn is a woman of considerable means  the furnishings prove that said mary louise theyre not all in the best of taste but they are plentiful and meant to be luxurious why doesnt mrs joselyn occupy her home this summer and why if she is wealthy does she rent the place  those are problems i am unable to solve my dear replied the colonel with a smile when old man cragg who is the nearest approach to a real estate agent in the village told me the place was for rent i inquired the price and contracted to lease it for the summer that satisfied me mary louise but if you wish to inquire into the history and antecedents of the kenton and joselyn families i have no doubt there are plenty of village gossips who can fill your ears full of it  dars one thing i foun out seh remarked uncle eben who always served at table and was not too diffident to join in the conversation of his betters at times dis joselyn man done dispearer run away er dig out somehowan he missus is mos plumb crazy bout it  when did that happen asked mary louise  bout chrismas time de stoahkeepah say nobody dont like him down heah cause he put on a strordnary mount o airs an didnt mix wid de town people nohow de stoahkeepeh tinks marse joselyn am crookedlike an done squandeh a lot o he wifes money befoh he went  perhaps said mary louise musingly that is why the poor woman is glad to rent this house i wish however we had gotten it for a more pleasant reason  dont pay attention to ebens chatter my dear advised her grandfather his authority seems to be the ancient storekeeper whom i saw but once and didnt fancy he looks like an old owl in those big hornrimmed spectacles  dat stoahkeepeh ain no owl kunl asserted uncle eben earnestly he done know all dey is to know roun dese diggins an a lot moah too an a owl is a mighty wise bird kunl ef i do say it an no disrespec so what dat stoahkeepeh say is boun to take notice of  mary louise spent the afternoon in examining her new possession and getting settled forwonder of wondersjoe brennan arrived with the trunks at three oclock some nine hours before the limit of midnight the colonel as he paid the man congratulated him on making such good time  yaas drawled joe i done pretty well considerin but if i hadnt hired out by the day id sure ben a loser ive ben a good ten hours goin fer them trunks fer i started at five this mornin so if id tooken a doller fer the job id only made ten cents a hour my price bein twentyfive but as it is he added with pride i git my reglar rate of a dollar n a quarter a day  proving that it pays to drive a bargain commented the colonel  mary louise unpacked granpa jims trunk first and put his room in applepie order as aunt polly admiringly asserted then she settled her own pretty room held a conference with her servants about the meals and supplies and found it was then time to dress for dinner she was not yet old enough to find household duties a bore so the afternoon had been delightfully spent  early after breakfast the next morning however mary louise started out to explore the grounds of her domain the day was full of sunshine and the air laden with fragrance of flowersa typical may morning granpa jim would of course read for an hour or two and smoke his pipe he drew a chair upon the broad veranda for this very purpose but the girl had the true pioneer spirit of discovery and wanted to know exactly what her five acres contained  the water was doubtless the prime attraction in such a neighborhood mary louise made straight for the river bank and found the shallow streamhere scarce fifty feet in widthrippling along over its stony bed which was a full fifty feet wider than the volume of water then required when the spring freshets were on perhaps the stream reached its banks but in the summer months it was usually subdued as now the banks were four feet or more above the rabble of stones below and close to the bank facing the river on her side mrs kenton had built a pretty pavilion with ample seats and room for half a dozen wicker chairs and a table where one could sit and overlook the water mary louise fervently blessed the old lady for this idea and at once seated herself in the pavilion while she examined at leisure the scene spread out before her  trees hid all the neighboring residences but one just across the river and not far from its bank stood a small weatherbeaten cottage that was in sharp contrast with the rather imposing kenton residence opposite it was not well kept nor even picturesque the grounds were unattractive a woodpile stood in the front yard the steps leading to the little porch had rotted away and had been replaced by a plank rather unsafe unless one climbed it carefully mary louise thought there were timeworn shades to the windows but no curtains a pane of glass had been broken in the dormer window and replaced by a folded newspaper tacked over it beside the porch door stood a washtub on edge a few scraggly looking chickens wandered through the yard if not an abode of poverty it was surely a place where careless indifference to either beauty or the comfort of orderly living prevailed  so much mary louise had observed wondering why mrs kenton had not bought the cottage and torn it down since it was a blot on the surrounding landscape when she saw the door open and a man come out she gave a little gasp of astonishment as her eyes followed this man who slowly took the path to the bridge from whence the road led into the village    chapter iii the folks across the river  her first glance told the girl that here was a distinctly unusual personage his very appearance was quaint enough to excite comment from a stranger it must have been away back in the revolutionary days when men daily wore coats cut in this fashion straight across the waistline in front and with two long tails flapping behind modern dress coats were much like it to be sure but this was of a faded bluebottle color and had brass buttons and a frayed velvet collar on it his trousers were tightfitting below the knee and he wore gaiters and a widebrimmed silk hat that rivaled his own age and had doubtless seen happier days  mary louise couldnt see all these details from her seat in the pavilion across the river but she was near enough to observe the general effect of the old mans antiquated costume and it amazed her  yes he was old nearly as ancient as his apparel the girl decided but although he moved with slow deliberation his gait was not feeble by any means with hands clasped behind him and head slightly bowed as if in meditation he paced the length of the wellworn path reached the bridge and disappeared down the road toward the village  that said a voice beside her is the poohbah of craggs crossing it is old cragg himself  granpa jim was leaning against the outer breast of the pavilion book in hand  you startled me she said but no more than that queer old man did was the village named after him granpa  i suppose so or after his father perhaps for the place seems even older than old cragg he has an office in a bare little room over the store and i rented this place from him whatever his former fortunes may have beenand i imagine the craggs once owned all the land about hereold hezekiah seems reduced to a bare existence  perhaps suggested mary louise he inherited those clothes with the land from his father isnt it an absurd costume granpa jim and in these days of advanced civilization too of course old hezekiah cragg is not strong mentally or he would refuse to make a laughingstock of himself in that way  colonel hathaway stared across the river for a time without answering then he said  i do not think the natives here laugh at him although i remember they called him old swallowtail when i was directed to him as the only resident real estate agent i found the old man quite shrewd in driving a bargain and thoroughly posted on all the affairs of the community however he is not a gossip but inclined to be taciturn there is a fathomless look in his eyes and he is cold and unresponsive country life breeds strange characteristics in some people the whimsical dress and mannerisms of old mr cragg would not be tolerated in the cities while here they seem regarded with unconcern because they have become familiar i was rather pleased with his personality because he is the cragg of craggs crossing how much of the original plot of land he still owns i dont know  why he lives in that hovel said the girl  so it seems although he may have been merely calling there  he fits the place she declared its old and worn and neglected just as he and his clothes are id be sorry indeed to discover that mr cragg lives anywhere else  the colonel his finger between the leaves of the book he held to mark the place where he was reading nodded somewhat absently and started to turn away then he paused to ask anxiously  does this place please you my dear  ever so much granpa jim she replied with enthusiasm leaning from her seat inside the pavilion to press a kiss upon his bare gray head ive a sense of separation from all the world yet it seems good to be hidden away in this forgotten nook perhaps i wouldnt like it for always you know but for a summer it is simply delightful we can restand restand restand be as cozy as can be  again the old gentleman nodded smiling at the girl this time they were good chums these two and what pleased one usually pleased the other  colonel hathaway had endured a sad experience recently and his handsome old face still bore the marks of past mental suffering his only daughter beatrice burrows who was the mother of mary louise had been indirectly responsible for the colonels troubles but her death had lifted the burden her little orphaned girl to whom no blame could be attached was very dear to granpa jims heart indeed she was all he now had to love and care for and he continually planned to promote her happiness and to educate her to become a noble woman fortunately he had saved considerable money from the remains of an immense estate he had once possessed and so was able to do anything for his grandchild that he desired in new york and elsewhere colonel james hathaway had a host of influential friends but he was shy of meeting them since his late unpleasant experiences  mary louise for her part was devotedly attached to her grandfather and preferred his society to that of any other person as the erect form of the old gentleman sauntered away through the trees she looked after him affectionately and wagged her little head with hearty approval  this is just the place for granpa jim she mused theres no one to bother him with questions or sympathy and he can live as quietly as he likes and read those stuffy old booksthe very name classics makes me shudderto his hearts content hell grow stronger and happier here im sure  then she turned anew to revel in the constantly shifting view of river and woodland that extended panoramically from her seat in the pavilion as her eyes fell on the old cottage opposite she was surprised to see a dishpan sail through the open window to fall with a clatter of broken dishes on the hard ground of the yard a couple of dishtowels followed and then a broom and a scrubbingbrushall tossed out in an angry energetic way that scattered them in every direction then on the porch appeared the form of a small girl poorly dressed in a shabby gingham gown who danced up and down for a moment as if mad with rage and then observing the washtub gave it a kick which sent it rolling off the porch to join the other utensils on the ground  next the small girl looked around her as if seeking more inanimate things upon which to vent her anger but finding none she dashed into the cottage and soon reappeared with a muchworn straw hat which she jammed on her flaxen head and then with a determined air walked down the plank and marched up the path toward the bridgethe same direction that old cragg had taken a short time before  mary louise gave a gasp of amazement the scene had been dramatic and exciting while it lasted and it needed no explanation whatever the child had plainly rebelled at enforced drudgery and was goingwhere  mary louise sprang lightly from her seat and ran through the grounds to their entrance when she got to the road she sped along until she came to the bridge reaching one end of it just as the other girl started to cross from the opposite end then she stopped and in a moment the two met  where are you going asked mary louise laying a hand on the childs arm as she attempted to pass her  none o yer business was the curt reply  oh it is indeed said mary louise panting a little from her run i saw you throw things a minute ago so i guess you mean to run away  the girl turned and stared at her  i dont know ye said she never saw ye before whered ye come from anyway  why my grandfather and i have taken the kenton house for the summer so were to be your neighbors of course you know we must get acquainted  ye kin be neighbors to my grandad if ye like but not to me not by a ginger cookie ive done wi this place fer good an all i hev and if ye ever see me here agin my name aint ingua scammel  here lets sit down on the bridge and talk it over proposed mary louise theres plenty of time for you to run away if you think youd better is mr cragg your grandfather then  yes ol swallertail is ol humbug is what i calls him  not to his face do you  i aint so foolish hes got a grip on him like a lobster an when hes mad at me he grips my arm an twists it till i holler when grandads aroun you bet i hev to knuckle down er i gits the worst of it  so hes cruel is he  uhhuh thet is hes cruel when i riles him as i got a habit o doin when things runs smooth grandad aint so bad but i aint goin to stand that slave life no longer i aint ive quit fer good  wherever you go said mary louise gently you will have to work for someone someone perhaps who treats you worse than your grandfather does no one else is obliged to care for you in any way so perhaps youre not making a wise change  i aint eh  perhaps not have you any other relatives to go to  no  or any money  not a red cent  then youll have to hire out as a servant youre not big enough or strong enough to do much so youll search a long time before you find work and that means being hungry and without shelter i know more of the world than you do inguawhat an odd name you haveand i honestly think you are making a mistake to run away from your own grandfather  the girl stared into the water in sullen silence for a time mary louise got a good look at her now and saw that her freckled face might be pretty if it were not so thin and drawn the hands lying on her lap were red and calloused with housework and the childs whole appearance indicated neglect from the brokendown shoes to the soiled and tattered dress she seemed to be reflecting for after a while she gave a short bitter laugh at the recollection of her late exhibition of temper and said  its too late to back down now ive busted the dishes an smashed things genrally  that is bad said mary louise but it might be worse mr cragg can buy more dishes  oh he can can he wheres the money comin from  is he poor  he aint got no money if thats what ye mean thats what he says anyhow says it were a godsend you folks rented that house of him cause itll keep us in corn bread an pork for six months ef were keerful bein keerful means that hell eat the pork an i gits a chunk o corn bread now an then  dear me exclaimed mary louise in a distressed voice dont you get enough to eat  oh i manages it somehow declared ingua with indifference i ben swipin one egg a day fer weeks an weeks grandad says hell trim me good an plenty if he catches me eatin eggs cause all that our chickens lays he takes down to the store an sells but he aint home daytimes to count what eggs is laid an so i watches out an grabs one a day hes mighty cute i tell ye grandad is but he aint cute enough to catch me at the eggswipin  mary louise was greatly shocked really she decided something must be done for this poor child looking at the matter from inguas report the smashing of the dishes might prove serious so she said  come dear lets go together to your house and see if we cant restore the damage  but the girl shook her head  nothn cant mend them busted dishes she said an when grandad sees em hell hev a fit thats why i did it i wanted to show him id had revenge afore i quit him cold he wont be home till night but i gotta be a long way off afore then sos he cant ketch me  give it up suggested mary louise ive come here to live all summer ingua and now that were friends im going to help you to get along more comfortably we will have some splendid times together you and i and you will be a good deal better off than wandering among strangers who dont care for you  the girl turned and looked into mary louises face long and earnestly her eyes wandered to her neatly arranged hair to the white collar at her throat then down to her blue serge dress and her dainty shoes but mostly she looked straight into the eyes of her new friend and found there sincerity and evident good will so she sighed deeply cast a glance at her own bedraggled attire and said  we aint much alike us two but i guess we kin be friends other girls has come here to the rich peoples houses but they all stuck up their noses at me youre the first thats ever give me a word  all girls are not alike you know responded mary louise cheerfully so now lets go to your house and see what damage has been done    chapter iv getting acquainted  the two girls had been sitting on the edge of the bridge but mary louise now rose and took inguas arm in her own leading the reluctant child gently toward the path it wasnt far to the old cottage and when they reached the yard ingua laughed again at the scene of disorder  its amost a pity grandad cant see it she chuckled hed be so crazy hed hev them claws o hisn round my throat in a jiffy  mary louise drew back startled  did he ever do that she asked  only once but that time near ended me it were a long time ago an he was sorry i guess cause he bought me a new dress nex dayan new shoes i aint had any since she added disconsolately so the other day i asked him wasnt it about time he choked me agin  what did he say to that  jes growled at me grandads got a awful temper when hes good an riled but usual hes still as a mouse dont say a word to me fer days together sometimes once i saw him  she suddenly checked herself and cast an uneasy sidelong glance at her companion mary louise was rolling the washtub back to the stoop  the only thing that will bother us ingua she said is those dishes let us try to count the broken ones do you know how many there were  sure i do answered the girl removing the battered dishpan from the heap of crockery two plates two cupsnsaucers a oatmeal dish a bread plate an the pork platter gee what a smash one cups whole an the oatmeal dish the rest is goneup  im going to dig a hole and bury the broken pieces said mary louise have you a spade  theres an ol shovel but it wont do no good to bury of em grandad he counts evry piece evry day he counts evry thing from the grains of salt to the chickens say once i tried to play a trick on him id got so hungry fer meat i jes couldnt stand it so one day i killed a chickn thinkin he wouldnt miss it mymy wha dye spose say ye never told me yer name yit  i am mary louise burrows  highflyin name aint it well i killed thet chickn an cut it up an fried it an et jes a leg an a wing an hid the rest under my bed in the peak up there where ol swallertail never goes all the feathers an the head i buried an i cleaned up the hatchet an the fryinpan sos there wasnt a smitch of anything left to prove id murdered one o them chicks i was feelin kinder chirky when grandad come home cause i thought hed never find out but what did the ol villn do but begin to sniff aroun an he sniffed an he sniffed till he says ingua what chickn did ye kill an why did ye kill it  yer crazy says i whatre ye talkin bout  then he gives me one sour look an marches out to

lyin says he go git it hustle  well i saw his claws beginnin to work an it scared me stiff so i goes to my room an brings down the chickn an he eyes it quietlike fer a long time an then eats some fer his supper the rest he locks up in the cupboard that he allus carries the key to say mary louise i never got another taste o that chickn as long as it lasted ol swallertail et it all himself an took a week to do it  during this recital the broom and mop and scrubbingbrush had been picked up and restored to their proper places then the two girls got out the old shovel and buried the broken dishes in a far corner of the yard among high weeds mary louise tried to get the dents out of the old dishpan but succeeded only indifferently it was so battered through long use however that ingua thought the jams would not be noticed  next said mary louise we must replace the broken pieces i suppose they sell dishes at the village store do they not  thats where these come fromlong ago replied ingua but dishes cost money  ive a little money in my purse enough for that im sure will you go to town with me  ingua stared at her as if bewildered the proposition was wholly beyond her understanding but she replied to her new friends question saying slowly  no i wont go ol swallertaild skin me alive if he caught me in the village  then ill go alone and ill soon be back though i must run over to my own house first to get my purse and my hat let me have one of the cups for a sample ingua  she left the child sitting on the plank runway and looking rather solemn and thoughtful mary louise was somewhat fearful that she might run away in her absence so she hurried home and from there walked into the village a tramp easily accomplished in ten minutes  the store was the biggest building in town but not very big at that it was clapboarded and two stories in height the upper floor being used by sol jerrems the storekeeper as a residence except for two little front rooms which he rented one to miss huckins the dressmaker and milliner who slept and ate in her shop and the other to mr cragg a high platform had been built in front of the store for the convenience of farmer customers in muddy weather and there were steps at either end of the platform for the use of pedestrians  when mary louise entered the store which was cluttered with all sorts of goods not arranged in very orderly manner there were several farmers present but old sol had his eye on her in an instant and shuffled forward to wait upon her  i want some crockery please she said  he looked at the sample cup and led her to a corner of the room where a jumble of dishes crowded a single shelf  i take it youre one o them new folks at the kenton place he remarked  yes said she  thought ther was plenty o dishes in that place continued mr jerrems in a friendly tone but praps ye dont want the black folks t eat offn the same things ye do yerselves  mary louise ignored this speech and selected the dishes she wanted she had measured the broken platter and found another of the same size old sol wouldnt sell a saucer without a cup explaining that the two always went together the cup to hold the stuff an the saucer to drink it outn without argument however the girl purchased what she wanted it was heavy cheap ware of the commonest kind but she dared not substitute anything better for it  then she went to the grocery counter and after considering what ingua might safely hide and eat in secret she bought a tin of cooked corned beef another of chipped beef one of deviled ham and three tins of sardines also she bought a basket to carry her purchases in and although old sol constantly sought to pump her concerning her past life present history and future prospects she managed to evade successfully his thirst for information no doubt the fellow was a great gossip as old eben had declared but mary louise knew better than to cater to this dangerous talent  the proprietor accompanied her to the door and she drew back hesitating as she observed an old man in a bottleblue swallowtail coat pace in deliberate dignified manner along the opposite side of the street  who is that she asked as an excuse for not going out until inguas grandfather had passed from sight  that why thats ol swallertail otherwise hezekiah cragg one o our most interestin citizens replied sol glad of the chance to talk  does he own craggs crossing asked mary louise  mercy no he owned a lot of it once though but that were afore my time sold it out an squandered the money i guess for he lives like a rat in a hole mebbe though hes got some hid away thats what some o the folks here whispersfolks thats likely to know but if thats a fact hes got a streak o miser in him for he dont spend moren the law allows  he may have lost the money in speculations suggested the girl  say yeve hit the nail square on the head he exclaimed admiringly thems my own opinions to a t ive told the boys so a hunderd times but they cant git it wasnt ol swallertail handinglove wi that slick mister joselyn who they say has run away an left his pore wife in the lurch thats how you got a chance to rent the kenton house joselyn were slick as butter an highstrung wouldnt hobnob with any o us but ol swallertail an thats why i think cragg was investin money with him joselyn he came down here three year ago havin married annabel kenton in the winter an the way he swelled aroun were a caution to snakes but the pore devil run his rope an lit out where he skipped to i dunno nobuddy seems to know not even his wife but they say she didnt hev enough money left to count an by the glum looks o ol swallertail im guessin he got nipped too  how long ago was that asked mary louise  some time bout last christmas they say anyhow thats when his wife missed him an set up a hunt that didnt do no good she came down here with red eyes an tramped round in the deep snow askin questions but sakes ned joselyn wouldnt a come to an outotheway place like this we didnt never suit his style ye see so poor ann kenton whose misfortun made her mrs ned joselyncried an wailed fer a day er two an then crep back to the city like a whipped dog funny how womenll care fer a wuthless neerdowell chap that happens to be goodlookin aint it  mary louise nodded rather absently however distorted the story might be it was curious what had become of mr joselyn but her thoughts reverted to another theme and she asked  hasnt mr cragg a granddaughter  oh yeve seen little ingua scammel hev ye or mebbe just heard tell of her shes the cussedest little coal o fire in seven counties keeps ol swallertail guessin all the time they say jes like her mom nan cragg did afore her gosh what a woman her mom were she didnt stay round here much but whenever she run out o cash an didnt hev a square meal comin to her she camped on ol swallertail an made him board her las time she come she left her youngun thats ingua ye knowan the kids been here ever since sort of a thorn in the side of ol hezekiah we folks think though he dont never complain she aint moren twelve or thirteen year old thet ingua but she keeps house fer her grandadwhat they is to keep which aint much i wont let the kid round my store nohow cause she swipes evrything from dried apples to peanuts thet she kin lay her hands on  perhaps she is hungry said mary louise defending her new friend  like enough but i aint feedin starvin kids taint my business if ol swallertail dont feed her enough thets his lookout ive warned him if she sets foot in this store ill charge him ten cents jes fer safety so he keeps her out hes slick ol swallertail is an silentlike an secret in all he does an says but hes got to git up earlier in the mornin to git the best o sol jerrems he er his kid either one  as mr cragg had now vanished from sight up the street mary louise ventured out and after a brisk walk deposited her basket on the stoop of the cragg cottage where ingua still sat swinging her feet pensively as if she had not stirred since mary louise had left her    chapter v mary louise becomes a peacemaker  here are the dishes exactly like the broken ones reported mary louise in a jubilant tone as she set down her heavy basket let us go in and wash them ingua and put them away where they belong  the child followed her into the house all her former pentup energy seemed to have evaporated she moved in a dull sort of way that betokened grim resignation  ive ben plannin fer months to make a run fer it she remarked as she washed the new dishes and mary louise wiped them dry an just when id mustered up courage to do the trick along comes you an queered the whole game  youll thank me for that some day ingua arent you glad even now that you have a home and shelter  i aint tickled to death about it home with a scornful glance around the room barren of all comforts a graveyards a more cheerful place to my notion  we must try to make it pleasanter dear im going to get acquainted with mr cragg and coax him to brighten things up some and buy you some new clothes and take better care of you  ingua fell back on a stool fairly choking twixt amazement and derision  you coax ol swallertail make him spend money on me say if ye wasnt a stranger here mary louise id jes laugh but bein as how yer a poor innercent ill only say ther aint no power on earth kin coax grandad to do anything better than to scowl an box my ears you dont know him but i do  meantime said mary louise refusing to argue the point here are some little things for you to hide away and to eat whenever you please and she took from the basket the canned goods she had bought and set them in an enticing row upon the table  ingua stared at the groceries and then stared at mary louise her wan face flushed and then grew hard  ye bought them fer me she asked  yes so you wont have to steal eggs to satisfy your natural hunger  well ye kin take the truck away agin an youd better go with it said the girl indignantly we may be poor but we aint no beggars an we dont take charity from nobody  but your grandfather  well pay our own bills an buy our own fodder the craggs is jus as good as yer folks an im a cragg to the backbone she cried her eyes glinting angrily if we want to starve its none o yer business ner nobody elses and springing up she seized the tins one by one and sent them flying through the window as she had sent the dishpan and dishes earlier in the morning now then foller yer charity an make yerself scarce and she stamped her foot defiantly at mary louise who was dumb with astonishment  it was hard to understand this queer girl she had made no objection to replacing the broken dishes yet a present of food aroused her to violent anger her temper was positively something terrible in so small a person and remembering her story of how old swallowtail had clenched his talonlike fingers and twisted inguas arm till she screamed with pain mary louise could well believe the statement that the child was a cragg to the backbone  but mary louise although only a few years older than ingua had had a good deal more experience and was moreover a born diplomat astonished though she was she quickly comprehended the peculiar pride exhibited in a refusal to accept food from a stranger and knew she must soothe the girls outraged spirit of independence if they were to remain friends  i guess ill have to beg your pardon ingua she said quietly i was grieved that you are so often hungry while i have so much more than i need and the money which i spent was all my own to do what i liked with if i were in your place and you in mine and we were good chums as i know were going to be id be glad to have you help me in any little way you could true friends ingua share and share alike and dont let any foolish pride come between them  she spoke earnestly with a ring of sincerity in her voice that impressed the other girl inguas anger had melted as quickly as it had roused and with sudden impulsiveness she seized mary louises hands in her own and began to cry  im as wicked as they make em she wailed i know i am but i cant help it mary louise its borned in me i want to be friends with ye but i wont take your charity if i starve not now anyhow here ill go git the stuff an put it back in yer basket an then ye kin lug it home an do what ye please with it  they picked up the cans together ingua growing more calm and cheerful each moment she even laughed at mary louises disappointed expression and said  i dont always hev tantrums this is my bad day but the devilsll work out o me by termorrer and ill be sweet as sugar im sorry but its the cragg blood that sets me crazy at times  wont you run over and see me asked mary louise preparing to go home  when  this afternoon  ingua shook her head  i dastnt she said i gotta hold myself in the rest o the day sos i wont fight with ol swallertail when he comes home anyhow i aint fit t show up aroun yer swell place that black coon o yersd turn me out if he saw me comin thinkin i was a tramp  mary louise had a bright idea  im going to have tea tomorrow afternoon in that summerhouse across the creek said she i will be all alone and if you will come over and join me well have a nice visit together will you ingua  i guess so was the careless answer when yere ready jes wave yer hankercher an if the devils aint squeezin my gizzard like they is today ill be there in a jiffy    chapter vi afternoon tea  mary louise who possessed a strong sense of humor that evening at dinner told granpa jim of her encounter with old mr craggs granddaughter and related their interview in so whimsical a manner that colonel hathaway laughed aloud more than once but he also looked serious at times and when the recital was ended he gravely considered the situation and said  i believe my dear you have discovered a mine of human interest here that will keep you occupied all summer it was most fortunate for the poor child that you interpreted her intent to run away from home and foiled it so cleverly from the little girls report that grim and dignified grandsire of hers has another and less admirable side to his character and unless she grossly exaggerates has a temper so violent that he may do her a mischief some day  im afraid of that too declared mary louise especially as the child is so provoking yet im sure ingua has a sweeter side to her nature if it can be developed and perhaps old cragg has too do you think granpa jim it would be advisable for me to plead with him to treat his orphaned grandchild more considerately  not at present my dear ill make some inquiries concerning cragg and when we know more about him we can better judge how best to help ingua are you sure that is her name  yes isnt it an odd name  somewhere said the colonel musingly i have heard it before but just now i cannot recollect where it seems to me however that it was a mans name do you think the childs mother is dead  i gathered from what ingua and the storekeeper said that she has simply disappeared  an erratic sort of creature from the vague reports you have heard commented granpa jim but whatever her antecedents may have been there is no reason why ingua may not be rescued from her dreadful environments and be made to become a quite proper young lady if not a model one but that can only result from changing the existing character of her environment rather than taking her out of them  that will be a big task granpa jim and it may prove beyond me but ill do the best i can  he smiled  these little attempts to help our fellows said the colonel not only afford us pleasure but render us stronger and braver in facing our own tribulations which none however securely placed seem able to evade  mary louise gave him a quick sympathetic glance he had surely been brave and strong during his own period of tribulation and the girl felt she could rely on his aid in whatever sensible philanthropy she might undertake she was glad indeed to have discovered poor ingua for she was too active and of too nervous a temperament to be content simply to rest all summer rest was good for granpa jim just now but rest pure and simple with no compensating interest would soon drive mary louise frantic  she conferred with aunt polly the next day and told the faithful black servant something of her plans so when the old cook lugged a huge basket to the pavilion for her in the afternoon and set a small table with snowy linen and bright silver with an alcohol arrangement for making tea she said with an air of mystery  don yo go open dat bastik may weeze till de time comes fer eatin i jes wants to sprise yoyo an dat lil pooah girl what gits hungry so much  so when aunt polly had gone back to the house mary louise arranged her table and then stood up and waved a handkerchief to signal that all was ready  soon ingua appeared in her doorway hesitated a moment and then ran down the plank and advanced to the river bank instead of following the path to the bridge almost opposite the pavilion mary louise noticed that several stones protruded from the surface of the water they were not in a line but placed irregularly however ingua knew their lie perfectly and was able to step from one to another until she had quickly passed the water then she ran up the dry bed of the river to the bank where steps led to the top  why this is fine exclaimed mary louise meeting her little friend at the steps id no idea one could cross the river in that way  oh weve known bout that always was the reply ned joselyn used to come to our house ever so many times by the river stones to talk with ol swallertail an grandad used to come over here to this same summerhouse an talk with joselyn  mary louise noticed that the old gingham dress had been washed ironed and mendedall in a clumsy manner inguas blond hair had also been trained in awkward imitation of the way mary louise dressed her own brown locks the child observing her critical gaze exclaimed with a laugh  yes ive slicked up some no onell see me but you will they she added suspiciously  no indeed were to be all alone how do you feel today ingua  the devils are gone grandad didnt spicion anything las night an never said a word he had one o his dreamy fits an writ letters till long after i went to bed this mornin he said as ol sol jerrems has raised the price o flour two cents so ill hev to be keerful but that was all no rumpus ner anything  thats nice said mary louise leading her arm in arm to the pavilion arent you glad you didnt run away  ingua did not reply her eyes big and round were taking in every detail of the table then they wandered to the big basket and mary louise smiled and said  the table is set as you see but i dont know what were to have to eat i asked aunt polly to put something in the basket as i was going to have company and im certain therell be enough for two whatever its like you see this is a sort of surprise party for we wont know what weve got until we unpack the basket  ingua nodded much interested  ye said tea she remarked an i haint tasted tea sence marm left us but i spose somethin goes with tea  always tea means a lunch you know and im very hungry because i didnt eat much luncheon at noon i hope you are hungry too ingua she added opening the basket and beginning to place its contents upon the table  ingua may have considered a reply unnecessary for she made none her eyes were growing bigger every moment for here were dainty sandwiches cakes jelly a pot of marmalade an assortment of cold meats olives saratoga chips and last of all a chicken pie still warm from the ovenone of those chicken pies that aunt polly could make as no one else ever made them  even mary louise was surprised at the array of eatables it was a veritable feast but without comment she made the tea the water being already boiling and seating ingua opposite her at the table she served the child as liberally as she dared bearing in mind her sensitiveness to charity  but ingua considered this a party where as a guest she was entitled to all the good things and she ate with a ravenous haste that was pitiful trying the while not to show how hungry she was or how good everything tasted to her  mary louise didnt burden her with conversation during the meal which she prolonged until the child positively could eat no more then she drew their chairs to a place where they had the best view of the river and woodlandwith the old cragg cottage marring the foregroundand said  now we will have a good long talk together  ingua sighed deeply  dont we hev to do the dishes she asked  no aunt polly will come for them by and by all we have to do now is to enjoy your visit which i hope you will repeat many times while i am living here  again the child sighed contentedly  i wish ye was goin ter stay always she remarked you folks is a sight nicern that joselyn tribe they kep us stirred up a good deal till ned  she stopped abruptly  what were the joselyns like inquired mary louise in a casual tone that was meant to mask her curiosity  well thats hard to say answered ingua thoughtfully ol mis kenton were a good lady an evrybody liked her but after she died ann kenton come down here with a new husban who were ned joselyn an then things began to happen ned was slick as a banbox an wouldnt hobnob with nobody at first but one day he got acquainted with ol swallertail an they made up somethin wonderful i guess other folks didnt know bout their bein so close fer they was sly bout it genrally theyd meet in this summerhouse or theyd meet at our house crossin the river on the steppinstones but when ned came over to us grandad allus sent me away an said hed skin me if i listened but one dayno i musnt tell that she said checking herself quickly as a hard look came over her face  why not softly asked mary louise  cause if i do ill git killed thats why answered the child in a tone of conviction  something in her manner startled her hearer  who would kill you ingua she asked  grandad would  oh im sure he wouldnt do that whatever you said  ye dont know grandad mary louise hed as lief kill me as look at me if i give him cause to  and he has asked you not to talk about mr joselyn  he tol me ter keep my mouth shet or hed murder me an stick my body in a hole in the yard an hed do it in a minute ye kin bank on that  then said mary louise looking troubled i advise you not to say anything he has forbidden you to and if anything ever happens to you while im here i shall tell granpa jim to have mr cragg arrested and put in prison  will ye will yehonest asked the girl eagerly say thatll help a lot if im killed ill know ill be revenged  so tragic was her manner that mary louise could have laughed outright had she not felt there was a really serious foundation for inguas fears there was something about the silent coldfeatured mysterious old man that led her to believe he might be guilty of any crime but after all she reflected she knew mr craggs character only from inguas description of it and the child feared and hated him  what does your grandfather do in his office all day she inquired after a long pause  writes letters an reads the ones he gits i guess he dont let me go to his office  does he get many letters then  heaps an heaps of em you ask jim bennett who brings the mail bag over from the station evry day  is jim bennett the postman  his wife is jim lugs the mail tween the station an his own house thats the little white house next the churchwhere his wife whos deefndumb runs the postoffice i know jim he says theres bout six letters a year for the farmers round here an bout one a week for sol jerremswhich is mostly billsan all the rest belongs to ol swallertail  mary louise was puzzled  has he a business then she asked  not as anybody knows of  but why does he receive and answer so many letters  yell hev to guess ive guessed myself but whats the use if he was as stingy of postage stamps as he is of pork an oatmeal he wouldnt send a letter a year  mary louise scented a mystery mysteries are delightful things to discover and fascinating to solve but who would have thought this quiet retired village harbored a mystery  does your grandfather ever go away from here does he travel much was her next question  he aint never been out of craggs crossing sence ive knowed him  really said mary louise it is perplexing  ingua nodded she was feeling quite happy after her lunch and already counted mary louise a warm friend she had never had a friend before yet here was a girl of nearly her own age who was interested in her and her history and sweetly sympathetic concerning her woes and worries to such a friend ingua might confide anything almost and while she was not fully aware of that fact just now she said impulsively  without tellin whatd cost me my life or lettin anybody know whats become of ned joselyn ill say they was moneylots o moneypassed atween him an ol swallertail sometimes the heap went to one an sometimes to the other i seen it with my own eyes when grandad didnt know i was spyin but it didnt stick to either one for ned was she stopped short then continued more slowly when ned dispeared hed spent all his own an his wifes money an ol swallertail aint got enough t live decent  are you sure of that ingua  no i aint sure o nothn but he dont spend no money does he  for stamps mary louise reminded her  then the child grew silent and thoughtful again mary louise watching the changing expressions on her face was convinced she knew more of the mystery than she dared confide to her new friend there was no use trying to force her confidence however in her childish way she was both shrewd and stubborn and any such attempt would be doomed to failure but after quite a period of silence mary louise asked gently  did you like mr joselyn ingua  sometimes only when another selfinterruption she seemed often on the point of saying something her better judgment warned her not to sometimes ned were mighty good to me sometimes he brought me candy when things was goin good with him once mary louise he kissed me an never wiped off his mouth afterwards yes i liked ned ceptin when another break i thought ned was a pretty decent gink  where did you learn all your slang dear  whats slang  calling a man a gink and words like that oh marm was full o them words she replied with an air of pride they seem to suit things better than common words dont you think so mary louise  sometimes with an indulgent smile but ladies do not use them ingua because they soil the purity of our language  well said the girl itll be a long time yit afore im a lady so i guess ill talk like marm did marm werent a real lady to my mind though she claimed shed show anybody that said she wasnt real ladies dont leave ther kids in the clutches of ol swallertails  mary louise did not think it wise to criticize the unknown mrs scammel or to allow the womans small daughter to do so so she changed the subject to more pleasant and interesting topics and the afternoon wore speedily away  finally ingua jumped up and said  i gotta go if grandad dont find supper ready therell be another rumpus an ive been so happy today that i want to keep things pleasantlike  wont you take the rest of these cakes with you urged mary louise  nope ill eat one more on my way home but i aint one o them tramps that wants food pushed at em in a bundle  we aint got much to home but what we gots ours  a queer sort of mistaken pride mary louise reflected as she watched the girl spring lightly over the steppingstones and run up the opposite bank evidently ingua considered old mr cragg her natural guardian and would accept nothing from others that he failed to provide her with yet to judge from her speech she detested her grandfather and regarded him with unspeakable aversion    chapter vii mary louise calls for help  all the queer hints dropped by the girl that afternoon concerning the relations between mr joselyn and mr cragg were confided by mary louise to her granpa jim that evening while the old colonel listened with grave interest  im sure there is some mystery here declared mary louise and maybe we are going to discover some dreadful crime  and on the contrary returned colonel hathaway the two men may have been interested together in some business venture that resulted disastrously and led mr joselyn to run away to escape his wifes reproaches i consider that a more logical solution of your mystery my dear  in that case was her quick reply why is mr cragg still writing scores of letters and getting bags full of replies i dont believe that business dealwhatever it wasis ended by any means i think that ned joselyn and old swallowtail are still carrying it on one in hiding and the other hereand to be here is to be in hiding also and it isnt an honest business granpa jim or they wouldnt be so secret about it  the colonel regarded his young granddaughter with surprise  you seem quite logical in your reasoning my dear he confessed and should your conjectures prove correct these men are using the mails for illegal purposes for which crime the law imposes a severe penalty but consider mary louise is it our duty to trail criminals and through our investigations bring them to punishment  mary louise took time to consider this question as she had been advised to do when she replied she had settled the matter firmly in her mind  we are part of the government granpa jim she asserted if we believe the government is being wrongedwhich means the whole people is being wrongedi think we ought to uphold the law and bring the wrongdoer to justice  allowing that said her grandfather let us next consider what grounds you have for your belief that wrong is being committed are they not confined to mere suspicions suspicions aroused by the chatter of a wild ungoverned child often the amateur detective gets into trouble through accusing the innocent lawabiding citizens should not attempt to uncover all the wrongs that exist or to right them the united states government employs special officers for such duties  mary louise was a bit nettled failing to find at the moment any argument to refute this statement she was still convinced however that the mystery was of grave importance and she believed it would be intensely exciting to try to solve it granpa jim was not acquainted with ingua scammel and had not listened to the girls unconscious exposures so naturally he couldnt feel just as mary louise did about this matter she tried to read as her grandfather considering the conversation closed was now doing they sat together by the lamplight in the cozy sitting room but her thoughts constantly reverted to old swallowtail and to ingua at length she laid down her book and said  granpa would you mind if i invited josie ogorman to come here and make me a visit  he gave her a curious look which soon melted into an amused smile  not at all my dear i like josie but i can see by your desire to introduce a female detective on the scene that you cannot abandon your suspicion of mr cragg  i want to save ingua if i can replied the girl earnestly the poor little thing cant go on leading such a life without its ruining all her future even if her grandfathers brutal threats are mere bluff and josie isnt a female detective as yet she is only training to be one because her father has won fame in that profession  josie ogorman said the colonel meditatively is a wonderfully clever girl i believe she is better even now than a score of average male sleuths perhaps it will be a desirable thing for her to come here for she will be shrewd enough to decide in a short time whether or not your suspicions are justified in the latter case you will be relieved of your worries will you abide by josies decision  will you granpa jim  i have considerable confidence in the girls judgment  then i will write to her at once  she went to her desk and wrote the following note  dear josie we are at the droppingoffplace of the world a stagnant little village of a dozen houses set in an oasis that is surrounded by the desert of civilization and here where life scarcely throbs ive scented a mystery that has powerfully impressed me and surely needs untangling it will be good practice for you josie and so i want you to pack up at once and come to us on a good long visit were delightfully situated and even if the mystery dissolves into thin air under the sunshine of your eyes i know you will enjoy the change and our dreamy happy existence in the wilds of nowhere granpa jim wants you too as he thinks your coming will do me good and his judgment is never at fault so drop me a postal to say when you will arrive and i will meet you at chargrove station with our car affectionately your friend mary louise burrows  granpa jim read this note and approved it so next morning mary louise walked to the village and deposited it in the postoffice which located in the front room of jim bennetts little residence and was delightfully primitive jim was jus makin up the mail bag he said so her letter was in time to catch the daily train and would be in washington where josie lived in the quickest possible time  josie ogorman was about the same age as mary louise and she was the only child of john ogorman famed as one of the cleverest detectives in the secret service josie was supposed to have inherited some of her fathers talent at least her fond parent imagined so after carefully training the child almost from babyhood ogorman had tested josies ability on just one occasion when she had amply justified her fathers faith in her this test had thrown the girl into association with mary louise and with colonel hathaway both of whom greatly admired her cleverness her clear head and shrewd judgment mary louise especially had developed a friendship for the embryo girl detective and had longed to know her more intimately so she congratulated herself on the happy thought of inviting josie to craggs crossing and was delighted that the vague mystery surrounding the cragg family offered an adequate excuse to urge the girl to come to her there seemed nothing in the way of such a visit for officer ogorman however pleased he might be at his daughters success in her first detective case declared josie yet too young to enter active service and insisted that she acquire further age and experience before he would allow her to enter her chosen profession in earnest one swallow he said doesnt make a summer and the next bird you fly might prove a buzzard my dear take your time let your wits mature and youll be the better for it in the end  so mary louise waited impatiently for josies reply meantime seeing as much of ingua as she could and trying to cement the growing friendship between them ingua responded eagerly to her advances and as old mr cragg was away from home the greater part of the day there was much crossing of the steppingstones by both girls and more than one afternoon tea in the pavilion  do you know said ingua one day in confidential mood i havent had the devils since that time i started to run away and you stopped me praps its because im not as hungry as i used to be but anyhow im glad i stayed grandads been good too though hes got the wakes agin  what are the wakes asked mary louise  cant sleep nights goes t bed on time ye know but gits up agin an dresses himself an walks  in the house  no walks out o doors sometimes hell come in at jes daylight sometimes not till breakfas is ready  and doesnt that make him cross ingua  not a bit it seems to chirk him up yistday mornin when he come in he was feelin so chipper he give me a cent an told me to buy somethin useful i guess thats the first cent he ever give me ive took money o hisn but he never give me none afore  oh ingua i hope you havent stolen money  nope jes took it it aint easy cause he knows evry cent hes got an it aint often he leaves it where i kin git it praps he knows its me but when i lie out of it he cant do nothn but growl an growlin dont hurt any  mary louise was greatly distressed this reckless disregard of property rights was of course the direct result of the childs environment but must be corrected ingua resented direct chiding and it was necessary to point out to her the wickedness of stealing in the gentlest possible manner  how much money have you taken from your grandfather she asked  oh not much a nickel now an then he wouldnt stan for losin any more ye see praps altogether ive swiped twentyfive cents but once ned joselyn give me a dollar an ol swallertail knowed it an made me give it to him to save for me that were the last i ever saw o that dollar mary louise so i aint even with grandad yet  do you think remarked mary louise there is ever any excuse for stealing  the girl stared at her coloring slightly  do ye mean grandad er me  i mean you he didnt steal your dollar dear he merely took it so you wouldnt spend it foolishly  an i merely took them nickels sos i could spend em foolish theres no fun in spendin money seems to me unless you squander it reckless thats what i done with them nickels candy an chewin gum tastes better when you know its swiped  mary louise sighed it was so hard to show little ingua the error of her ways  as fer stealinout an out stealin continued the girl with a proud toss of her head we craggs aint never took nothn that dont belong to us from nobody what a cragg takes from a cragg is a craggs business an when we takes somethn from somebody else ill ask ye to tell me bout it  where are you going ingua  home  youre not offended i hope  no but i got work to do i aint done my breakfas dishes yet  mary louise musingly watched the girl cross the river on the opposite bank she turned to wave her hand and then ran into the cottage inguas code of honor was a peculiar one her pride in the craggs seemed unaccountable considering she and her grandfather were the only two of the family in existenceexcept that wandering mother of hers  but the recent conversation had uncovered a new phase of the mystery old swallowtail was nervous over something he could not sleep at night but roamed the roads while others with clear consciences slumbered there must be some powerful reason to account for the old mans deserting his bed in this manner what could it be  when she walked over to the postoffice the girl found the longlookedfor letter from josie ogorman it said  dear mary louise how good you are i positively need a change of scene and a rest so im coming tomorrowby the train to chargrove the mystery you hint at will help me to rest dad doesnt want me to grow rusty and he has some odd theories id like to work out i havent an idea what your mystery is of course but if it enables me to test any one of the ogorman theories a theory is merely a steppingstone to positive information i shall bless you forever and that reminds me im coming as a sewing girl to help you fix over some summer gowns youre anxious to give me the work because i need it but as were rather chummy im half servant and half companion i hate sewing and make the longest stitches you ever saw moreover im josie jessup im never an ogorman while im working on a mystery it wouldnt do at all explain this to dear old granpa jim  between the receipt of this script and tomorrows train jot down in regular order everything you know concerning the aforesaid mystery make it brief no speculations or suspicions just facts then i wont waste any time getting busy  can you hear the rumble of my train while youre reading this im on my way  josie  good murmured mary louise as she folded the letter i feel better already whatever the mystery of old swallowtail may be josie is sure to solve it    chapter viii the redheaded girl  sol jerrems the storekeeper coming in from the back room where he had been drawing molasses for farmer higgins found perched on top the sugarbarrel a chunky redhaired frecklefaced young girl whom he had never seen before she seemed perfectly at home in his store and sat with her knees drawn up to her chin and her arms encircling her legs eyeing soberly the two or three farmers who had come to the crossing to trade  if the head o thet barl busts in youll be a fine mess remarked sol  the girl nodded but did not move from her position sol waited on his customers at times eyeing the strange girl curiously when the farmers had gone with their purchases he approached the barrel and examined his visitor with speculative care  want anything  spool o red cotton number thirty  aint got no red  greenll do  aint got green only black an white  all right  want black or white  no  sol leaned against the counter he wasnt busy the girl seemed in no hurry it was a good time to gossip and find out all about the strange creature perched on his sugarbarrel  whered ye come from he inquired  city tossing her head toward the north  what for  to do sewing for the hathaways folks mary louise you know  sol pricked up his ears the hathaways were newcomers about whom little was known he wanted to know more and here was a girl who could give him inside information  knowed the hathaways in the city  kind o sewed on mary louises spring dresses how long you been here  me why i come here moren twenty years ago what does the colonel do in the city  never asked him why do they call this place craggs crossing  i didnt name it spose cause ol cragg used to own all the land an the roads crossed in the middle o his farm  what cragg was that  eh why father to ol swallertail ever seen ol swallertail  no  wal hes a sight fer sore eyes first time anybody sees him they either laughs er chokes the movinpictur folks would go crazy over him ever seen a movinpictur  yes  i did too when i was in the city las year ol swallertail minds me of em goes round dressed up like george washington when he crossed the delaware  crazy  that way yes other ways not a bit pretty foxy gent is ol swallertail  why  sol hesitated reflecting these questions were natural in a stranger but to explain old hezekiah craggs character was not a particularly easy task  in the fust place he drives a hard bargain dont spend money but allus has it keeps busy but keeps his business to himself  what is his business  didnt i say he kep it to himself  but he owns all the land around here  not now he owns jest a halfacre so fars anybody knows with a little ol hut on it thet a respectble pig wouldnt live in its jes acrost the river from the place where youre workin  then what has become of his land  its stayed jes where it allus was i guess with a chuckle at his own wit but ol swallertail sold it long ago ol nick cragg his father afore him sold a lot of it they say and when he died he left half his ready money an all his land to hezekiahthets ol swallertailan the other half o his money to his second son peter  where is peter asked the girl quickly  went back to ireland years ago and nevers ben heard of since the craggs was irish afore they got to be americans but it seems pete hankered fer th ol sod an quit this country cold  so the craggs are irish eh mused the girl in a casual tone and then she yawned as if not greatly interested but sol was interested so long as he was encouraged to talk  i ben told by some o the ol settlers he went on thet ol nick cragg were born in ireland was a policeman in new yorkwhere he made his first moneyan then come here an bought land an settled down they aint much difference tween a policeman an a farmer i guess if the storys true it proves ol swallertail has irish blood in him yit though fer that matter hes lived here long enough to be jes american like the rest of us after he come inter the property he graduallike sold off all the land piece by piece till he aint got nothn left but thet halfacre sold most of it afore i come here an i ben at the crossing moren twenty year  if the land brought a fair price old swallowtail ought to be rich remarked the girl  then he aint what he orter be folks says he specilated years ago an got stung i know him pretty wellas well as anybody knows him an my opinion is he aint got moren enough to bury him decent  thought you said he drives a hard bargain  young woman said sol earnestly the man dont live as kin make money specilatin the games agin him fust an last an the more brains hes got the harder hell git stung  but i thought you said mr cragg has a business  an i said nobody knows what it is when ned joselyn used to come here the two was thick an ned were a specilater through an through some thinks it was him as got craggs wad an some says he lost it all an his wifes money too anyhow joselyn lit out fer good an when he were gone ann kenton cried like a baby an ol swallertail s been dumb as a clam ever since  what makes you think cragg has a business persisted the girl  he keeps an office over the store here an he has a sign on the door thet says real estate but he aint got no real estate so that aint why he shuts himself in the office day after dayan even sundays hes got some other business evry night afore he goes home he takes a bunch o letters to mrs bennetts postoffice an evry mornin he goes there an gits another bunch o letters thats come to him in the mail if that dont mean some sort o business i dont know whatn thunder it does mean  nor i said the girl yawning again what about ned joselyn was he nice  dressed like a dandy looked like a fool acted like the empror o rooshy an pleased evrybody by runnin away that is evrybody but his wife an ol swallertail  i see who else lives over your store  i live there myself me an my fambly in the back part one o the front rooms i rents to ol swallertail an he pays the rent reglar the other front room miss huckins the dressmaker lives in  oh im a dressmaker too guess ill go up and see her is she in  when shes out she leaves the key with me an the key aint here say girl whats yer name  josie  josie what  jessup pa was a drayman ever hear of him  no but about the hathaways what has  and youve got no red thread or green  only black an white does the colonel  cant use black or white said the girl deliberately getting off the barrel guess ill go up and ask miss huckins if she has any red  out she walked and old sol rubbed his wrinkled forehead with a bewildered look and muttered  drat the gal shes pumped me dry an didnt tell me a word about them hathaway folks she worsen ol eben the nigger help seems like nobody wants t talk about the hathaways an that means theres somethin queer about em but this redheaded sewingirl is a perfec innercent an ill git her talkin yet if she stays here long  meantime josie mounted the stairs which were boarded in at one end of the building being built on the outside to economize space and entered the narrow upper hallway a chatter of childrens voices in the rear proclaimed that portion to be the quarters of the jerrems family toward the front was a door on which in dim letters was the legend h cragg real estate  here the girl paused to listen no sound came from the interior of h craggs apartment farther along she found a similar door on which was a card reading miss huckins dressmaker and milliner listening again she heard the sound of a flatiron thumping an ironing board  she knocked and the door was opened by a little middleaged woman who held a hot flatiron in one hand she was thin she was brighteyed her hair was elaborately dressed with little ringlets across the forehead and around the ears so josie at once decided it was a wig  seeing a stranger before her miss huckins looked her over carefully from head to foot while josie smiled a vacuous inconsequent smile and said in a perfunctory way  good morning  come in returned miss huckins with affable civility i dont think i know you  im josie jessup from the city im in your line miss huckinsin a way that is ive come here to do some sewing for mary louise burrows who is the granddaughter of colonel hathaway who has rented the kenton place nice weather isnt it  miss huckins was not enthusiastic her face fell she had encouraged sundry hopes that the rich little girl would employ her to do whatever sewing she might need so she resumed the pressing of a new dress that was spread over her ironingboard and said rather shortly  anything i can do for you  i want to use some red thread and the storekeeper doesnt keep it in stock queer old man that storekeeper isnt he  i dont call him queer hes honest as the day is long and makes a good landlord country stores dont usually keep red thread for it is seldom used  he has been talking to me about old mr cragg who has an office next door to you im sure youll admit that mr cragg is queer if the storekeeper isnt  a man like mr cragg has the right to be queer snapped the dressmaker who did not relish this criticism of the natives by a perfect stranger he is very quiet and respectable and makes a very satisfactory neighbor  josie seated in a straight woodbottomed chair seemed not at all chagrined by her reception she watched the pressing for a time silently  thats a mighty pretty gown she presently remarked in a tone of admiration i dont suppose i shall ever be able to make anything as nice as that iim not good at planning you know with modest selfdeprecation i only do plain sewing and mending  the stern features of miss huckins relaxed a bit she glanced at the girl then at her work and said more pleasantly than she had before spoken  this dress is for mary donovan who lives two miles north of here shes to be married next saturdayif they get the haying over with by that timeand this is part of her trousseau ive made her two other dresses and trimmed two hats for hera straw shape and a felt gainsboro the donovans are pretty welltodo  josie nodded with appreciation  its nice she can get such elegant things so near home isnt it why she couldnt do as well in the citynot half as well  miss huckins held up the gown and gazed at it with unmistakable pride its the best henrietta said she and im to get six dollars for the making i wanted seven at first and mary only wanted to pay five so we split the difference with all the other things i didnt do so badly on this trousseau  youre in luck declared josie and so is mary donovan doesnt mr cragg do any business except real estate  i think he must replied the dressmaker hanging up the gown and then seating herself opposite her visitor all the real estate business hes done in the last two years was to rent the kenton place to colonel hathaway and make a sale of higgins cow pasture to sam marvin but hes so quiet all day in the next room that i cant figure out what hes up to no one goes near him so i cant overhear any talk one time of course mr joselyn used to go there and then they always whispered as if they were up to some deviltry but after the quarrel joselyn never came here again  oh did they quarrel asked josie with languid interest she knew her praise of the dress had won the dressmakers heart and also she was delighted to find miss huckins a more confirmed and eager gossip than even sol jerrems  i should say they did quarrel was the emphatic reply although she sank her voice to a whisper and glanced warningly at the thin partition at one time i thought thered be murder done for joselyn yelled take that awaytake it away and old swallowtailthats the name we call mr cragg you knowroared out you deserve to die for this cowardly act well youd better believe my hair stood on end for a minute josie smiled as she thought of the wig standing on end but nothing happened there was deep silence then the door opened and mr joselyn walked out i never interfere with other peoples business but attend strictly to my own yet that day i was so flustered that i peeked through a crack of my door at mr joselyn and he seemed cool as a cucumber then mr cragg slammed the door of his roomwhich is z very unusual thing for him to doand that was all  when did this happen asked josie  last fall just before mrs joselyn and her husband went back to their city home some time in the winter mr joselyn ran away from her they say but i guess old cragg had nothing do with that around here joselyn wasnt liked he put on too many airs of superiority to please the country folks sol jerrems thinks he made away with mr craggs money in unwise speculations but i dont believe cragg had any money to lose he seems as poor as i am  what do you suppose drew those two men together miss huckins inquired the girl  i cant say ive tried to figure it out but the truth is that old cragg dont confide in anyonenot even in me and were close neighbors you couldnt find two men in all america more different than joselyn and cragg and yet they had dealings of some sort together and were friendly for a time  josie sighed regretfully  i like to hear about these mysterious things said she its almost as good as reading a story only in this case we will never know how the story ends  well perhaps not admitted the dressmaker joselyn is gone and no onell ever get the truth out of cragg butid like to know myself not only how the story ends but what it was all about just now all we know is that there was a story of some sort or other and perhaps is yet  a period of silence while both mused  i dont suppose you could find a bit of red thread said josie  no i havent used it for ages is it to mend with  yes  if its a red dress use black thread it wont show if youre careful and it wont fade away and leave a white streak like red sometimes does  thank you miss huckins she rose to go id like to drop in again sometime for a little visit  come as often as you like was the cordial reply  craggs crossing people are rather interesting theyre so different from city folks said josie  yes they really are and i know most of them pretty well come in again josie  thank you i will    chapter ix josie investigates  well what luck asked mary louise as she came into josies room while her friend was dressing for dinner  not much was the reply im not at all sure mary louise that this chase will amount to anything but it will afford me practice in judging human nature if nothing else comes of it so im not at all sorry you put me on the trail when are we to see ingua again  tomorrow afternoon shes coming to tea in the pavilion  thats good let me see all of her you can shes an original that child and im going to like her our natures are a good deal alike  oh josie  thats a fact were both proud resentful reckless and affectionate we hate our enemies and love our friends were rebellious at times and not afraid to defy the world  im sure you are not like that dear protested mary louise  i am ingua and i are both children of nature the only difference is that i am older and have been taught diplomacy and selfcontrol which she still lacks i mask my feelings while ingua frankly displays hers thats why i am attracted to her  mary louise did not know how to combat this mood she remained silent until josie was dressed and the two went down to dinner their visitor was no longer the type of a half ignorant half shrewd sewinggirl such as she had appeared to be while in the village her auburn hair was now tastefully arranged and her attire modest and neat she talked entertainingly during dinner enlivening her companions thereby and afterward played a game of dominoes with the colonel in the livingroom permitting him to beat her at this his favorite diversion  both the old gentleman and his granddaughter enjoyed their evenings with josie ogorman for she proved delightful company in the mornings however she would don her cheap gingham rumple her hair and pose throughout the day as josie jessup the sewinggirl  ingua at first shy of the visitor soon developed a strong liking for josie and would talk with her more freely than with mary louise josie would skip across the steppingstones and help ingua wash the breakfast dishes and sweep the bare little rooms of the cottage and then together they would feed the chickens gather the eggs and attend to such daily tasks as ingua was obliged to fulfill with josies help this was soon accomplished and then the child was free for the day and could run across to join mary louise while josie sallied to the village to interview the natives  when the girl detective had been at craggs crossing for a week she was a familiar figure to the villagersevery one of whom was an acquaintanceand had gleaned all the information it was possible to secure from them which was small in amount and unsatisfactory in quality two or three times she had passed old swallowtail on the street but he had not seemed to notice her always the old man stared straight ahead walking stiffly and with a certain repellent dignity that forbade his neighbors to address him he seemed to see no one he lived in a world known only to himself and neither demanded nor desired association with his fellows  an eccentric bigoted sullen and conceited reflected josie in considering his character capable of any cruelty or crime but too cautious to render himself liable to legal punishment the chances are that such a man would never do any great wrong from cowardly motives he might starve and threaten a child indeed but would refrain from injuring one able to resent the act nevertheless he quarreled with joselynand joselyn disappeared there was some reason for that quarrel some reason for that disappearance some reason why a man like edward joselyn made old swallowtail his confidential friend a business connection perhaps before daring a conjecture i must discover what business cragg is engaged in  she soon discovered that ingua was as ignorant of her grandfathers business life as were all others one day as the two girls were crossing the steppingstones to reach the pavilion after doing the morning housework josie remarked  in winter one could cross here on the ice  oh no replied ingua the water dont freeze it runs too fast but sometimes it gits over the top o the stones an then you has to step keerful to keep from fallin in  did you ever try to cross at such a time once i did an i was skeered you kin bet but i says to myself if ol swallertail kin make the crossin i kindark or no darkan by cracky i tackled it brave as a lion  you tried to cross in the dark on a winters night what for ingua  ingua walking beside her up the bank paused with a startled expression and grew red her eyes narrowed and shrewd fixed themselves suspiciously on josies face but the other returned the look with a bland smile that surely ought to disarm one more sophisticated than this simple child  i mustnt talk bout that said ingua in a low voice jes fergit as i said it josie  why  do ye want me choked or killed  who would do that  grandad would if i blabbed  shucks  ye dont know grandadnot when hes got the temper on him if yed seen what i seen yed know that hed keep his wordto kill me if i talk too much  josie sat down on top the bank  what did you see ingua  yell hev to guess it  it looks that way said josie calmly but you neednt be afraid of me ingua you and i could know a lot of things together and keep em to ourselves dont you think im a good enough friend not to get you choked or killed by telling any secrets you confided to me and look here inguathis secret is worrying you a good deal  who says so  i do youd feel a heap better if you told me about it for then we could talk it over together when were alone  ingua sat down beside her gazing thoughtfully at the river  youd tell mary louise  you know better than that a secrets a secret isnt it i guess i can keep my mouth shut when i want to ingua  josie had a way of imitating inguas mode of speech when they were together it rendered their intercourse more free and friendly but the girl did not reply at once she sat dreamily reflecting upon the proposition and its possible consequences finally she said in a hesitating way  i wisht i knew what ter do i sometimes think i orter tell somebody that knows moren i do josie if i ever blab at all  try me ingua im pretty smart cause ive seen more of the big world than you have and know what goes on in the big busy cities where life is different from what it is in this little place ive lived in more than one city too and that means a lot of experience for a girl of my age im sure i could help you dear perhaps when ive heard your story i will tell you never to say anything about it to anyone else and then on the other hand i might think differently anyhow id never tell myself any secret of yours whatever i might think because id cut off my right hand rather than get you into trouble  this dramatic speech was intended to appeal to the childs imagination and win her full confidence in a way it succeeded ingua sidled closer to josie and finally said in a trembling whisper  ye wouldnt git grandad inter trouble either would ye  do you like him ingua  i hate him but hes a cragg an im a cragg an the craggs kin stand up an spit at the world if they wants to  thats right agreed josie emphatically weve got to stick up for our own families and fight for our good name when its necessary do you think id let anybody get the best of a jessup never in a thousand years  ingua nodded her head as if pleased  thats the way i look at it josie evrybodys down on ol swallertail an im down on him myself fer that matter but ill dare anybody to say anything agin him when im aroun an yet josiean yeti aint sure but hesbut hes a murderer  she had dropped her voice until she scarcely breathed the last words and her little body trembled through and through with tense nervousness josie took her hand  never mind dear she said gently perhaps he didnt kill ned joselyn after all  ingua sprang up with a hoarse scream and glared at josie in absolute terror  howd ye know howd ye know it were ned joselyn she demanded trembling more and more  josies reply was a smile josies smile was essentially winning and sweet it was reassuring trustful friendly  this isnt a very big place ingua she quietly remarked i can count the people of craggs crossing on my fingers and toes and the only one who has ever disappeared is ned joselyn why youve told me so yourself your grandfather and joselyn were friends then they quarreled afterward joselyn disappeared  who said they quarreled  miss huckins told me it was in the office next door to where she lives and works  oh with a sigh of relief but ned joselyn run away evrybody knows that  everybody but you dear sit down why do you get so nervous really ingua after youve told me the whole story youll feel better its too big a secret for one small body to hold isnt it and just between ourselves we will talk it all overmany timesand then it wont seem so dreadful to you and after all youre not positive your grandfather killed ned joselyn perhaps he didnt but youre afraid he did and that keeps you unstrung and unhappy who knows but i may be able to help you discover the truth sit down ingua and lets talk it all over    chapter x ingua is confidential  ingua slowly resumed her seat on the bank beside her friend it was hard to resist josies appeals  the whole thing looks pretty black agin grandad she said i spose ye cant understand what i mean till i tell ye the whole story from the beginning cause ye didnt live here at the time if ye lived here she added i wouldnt tell ye anything but bynby yer goin away an yeve promised to keep yer mouth shut  unless you give me permission to speak  i aint likely to do that im tellin ye this josie sos we kin talk it over at times it has got hold o my mind somethin terrible once i was goin to tell mary louise butshe couldnt understand it like you kin shesdiffrent and if grandad ever hears that i blabbed im as good as dead an i know it  he wont hear it from me promised josie  well grandad was allus sly i member marm tellin him to his face he were cold as ice an sly as sin mann had a way o sayin what she thought o him an hed jes look at her steady an say nuthn back she was allus tryin to git money out o him marm was an when he said he didnt hev no money she tol him she knew he did she ransacked the whole housean even tore up the floorboardstryin to find where hed hid it her idee was that if hed sold his land for a lot o money an hadnt spent a cent he must hev it yit but i guess marm didnt find no money an so she lit out the day she lit out she said to him that he was too slick for her but she could take care o herself all she wanted was for him to take care o me grandad said he would an so he did he didnt take any too much care o me an id ruther he wouldnt if i had more to eat i wouldnt kick but since mary louise come here an invited me to tea so often i haint ben hungry a bit  mary louise likes company said josie go on dear  well after ann kenton got married her new husban come here which was ned joselyn i never took a fancy to ann she wasnt specially uppish but she wasnt nothn else either ned made me laugh when i first seen him he had one spectacle in one eye with a string to ketch it if it fell off he had striped clothes an shiny shoes an he walked as keerful as if he was afraid the groun would git the bottoms o them nice shoes dirty he used to set in that summerhouse an smoke cigarettes an read books one day he noticed ol swallertail an looked so hard at him that his oneeyed spectacle fell off a dozen times  that night he sent a letter to grandad an grandad read it an tore it up an told the man that brung it there was no answer thats all i knew till one night they come walkin home together chummy as a team o mules when they come to the bridge they shook hands an ol swallertail come to the house with a grin on his facethe first an last grin i ever seen him have  doesnt he ever laugh asked josie  if he does he laughs when no one is lookin but after that day i seen ned joselyn with grandad a good deal sometimes hed come to our house an wait fer ol swallertail to come home an theyd send me away an tell me not to come back till i was called that made me mighty curious to see what they was up to so one day i crep up behind the house an peeked in the winder they wasnt in the kitchen so i went aroun an peeked through the winder o grandads room an there they both sot an grandad was countin out money on the table it must a ben gold money cause it was yaller an bigger ner cents er nickels ned put it all in his pocket an writ somethin on a paper that grandad put inter his big pocketbook then they both got up an i made a run fer it an hid behind the barn  when did that happen asked josie  the first summer ann was married that was three summers ago countin this one i was only a kid then said ingua as if realizing she was now two years older  and after that said josie  las summer it was jes the same the two was thickern gumdrops only ned didnt go to the office no more he allus came to our house instid one day when he was waitin fer ol swallertail he says to me ingua howd ye like to be rollin in money an jive in a big city an hev yer own automobile to ride in an dress like a queen  id like it says i  well says he its boun to

afore ive done with him  i dont see how thatll make me rollin in money anyhow i told him  the ol manll die pretty soon says ned an then youll git the money i make for him by the time yer growed up if not afore says he you may be the riches girl in the world it all depends on how i kin bend that ol stick of a grandad o yourn  that was the day he gimme the dollar an grandad come in in time to see it an took it away from me it didnt set me up any that talk o neds cause i didnt believe in them brains he bragged on or his bein able to lead ol swallertail by the nose grandad begun gittin kind o harsh with ned afore the summer was over which showed he wasnt bendin much and at the lastjust afore ned went awaythe big quarrel come off it wasnt the quarrel miss huckins knows about but it happened right here theyd sent me away from the house like they always did and i were layin in the clover in the back yard when there was a crash an a yell i jumped up an run to the door an the table was tipped over an a lot o papers an money scattered on the floor an behind the table stood ol swallertail white an still an ned pointn a gun at him  what sort of a gun questioned josie  one o them hippocket sort same as jim bennett the mailman carries only jims aint never loaded cause hes afraid of it i aint sure neds was loaded either for when he seen me in the doorway he jes slipped it in his pocket   very well says grandad i knows now what sort o a man you are ned joselyn an ned he answers back an i know what sort o a man you are ol cragg yer a hypercrit through an through ye preach squareness while yer as crooked as a snake an as pisonous an deadly an yed ruin yer bes friend jes to git a copper cent the best o him  grandad leaned over an set the table on its legs agin an then he says slow an cold but i haint offered to murder you not yet ned joselyn  ned looked at him an kinder shivered an grandad said pick up them papers an things ingua  so i picked em up an put em on the table an they sent me away agin i laid in the clover a whole hour feelin pretty nervous an rocky fer i didnt know what was goin to happen nothn did happen though cept that ned crossed the river on the steppinstones an halfway over he turned an laughed an waved his hand at grandad who stood in the door an watched him go but grandad didnt laugh he says to me when i come in  ingua if ever im found dead you go to dud berkey the constable an tell him to arrest ned joselyn for murder dye understan  i sure do says i guess hed a shot ye grandad if i hadnt come in just when i did  an see here he went on unless im foun dead you keep mum bout what ye seen today if ye blab a word to anyone yell git me in trouble an ill crush ye as willin as id swat a fly me an ned is friends agin says he but i dont trust him  does he trust you i asked him an at first he jus looked at me an scowled but after a minute he answered i dont know how wise the man is praps he isnt a fool but even wise men is foolish sometimes  well josie that was all just then ned went with his wife ann to the city nex day an things here went on as usual only grandad begun to git wakeful nights an couldnt sleep hed git up an dress an go outdoors an walk aroun till mornin he didnt say nothn to me about it but i watched him an one mornin when he come in i says why dont ye git some medicine o doc jenkins to make ye sleep then he busts out an grabs me by the throat an near choked the life out or me  ye spyye dirty little spy says he ye keep yer eyes shut an yer mouth shut or ill skinye alive says he  the way he looked at me i was skeered stiff an i never said nothn more bout his sleepin nights i guess what made him mad was my sayin he orter hev a doctor cause doctors cost money an grandads so poor he hates t spend money unnecessary  did he ever again try to choke you  he tried once more but i was too spry for him it was a winter night when it was cold in his room an he come inter the kitchen where there was a fire to write i sot behind the stove tryin to keep warm an after a time i seen him look up an glare at the bare wall a long time bynby he says in a low voice fer the cause an starts writin agin what cause are ye talkin about grandad says i  i guess hed fergot i was there but now he gives a yell an jumps up an comes for me with his fingers twistin and workin like id seen em afore i didnt wait fer him to git near me you kin bet i made a dive out the back door an stood aroun in the cold tryin to keep warm while i give him time to cool off where the fire was when he was writin agin i sneaked in an he didnt notice me when marm was here she used to josh him about the cause an once i heard her tell him she guessed the cause was hoardin his money sos to starve his family marm wasnt afraid of him but i am so i never whisper the word cause while hes around  josie sat in silent reflection for a time then she asked softly  does he still walk at night ingua  sometimes not so much as he once did though he seems to take streaks o bein wakeful explained the girl  have you ever seen him come out or go in  lots o times when its moonlight i kin see him through my window an he cant see me cause my room is dark  and does he carry anything with him  not a thing he jes goes out like he does daytimes an comes back the same way  josie nodded her tousled red head as if the answers pleased her  hes a very clever man your grandfather she remarked he can fool not only his neighbors but his own family but youve more to tell me ingua  how dye know josie  because all this is just the beginning it is something else that has been worrying you dear    chapter xi the fate of ned joselyn  the child stared dreamily at the rushing water for several minutes then she looked earnestly into josies face finally with a sigh she said  i may as well go on an finish it i spose  to be sure said josie you havent told me anything very important yet  the important parts comin asserted ingua her tone gradually assuming its former animation twas last winter on the thursday between christmas an new years it was cold an snowin hard an it gits dark early them days grandad an me was eatn supper by lamplight when there come a knock at the door i jumped up an opened it an there stood ned joselyn in a big heavy coat that was loaded with snow an kid gloves on an his oneeyed spectacle on his face he come in an stood while i shut the door an grandad glared at him like he does when the devils gits him and said whatmore  sure thing says ned nothn lasts forever  thats true says grandad holdin himself in then he looks at me an back to ned an says i cant see ye here where ye stoppin at the kenton house  jes fer tonight says ned its more private than a hotel  go home then says grandad ill come over bynby  ned opened the door an went out sayin nothn more grandad finished his supper an then sot by the stove an smoked his pipe while i washed the dishes i wondered why he didnt go over an see ned but he sot there an smoked till i went upstairs to bed that was queer for i never knew him to smoke moren one pipe o tobacco at a time before an then mostly on sundays and id never seen his face so hard an cruellookin as it were that night and his eyes seemed like they were made of glass i didnt undress fer i knowed thered be trouble if he went over to neds house and i made up my mind to keep watch o things  so i set still in my room in the attic an grandad set still in the room downstairs an it must a ben pretty late when i heard him get up an go out i slipped down right after him meanin to foller him an let myself out the back door sos he wouldnt see me it had stopped snowin by then but it was so cold that the air cut like a knife and the only jacket i had wasnt any too warm fer such weather  when i got round the house ol swallertail was standin on the bank lookin at the river i never knew nobody to try the steppinstones in winter an i sposed o course grandad would take the path to the bridge but he went down the bank wadin through the snow an started to cross over the moon an the snow made it light enough to see easy after youd ben out a few minutes i watched him cross over an climb the bank an make for the house an then i run down to the river myself  the water covered all the stones but i knew where they were as well as grandad did i didnt like my job a bit but i knew if i waited to go roun by the bridge that id be too late to see anything that happened so i screwed up courage an started over my legs aint as long as a grownups and at the third step i missed the stone an soused one leg in the water up to my knee gee that was a cold one but i wouldnt give up an kep on until jus in the middle where the water were roarin the worst i slipped with both legs and went in to my waist that settled it for me i thought id drown for a minute but i went crazy with fear an the next thing i knew i was standin on the bank where id come from an the cold wind was freezin a sheet of ice on my legs an body  there wasnt no time to lose whatever was happenin over to the big house didnt mean as much to me as death did an death was on my track if i didnt get back home afore i froze stiff i started to run it aint farlook there josie ye could almost make it in three jumps but i remember fallin down half a dozen times in the snow an at the last i crawled to the door on my hands an knees an had jus strength enough to rise up an lift the latch  grandads awful stingy about burnin wood but i threw the chunks into the stove till the old thing roared like a furnace an when id thawed out some i got off my shoes an stockins an my wet dress an put another skirt on then i lay in grandads chair afore the fire an shivered an cried like a baby whenever i thought o that icy river  i guess i must a went to sleep afterwards fer when i woke up the fire was gettn low an ol swallertail opened the door on a sudden an walked in josie ye orter seen him his legs was wet an icy too so he must a slipped on the stones himself an he was shakin all over as if hed got the ague his face was a dirty white an his eyes burnt like two coals he threw on more wood recklesslike an jerked off his shoes an socks an set down tother side the stove neither of us said nothn fer awhile an then he looks at me sort o curious an asks  did ye git across ingua  no says i i near got drowned tryin it  then he set silent agin lookin at the fire bynby says he ingua yer old enough to hev sense an i want ye to think keerful on what im goin ter say folks aroun here dont like you an me very much an if they got a chanceor even thought they had a chance theyd crush us under heel like they would scorpions thats cause were craggs for craggs aint never ben poplar in this neighborhood for some reason now lisn ive done with ned joselyn it aint nay fault as ive cast him off its hisn hes got a bad heart an hes robbed me right an left i could fergive him fer that becausewell ye dont need to know why i clung to the feller when i knew he was a scoundrel but he robbed a cause dearer to my heart than myself an for that i couldnt fergive him nobody knows ned were here tonight ingua so if anybody asks ye questions ye didnt see him at all fix that firm in yer mind ye dont know nothn bout ned sence he went away las october ye haint seen him stick to that girl an yer all right but if ye blabif ye ever tell a soul as ned were hereill hev to kill yer myself to stop yer mouth fix that in yer mind too  i was so skeered that i jes looked at him then i says in a whisper what did ye do to ned grandad  he turned his eyes on me so fierce that i dropped my head  i didnt kill him if thats what ye mean says he i orter strangled him but i didnt want to swing fer no common thief like ned joselyn besides hesbut thats none o yer business so i threatened him an that was jus as good as killin he wont show up agin here never an he aint likely to show up anywheres else that hes known praps hell be hunted for but hell keep out a the way you an i aint got nothn to worry about inguaunless you blab  i didnt believe a word he said josie they was jus words an it was natral hed lie about that nights work when i went to bed it was near mornin but ol swallertail was still settn by the fire  nex day he went on jus as usual an from then till now hes never spoke to me of that night in a couple o weeks we heard as ned joselyn had run away his wife come down here askin fer him but nobodyd seen hide ner hair of him thats all josie thats the whole story an im glad you know it now as well as i do wha dye think did ol swallertail kill ned joselyn  josie woke from her meditation with a start  iim going to think it over she said evasively its a queer story inguamighty queerand its going to take a lot of thought before i make up my mind about it    chapter xii theories are dangerous  what were you and ingua talking about for so long asked mary louise when she and josie were alone  she was telling me her story was the reply  all of it  every bit of it i think  oh what was it all about questioned mary louise eagerly  ive promised not to tell  not even me josie  not even you ingua insisted and really dear its better you should know nothing just at present  am i to be left out of all this thrilling mystery demanded mary louise with an aggrieved air  there wont be a thrill in it until the end and perhaps not then but you shall come in at the finish if not before ill promise that  wont this enforced promise to ingua tie your hands queried the other girl thoughtfully  no i didnt promise not to act but only to keep the childs secret for inguas sake as well as to satisfy your curiosityand my ownim going to delve to the bottom of ned joselyns disappearance that will involve the attempt to discover all about old swallowtail who is a mystery all by himself i shall call on you to help me at times mary louise but youre not to be told what is weighing so heavily on poor inguas mind  well said mary louise if i may help that will serve to relieve my disappointment to an extent but im surprised at ingua i thought she loved and trusted me  so she does asserted josie since ive heard the story im not surprised at ingua at all if you knew all my dear you would realize why she believes that one confidant is enough indeed im rather surprised that ingua ventured to confide in me  is it so serious then  if her fears are justified replied josie gravely it is very serious  but are they justified urged mary louise  ingua is a child and very sensitive to impressions but she is a shrewd child and living a lonely life has had ample time to consider the problems that confront her whether she is right or wrong in her conjectures time will determine but dont question me further please or you will embarrass me tomorrow i want to go to the city which is the county seat will you go with me and can we get uncle eben to drive us over in the car  ill ask granpa jim  colonel hathaway was rather amused at the efforts of the two girls to fathom the mystery of old swallowtail but he was willing to assist in any practical way so uncle eben drove them to the county seat next day and josie spent several hours in the county clerks office and paid a visit to the chief of police who knew her father john ogorman by reputation mary louise shopped leisurely while her friend was busy with her investigations and at last they started for home where they arrived in time for dinner on the way mary louise inquired if josie had secured any information of importance  a little said the girl detective for one thing old hezekiah cragg pays taxes on just one bit of land besides that little homestead of his it is a fiveacre tract but the assessment puts it at an astonishingly low valuationscarcely ten per cent of the value of all surrounding property that strikes me as queer ive got the plat of it and tomorrow we will look it up  they found it was not easy to locate that five acres even with a map when the two girls made the attempt the next forenoon but finally at the end of a lonely lane about a mile and a half from the village they came upon a stony tract hemmed in by low hills which seemed to fit the location described the place was one mass of tumbled rocks little herbiage of any sort grew there and its low assessment value was easily explained the surrounding farms all highly cultivated backed up to the little waste valley which was fenced outor rather inby the owners of the fertile lands one faintly trodden path led from the bars of the lane the girls were in toward mr craggs five acres of stones but amid the jumble of rocks it would be difficult to walk at all  this is an odd freak of nature remarked josie gazing at the waste with a puzzled expression it is easy to understand why mr cragg hasnt sold this lot as he did all his other land no one would buy it  havent the stones a value for building or something asked mary louise  not in this location so far from a railway in my judgment the tract is absolutely worthless i wonder that so economical a man as mr cragg pays taxes on it  they went no farther than the edge of the rockstrewn field for there was nothing more to see up the slope of the hill on the far side from where they stood were jumbled masses of huge slabs and boulders that might be picturesque but were not especially interesting the girls turned and retraced their steps to the neglected lane and from thence reached the main road again  i have now satisfied myself on two counts was josies comment first that mr cragg owns no property but this stoneyard and his little home and second that within the last forty years he has at different times disposed of seventy thousand dollars worth of land left him by his father the county records prove that the last sale was made about four years ago so he has consistently turned all his real estate into ready money  what can he have done with so much money exclaimed mary louise  ah that is part of the mystery my dear if he still has it then the man is a miser if he has lost it he is a gambler which is just about as bad either way hezekiah cragg is not entitled to our admiration to say the least let us admit that in a big city a man might lose seventy thousand dollars in business ventures without exciting adverse criticism except for a lack of judgment but old swallowtail has never left craggs crossing according to all reports and im sure there is no way for him to squander a fortune here  i think he must be a miser said mary louise with conviction ingua once told me of seeing lots of money pass between him and mr joselyn andtell me josiewhat is all his voluminous correspondence about  im going to investigate that presently replied her friend it isnt quite in line yet but will come pretty soon tomorrow i shall call upon old swallowtail at his office  shall you really and may i go with you josie  not this time youd spoil my excuse you see for you are going to discharge your sewinggirl and your sewinggirl is going to apply to hezekiah cragg for work his granddaughter needs some sewing done by the looks of her wardrobe  oh very well but you will tell me what happens  of course  once said mary louise i proposed going myself to mr cragg to intercede for ingua but the girl thought i would do more harm than good so i abandoned the idea  i think that was wise i dont expect to get much out of the man except an interview with a chance to study him at close range also im anxious to see what that mysterious office looks like  mary louise regarded her friend admiringly  youre very brave josie she said  pooh theres no danger one of the first things father taught me about the detective business was that all men belong to one tribe and the criminal is inevitably a coward at heart old swallowtail may be afraid of me before im through with this case but whether he proves guilty or innocent i shall never fear him a particle  have you any theory as yet josie  no theories are dangerous things and never should be indulged in until backed by facts  but do not theories often lead to facts and how about those ogorman theories you mentioned which you were eager to test  those are mere theories of investigationmethods to be pursued in certain situations i believe i shall be able to test some of them in this case my plan is to find out all i can about everyone and everything and then marshal my facts against the question involved if there is no answer ive got to learn more if i cant learn more then the whole thing becomes mere guessworkin other words theorymore likely to be wrong than right  mary louise seldom argued with josies decisions when the next morning her friend started for the village to call upon old swallowtail she pressed her hand and wished her good luck josie departed in her plain gingham dress shoes run over at the heels hair untidy and uncovered by hat or hooda general aspect of slovenly servitude  mr cragg was never an early riser he breakfasted at eight oclock and at half past eight stalked with stiff dignity to town and entered his office without deigning to recognize any villagers he might meet josie was aware of this habit she timed her visit for halfpast ten  unnoticed she passed through the village street and crept up the stairs at the end of the store building before the door marked h cragg real estate she paused to listen no sound came from within but farther along the passage she heard the dull rumble of miss huckins sewing machine  for once josie hesitated but realizing that hesitation meant weakness on such an errand she boldly thrust out a hand and attempted to turn the doorknob    chapter xiii bluff and rebuff  the door was locked immediately josie pounded upon it with her knuckles and a voice demanded  who is there  instead of replying josie knocked again and suddenly the door was opened and old swallowtail stood before her  ii beg your pardon said she diffidently are you the real estate man  yes he replied standing quietly in the doorway  then youre the man i want to see she asserted and took a step forward but he did not move an inch from his position and his eyes were fixed steadfastly on her face  i have nothing to sell at present he remarked  but i want to give you something to sell she retorted impatiently summoning her wits to meet the occasion let me in please or do you transact all your business in the hallway  somewhat to her surprise he stepped back and held the door for her to enter josie promptly walked in and sat down near a round table one comprehensive glance fixing in her mind the entire contents of the small room  there was one window dim and unwashed facing the street it had a thick shade now raised originally the room had been square and rather crudely plastered and wallpapered but a wooden partition had afterward been erected to cut the room into two so that the portion she had entered was long and narrow its sole furniture consisted of the round table quite bare two or three woodenbottomed chairs and against one wall a rack filled with books during the interview she noted that these books were mostly directories of the inhabitants of various prominent cities in the united states and such a collection astonished her and aroused her curiosity  just at present however the partition proved the most interesting thing she observed for beyond it must be another room which was doubtless the particular sanctum of old swallowtail and to which she scarcely expected to gain admittance the door was closed it was stout and solid and was fitted with both an ordinary doorlock and a hasp and padlock the latter now hanging on a nail beside the door  this much josies sharp eyes saw in her first glance but immediately her attention was demanded by mr cragg who took a seat opposite her and said in a quiet well modulated voice now my girl state your business she had planned to tell him how she had come to town to sew for mary louise burrows how she had now finished her work but was so charmed with craggs crossing that she did not care to leave it during the hot weather to return to the stuffy city therefore she intended to add if he would let her make some new dresses for ingua she would work for half her regular wages her dress as a sewinggirl would carry out this deception and the bait of small wages ought to interest the old man but this clever plan had suddenly gone glimmering for in order to gain admittance to the office and secure an interview with old swallowtail she had inadvertently stated that she had some real estate to dispose of so sudden a change of base required the girl to think quickly in order to formulate a new argument that would hold his attention  to gain time she said slowly  my name is josie jessup im a sewinggirl by profession  yes i know he replied  ive been here ten days or so working for miss burrows  i have seen you here said mr cragg  she wondered how he knew so much as he had never seemed to favor her with even a glance when by chance they met in the street but perhaps ingua had told him  i like craggs crossing continued josie assuming a confidential tone and ive made up my mind id like to live here there ought to be plenty of work sewing for the farmers wives outside of what miss huckins does and it dont cost much to live in a small town in the city i own a little house and lot left to me by my uncle on my mothers side and ive decided to trade it for some place here dont you know sir of someone whod like to move to the city and will be glad to make the exchange  i know of no such person he replied coldly  but you will make inquiries  it would be useless i am very busy today so if you will excuse me  he rose and bowed  josie was disappointed she decided to revert to her first proposition  doesnt your granddaughter need some sewing done sir she asked with a frank look from her innocent blue eyes  he stood still silently studying her face with one hand he rubbed his chin gently as if in thought then he said  we cannot afford to hire our sewing done but i thank you for the offer good morning missjessup  walking to the door he held it open and bowed gravely as she walked out next moment she heard the key click as it turned in the lock  josie feeling a sense of failure slowly went down the stairs entered the store and perched herself upon the sugarbarrel old sol was waiting on a farmers wife and only gave the girl a glance  josie reflected on her interview with mr cragg while it was fresh in her mind he was no crude uneducated country bumpkin despite his odd ways and peculiar dress indeed the man had astonished her by his courtesy his correct method of speech his perfect selfassurance her visit was calculated to annoy him and to arouse his impatience after inguas report of him she expected he would become scornful or sarcastic or even exhibit violent anger yet there had been nothing objectionable in his manner or words still he had dismissed her as abruptly as possible and was not eager to grasp an opportunity to exchange real estate  that isnt his business at all she told herself its merely a blind although he actually did rent the kenton place to colonel hathawayi wonder what he does in that office all day in the inner room of course that is his real workshophes quite gentlemanly he has a certain amount of breeding which ingua wholly lackshe must realize what a crude and uncultured little thing his granddaughter is then why hasnt he tried to train her differentlyreally he quite awed me with his stately composed manner no one would expect that sort of man to be a murderer butthere havent i been warned that the educated gentleman is the worst type of criminal and the most difficult to detect  sols customer went away and the old man approached the barrel  well he said wanter buy anything today  no said josie pleasantly this is only a social call ive just come from old swallowtails office and thought a word with you would cheer me up  you you ben to ol swallertails office sakes alive gal i wouldnt dare do that myself  why not  he goes crazy when he gits mad  are you sure of that  evrybody here knows it from the threeyearolds up what did ye go to him for  a little matter of business  an he slammed the door in yer face  no indeed  thats funny said old sol rubbing his forehead in a perplexed way  he was very decent to me continued josie acted like a gentleman talked as if hed been to school you know  school well i should say he had exclaimed the storekeeper ol swallertails the most eddicated man in these ere parts i guess ol nick cragg his daddy wanted for him to be a preacheror a priest most likelyan when he was a boy his ol man paid good money to hev him eddicated at a theat a theoat a collidge but hezekiah want overreligious an lowed he didnt hev no call to preach so thats all the good the eddication ever done him  youve never felt the need of an education have you asked the girl artlessly  me well i aint sayin as i got no eddication though i dont class myself in booklarnin with ol swallertail three winters i went to school an once i helped whip the schoolteacher taint evry one has got that record but eddication means moren books it means keepin yer eyes open an gittn onter the tricks o yer trade evry time i git swindled ive larned somethin an if id started this store in new york instid o craggs crossin they might be runnin me fer president by this time  but what could craggs crossing have done without you inquired josie it seems to me youre needed here  well thats worth thinkin on admitted the storekeeper and as for old swallowtail he may have learned some tricks of his trade too but i dont know what his trade is  nobody knows that i dont blieve that business o hisn is a trade at all ill bet its a steal whatever its other name happens to be  but he doesnt prosper  no he aint got much t show fer all these years folks used to think hed got money saved from the sale of his land till ned joselyn come here an dallied with ol swallertails savins an then took to the woods its generly blieved that what cragg had once neds got now but it dont matter much cragg haint got long ter live an his feed dont cost him an his little gal much moren it costs to feed my cat  there was no further information to be gleaned from sol jerrems so josie walked home    chapter xiv midnight vigils  well how is our girl detective progressing in her discovery of crime and criminals asked colonel hathaway that evening as they sat in the livingroom after dinner  dont call me a girl detective please pleaded josie ogorman im only an apprentice at the trade colonel and i have never realized more than i do at this moment the fact that ive considerable to learn before i may claim membership with the profession  then youre finding your present trail a difficult one to follow  i believe my stupidity is making it difficult admitted josie with a sigh father would scold me soundly if he knew how foolishly i behaved today there was every opportunity of my forcing a clew by calling unexpectedly on mr cragg at his office but he defeated my purpose so easily that now im wondering if he suspects who i am and why im here he couldnt have been more cautious  he could scarcely suspect that said the colonel musingly but ive noticed that these simple country people are chary of confiding in strangers  ah if mr cragg were only thata simple unlettered countryman as i thought himi should know how to win his confidence but do you know sir he is well educated and intelligent once he studied for the priesthood or ministry attending a theological college  indeed  my informant the village authoritywho is sol jerrems the storekeepersays he objected to becoming a priest at the last because he had no leaning that way my own opinion is that he feared his ungovernable temper would lead to his undoing i am positive that his hysterical fury when aroused has gotten him into trouble many times even in this patient community  thats it said mary louise with conviction his temper has often made him cruel to poor ingua and perhaps his temper caused unfortunate ned joselyn to disappear  have you discovered anything more than you have told me she asked  not a thing replied mary louise im waiting for you to make discoveries josie  a puzzle that is readily solved remarked the colonel picking up his book is of little interest the obstacles you are meeting josie incline me to believe you girls have unearthed a real mystery it is not a mystery of the moment however so take your time to fathom it the summer is young yet  josie went to her room early saying she was tired but as soon as she was alone and free she slipped on a jacket and stealthily left the house down the driveway she crept like a shadow out through the gates over the bridge and then she turned down the pathway leading to old swallowtails cottage  the steppingstones are a nearer route she reflected but i dont care to tackle them in the dark  the cottage contained but three rooms the larger one downstairs was a combination kitchen and dining room a small wing built upon one side was used by mr cragg for his private apartment but its only outlet was through the main room at the back was a leanto shed in which was built a narrow flight of stairs leading to a little room in the attic where ingua slept josie knew the plan of the house perfectly having often visited ingua during the day when her grandfather was absent and helped her sweep and make the beds and wash the dishes  tonight josie moved noiselessly around the building satisfied herself that ingua was asleep and that mr cragg was still awake and then strove to peer through the shuttered window to discover what the old man was doing  she found this impossible although the weather was warm the window was tightly shut and a thick curtain was drawn across it  josie slipped over to the river bank and in the shadow of a tree sat herself down to watch and wait with such patience as she could muster it was half past nine oclock and ingua had told her that when her grandfather was wakeful and indulged in his long walks he usually left the house between ten oclock and midnightseldom earlier and never later he would go to bed the child said and finding he could not sleep would again dress and go out into the night only to return at early morning  josie doubted that he ever undressed on such occasions knowing as he no doubt did perfectly well what his program for the night would be she had decided that the nocturnal excursions were not due to insomnia but were carefully planned to avoid possible observation when all the countryside was wrapped in slumber the old gentleman stole from his cottage and wentwhere doubtless to some secret place that had an important bearing on his life and occupation it would be worth while josie believed to discover the object of these midnight excursions ingua claimed that her grandfathers periods of wakeful walking were irregular sometimes he would be gone night after night and then for weeks he would remain at home and sleep like other folks  so josie was not surprised when old swallowtails light was extinguished shortly after ten oclock and from then until midnight he had not left the house evidently this was not one of his wakeful periods the girls eyes during this time never left the door of the cottage the path to the bridge passed her scarcely five yards distant therefore as hezekiah cragg had not appeared he was doubtless sleeping the sleep of the justor the unjust for all sorts and conditions of men indulge in sleep  josie waited until nearly one oclock then she went home let herself in by a side door to which she had taken the key and in a few minutes was as sound asleep as old swallowtail ought to be  for three nights in succession the girl maintained this vigil with no result whatever it was wearisome work and she began to tire of it on the fourth day as she was visiting with ingua she asked  has your grandfather had any sleepless nights lately  i dont know was the reply but he aint walked any as he sometimes does for i haint heard him go out  do you always hear him  praps not always but most times  and does he walk more than one night inquired josie  when he takes them fits they lasts for a week or more asserted ingua then for a long time he sleeps quiet  will you let me know the next time he takes to walking  why asked the child suspiciously  its a curious habit josie explained and id like to know what he does during all those hours of the night  he walks declared ingua and if he does anything else its his own business  ive wondered said josie impressively if he doesnt visit some hidden grave during those midnight rambles  ingua shuddered  i wish ye wouldnt talk like that she whispered it gives me the creeps  wouldnt you like to know the truth of all this mystery ingua  sometimes i would an sometimes i wouldnt if the truth leaked out mebbe grandad would git inter a lot o trouble i dont want that josie i aint no cause to love grandad but hes a cragg an im a cragg an no cragg ever went back on the fambly  it seemed unwise to urge the child further to betray her grandfather yet for inguas sake if for no other reason josie was determined to uncover the hidden life of hezekiah cragg  the following night she watched again at her station by the river bank and again the midnight hour struck and the old man had not left his cottage his light was extinguished at eleven oclock at twelvethirty josie rose from the shadow of the tree and slowly walked to the bridge there instead of going home she turned in the direction of the town  in the sky were a few stars and the slim crescent of a new moon affording sufficient light to guide her steps crickets chirped and frogs in the marshes sang their hoarse love songs but otherwise an intense stillness pervaded the countryside you must not consider josie ogorman an especially brave girl for she had no thought of fear in such solitary wanderings although but seventeen years of age she had been reared from early childhood in an atmosphere of intrigue and mystery for her detective father had been accustomed to argue his cases and their perplexities with his only child and for hours at a time he would instruct her in all the details of his profession it was ogormans ambition that his daughter might become a highly proficient female detective  there are so many cases where a woman is better than a man he would say and there is such a lack of competent women in this important and fascinating profession that i am promoting the interests of both my daughter and the public safety by training josie to become a good detective  and the girl having been her fathers confidant since she was able to walk and talk became saturated with detective lore and only needed practical experience and more mature judgment fully to justify ogormans ambition for her  however the shrewd old secret service officer well knew that the girl was not yet ready to be launched into active service the experience she needed was only to be gained in just such odd private cases as the one on which she was now engaged so he was glad to let her come to craggs crossing and josie was glad to be there she was only content when working and however the cragg mystery developed or resulted her efforts to solve it were sure to sharpen her wits and add to her practical knowledge of her future craft  when she reached the town she found it absolutely deserted not a light shone anywhere no watchman was employed the denizens of craggs crossing were all in bed and reveling in dreamland  josie sat on the bottom stair of the flight leading to the store and removed her shoes upstairs the family of sol jerrems and miss huckins the dressmaker were sleeping and must not be disturbed the girl made no sound as she mounted the stairs and softly stole to the door of h craggs real estate office here it was dark as could be but josie drew some skeleton keys from her pocket and slid them one by one into the lock the fourth key fitted she opened the door silently and having entered the room drew the door shut behind her  the thick shade was drawn over the window it was as black here as it was in the hallway josie flashed a small searchlight on the door of the connecting room and saw that it was not only locked in the ordinary manner but that the padlock she had noted on her former visit to the room was now inserted in the hasp and formed an additional security against intrusion  while her electric spotlight played upon this padlock she bent over and examined it swiftly but with care  a yale lock she muttered it cant be picked but it will delay me for only a few minutes  then from her pocket she brought out a small steel hacksaw and as she could not work the saw and hold the flashlight at the same time she went to the window and removed the heavy shade the light that now came into the room was dim but sufficient for her purpose returning to the door of the mysterious inner room the contents of which she had determined to investigate she seized the padlock firmly with one hand while with the other she began to saw through the steel loop that passed through the hasp  the sound made by the saw was so slight that it did not worry her but another sound of an entirely different character and coming from the hallway caused her to pause and glance over her shoulder  slowly the outer door opened and a form appeared in the doorway it was a mere shadow at first but it deliberately advanced to the table struck a match and lighted a small kerosene lamp  she was face to face with old swallowtail    chapter xv old swallowtail  josie was so astonished that she still bent over the lock motionless saw in hand in the instant she made a mental review of her proceedings and satisfied herself that she had been guilty of no professional blunder the inopportune appearance of mr cragg must be attributed to a blind chanceto fate so the first wave of humiliation that swept over her receded as she gathered her wits to combat this unexpected situation  mr cragg stood by the table looking at her he was very calm the discovery of the girl had not aroused that violence of temper for which the old man was noted josie straightened up slipped the saw in her pocket and faced him unflinchingly  wont you sit down he said pointing to a chair beside her i would like to know why you have undertaken to rob me  josie sat down her heart bounding with joy if he mistook her for a thief all was not lost and she would not have to write finis as yet to this important case but she made no answer to his remark she merely stared at him in a dull emotionless way that was cleverly assumed  i suppose he continued you have been told i am richa miserand perhaps you imagine i keep my wealth in that little room because i have taken pains to secure it from intrusion by prying meddlers i suspected you my girl when you came to see me the other day your errand was palpably invented you wanted to get the lay of the room in preparation for this nights work but who told you i was worthy of being robbed was it ingua  no came a surly reply she wont mention you to me  very good but the neighborsthe busybodies around here perhaps old sol jerrems has gossiped of my supposed hoard is it not so  josie dropped her eyes as if confused but remained silent the old man seemed to regard her as a curiosity for his cold gray eyes examined her person with the same expression with which he might have regarded a caged monkey  then you do not wish to confess  whats the use she demanded with a burst of impatience havent you caught me at the job  he continued to eye her reflectively  the cities breed felons he remarked it is a pity so young a girl should have chosen so dangerous and disastrous a career it is inevitably disastrous how did it happen that colonel hathaway allowed you to impose on him  i do sewing she said doggedly  in order to gain entrance to a household i suppose but hathaway is wealthy why did you not undertake to rob him instead of me  one at a time said josie with a short laugh  oh i understand you expected to make the small pickups and then land the grand coup the answer is simple after all but he added his voice growing stern and menacing for the first time i do not intend to be robbed my girl fleece hathaway if you can it is none of my business but you must not pry into my personal affairs or rifle my poor rooms do you understand me  ii think so sir  avoid me hereafter keep out of my path the least interference from you in any way will oblige me to turn you over to the police  youll let me go now  he glanced at her frowning  i am too much occupied to prosecute youunless you annoy me further perhaps you have this night learned a lesson that will induce you to abandon such desperate criminal ventures  josie stood up  i wish i knew how you managed to catch me she said with a sigh  you were watching my house tonight waiting until i was safely in bed before coming here i happened to leave my room for a little air and going out my back door i passed around the house and stood at the corner in deep shade my eyes were good enough to distinguish a form lurking under the tree by the river bank i went in put out my light and returned to my former position you watched the house and i watched you you are not very clever for all your slyness you will never be clever enough to become a good thiefmeaning a successful thief after a half hour i saw you rise and take the path to the village i followed you do you understand now god has protected the just and humbled the wicked  that final sentence surprised the girl coming from his lips it shocked her in his former speech he had not denounced her crime but only her indiscretion and the folly of her attempt suddenly he referred to god as his protector asserting his personal uprightness as warrant for divine protection and singularly enough his tone was sincere  josie hesitated whether to go or not for old swallowtail seemed in a talkative mood and she had already discovered a new angle to his character by way of diversion she began to cry  ii know im wicked she sobbed its wrong to steal i know it is but iineed the money and youve got lots of it andandi thought you must be just as wicked as i am  his expression changed to one of grim irony  yes said he by common report i am guilty of every sin in the calendar do you know why  no of course i dont she answered softening her sobs to hear more clearly  years ago when i was a young man i stabbed a fellowstudent in the necka dreadful woundbecause he taunted me about my mode of dress i was wearing the only clothes my eccentric father would provide me with i am wearing the same style of costume yet as penance for that dastardly actcaused by an ungovernable temper with which i have been cursed from my birth i would have entered the service of god had it not been for that temper i am unable to control it except by avoiding undue contact with my fellow men that is why i am living here a recluse when i should be taking an active part in the worlds work  he spoke musingly as if to himself more than to the girl who hung on each word with eager interest no one had ever told her as much of old swallowtail as he was now telling her of himself she wondered why he was so confidential was it because she seemed dull and stupid because she was a stranger who was likely to decamp instantly when he let her go or was the retrospective mood due to the hour and the unwonted situation she waited scarce breathing lest she lose a word  the poor fellow whom i stabbed lived miserably for twenty years afterward he went on and i supported him and his family during that time for his life had been ruined by my act later in life and here at the crossing people saw me kill a balky horse in a wild rage and they have been afraid of me ever since even more recently i  he suddenly paused remembering where he was and to whom he was speaking the girls face was perfectly blank when he shot a shrewd glance at it her look seemed to relieve his embarrassment  however said he in a different tone i am not so black as im painted  i dont think you treat poor ingua quite right remarked josie  eh why not  you neglect her you dont give her enough to eat she hasnt a dress fit for a ragamuffin to wear and shes your granddaughter  he drew in a long breath staring hard  has she been complaining  not to me said josie but she doesnt need to havent i eyes doesnt everyone say its a shame to treat the poor child the way you do my personal opinion is that youre a poor excuse for a grandfather she added with more spirit than she had yet exhibited  he sat silent a long time looking at the lamp his face was hard his long slim fingers twitched as if longing to throttle someone but he positively ignored josies presence she believed he was struggling to subdue what ingua called the devils and would not have been surprised hadhe broken all bounds and tried to do her an injury  go he said at last still without looking at her go and remember that i will not forgive twice  she thought it best to obey very softly she left the room and as she passed out he was still staring at the flame of the lamp and alternately clenching and unclenching his talonlike fingers    chapter xvi inguas new dress  well said mary louise when josie had related to her friend the story next morning what do you think of old swallowtail now  about the same as before im gradually accumulating facts to account for the old mans strange actions but im not ready to submit them for criticism just yet the plot is still a bit ragged and i want to mend the holes before i spread it out before you  do you think he suspects who you are  no he thinks im a waif from the city with a penchant for burglary he expects me to rob you presently and then run away im so unlikely to cross his path again that he talked with unusual frankness to meor at me if you prefer to put it that way all i gained last night was the knowledge that hes afraid of himself that his temper cost him a career in the world and obliged him to live in seclusion and that he has a secret which he doesnt intend any redheaded girl to stumble on accidentally  and you think he was angry when you accused him of neglecting ingua  im sure he was it made him more furious than my attempt to saw his padlock come lets run over and see ingua now i want to ask how her grandfather treated her this morning  they walked through the grounds crossed the river on the steppingstones and found ingua just finishing her mornings work the child greeted them eagerly  im glad you come she said for i was meanin to run over to your place pretty soon what dye think hes happened las night in the middle o the nightor praps nearer morningrandad begun to slam things aroun the smashin of tables an chairs woke me up but i didnt dare go down to see what was the matter he tumbled evrything round in the kitchen an then went inter his own room an made the fur fly there i knew he were in one o his tantrums an that hed be sorry if he broke things but it wasnt no time to interfere when the rumpus stopped i went to sleep agin but i got up early an had his breakfas all ready when he come from his room id picked up all the stuff hed scattered an mended a broken chair an things didnt look so bad  well ol swallertail jes looked aroun the room an then at me an sot down to eat ingua he says pretty soon you need a new dress say girls i near fell over backwards go down to sol jerrems says he an pick out the goods an ill pay for it ill stop in this mornin an tell sol to let ye have it an says he lookin at me ruther queer ye might ask that redheaded sewingirl thats stay in at the hathaways to make it up fer ye i dont think shell ask ye a cent fer the work  grandad says i would ye hev a cragg accep charity even to the makin of a dress   no says he the girl owes me somethin an i guess shell be glad to square the account  then he goes away to town an ive ben nervous an flustered ever since i cant make it out i cant do you owe him anything josie  yes said josie with a laugh i believe i do you shall have the dress inguaall made upand ill go down with you and help pick out the goods  so will i exclaimed mary louise highly delighted  and we will have miss huckins cut and fit it continued josie im not much good at that thing ingua so we will have a real dressmaker and ill pay her and charge it up to what i owe your grandfather  the little girl seemed puzzled  howd ye happen to owe him anything josie she asked  didnt he tell you  not a word  then he expects it to remain a secret and you mustnt urge me to tell im pretty good at keeping secrets ingua arent you glad of that  they trooped away to town presently all in high spirits and purchased the dress and trimmings at the store old sol was so astonished at this transaction that he assailed the three girls with a thousand questions to none of which did he receive a satisfactory reply  he didnt put no limit on the deal said the storekeeper he jus said whatever the gal picks out charge it to me an ill pay the bill looks like ol swallertail hed gone plumb crazy dont it  then they went upstairs to miss huckins who was likewise thrilled with excitement at the startling event of inguas having a new dress mary louise and josie helped plan the dress which was to be a simple and practical affair after all and the dressmaker measured the child carefully and promised her a fitting the very next day  i dont quite understan remarked ingua as they walked home after this impressive ceremony why you dont make the dress yourself josie an save yer money youre a dressmaker ye say  im a sewinggirl replied josie calmly but ive promised mary louise to sew for no one but her while im here and im too lazy to sew much anyway im having a sort of vacation you know  josie is my friend explained mary louise and i wont let her sew at all if i can help it i want her to be just my companion and have a nice visit before she goes back to the city  but when the two girls were alone josie said to mary louise  old cragg isnt so stonyhearted after all just my suggestion last night that ingua was being neglected has resulted in the new dress  he threw things though before he made up his mind to be generous observed mary louise but this proves that the old man isnt so very poor he must have a little money josie  josie nodded her head absently she was trying hard to understand mr craggs character and so far it baffled her he had frankly admitted his ungovernable temper and had deplored it also he had refrained from having josie arrested for burglary because he was too occupied to prosecute her occupied occupied with what surely not the real estate business she believed the true reason for her escape was that he dreaded prominence old swallowtail did not wish to become mixed up with police courts any more than he could help this very occurrence made her doubt him more than ever    chapter xvii a clew at last  that night josie resumed her watch of craggs cottage she did not trust to the shadow of the tree to conceal her but hid herself under the bank of the river among the dry stones allowing only her head to project above the embankment and selecting a place where she could peer through some low bushes  she suspected that the excitement of the previous night might render the old man nervous and wakeful and send him out on one of his midnight prowls this suspicion seemed justified when at eleventhirty his light went out and a few minutes later he turned the corner of the house and appeared in the path  he did not seem nervous however with hands clasped behind his back and head bowed he leisurely paced the path to the bridge without hesitation crossed the river and proceeded along the road in a direction opposite to the village  josie was following keeping herself concealed with utmost care she remembered that his eyes were sharp in penetrating shadows  he kept along the main country road for a time and then turned to the right and followed an intersecting road half a mile in this direction brought him to a lane running between two farm tracts but which was so little used that grass and weeds had nearly obliterated all traces of wagonwheels  by this time josies eyes were so accustomed to the dim moonlight that she could see distinctly some distance ahead of her the sky was clear there was just enough wind to rustle the leaves of the trees now and then in some farmyard a cock would crow or a dog bark but no other sounds broke the stillness of the night  the girl knew now where old swallowtail was bound at the end of this lane lay his five acres of stones and he was about to visit it the fact gave her a queer little thrill of the heart for a dozen strange fancies crossed her mind in rapid succession if he had really killed ned joselyn it was probable he had buried the man in this neglected place amongst the rubble of stones josie had inspected every foot of ground on the kenton place and satisfied herself no grave had been dug there indeed at the time of joselyns disappearance the ground had been frozen so hard that the old man could not have dug a grave perhaps after a night or two he had dragged the corpse here and covered it with stones it would be a safe hidingplace  and now regret for his act drove the murderer here night after night to watch over the secret grave  or granting that the supposed crime had not been committed might not mr cragg have discovered some sort of mineral wealth in his stoneyard which would account for his paying taxes on the place and visiting it so often or did he simply love the solitude of the dreary waste where safe from prying eyes he could sit among the rocky boulders and commune with himself beneath the moonlit sky  such conjectures as these occupied the girls mind while she stealthily shadowed the old man along the lane never once did he look behind him although she was prepared to dissolve from view instantly had he done so and at last the end of the lane was reached and he climbed the rail fence which separated it from the valley of stones  josie saw him suddenly pause motionless as he clung to the rails she guessed from his attitude that he was staring straight ahead of him at something that had surprised him a full minute he remained thus before he let himself down on the other side and disappeared from view  the girl ran lightly forward and crouching low peered through the bars of the fence half a dozen paces distant the old man stood among the stones in a silent paroxysm of rage he waved his long arms in the air anon clenching his fists and shaking them at some object beyond him his frail old body fluttered back and forth right and left as if he were doing a weird dance among the rocks the violence of his emotion was something terrible to witness and fairly startled the girl had he screamed or sobbed or shrieked or moaned the scene would have been more bearable but such excess of silent intense rage made her afraid for the first time in her life  she wanted to run away at one time she actually turned to fly but then common sense came to her rescue and she resolved to stay and discover what had affected old swallowtail so strongly from her present position she could see nothing more than a vista of tumbled stones but rising until her head projected above the topmost rail she presently saw far across the valley an automobile standing silhouetted against the gray background  the machine was at present vacant it had been driven in from the other side of the valley where doubtless there were other lanes corresponding with the one she was in however there was no fence on that side to separate the lane from the waste tract so the machine had been driven as close as possible to the edge of the stones  although the automobile was deserted that was evidently the object which had aroused old craggs fury the object at which he was even yet shaking his clenched fists josie wondered and watched gradually the paroxysm of wrath diminished presently the old man stood as motionless as the stones about him five minutes perhaps he remained thus controlling himself by a mighty effort regaining his capacity to think and reason then to the girls amazement he tottered toward a large shelflike slab of stone and kneeling down as before an altar he bared his head raised his arms on high and began to pray  there was no mistaking this attitude old swallowtail was calling on god to support him in this hour of trial josie felt something clutching at her heart nothing could be more impressive than this scenethis silent but earnest appeal to the most high by the man whom she suspected of murderof crimes even more terrible she could see his eyes pleading and sincere turned upward could see his gray hair flutter in the breeze could see his lips move though they uttered no sound and after he had poured out his heart to his maker he extended his arms upon the slab rested his head upon them and again became motionless  the girl waited she was sorely troubled surprised even humiliated at being the witness of this extraordinary and varied display of emotion she felt a sense of intrusion that was almost unjustifiable even in a detective what right had anyone to spy upon a communion between god and man  he rose at length rose and walked uncertainly forward stumbling among the ragged rocks he made for the far hillside that was cluttered with huge fragments of stone some weighing many tons and all tumbled helterskelter as if aimlessly tossed there by some giant hand and when he reached the place he threaded his way between several great boulders and suddenly disappeared  josie hesitated a moment what to do yet instinct urged her to follow she had a feeling that she was on the verge of an important discovery that events were about to happen which had been wholly unforeseen even by old cragg himself  she was taking a serious risk by venturing on the stony ground for under the moonlight her dark form would show distinctly against the dull gray of the stones yet she climbed the fence and with her eye fixed on the cluster of rocks where old swallowtail had disappeared she made her way as best she could toward the place should the old man reappear or the owner of the strange automobile emerge from the rocks josie was sure to be discovered and there was no telling what penalty she might be obliged to pay for spying it was a dreary deserted place more than one grave might be made there without much chance of detection  in a few minutes she had reached the hillside and was among the great boulders she passed between the same ones where mr cragg had disappeared but found so many set here and there that to follow his trail was impossible unless chance led her aright  there were no paths for a rubble of small stones covered the ground everywhere between some of the huge rocks the passage was so narrow she could scarcely squeeze through between others there was ample space for two people to walk abreast the girl paused frequently to listen taking care the while to make no sound herself but an intense silence pervaded the place  after wandering here and there for a time without result she had started to return to the entrance of this labyrinth when her ears for the first time caught a sounda peculiar grinding thumping sound that came from beneath her feet seemingly and was of so unusual a character that she was puzzled to explain its cause  the shadows cast by the towering rocks rendered this place quite dark so josie crouched in the deepest shade she could find and listened carefully to the strange sound trying to determine its origin it was surely under grounda little to the right of herperhaps beneath the hillside which slanted abruptly from this spot she decided there must be some secret passage that led to a cave under the hill such a cave might be either natural or artificial in either case she was sure old cragg used it as a rendezvous or workshop and visited it stealthily on his wakeful nights  having located the place to the best of her ability josie began to consider what caused that regular thumping noise which still continued without intermission  i think it must be some sort of an engine she reflected a stamp for ore or something of that sort still it isnt likely there is any steam or electrical power to operate the motor of so big a machine it might be a die stamp though operated by foot power orthis is most likelya footpower printingpress well if a die stamp or a printing press i believe the mystery of old swallowtails business is readily explained  she sat still there crouching between the rocks for more than two hours before the sound of the machine finally ceased another hour passed in absolute silence she ventured to flash her pocket searchlight upon the dial of her watch and found it was nearly four oclock dawn would come presently and then her situation would be more precarious than ever  while she thus reflected the sound of footsteps reached her earsvery near to her indeedand a voice muttered  come this way have you forgotten  forgotten i found the place didnt i was the surly reply  then there passed her so closely that she could have touched them three dim forms she watched them go and promptly followed taking the chance of discovery if they looked behind they were wholly unconscious of her presence however and soon made their way out into the open there they paused and josie hiding behind a high rock could both see and hear them plainly  one was old cragg another a tall thin man with a monocle in his left eye the third she found to her surprise was none other than jim bennett the postman the tall man held in his arms a heavy bundle securely wrapped  youll surely get them off tomorrow said cragg to him  of course was the answer you may be certain ill not have them on my hands longer than is necessary  do you mean to play square this time  dont be a fool said the tall man impatiently your infernal suspicions have caused trouble enough during the past year hidden like a crab in your shell you think everything on the outside is going wrong cant you realize cragg that i must be loyal to c i l theres no question of my playing square ive got to  thats right sir broke in jim bennett seems to me hes explained everything in a satisfactory manneras far as anyone could explain  then good night said cragg gruffly andgood luck  good night growled the tall man in return and made off in the direction of the automobile carrying the package with him the other two stood silently watching him until he reached the car took his seat and started the motor presently the machine passed out of sight and then bennett said in a tone of deepest respect  good night chief this meeting was a great thing for c i l it brings us all nearer to final success  i wish i could trust him replied cragg doubtfully good night jim  the postman made off in another direction and the old man waited until he had fully disappeared before he walked away over the stones himself josie let him go she did not care to follow him home weary though she was from her long vigil she determined to examine the rocks by daylight before she left the place  the sun was just showing its rim over the hills when she quitted hezekiah craggs five acres of stones and took the lane to the highway but her step was elastic her eyes bright her face smiling  ive found the entrance though i couldnt break in she proudly murmured but a little dynamiteor perhaps a few blows of an axe will soon remove the barrier this affair however is now too big and too serious for me to handle alone i must have help i think it will amaze dear old dad to know what ive stumbled on this night    chapter xviii doubts and suspicions  mary louise entered her friends room at seven oclock and exclaimed not up yet  josie raised her head drowsily from the pillow  let me sleep till noon she pleaded ive been out all night  and did you learn anything was the eager question  please let me sleep  shall i send you up some breakfast josie  breakfast bah  she rolled over drawing the clothes about her and mary louise softly left the darkened room and went down to breakfast  granpa jim said she thoughtfully buttering her toast do you think its right for josie to be wandering around in the dead of night  he gave her an odd look and smiled  if i remember aright it was one miss mary louise burrows who thrust josie into this vortex of mystery  you didnt answer my question granpa jim  i can imagine no harm to girl or man in being abroad in this peaceful country at night if one has the nerve to undertake it you and i dear prefer our beds josie is wrapped up in the science of criminal investigation and has the enthusiasm of youth to egg her on moreover she is sensible enough to know what is best for her i do not think we need worry over her nightly wanderings which doubtless have an object has she made any important discovery as yet  i believe not said mary louise she has learned enough to be positive that old mr cragg is engaged in some secret occupation of an illegal character but so far she is unable to determine what it is hes a very queer old man it seems but shrewd and clever enough to keep his secret to himself  and how about the disappearance of mr joselyn  were divided in opinion about that said the girl ingua and i both believe mr cragg murdered him but josie isnt sure of it if he did however josie thinks we will find the poor mans grave somewhere under the stones of the river bed there was no grave dug on our grounds that is certain  colonel hathaway regarded her seriously  i am sorry mary louise he remarked that we ever decided to mix in this affair i did not realize when first you proposed having josie here that the thing might become so tragic  it has developed under investigation you see she replied but i am not very sure of josies ability because she is not very sure of it herself she dare not even yet advance a positive opinion unless she learned something last night she is still groping in the dark  we must give her time said the colonel  we have accomplished some good however continued the girl ingua is much happier and more content she is improving in her speech and manners and is growing ambitious to become a respectable and refined young lady she doesnt often give way to temper as she used to do on every occasion and i am sure if she could be removed from her grandfathers evil influence she would soon develop in a way to surprise us all  does her grandfathers influence seem to be evil then asked the colonel  he has surrounded her with privations if not with actual want said she only the night before last he was in such a violent rage that he tried to smash everything in the house that is surely an evil example to set before the child who has a temper of her own perhaps inherited from him he has however bought her a new dressthe first one she has had in more than a yearso perhaps the old man at times relents toward his granddaughter and tries to atone for his shortcomings  granpa jim was thoughtful for a time  perhaps he presently remarked mr cragg has but little money to buy dresses with i do not imagine that a man so well educated as you report him to be would prefer to live in a hovel if he could afford anything better  if he is now poor what has he done with all his money demanded mary louise  that is a part of the mystery isnt it do you know my dear i cant help having a kindly thought for this poor man perhaps because he is a grandfather and has a granddaughterjust as i have  he doesnt treat her in the same way granpa jim said she with a loving look toward the handsome old colonel  and there is a perceptible difference between ingua and mary louise he added with a smile  they were to have inguas dress fitted by miss huckins that morning and as josie was fast asleep mary louise went across to the cottage to go with the girl on her errand to her surprise she found old mr cragg sitting upon his little front porch quite motionless and with his arms folded across his chest he stared straight ahead and was evidently in deep thought this was odd because he was usually at his office an hour or more before this time  mary louise hesitated whether to advance or retreat she had never as yet come into personal contact with inguas grandfather and suspecting him of many crimes she shrank from meeting him now but she was herself in plain sight before she discovered his presence and it would be fully as embarrassing to run away as to face him boldly moreover through the open doorway she could see ingua passing back and forth in the kitchen engaged in her customary housework so on she came  mr cragg had not seemed to observe her at first but as she now approached the porch he rose from his chair and bowed with a courtly grace that astonished her in many ways his dignified manners seemed to fit his colonial costume  you will find ingua inside i believe he said  ii am mary louise burrows  again he bowed  i am glad to meet you miss burrows and i am glad that you and ingua are getting acquainted he rejoined in even well modulated tones she has not many friends and her association with you will be sure to benefit her  mary louise was so amazed that she fairly gasped  ii like ingua she said were going into town to have her new dress tried on this morning  he nodded and resumed his chair his unexpected politeness gave her courage  its going to be a pretty dress she continued and if only she had a new hat to go with it ingua would have a nice outfit she needs new shoes though as an afterthought and perhaps a few other little thingslike stockings and underwear  he was silent wholly unresponsive to her suggestion  iid like to buy them for her myself went on the girl in a wistful tone only ingua is so proud that she wont accept gifts from me  still he remained silent  i wonder she said with obvious hesitation if you would allow me to give you the things sir and then you give them to ingua as if they came from yourself  no it was a veritable explosion so fierce that she started back in terror then he rose from his chair abruptly quitted the porch and walked down the path toward the bridge in his accustomed deliberate dignified manner  ingua overhearing his ejaculation came to the open window to see what had caused it  oh its you mary louise is it she exclaimed thank goodness youve drove grandad off to the office i thought hed planted himself in that chair for the whole day  are you ready to go to miss huckins asked mary louise  i will be in a few minutes grandad was late gettn up this mornin and that put things back he had the wakes agin last night  oh did he walk out then  got back at about daylight and went to bed thats why he slep so late  mary louise reflected that in such a case josie ought to have some news to tell her she answered inguas inquiries after josie by saying she was engaged this morning and would not go to town with them so presently the two girls set off together mary louise was much better qualified to direct the making of the new dress than was josie and she gave miss huckins some hints on modern attire that somewhat astonished the country dressmaker but were gratefully received there was no question but that mary louise was stylishly if simply dressed on all occasions and so miss huckins was glad to follow the young girls advice  they were in the dressmakers shop a long time fitting and planning and when at length they came down the stairs they saw sol jerrems standing in his door and closely scrutinizing through his big horn spectacles something he held in his hand as mary louise wished to make a slight purchase at the store she approached the proprietor who said in a puzzled tone of voice  i dunno what t say to you folks cause im up in the air this money may be genooine but it looks to me like a counterfeit and he held up a new tendollar bill  i want a roll of tape please said mary louise i hope your money is good mr jerrems but its value cannot interest us  i dunno bout that he replied looking hard at ingua ol swallertail gimme this bill not ten minutes ago an said as his grandarter was to buy whatever she liked as fur as the money would go that order was so queer that it made me suspicious see here a few days ago ol cragg bought ingua a dressan paid for it by guman now he wants her t git ten dollars wuth o shoes an things dont that look mighty strange  why asked mary louise  cause its the first money hes spent on the kid since i kin remember an hes allus talkin poverty an says how hell die in the poorhouse if prices keep goin up as they hev durin the furrin war thats now hummin acrost the water if hes that poor an on a sudden springs a tendollar bill on me for fixins fer his kid theres sure somethin wrong somewhere i got stuck on a bill jus like this a year ago an i aint goin to let any goods go till i find out for sure whether its real money or not  when can you find out inquired mary louise  tomorrer theres a drummer due here fm the citya feller keen as a razorwholl know in a minute if the bill is a counterfeit if he says its good then ingua kin trade it out but i aint goin to take no chances  ingua came close to the storekeeper her face dark with passion  come said mary louise taking the childs arm let us go home i am sure mr jerrems is over particular and that the money is all right but we can wait until tomorrow easily come ingua  the child went reluctantly much preferring to vent her indignation on old sol mary louise tried to get her mind off the insult  well have the things all right ingua she said wasnt it splendid in your grandfather to be so generous when he has so little money to spend and the ten dollars will fit you up famously i wish though she added there was another or a better store at the crossing at which to trade  well there aint observed ingua so we hev to put up with that sol jerrems when i tell grandad about this business i bet hell punch sol jerrems nose  dont tell him advised mary louise  why not  i think he gave this money to mr jerrems on a sudden impulse perhaps if there is any question about its being genuine he will take it back and you will lose the value of it better wait until tomorrow when of course the drummer will pronounce it all right my opinion is that mr jerrems is so unused to new ten dollar bills that having one makes him unjustly suspicious  i guess yer right said ingua more cheerfully its amazin that grandad loosened up at all an he might repent like you say an take the money back so ill be like ol solill take no chances    chapter xix good money for bad  at luncheon josie appeared at the table fresh as ever and mary louise began to relate to her and to her grandfather the occurrences of the morning when she came to tell how sol jerrems had declared the money counterfeit josie suddenly sprang up and swung her napkin around her head shouting gleefully  glory hallelujah ive got him ive trapped old swallowtail at last  they looked at her in amazement  what do you mean asked mary louise  josie sobered instantly  forgive me she said im ashamed of myself go on with the story what became of that counterfeit bill  mr jerrems has it yet he is keeping it to show to a commercial traveler who is to visit his store tomorrow if the man declares the money is good then ingua may buy her things  we wont bother the commercial traveler said josie in a tone of relief im going straight down to the store to redeem that bill i want it in my possession  colonel hathaway regarded her gravely  i think our female detective having said so much and having exhibited such remarkable elation must now explain her discoveries to us more fully said he  id rather not just yet protested josie but what have i said in my madness and what did my words imply  from the little i know of this case replied the colonel i must judge that you believe mr cragg to be a counterfeiter and that his mysterious business isto counterfeit in this outoftheway place he continued thoughtfully such a venture might be carried on for a long time without detection yet there is one thing that to me forbids this theory  what is that sir  a counterfeiter must of necessity have confederates and mr cragg seems quite alone in the conduct of his mysterious business  josie smiled quite contentedly confederates last nights discoveries had proved that old swallowtail had two of these at least  please dont lisp a word of this suspicion at present she warned her friends if i am rightand i have no doubt of thatwe are about to uncover a farreaching conspiracy to defraud the government but the slightest hint of danger would enable them to escape and i want the credit of putting this gang of desperadoes behind the bars really id no idea when i began the investigation that it would lead to anything so important i thought at first it might be a simple murder case simple because the commonest people commit murder and to the detective the deed is more revolting than exciting but we may dismiss the murder suspicion entirely  oh indeed what about ned joselyns mysterious disappearance asked mary louise  joselyn he disappeared for a purpose answered josie i saw him last nightmonocle and allacting as old craggs confederate ned joselyn is one of those i hope to land in prison  her hearers seemed quite bewildered by this positive statement  where were you last night inquired mary louise  at that five acres of stones we once visited which is mr craggs private property hidden somewhere in the hillside is a cavern and in that cavern the counterfeit money is made i have heard the printingpress turning it out in quantity i saw ned joselyn come away with a package of the manufactured bills and heard old swallowtail implore him  to play square with the proceeds there was another of the gang present also a man whom i had considered quite an innocent citizen of craggs crossing until i discovered him with the others i think it was he who operated the press it has been a very pretty plot a cleverly conducted plot and it has been in successful operation for years but the gang is in the toils just now and little redheaded josie ogorman is going to score a victory that will please her detective daddy mightily josie was surely elated when she ventured to boast in this manner the others were duly impressed  you dont mean to arrest those men alone do you josie asked the colonel somewhat anxiously  no indeed im not yet quite ready to spring my trap she replied when the time comes i must have assistance but i want to get all my evidence shipshape before i call on the secret service to make the capture i cant afford to bungle so important a thing you know and this ten dollar bill so carelessly given the storekeeper is going to put one powerful bit of evidence in my hands that was a bad slip on old craggs part for he has been very cautious in covering his tracks until now but i surmise that mary louises pleading for ingua this morning touched his pride and having no real money at hand he ventured to give the storekeeper a counterfeit and old sol having been caught by a counterfeit once beforei wonder if old swallowtail gave him that one toobecame suspicious of the newness of the bill and so played directly into our hands so now if youll excuse me ill run to town without further delay i wont rest easy until that bill is in my possession  ill go with you said mary louise eagerly  half an hour later the two girls entered the store and found the proprietor alone mary louise made a slight purchase as an excuse and then josie laid ten silver dollars on the counter and said carelessly  will you give me a ten dollar bill for this silver mr jerrems i want to send it away in a letter  sure id ruther hev the change than the bill he answered taking out his wallet but i wouldnt send so much money in a letter if i was you better buy a postoffice order  i know my business she pertly replied watching him unroll the leather wallet no dont give me that old bill id rather have the new one on top  that new one said he i dont blieve is good looks like a counterfeit to me  lets see it proposed josie taking the bill in her hand and scrutinizing it i can tell a counterfeit a mile away no this is all right ill take it she decided  yer like to git stung if ye do he warned her  ill take my chances said josie folding the bill and putting it in her purse youve got good money for it anyhow so youve no kick coming that i can see  why that must be the bill mr cragg gave you mary louise said to the storekeeper as if she had just recognized it  it is admitted sol  then ingua can now buy her outfit  any time she likes he said but i want it reglar understood that the sewingirl cant bring the money back to me if she finds it bad i aint sure its bad ye know but ive warned her an now its her lookout  of course it is agreed josie but dont worry the bill is good as gold i wish i had a hundred like it  on their way home josie stopped to call on ingua while mary louise at her friends request went on  ive two important things to tell you josie announced to the child one is that you neednt worry any more about ned joselyns being dead a girl whom i know well has lately seen him alive and in good health so whatever your grandfathers crimes may have been he is not a murderer  ingua was astounded after a moment she gasped out  how dye know who was the girl are ye sure it were ned joselyn  quite sure he has probably been in hiding for some reason but you mustnt tell a soul about this ingua especially your grandfather it is part of the secret between us and thats the reason i have told you  ingua still stared as if bewildered  who was the girl she whispered  i cant tell you her name but you may depend upon the truth of her statement just the same  and shes sure it were ned joselyn she saw  isnt he tall and thin with a light moustache and curly hair and doesnt he wear a glass in one eye  with a string to it yes thats him sure enough whered she see him  dont ask me questions its a part of the girls secret you know she let me tell you this much so that you wouldnt worry any longer over the horror of that winter night when your grandfather went to the kenton house and joselyn disappeared i think ingua that the man is crooked and mixed up with a lot of scoundrels who ought to be in jail  ingua nodded her head  grandad told him he was crooked she affirmed i dont say as grandad is a saint josie but he aint crooked like nedye kin bank on thatcause hes a cragg an the craggs is squaretoes even when theyre chillins  josie smiled at this quaint speech she was sorry for poor ingua whose stalwart belief in the cragg honesty was doomed to utter annihilation when her grandsire was proved to have defrauded the government by making counterfeit money but this was no time to undeceive the child so she said  the other bit of news is that sol jerrems has traded the bill which he thought was bad for good money so you can buy your things any time you please  then it wasnt counterfeit  i saw it myself ive lived in the city so long that no one can fool me with counterfeit money i can tell it in two looks ingua so id rather have a nice new bill than ten clumsy silver dollars and i made the trade myself  whered ye get so much money josie  my wages i dont do much work but i get paid regularly once a week  she didnt explain that her father made her a weekly allowance but ingua was satisfied  what do you think i orter buy with that money josie i need so many things that its hard to tell where to begin and where to leave off  lets make a list then and figure it out  this occupied them some time and proved a very fascinating occupation to the poor girl who had never before had so much money to spend at one time  i owe it all to mary louise she said gratefully as josie rose to depart it seems like no one can refuse mary louise anything when she asked me to be more careful in my speech didnt i do better i slips now an then but ims always tryin and she tackled grandad if you or meor ihad asked grandad for that money josie wed never a got it in a thousan years why do you spose mary louise gits into people the way she does  its personality i suppose answered josie thoughtfully and then realizing that ingua might not understand that remark she added theres no sham about mary louise shes so simple and sweet that she wins hearts without any effort you and i have natures so positive on the contrary that we seem always on the aggressive and that makes folks hold aloof from us or even oppose us  i wish i was like mary louise said ingua with a sigh  i dont declared josie we cant all be alike you know and id rather push ahead and get a few knocks on the way then have a clear path and no opposition    chapter xx an unexpected appearance  for a week it was very quiet at craggs crossing the only ripple of excitement was caused by the purchase of inguas new outfit in this the child was ably assisted by mary louise and josie indeed finding the younger girl so ignorant of prices and even of her own needs the two elder ones entered into a conspiracy with old sol and slyly added another ten dollars to inguas credit the result was that she carried home not only shoes and a new hattrimmed by miss huckins without cost the material being furnished from the fundbut a liberal supply of underwear ribbons collars and hosiery and even a pair of silk gloves which delighted the childs heart more than anything else  miss huckins new dress proved very pretty and becoming and with all her wealth of apparel ingua was persuaded to dine with mary louise at the kenton house on saturday evening the hour was set for seven oclock in order to allow the girl to prepare her grandfathers supper before going out and the first intimation old swallowtail had of the arrangement was when he entered the house saturday evening and found ingua arrayed in all her finery  he made no remark at first but looked at her more than oncewhether approvingly or not his stolid expression did not betray when the girl did not sit down to the table and he observed she had set no place for herself he suddenly said  well  im goin to eat with the hathaways tonight she replied their dinner aint ready till seven oclock so if ye hurry a little i kin wash the dishes afore i go  he offered no objection indeed he said nothing at all until he had finished his simple meal then as she cleared the table he said  it might be well while you are in the society of mary louise and colonel hathaway to notice their method of speech and try to imitate it  whats wrong with my talk she demanded she was annoyed at the suggestion because she had been earnestly trying to imitate mary louises speech  i will leave you to make the discovery yourself he said dryly  she tossed her dishes into the hot water rather recklessly  if i orter talk diffrent said she its your fault ye haint give me no schooling ner nothn ye dont even say six words a week to me im just your slave to make yer bed an cook yer meals an wash yer dishes gee howd ye spose id talk like a lady  i think he quietly responded you picked up your slang from your mother who however had some education the education ruined her for the quiet life here and she plunged into the world to get the excitement she craved hasnt she been sorry for it many times ingua  i dont know much bout marm an i dont care whether shes sorry or not but i do know i need an eddication if mary louise hadnt had no eddication shed a been just like me a bit o junk on a scrapheap that aint no good to itself ner anybody else  he mused silently for a while getting up finally and walking over to the door  your peculiarities of expression he then remarked as if more to himself than to the child are those we notice in sol jerrems and joe brennan and mary ann hopper they are characteristic of the rural population which having no spur to improve its vocabulary naturally grows degenerate in speech  she glanced at him half defiantly not sure whether he was pokin fun at her or not  if you mean i talks country talk said she youre right why shouldnt i with no one to tell me better  again he mused his mood was gentle this evening  i realize i have neglected you he presently said you were thrust upon me like a stray kitten which one does not want but cannot well reject your mother has not supplied me with money for your education although she has regularly paid for your keep  she has cried ingua astounded then youve swindled her an me both for i pays for moren my keep in hard work my keep for the love o mike what does my keep amount to a cent a year  he winced a little at her sarcasm but soon collected himself strangely enough he did not appear to be angry with her  ive neglected you he repeated but it has been an oversight i have had so much on my mind that i scarcely realized you were here i forgot you are nans child and that youyou needed attention  ingua put on her new hat looking into a cracked mirror  ye might a remembered im a cragg anyhow said she mollified by his tone of self reproach an ye might a remembered as youre a cragg the craggs orter help each other cause all the worlds agin em  he gave her an odd look in which pride perplexity and astonishment mingled  and you are going into the enemys camp tonight  oh mary louise is all right she aint like them other snippy girls that sometimes comes here to the big houses she dont care if i am a cragg or if i talks country i like mary louise  when she had gone the old man sat in deep thought for a long time the summer evening cast shadows twilight fell darkness gradually shrouded the bare little room still he sat in his chair staring straight ahead into the gloom and thinking  then the door opened shifting his eyes he discovered a dim shadow in the opening whoever it was stood motionless until a low clear voice asked sharply  anybody home  he got up then and shuffled to a shelf where he felt for a kerosene lamp and lighted it  come in nan he said without turning around as he stooped over the lamp and adjusted the wick  the yellow light showed a young woman standing in the doorway a woman of perhaps thirtyfive she was tall erect her features well formed her eyes bright and searching her walkingsuit was neat and modish and fitted well her graceful rounded form on her arm was a huge basket which she placed upon a chair as she advanced into the room and closed the door behind her  so youve come back remarked old swallowtail standing before her and regarding her critically  a selfevident fact dad she answered lightly removing her hat wheres ingua  at a dinner party across the river  thats good is she well  what do you care nan whether she is well or not  if shes at a dinner party i neednt worry forgive the foolish question dad brennan promised to bring my suit case over in the morning i lugged the basket myself  whats in the basket  food unless youve changed your mode of living the cupboards pretty bare and this is saturday night i can sleep on that heartbreaking husk mattress with ingua but ill be skinned if i eat your salt junk and corn pone forewarned is forearmed i brought my own grub  as she spoke she hung her hat and coat on some pegs turned the lamp a little higher and then pausing with hands on hips she looked inquisitively at her father  you seem pretty husky for your age she continued with a hard little laugh  youve been prospering nan  yes sitting in a chair and crossing her legs ive found my forte at last for three years nearly ive been employed by the secret service department at washington  ah  ive made good my record as a woman sleuth is excellent i make more money in a weekwhen im workingthan you do in a year unless she paused abruptly and gave him a queer look  unless its true that youre coining money in a way thats not legal  he stood motionless before her reading her face she returned his scrutiny with interest neither resumed the conversation for a time finally the old man sank back into his chair  a female detective said he a little bitterly is stilla female  and likewise a detective i know more about you dad than you think she asserted in an easy composed tone that it seemed impossible to disturb you need looking after just at this juncture and as ive been granted a vacation i ran up here to look after you  in what way nan  well talk that over later there isnt much love lost between us mores the pity youve always thought more of your infernal cause than of your daughter but were craggs both of us and its the cragg custom to stand by the family  it struck him as curious that ingua had repeated almost those very words earlier that same evening he had never taught them the cragg motto stand fast that he could remember yet both nan and her child were loyal to the code was he loyal too had he stood by nan in the past and ingua in the present as a cragg should do  his face was a bit haggard as he sat in his chair and faced his frankspoken daughter whose clear eyes did not waver before his questioning gaze  i know what youre thinking said she that ive never been much of a daughter to you well neither have you been much of a father to me ever since i was born and my unknown motherlucky souldied youve been obsessed by an idea which lofty and altruistic as you may have considered it has rendered you selfcentered cold and inconsiderate of your own flesh and blood then theres that devilish temper of yours to contend with i couldnt stand the life here i wandered away and goodness knows how i managed to live year after year in a struggle with the world rather than endure your society and the hardships you thrust upon me youve always had money yet not a cent would you devote to your family you lived like a dog and wanted me to do the same and i wouldnt finally i met a good man and married him he wasnt rich but he was generous when he died i was thrown on my own resources again with a child of my own to look after circumstances forced me to leave ingua with you while i hunted for work i found it im a detective wellknown and respected in my profession  im glad to know you are prosperous he said gently as she paused he made no excuses he did not contradict her accusations he waited to hear her out  so said nan in a careless offhand tone ive come here to save you youre in trouble  i am not aware of it  very true if you were the danger would be less ive always had to guess at most of your secret life i knew you were sly and secretive i didnt know until now that youve been crooked  he frowned a little but made no retort  it doesnt surprise me however she continued a good many folks are crooked at times and the only wonder is that a clever man like you has tripped and allowed himself to fall under suspicion suspicion leads to investigationwhen its followed upand investigation in such cases leads tojail  he gave a low growl that sounded like the cry of an enraged beast and gripped the arms of his chair fiercely then he rose and paced the room with frantic energy nan watched him with a half smile on her face when he had finally mastered his wrath and became more quiet she said  dont worry dad i said i have come to save you it will be fun after working for the government so long to work against it theres a certain redheaded imp in this neighborhood who is the daughter of our assistant chief john ogorman her name is josie ogorman and shes in training for the same profession of which im an ornament i wont sneer at her for shes clever in a way but id like to show ogorman that nan shelleythats my name in washingtonis a little more clever than his pet this josie ogorman is staying with the hathaway family shes been probing your secret life and business enterprises and has unearthed an important clew in which the department is bound to be interested so she sent a code telegram to ogorman who left it on his desk long enough for me to decipher and read it i dont know what the assistant chief will do about it for i left washington an hour later and came straight to you what i do know is that im in time to spike miss josies guns which will give me a great deal of pleasure she doesnt know im your daughter any more than ogorman does so if the girl sees me here shell imagine im on government business but i want to keep out of her way for a time do you know the girl dad  yes he said  shes rather clever  yes  i think shed have nabbed you presently if i hadnt taken hold of the case so promptly myself with our start and the exercise of a grain of intelligence we can baffle any opposition the girl can bring to bear do you wish to run away  no he growled  im glad of that i like the excitement of facing danger boldly but theres ample time to talk over details i see youve had your supper so ill just fry myself a beefsteak  she opened her basket and began to prepare a meal old swallowtail sat and watched her presently he smiled grimly and nan never noticed the expression perhaps had she done so she would have demanded an explanation he rarely smiled and certainly his daughters disclosures were not calculated to excite mirth or even to amuse    chapter xxi a case of nerves  the hotel at the crossing was not an imposing affair indeed had there not been an office in the front room with a wooden desk in one corner six chairs and two boxes of sawdust to serve as cuspidors the building might easily have been mistaken for a private residence but it stood on the corner opposite the store and had a worn and scarcely legible sign over the front door calling it a hotel in capital letters  the hoppers who operated the establishment did an excellent business on week days the farmers who came to town to trade made it a point to eat one of silas hoppers twentyfive cent dinners famous for at least five miles around for profusion and good cookery on sundaysand sometimes on other daysan automobile party touring the country would stop at the hotel for a meal and mrs hopper was accustomed to have a chicken dinner prepared every sunday in the hope of attracting a stray tourist there were two guest rooms upstairs that were religiously reserved in case some patron wished to stay overnight but these instances were rare unless a drummer missed his train and couldnt get away from the crossing until the next day  the sunday following the arrival of inguas mother in town proved a dull day with the hoppers who had been compelled to eat their chicken dinner themselves in default of customers the dishes had been washed and mary ann the daughter of the house was sitting on the front porch in her sunday gown and a rockingchair when an automobile drove up to the door and a dapper little man alighted he was very elaborately dressed with silk hat patentleather shoes and a cane setting off his prince albert coat and lavender striped trousers across his white waistcoat was a heavy gold watchguard with an enormous locket dangling from it he had a sparkling pin in his checkered neckscarf that might be set with diamonds but perhaps wasnt on his fingers gleamed two or three elaborate rings he had curly blond hair and a blond moustache and he wore goldrimmed eyeglasses altogether the little man was quite a dandy and radiated prosperity so when the driver of the automobile handed out two heavy suit cases and received from the stranger a crisp bill for his services mary ann hopper realized with exultation that the hotel was to have a guest  as the car which had brought him rolled away the little man turned observed mary ann and removing his silt hat bowed low  i presume said he in precise accents that this town is that of craggs crossing and that this building is the hotel am i correct in the surmise  ill call pa said mary ann somewhat embarrassed drummers she could greet with unconcern but this important individual was a man of a different sort his brilliant personality dazzled her  mr hopper came out in his shirtsleeves gave one look at his customer and put on his coat  goin to stay sir he asked  for a time if i like the accommodations was the reply i am in need of perfect quiet my doctor says i must court tranquility to avoid a nervous breakdown i do not know your town i do not know your hotel i hired a man in the city to drive me until i came to a quiet place he assured me on the way that this is a quiet place  i dunno him said hopper but he didnt put up no bluff if ye can find a quieter place ner this outside a graveyard ill board ye fer nothn  i thank you for your assurance sir can you show me to the best room you can place at my disposal  had dinner  i thank you yes i am weary from the long ride i will lie down for an hour then i will take my usual walk when i return i would like an omelet with mushroomsi suppose you have no trufflesfor my evening meal  the landlord grinned and picked up the suit cases  were jest out o truffles an were out o mushrooms he said but were long on eggs an ye can have em omeletted or fried or biled as it suits yer fancy sophies best hold is cookin eggs sophies my wife ye know an there aint no better cook in seven counties so the drummers say  as he spoke he entered the house and led the way up the stairs  thank you thank you said the stranger i am glad your good wife is an experienced cook kindly ask her to spare no expense in preparing my meals i am willing to pay liberally for what i receive  this room with board remarked hopper setting down the suit cases in the front corner bedchamber will cost you a dollar a day or five dollars a weekif you eat our reglar meals if ye keep callin fer extrys ill hev to charge ye extry  very reasonable very reasonable indeed declared the stranger taking a roll of bills from his pocket as i am at present unknown to you i beg you to accept this fivedollar bill in advance and now if you will bring me a pitcher of icewater i will take my needed siesta my nerves as you may have observed are at somewhat of a tension today  were out o ice remarked the landlord pocketing the money but yell find plenty of good cold water at the pump in the back yard anything else sir  i thank you no i am not thirsty icewater is not necessary to my happiness you will pardon me if i ask to be left alonewith my nerves  hopper went away chuckling his wife and mary ann were both at the foot of the stairs lying in wait to question him  that fellers as good as a circus he asserted taking off his coat again and lighting his corncob pipe hes got nerves an money an hes come here to git rid of em both  who is he demanded mrs hopper  by gum i fergot to ask him i got thanked fer evrything i did an evrything i couldnt do an ive got five dollars o his money in my jeans as a evidence o good faith the whole performance sort o knocked me out  no wonder asserted his wife sympathetically  ill bet hes some punkins though declared mary ann an hell be a godsend to us after a dull week only remember this if he kicks on the feed he dont git no satisfaction out o me  i dont think hell kick on anything said her father he wants eggs for his supper in a omelet  he couldnt want anything thats cheaper to make said mrs hopper the hens are layin fine jus now  when he comes down make him register suggested mary ann if ye dont we wont know what ter call him  ill call him an easy mark whatever his name is said the landlord grinning at his own attempt at wit  the stranger kept his room until five oclock then he came down spick and span his cane under his arm upon his hands a pair of bright yellow kid gloves  i will now indulge in my walk said he addressing the family group in the office my nerves are better but still vibrant i shall be further restored on my return  jest sign the register proposed hopper pointing to a worn and soiled book spread upon the counter hate to trouble ye but its one o the rules o my hotel  no trouble thank you no trouble at all responded the stranger and drawing a fountainpen from his pocket he approached the register and wrote upon the blank page i hope there is nothing to see in your town he remarked turning away i dont wish to see anything i merely desire to walk  yer wishll come true i guess said hopper ive lived here over twenty year an i haint seen nothn yet but the walkin is as good as it is anywhere  thank you i shall return at six oclockfor the omelet and he walked away with short mincing steps that seemed to them all very comical  three heads at once bent over the register on which the stranger had i written in clear delicate characters lysander antonius sinclair b n boston mass  i wonder what the b n stands for said mary ann hopper curiously  bum nerves o course replied the landlord hes got em sure enough    chapter xxii inguas mother  and how do you like your grandfather is he good to you asked mrs scammel on sunday forenoon as she sat on the porch beside her small daughter old swallowtail did not usually go to his office on sundays but kept his room at the cottage and wrote letters today however he had wandered down the path and disappeared and nan and ingua were both glad to see him go  no answered the child to both questions  you dont like him  how can i when he jes sets an glares at me evry time he comes into the housecept when he complains i aint doin my work proper it were a sort o mean trick o yours marm leavin me here to slave fer that ol man while you was off in the cities havin a good time  yes said nan i was frolicking with starvation until i got a job and it was the sort of job that wouldnt allow having a child around but since ive been making money ive sent dad five dollars every week for your clothes and board  you have  every week  ten cents a week would pay for all the grub he gives me an there aint a beggar in the county that sports the rags an tatters i does that new dress i had on las night was the first thing in clothes hes bought me for a year and i guess i wouldnt have had that if mary louise hadnt told him he orter dress me more decent  nans brow grew dark  ill have it out with him for that she promised what does he do with his money ingua  salts it i guess i never see him have any its one o the mysteries marm mysteries is thick aroun grandad an folks suspicion most anything about him all i know is that he aint no spendthrift once when ned joselyn used to come here there was lots of money passed between em i saw it myself i helped pick it up once when they quarreled an upset the table an spilled things but since ned run ayray grandads ben more savin than ever  ingua said nan thoughtfully i want you to tell me all you know about ned joselyn from the time he first came here  ingua regarded her mother with serious eyes  all she inquired  everything little or big that you can recollect  youll stick to grandad wont ye  thats what im here for there are enemies on his trail and i mean to save him  whats he done  ive got to find that out when i was here before i knew he had some secret interest to which he was devoted but i was too indifferent to find out what it was now i want to know if im going to save him from the penalties of his crime i must know what the crime is i think this man joselyn is mixed up with it in some way so go ahead and tell me all you know about him  ingua obeyed for more than an hour she earnestly related the story of ned joselyn only pausing to answer an occasional question from her mother when she came to that final meeting at christmas week and joselyns mysterious disappearance nan asked  do you think he killed him  i was pretty sure of it till yestday when josie told me a friend of hers had seen him alive an well  josie ogorman  no josie jessup shes the sewingirl over to mary louises  i know but that girl has more names than one do you know her very well ingua  shes my best chum declared the child josies a dandy girl an i like her  have you told her anything about your grandad  a little ingua admitted hesitating  see here said nan scowling ill put you wise this redheaded josie ogorman is a detective shes the daughter of the man i work for in washingtonthe assistant chief of the departmentand she is here to try to land your grandad in jail whats more ingua shes likely to do it unless you and i find a way to head her off  inguas face depicted astonishment grief disappointment finally she said  grandad didnt murder ned for josie herself told me so so i cant see what hes done to go to jail for  he has counterfeited money said nan in a low voice  grandad has  so they say and i believe it may be true josie has wired her father that shes got the goods on old swallowtail and has asked that somebody be sent to arrest him i saw the telegram and made up my mind id get the start of the ogormans dad wont run away ive warned him they are on his trail and he didnt make any reply but i wouldnt be surprised if hes gone this very day to cover up his traces hes bright enough to know that if he destroys all evidence they cant prove anything against him  she spoke musingly more to herself than the child beside her but ingua drew a deep sigh and remarked  then its all right grandad is slick theyll hev to get up early in the mornin to beat him at his own game but i wonder what he does with the counterfeit money or the real money he trades it for  i think i know said her mother hes chucked a fortune into one crazy idea in which his life has been bound up ever since i can remember and i suppose he tried counterfeiting to get more money to chuck away in the same foolish manner  what crazy idea is that inquired ingua  ill tell you sometime just now i see your friend josie coming and thats a bit of good luck im anxious to meet her but if she sees me first she wont come on as she spoke she rose swiftly and disappeared into the house stay where you are ingua she called from within in a low voice i dont want her to escape  josie was even now making her way across the steppingstones presently she ran up the bank smiling and plumped down beside ingua  top o the morning to you said she how did you enjoy your first evening in society  they were all very good to me replied ingua slowly looking at her friend with troubled eyes i had a nice time but  you were a little shy said josie but that was only natural when you get better acquainted with mary louise and the dear old colonel youll  she stopped abruptly for looking up she saw standing in the doorway nan shelleyby which name she knew herwho was calmly regarding her the shock of surprise for shock it surely was seemed brief for almost instantly josie completed her broken speech  when you know them better youll feel quite at home in their society hello nan  what josie ogorman you here with wellaffected surprise  you know it but how came you here nan has daddy sent you to help me  help you in what way  help me enjoy country life said josie coloring at her slip  why im on a vacation you dont seem to understand iminguas mother  josies selfcontrol wasnt proof against this second shock her blue eyes stared amazed with a low exclamation she stood up and faced the woman  inguas mother you nan  just so with a quiet smile  then you ought to be ashamed of yourself declared josie with righteous indignation youre one of the best paid women in the department and youve left your poor child here to starve and slave for a wretched old she paused  well what is he asked nan with tantalizing gentleness  an old skinflint at the least shame on you nan ingua is a dear little girl and youyoure an unnatural mother why i never suspected you were even married  im a widow josie  and old swallowtail is your father how strange butwhy did you come here just now with sudden suspicion  ive just finished the hillyard case and they gave me a vacation so i came here to see my little girl i didnt know she was being neglected josie i shall take better care of her after this my visit to craggs crossing is perfectly natural for i was born here but you what are you up to josie  im visiting mary louise burrows  with what object  a detective must be quickwitted josies brain was working with lightninglike rapidity in a few brief seconds she comprehended that if nan was old swallowtails daughter home on a vacation she must not be allowed to know that josie was conducting a case against her father otherwise she might interfere and spoil everything she knew nan of old and respected her keen intelligence once when they had been pitted against each other josie had won but she was not sure she could defeat nan a second time therefore it was imperative that old craggs daughter remain in ignorance of the fact that josie was awaiting reinforcements from washington in order to arrest nans father as a counterfeiter also josie realized instantly that ingua was likely to tell her mother all she knew about joselyn including the story she had told josie so without hesitation she answered nans question with apparent frankness  really nan i came here on a wildgoose chase a man named ned joselyn had mysteriously disappeared and his wife feared he had met with foul play i traced him to this place and as colonel hathaway and mary louise were living herein mrs joselyns own house by the way i had myself invited as their guest well the long and short of it is that joselyn isnt murdered after all he simply skipped and since i came here to worry my poor brain over the fellow he has been discovered still in hiding but very much alive  you suspected my father of killing him  i did and so did others but it seems he didnt but even with that precious bubble burst mary louise insists on my staying for a visit so here i am and your little girl has become my friend  ingua knew this story to be quite correct as far as it regarded her grandfather and ned joselyn its straightforward relation renewed her confidence in josie but nan knew more than josie thought she did having intercepted the girls telegram to her father so she said with a slight sneer which she took no pains to conceal  youre a clever girl josie ogorman a mighty clever girl youre so clever that i wouldnt be surprised if it tripped you some day and landed you on your pug nose  which proved that nan was not clever for josies indulgent smile masked the thought she knows all and is here to defend her father i must look out for nan for she has a notion im still on the track of hezekiah cragg    chapter xxiii peculiar people  old swallowtail came home at about four oclock in the afternoon the day was hot yet the old man seemed neither heated nor wearied without a word to his daughter or ingua he drew a chair to the little shady porch and sat down in their company nan was mending her childs old frock ingua sat thinking  for half an hour perhaps silence was maintained by all then nan turned and asked  have you covered your tracks  he turned his glassy expressionless eyes toward her  my tracks as you call them said he have been laid for forty years or more they are now ruts i cannot obliterate them in a day  the woman studied his face thoughtfully  you are not worrying over your probable arrest  no  then its all right said she relieved youre a foxy old rascal dad and youve held your own for a good many years i guess you dont need more than a word of warning  he made no reply his eyes wandering along the path to the bridge mary louise was coming their way walking briskly her steps slowed a bit as she drew nearer but she said in an eager voice  oh mrs scammel josie has told me you are here and who you are isnt it queer how lives get tangled up but i remember you with gratitude and kindliest thoughts because you were so considerate of my dear granpa jim and to think that you are really inguas mother  nan rose and took the girls hands in her own  i fear ive been a bad mother to my kid she replied but i thought she was all right with her grandfather and happy here i shall look after her better in the future  mary louise bowed to mr cragg who nodded his head in acknowledgment then she sat down beside ingua  are you plannin to take me away from here mama asked the child  wouldnt you rather be with me than with your grandfather returned nan with a smile  i dunno said ingua seriously youre a detective an i dont like detections you aint much like a mother to me neither ner i dont know much about you i dunno yet whether im goin to like you or not  a wave of color swept over nans face mary louise was shocked the old man turned his inscrutable gaze down the path once more  i like it here continued the child musingly grandad makes me work but he dont bother me none cept when the devils get hold o him i member that you git the devils too once in awhile marm an theyre about as fierce as grandads is an i gets em cause im a cragg like the rest o you an devils seem to be in the cragg blood ive a notion its easier to stand the devils in the country here than in the city where you live  nan didnt know whether to be amused or angry  yet you tried to run away once she reminded ingua and it was mary louise who stopped you you told me of this only an hour ago  didnt i say the devils pick on me sometimes demanded the girl an mary louise was right she fought the devils for me and im glad she did cause ive had a good time with her ever since and she pressed mary louises hand gratefully  her childs frankness was indeed humiliating to nan scammel who was by no means a bad woman at heart and longed to win the love and respect of her little girl inguas frank speech had also disturbed mary louise and made her sorry for both the child and her mother old swallowtails eyes lingered a moment on inguas ingenuous countenance but he exhibited no emotion whatever  youre a simple little innocent remarked nan to ingua after a strained pause you know so little of the world that your judgment is wholly unformed ive a notion to take you to washington and buy you a nice outfit of clotheslike those of mary louise you knowand put you into a firstclass girls boardingschool then youll get civilized and perhaps amount to something  id like that said ingua with a first display of enthusiasm but whod look after grandad  why we must provide for dad in some way of course admitted nan after another pause i can afford to hire a woman to keep house for him if i hold my present job i suppose he has a hoard of money hidden somewhere but thats no reason he wouldnt neglect himself and starve if left alone and if hes really poor im the one to help him how does that arrangement strike you ingua  it sounds fine replied the girl but any woman thatd come here to work an would stan grandads devils wouldnt amount to much nohow if were goin to move to the city she added with a sigh lets take grandad with us  this conversation was becoming too personal for mary louise to endure longer they talked of mr cragg just as if he were not present ignoring him as he ignored them with an embarrassed air mary louise rose  i must go now said she i just ran over to welcome you mrs scammel and to ask you and ingua to dine with us tomorrow night will you come josie ogorman is with us you know and i believe you are old friends  nan hesitated a moment  thank you she replied well be glad to come youve been mighty good to my little girl and i am grateful please give my regards to colonel hathaway  when mary louise had gone the three lapsed into silence again ingua was considering in her childish but practical way the proposed changes in her life the mother was trying to conquer her annoyance at the childs lack of filial affection tacitly admitting that the blame was not inguas the old man stared at the path whatever his thoughts might be he displayed no hint of their nature  presently there appeared at the head of the path by the bridge the form of a stranger a little man who came on with nervous mincing steps he was dressed in dandified fashion with tall silk hat a goldheaded cane and yellow kid gloves almost had he reached the porch when suddenly he stopped short looked around in surprise and ejaculated  bless mebless me iive made a mistake this is a private path to your house no thoroughfare dear me what an error an unpardonable error i hope you will excuse meii hope so  to be sure we will replied nan with a laugh curiously eyeing the dapper little man the only way out sir is back by the bridge  thank you thank you very much he said earnestly ii am indulging in a stroll andand my mind wandered as did my feet ii am an invalid in search of rest thank you good afternoon  he turned around and with the same mincing regular steps retreated along the path at the bridge he halted as if undecided but finally continued along the country road past the kenton place  ingua laughed delightedly at the queer man nan smiled old swallowtail had altered neither his position nor his blank expression  hes a queer fish aint he remarked the girl hes pretty lively for an invalid whats lookin for rest i wonder when he landed an where hes stoppin  something in the childs remark made nan thoughtful presently she laid down her work and said  i believe ill take a little walk myself before dark want to go along ingua  ingua was ready she had on her new dress and hoped they might meet someone whom she knew they wandered toward the town where most of the inhabitants were sitting outf of doorsa sunday afternoon custom jim bennett in his shirtsleeves was reading a newspaper in front of the postoffice sol jerrems and his entire family occupied the platform before the store which was of course locked nance milliker was playing the organ in the brown house around the corner and in front of the hotel sat mary ann hopper in her rockingchair  nan strolled the length of the street startling those natives who had formerly known her ingua nodded and smiled at everyone mary ann hopper called as they passed her hullo ingua whered ye git the new duds  miss huckins made em answered ingua proudly  i guess ill go and shake hands with mrs hopper said nan dont you remember me mary ann im nan cragg  gee so yare exclaimed mary ann wonderingly we all spicioned you was dead long ago  im home for a visit you folks seem prosperous hows business  pretty good we got a new boarder today a feller with bum nerves who come from the city gee but hes togged out t kill got money too an aint afraid to spend it he paid dad in advance  thats nice said nan whats his name  its a funny name but i cant remember it ye kin see it on the register  nan went inside leaving ingua with mary ann and studied the name on the register long and closely  no she finally decided lysander isnt calculated to arouse suspicion he wears a wig i know but that is doubtless due to vanity and not a disguise i at first imagined it was someone ogorman had sent down here to help josie but none of our boys would undertake such a spectacular personation bound to attract attention this fellow will become the laughingstock of the whole town and every move he makes will be observed im quite sure there is nothing dangerous in the appearance here of mr lysander antonius sinclair  she chatted a few minutes with mrs hopper whom she found in the kitchen and then she rejoined ingua and started homeward scarcely were mother and child out of sight when mr sinclair came mincing along from an opposite direction and entered the hotel he went to his room but soon came down and in a querulous voice demanded his omelet thanking the landlady again and again for promising it in ten minutes  he amused them all very much stating that an omelet for an evening meal was an effective corrective of tired nerves and would enable him to sleep soundly all night  i sleep a great deal he announced after he had finished his supper and joined mr hopper on the porch when i have smoked a cigarin which luxury i hope you will join me siri shall retire to my couch and rest in the arms of morpheus until the brilliant sun of another day floods the countryside  praps itll rain suggested the landlord  then natures tears will render us sweetly sympathetic  he offered his cigar case to mr hopper who recognized a high priced cigar and helped himself  didnt see anything to make ye nervous durin yer walk did ye he inquired lighting the weed  very little it seems a nice quiet place only once was i annoyed i stumbled into a private path just before i reached the river andand had to apologize  must a struck ol swallertails place remarked the landlord  old swallowtail old swallowtail and who is he queried the stranger  hopper was a born gossip and if there was any one person he loved to talk of and criticize and pick to pieces it was old swallowtail so he rambled on for a half hour relating the cragg history in all its details including the story of ingua and inguas mother nan cragg who had married some unknown chap named scammel who did not long survive the ceremony  mr sinclair listened quietly seeming to enjoy his cigar more than he did the cragg gossip he asked no questions letting the landlord ramble on as he would and finally when hopper had exhausted his fund of fact and fiction which were about evenly mixed his guest bade him good night and retired to his private room  it aint eight oclock yet said the landlord to his wife but a feller with nerves is best asleep an when hes asleep he wont waste our kerosene  no mr sinclair didnt waste the hopper kerosene he had a little pocket arrangement which supplied him with light when an hour before midnight he silently rose dressed himself and prepared to leave the hotel he was not attired in what mary ann called his glad rags now but in a dark gray suit of homespun that was nearly the color of the night the blond wig was carefully locked in a suit case a small black cap was drawn over his eyes and thuscompletely transformedmr hoppers guest had no difficulty in gaining the street without a particle of noise betraying him to the family of his host  he went to the postoffice pried open a window unlocked the mail bag that was ready for jim bennett to carry to the morning train at chargrove and from it abstracted a number of letters which he unsealed and read with great care they had all been written and posted by hezekiah cragg the man spent a couple of hours here resealing the envelopes neatly and restoring them to the mail bag after which he attached the padlock and replaced the bag in exactly its former position when he had left the little front room which was devoted by the bennetts to the mail service the only evidence of his visit was a bruised depression beside the windowsash which was quite likely to escape detection  after this the stranger crept through the town and set off at a brisk pace toward the west taking the road over the bridge and following it to the connecting branch and thence to the lane a half hour later he was standing in old craggs stone lot and another hour was consumed among the huge stones by the hillsidethe place where josie had discovered the entrance to the underground cave mr sinclair did not discover the entrance however so finally he returned to town and mounted the stairs beside sol jerrems store building to the upper hallway  in five minutes he was inside of craggs outer office in another five minutes he had entered the inner office there he remained until the unmistakable herald of dawn warned him to be going however when he left the building there was no visible evidence of his visit he was in his own room and in bed long before mrs hopper gave a final snore and wakened to light the kitchen fire and prepare for the duties of the day    chapter xxiv facing danger  nans presence at craggs crossing rendered josie ogorman uneasy she had the cragg case so well in hand now and the evidence in her possession was so positively incriminating in her judgment that she did not like to be balked by a clever female detective from her fathers own office she had little doubt but nan would do all in her power to save old hezekiah cragg from the penalty of his misdeeds and her greatest fear was that he might utterly disappear before ogorman sent her assistance  with this fear growing in her mind on monday she determined to send another telegram to her father urging haste so she obtained permission from the colonel to have uncle eben drive her and mary louise to the city there being no telegraph office at chargrove station but she timed the trip when no trains would stop at chargrove during her absence and at the telegraph office she sent an imperative message to john ogorman at washington demanding instant help since all counterfeiting cases belonged distinctly to the secret service department she had little doubt her father would respond as soon as the affairs at the office would permit him to do so but the delay was exasperating nevertheless indeed josie was so sure that the crisis of her case was imminent that she determined to watch old craggs house every night until his arrest could be made if he attempted to escape she would arrest him herself with the aid of the little revolver she carried in her dress pocket  on their return journey they overtook mr sinclair at about a mile from the crossing they had never seen the man before but when he signaled them uncle eben slowed up the machine and stopped beside him  i beg a thousand pardons said the dapper little stranger removing his silk hat and bowing profoundly to the two girls but would you mind taking me to the town iifear i have turned my ankle not seriously you know but it is uncomfortable so if i may sit beside your chauffeur the favor will be greatly appreciated  to be sure said mary louise with ready can you get in unaided or do you wish uncle eben to assist you  thank you thank you a thousand times young lady said he climbing into the front seat im stopping at the hotel he explained as the car again started for rest and quiet because of my nervous condition my doctor said i would suffer a nervous breakdown if i did not seek rest and quiet in the seclusion of some country village so i came here andits secluded it really is  i hope your ankle is not seriously injured sir said mary louise take the gentleman to the hotel uncle eben  thank you said the little man and fussily removing a cardcase from an inner pocket he added my card please and handed it to mary louise  josie glanced at the card too she had been regarding the stranger thoughtfully with the same suspicions of him that nan had formerly entertained the card was not printed it was engraved one point in the mans favor his blond hair was a wig she had a good view of the back of it and was not to be deceived but perhaps the moustache which matched the hair was genuine carefully considering the matter she did not think anyone would come to craggs crossing in disguise unless he were a confederate of hezekiah cragg helping to circulate the counterfeit money this odd mr sinclair might be such a person and working under the direction of ned joselyn joselyn was in hiding for some unexplained reason sinclair could appear openly there might be nothing in this supposition but josie determined to keep an eye on the nervous stranger  he was profuse in his thanks when they let him out at hoppers hotel and uncle eben chuckled all the way home  dat man am shuah some mighty stravagant punkins in hes own mind he remarked he oughteh git hes pictur took in dat outfit may weeze jes to show how diclous a white man can look hell have all de kids in town achasin of him if he gits loose on de streets all he needs is a brass ban to be a circus parade  nan and ingua came over to dinner that evening and josie was very cordial to inguas mother who treated her chiefs daughter with the utmost friendliness both ingua and mary louise were surprised by their politeness and comradeship but neither of the principals was deceived by such a display each was on her guard but realized it was wise to appear friendly  monday night josie lurked in the shadows of the river bank until daybreak never relaxing her espionage of the cragg house for a moment all was quiet however  tuesday passed without event tuesday night josie was at her post again her eyes fixed on the dim light that shone from mr craggs room had she been able to see through the walls of the cottage she would have found the old man seated in his private apartment opposite his daughter could she have heard their conversationthe low continuous hum of old swallowtails voice broken only by an occasional question from nanshe would surely have been astonished nan was not much astonished save at the fact that her father had at last voluntarily confided to her the strange story of his life a life hitherto unknown to her she was not easily surprised but she was greatly impressed and when he finally rose from his chair and went out into the night nan sat in meditation for some time before she followed him ingua had long been asleep  josie lurking outside had not expected old swallowtail to leave the premises unless he planned to run away his delivery of counterfeit money to ned joselyn had been of too recent a date to render it necessary that he revisit his stoneyard for some time to come she argued yet tonight at a little after eleven oclock she saw his shadow pass from the house and take the path to the bridge  josie followed at the bridge mr cragg turned westward and at once she surmised he was bound for his rocky five acres the old man walked deliberately never thinking to look behind him he might not have observed anything suspicious had he turned but a hundred feet behind him came josie ogorman deftly dodging from tree to bush to keep in the dark places by the wayside and behind josie silently moved a little man in gray homespun whose form it would be difficult to distinguish even while he stood in the open josie like the prey she stalked was too occupied to look behind  old swallowtail reached the stoneyard and climbed the fence while he paused there josie crept close and noticed a light which suddenly flashed from the hillside it was a momentary flash and not very brilliant but she knew it was a signal because the old man at once started forward she let him lead on until he disappeared among the rocks and then she boldly followed she knew now where the secret entrance to the cavern was located  threading her way cautiously through the maze of rocks the girl finally reached a slanting shelf beneath which she crept on hands and knees at its farthest edge was a square door of solid oak rather crudely constructed but thick and substantial this door stood ajar  josie crouching beside the secret entrance wondered what she ought to do the regular thumping as of machinery which she had heard once before now began and continued without interruption here was an opportunity to catch the counterfeiters redhanded but she was one small girl as opposed to a gang of desperate criminals  oh dear she whispered half aloud i wish father had paid some attention to my telegram  he did responded a soft voice beside her    chapter xxv father and daughter  the girl would have screamed had not a hand been swiftly laid across her lips to stifle the sound she tried to rise but the shelf of rock beneath which she crouched prevented her however she struggled until an arm was passed firmly around her waist and a stern voice said warningly  josie control yourself  instantly her form relaxed and became inert she breathed hard and her heart still raced but she was no longer afraid  kiss me daddy she whispered and the man obeyed with a chuckle of delight  there was silence for a time while she collected herself then she asked in a businesslike tone  when did you get here  sunday said he  good gracious you must have caught the first train after getting my wire  i did a certain gang of unknown counterfeiters has been puzzling me a good deal lately and i fancied you had located the rascals  i have said josie exultantly  where he asked  the rascals are down below us this very minute daddy they are at our mercy  old cragg and jim bennett  yes and perhaps others  mmm mumbled ogorman youve a lot to learn yet josie youre quick youre persevering youre courageous but you lack judgment  do you mean that you doubt my evidence she asked indignantly  i do  ive the counterfeit bill here in my pocket which cragg tried to pass on the storekeeper she said  let me see it  josie searched and found the bill ogorman flashed a circle of light on it and studied it attentively  here he said passing it back to her dont lose it josie its worth ten dollars  isnt it counterfeit she asked trying to swallow a big lump that rose in her throat  it is one of the recent issues good as gold  she sat silent rigid with disappointment never had she been as miserable as at this moment she felt like crying and a sob really did become audible in spite of her effort to suppress it again ogorman passed his arm affectionately around her waist and held her close while she tried to think what it all meant  was that bill your only basis of suspicion dear he presently inquired  no indeed do you hear that noise what are they doing down there  i imagine they are running a printing press he replied  exactly she said triumphantly and why do these men operate a printing press in a secret cavern unless they are printing counterfeit money  ah there you have allowed your imagination to jump returned her father havent i warned you against the danger of imagination it leads to theory and theory leadsnine times in tento failure  circumstantial evidence is often valuable declared josie  it often convicts he admitted but i am never sure of its justice whenever facts are obtainable i prefer facts  can you explain she said somewhat coldly for she felt she was suffering a professional rebuke what those men below us are printing if not counterfeit money  i can said he  and you have been down there investigating  not yet he answered coolly  then you must be theorizing daddy  not at all if you know you have two marbles in one pocket and two more in another pocket you may be positive there are four altogether whether you bother to count them individually or not  she pondered this trying to understand what he meant  you dont know old cragg as well as i do she asserted  let us argue that point he said quickly what do you know about him  i know him to be an eccentric old man educated and shrewd with a cruel and murderous temper i know that he has secluded himself in this halfforgotten town for many years engaged in some secret occupation which he fears to have discovered i am sure that he is capable of any crime and thereforeeven if that bill is goodi am none the less positive that counterfeiting is his business no other supposition fits the facts in the case  is that all you know about old cragg asked ogorman  isnt it enough to warrant his arrest she retorted  not quite youve forgotten to mention one thing among his characteristics josie  what is that  cragg is an irishmanjust as i am  what has that to do with it  only this his sympathies have always been interested in behalf of his downtrodden countrymen i wont admit that they are downtrodden josie even to you but cragg thinks they are his father was an emigrant and hezekiah was himself born in dublin and came to this country while an infant he imagines he is irish yet perhaps he is  there was a note of bewilderment in the girls voice as she asked  what has his sympathy for the irish to do with this case  hezekiah cragg explained ogorman speaking slowly is at the head of an organization known as the champions of irish liberty for many years this c i l fraternity has been growing in numbers and power fed by money largely supplied by cragg himself i have proof indeed that he has devoted his entire fortune to this cause as well as all returns from his business enterprises he lives in comparative poverty that the champions of irish liberty may finally perfect their plans to free ireland and allow the irish to establish a selfgoverning republic  butwhy all this secrecy daddy she asked wonderingly  his work here is a violation of neutrality it is contrary to the treaty between our country and england according to our laws hezekiah cragg and his followers in seeking to deprive england of her irish possession are guilty of treason  could he be prosecuted for sympathizing with his own race  no for sending them arms and ammunition to fight with yes and that is what they have been doing  then you can arrest him for this act  i can said ogorman but ill be hanged if i will josie cragg is an idealist the cause to which he has devoted his life and fortune with a steadfast loyalty that is worthy of respect is doomed to failure the mans every thought is concentrated on his futile scheme and to oppose him at this juncture would drive him mad he isnt doing any real harm to our country and even england wont suffer much through his conspiracy but allowing for the folly of his attempt to make his people free and independent we must admire his lofty philanthropy his selfsacrifice his dogged perseverence in promoting the cause so near and dear to his heart let some other federal officer arrest him if he dares its no work for an ogorman  josie had encountered many surprises during her brief career as an embryo detective but this revelation was the crowning astonishment of her life all her carefully prepared theories concerning hezekiah cragg had been shattered by her fathers terse disclosure and instead of hating old swallowtail she suddenly found sympathy for his ideals welling in her heart josie o gorman was irish too  she pondered deeply the skilled detectives assertions and tried to fit them to her knowledge of old craggs character the story seemed to account for much but not all after a time she said  but this mysterious business of his which causes him to write so many letters and to receive so many answers to themwhat connection can it have with the champions of irish liberty  very little said her father except that it enables cragg to earn more money to feed into the everhungry maw of the cause craggs business is one of the most unique things of the sort that i have ever encountered and while it is quite legitimate he is obliged to keep it secret so as not to involve his many customers in adverse criticism  what on earth can it be  it pertains to heaven not earth my dear said ogorman dryly cragg was educated for the ministry or the priesthoodi cant discover whether he was catholic or protestantbut it seems he wasnt fitted for the church perhaps he already had in mind the idea of devoting his life to the land that gave him birth anyhow he was a well versed theologian and exceptionally brilliant in theses so when his money gave out he began writing sermons for others to preach doing a mailorder business and selling his products to those preachers who are too busy or too lazy to write their own sermons he has a sort of syndicate established and his books which i have examined with admiration and wonder prove he supplies sermons to preachers of all denominations throughout the united states this involves a lot of correspondence every week he writes a new sermon prints a large number of copies and sends one to each of his clients of course he furnishes but one man in a town or city with his products but there are a good many towns and cities to supply  is he printing sermons now asked josie  perhaps so or it may be he is printing some circular to be distributed to the members of the c i l jim bennett the husband of the postmistress here was once a practical printer and he is a staunch member of the irish fraternity cragg has known of this underground cavern for years and at one time it was a regular meetingplace for his order of champions so he bought a printing press and to avoid the prying eyes of his neighbors established it here that is the whole story of craggs crime josie and it is very simple when once fully explained  do you mean to say youve discovered all this in the two days since youve been here asked the girl in amazement  every bit of it i came prepared to arrest a gang of counterfeiters and stumbled on this very interesting but quite harmless plot  where have you been hiding since sunday she inquired  why i didnt hide at all he asserted dont you remember giving me a ride yesterday in the hathaway automobile  josie sat silent she was glad it was so dark under that shelf of rock for she would rather her father did not read her humiliation and selfreproach  daddy she said with a despairing accent im going to study to be a cook or a stenographer ill never make a decent detectivelike nan for instance  ogorman laughed  poor nan he exclaimed shes been more befuddled than you over this mysterious case and cragg is her own father too come josie its getting late lets go home    chapter xxvi the plot  when they were over the stones and in the lane again walking arm in arm toward the village josies logical mind turned from her own failure to a consideration of the story her father had just told her  i cant understand she remarked how joselyn came into this affair what happened to him or why he is once more the secret associate of old cragg  joselyn said the old detective is a clever grafterin other words an unmitigated scoundrel now do you understand  not quite confessed josie  hes irish  isnt his name scotch  yes but joselyn isnt his name if youre inclined to pick up his record and follow it through youll probably find him pursuing his various adventures under many aliases he doesnt belong in this country you know has only been here a few years so his adventures would probably cover two continents the fellow always manages to keep just within our laws although sometimes he gets dangerously near the edge the world is full of men like joselyn they dont interest me  then he belongs to the band of champions asked josie  yes in going over craggs books and papers in his private office the other night i found sufficient references to ned joselyn to figure out his story with a fair degree of accuracy said ogorman he was born in ireland got into trouble over there with the authorities and fled to america where he met annabel kenton and married her getting in touch with old swallowtail he joined the champions and attended to the outside business for mr cragg purchasing supplies and forwarding them with money to the patriots in ireland i suppose he made a fair rakeoff in all these dealings but that did not satisfy him he induced cragg to invest in some wildcat schemes promising him tremendous earnings which could be applied to the cause whether he really invested the money turned over to him or kept it for himself is a subject for doubt but it seems that the old man soon suspected him of doubledealing and they had so many quarrels that cragg finally threatened to turn him over to the authorities for extradition that was when our precious ned thought it wise to disappear but afterward another peace was patched up owing largely to the fact that joselyn knew so much of the workings of the secret order that it was safer to have him for a friend than an enemy  im thinking of his poor wife said josie does she know now where her husband is  i think not at first in order to win the confidence of old cragg ned applied considerable of his wifes money to the cause and while she would probably forgive his defalcations he thinks it wiser to keep aloof from her she foolishly trusted him to settle her mothers estate and im sure he managed to settle most of it on himself his value to cragg lay in his ability to visit the different branches of the champions which are pretty well scattered throughout the united states and keep them in touch one with the other also he purchased arms and ammunition to be forwarded secretly to ireland so you see it was quite impossible for the old man to break with him wholly rascal though he knows him to be  i see said josie joselyn has him in his power  entirely so a hint from him to the authorities would result in an embargo on any further shipments to the rebels in ireland and so completely ruin the usefulness of the order of champions the fellow seems to be a thorn deeply embedded in the side of old swallowtail who will suffer anything to promote the cause of irish liberty  ingua thinks her grandfather tried to kill ned at one time remarked the girl  its a wonder with his rabid temper that he didnt do so said ogorman but perhaps he realized that if he was hanged for joselyns murder his beloved order would be without a head and in sorry straits thousands of irishmen are feeding the funds of the champions aside from what cragg himself dumps into the pot so the old fellow is in a responsible position and mustnt commit murder however much he may long to because it would jeopardize the fortunes of his associates however the end is not yet and unless joselyn acts square in his future dealings he may yet meet with a tragic fate  i wonder what was in that package he took away with him the other night mused josie i was sure at the time it was counterfeit money  it probably contained the monthly printed circular to the various branches of the order jim bennett prints them in that underground cavern and ned joselyn sees they are distributed  well said josie with a sigh youve pricked my bubble daddy and made me ashamed with all my professed scorn of theories and my endeavors to avoid them i walked straight into the theoretic mire and stuck there  ogorman pressed her arm affectionately  never you mind my dear in a consoling tone you have learned a lesson that will be of great value to you in your future work i dare not blame you indeed for i myself on the evidence you sent me came rushing here on a wildgoose chase one never knows what is on the other side of a page till he turns it and if we detectives didnt have to turn so many pages only to find them blank wed soon rid the country of its malefactors but here we are at the kenton gateway go to bed josie dear and pleasant dreams to you  will i see you again she asked  no im off by the early train but you must stay here and have your visit out with mary louise it wont hurt you to have a free mind for awhile  he kissed her tenderly and she went in    chapter xxvii nans triumph  the nights events were not yet ended an automobile left the edge of the stoneyard followed a lane and turned into the main highway where it encountered a woman standing in the middle of the road and waving her arms she was distinctly visible in the moonlight  the man with the monocle slowed the car and came to a sudden stop rather than run her down  whats the matter he demanded impatiently  wait a minute i want to talk to you  cant stop he replied in a querulous tone ive got fifty miles to make before daylight out of my way woman  with a dexterous motion she opened the door and sprang into the seat beside him  here get out of this he cried  drive on she said calmly itll save time since youre in a hurry  get out  im going to ride with you why bother to argue  he turned nervously in his seat to get a look at her then shifted the clutch and slowly started the car the woman sat quiet while bumping over the uneven road at a reckless speed the driver turned at times to cast stealthy glances at the person beside him finally he asked in exasperation  do you know where im going  you havent told me  do you know who i am  how should i  oh very well with a sigh of relief but isnt this ratherer irregular  very  again he drove for a time in silence in the direction they were following they whirled by a village every three or four miles but the country roads were deserted and the nearest city of any size lay a good fifty miles on  i dont know who you are observed the woman presently but i can hazard a guess you call yourself joselynned joselynbut that isnt your name its the name you married annabel kenton under but it doesnt belong to you  he gave a roar of anger and started to slow down the car  go ahead she said imperatively  i wont youre going to get out of here and lively too or ill throw you out  do you feel anything against your side she asked coolly  yes with a sudden start  its the muzzle of a revolver i think its about opposite your heart and my finger is on the trigger go ahead  he turned the throttle and the car resumed its former speed  who the deuce are you he demanded in a voice that trembled slightly  like yourself i have many names she said in washington they call me nan shelley at craggs crossing im mrs scammel formerly nan cragg  ohho with a low whistle of astonishment nan cragg eh so youve returned from your wanderings have you with a derisive sneer  for a time but in wandering around ive found my place in the world and im now a lady detective not an especially highclass occupation but satisfactory as a breadwinner i find im quite talented im said to be a pretty fair detective  she could feel him tremble beside her he moved away from her as far as he could but the pressure against his side followed his movements after a time he asked defiantly  well being a detective whats your business with me i hope youre not fool enough to think im a criminal  i dont think it i know it youre an unusual sort of a criminal too she replied youre mixed up in a somewhat lawless international plot but it isnt my present business to bring you to book for that  what is your present business  to discover what youve done with my fathers money  he laughed as if relieved  spent it for the cause of ireland  part of it perhaps but the bulk of the money youve taken from the champions of irish liberty most of which came out of my fathers own pocket and practically all the money he gave you to invest for him you have withheld for your own use  youre crazy  i know the bank its deposited in  again he growled like a beast at bay  whatever i have on deposit is to be applied to the cause said he its reserved for future promotion  have you seen todays papers she inquired  no  the revolution in ireland has already broken out  great scott there was sincere anxiety in his voice now  it is premature and will result in the annihilation of all your plans  perhaps not  you know better said she anyhow your actions are now blocked until we see how the rebellion fares the irish will have no further use for american money im positive so i insist that my father receive back the funds he has advanced you and especially his own money which he gave you to invest and you never invested  bah if i offered him the money he wouldnt take it  then ill take it for him she asserted youll give up that money because you know i can have you arrested forwell let us say a breach of american neutrality you are not a citizen of the united states you were born in ireland and have never been naturalized here  you seem well posted he sneered  i belong to the government secret service and the bureau knows considerable she replied dryly  he remained silent for a time his eyes fixed upon the road ahead then he said  the government didnt send you to get craggs money away from me nor did cragg send you  no my father is afraid of you he has been forced to trust you even when he knew you were a treacherous defaulter because of your threats to betray the cause but youve been playing a dangerous game and i believe my father would have killed you long ago if  well if what  if you hadnt been his own nephew  he turned upon her with sudden fierceness  look out she called ive not the same objection to killing my cousin  your cousin  to be sure you are the son of peter cragg my fathers brother who returned to ireland many years ago when he was a young man ned joselyn is an assumed name you are ned cragg condemned by the british government for high treason you are known to be in america but only i knew where to find you  oh you knew did you  yes all your various hidingplaces are well known to me  confound you  exactly youd like to murder me cousin ned to stop my mouth but ill not give you the chance and really we ought not to kill one another for the cragg motto is a cragg for a cragg that has probably influenced my poor father more than anything else in his dealings with you he knew you are a cragg  well if im a cragg and youre a cragg why dont you let me alone  because the family motto was first ignored by yourself  for a long time he drove on without another word evidently he was in deep thought and the constant pressure of the revolver against his side gave him ample food for reflection nan was thinking too quietly exulting the while as a matter of fact she had hazarded guess after guess during the interview only to find she had hit the mark she knew that ned cragg had been condemned by the british government and was supposed to have escaped to america but not until now was she sure of his identity with ned joselyn her father had told her much but not this her native shrewdness was alone responsible for the discovery  were almost there arent we asked nan at last  where  at the house where youre at present hiding weve entered the city i see and its almost daybreak  well  i know the chief of police here am i to have that money cousin ned or  of course he said hastily    chapter xxviii planning the future  it was nearly a month later when mary louise walking down to the river on an afternoon discovered ingua sitting on the opposite bank and listlessly throwing pebbles into the stream she ran across the steppingstones and joined her little friend  how is your grandfather
