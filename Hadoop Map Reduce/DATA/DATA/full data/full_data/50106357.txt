by collision with a derelict when about the latitude 1 degree s and longitude 107 degrees w  on january the fifth 1888that is eleven months and four days aftermy uncle edward prendick a private gentleman who certainly went aboard the lady vain at callao and who had been considered drowned was picked up in latitude 5 degrees 3 s and longitude 101 degrees w in a small open boat of which the name was illegible but which is supposed to have belonged to the missing schooner ipecacuanha he gave such a strange account of himself that he was supposed demented subsequently he alleged that his mind was a blank from the moment of his escape from the lady vain  his case was discussed among psychologists at the time as a curious instance of the lapse of memory consequent upon physical and mental stress the following narrative was found among his papers by the undersigned his nephew and heir but unaccompanied by any definite request for publication  the only island known to exist in the region in which my uncle was picked up is nobles isle a small volcanic islet and uninhabited it was visited in 1891 by h m s scorpion  a party of sailors then landed but found nothing living thereon except certain curious white moths some hogs and rabbits and some rather peculiar rats so that this narrative is without confirmation in its most essential particular  with that understood there seems no harm in putting this strange story before the public in accordance as i believe with my uncles intentions  there is at least this much in its behalf  my uncle passed out of human knowledge about latitude 5 degrees s and longitude 105 degrees e and reappeared in the same part of the ocean after a space of eleven months in some way he must have lived during the interval  and it seems that a schooner called the ipecacuanha with a drunken captain john davies did start from africa with a puma and certain other animals aboard in january 1887 that the vessel was well known at several ports in the south pacific and that it finally disappeared from those seas with a considerable amount of copra aboard sailing to its unknown fate from bayna in december 1887 a date that tallies entirely with my uncles story  charles edward prendick  the story written by edward prendick     i  in the dingey of the lady vain   i do not propose to add anything to what has already been written concerning the loss of the lady vain  as everyone knows she collided with a derelict when ten days out from callao the longboat with seven of the crew was picked up eighteen days after by h m gunboat myrtle and the story of their terrible privations has become quite as well known as the far more horrible medusa case but i have to add to the published story of the lady vain another possibly as horrible and far stranger  it has hitherto been supposed that the four men who were in the dingey perished but this is incorrect  i have the best of evidence for this assertion i was one of the four men  but in the first place i must state that there never were four men in the dingeythe number was three  constans who was seen by the captain to jump into the gig1 luckily for us and unluckily for himself did not reach us  he came down out of the tangle of ropes under the stays of the smashed bowsprit some small rope caught his heel as he let go and he hung for a moment head downward and then fell and struck a block or spar floating in the water we pulled towards him but he never came up  1 daily news march 17 1887  i say lucky for us he did not reach us and i might almost say luckily for himself for we had only a small breaker of water and some soddened ships biscuits with us so sudden had been the alarm so unprepared the ship for any disaster we thought the people on the launch would be better provisioned though it seems they were not and we tried to hail them  they could not have heard us and the next morning when the drizzle clearedwhich was not until past middaywe could see nothing of them  we could not stand up to look about us because of the pitching of the boat the two other men who had escaped so far with me were a man named helmar a passenger like myself and a seaman whose name i dont knowa short sturdy man with a stammer  we drifted famishing and after our water had come to an end tormented by an intolerable thirst for eight days altogether after the second day the sea subsided slowly to a glassy calm  it is quite impossible for the ordinary reader to imagine those eight days he has not luckily for himself anything in his memory to imagine with after the first day we said little to one another and lay in our places in the boat and stared at the horizon or watched with eyes that grew larger and more haggard every day the misery and weakness gaining upon our companions  the sun became pitiless the water ended on the fourth day and we were already thinking strange things and saying them with our eyes but it was i think the sixth before helmar gave voice to the thing we had all been thinking i remember our voices were dry and thin so that we bent towards one another and spared our words  i stood out against it with all my might was rather for scuttling the boat and perishing together among the sharks that followed us but when helmar said that if his proposal was accepted we should have drink the sailor came round to him  i would not draw lots however and in the night the sailor whispered to helmar again and again and i sat in the bows with my claspknife in my hand though i doubt if i had the stuff in me to fight and in the morning i agreed to helmars proposal and we handed halfpence to find the odd man  the lot fell upon the sailor but he was the strongest of us and would not abide by it and attacked helmar with his hands  they grappled together and almost stood up i crawled along the boat to them intending to help helmar by grasping the sailors leg but the sailor stumbled with the swaying of the boat and the two fell upon the gunwale and rolled overboard together they sank like stones  i remember laughing at that and wondering why i laughed  the laugh caught me suddenly like a thing from without  i lay across one of the thwarts for i know not how long thinking that if i had the strength i would drink seawater and madden myself to die quickly  and even as i lay there i saw with no more interest than if it had been a picture a sail come up towards me over the skyline my mind must have been wandering and yet i remember all that happened quite distinctly i remember how my head swayed with the seas and the horizon with the sail above it danced up and down but i also remember as distinctly that i had a persuasion that i was dead and that i thought what a jest it was that they should come too late by such a little to catch me in my body  for an endless period as it seemed to me i lay with my head on the thwart watching the schooner she was a little ship schoonerrigged fore and aft come up out of the sea she kept tacking to and fro in a widening compass for she was sailing dead into the wind  it never entered my head to attempt to attract attention and i do not remember anything distinctly after the sight of her side until i found myself in a little cabin aft theres a dim halfmemory of being lifted up to the gangway and of a big round countenance covered with freckles and surrounded with red hair staring at me over the bulwarks  i also had a disconnected impression of a dark face with extraordinary eyes close to mine but that i thought was a nightmare until i met it again i fancy i recollect some stuff being poured in between my teeth and that is all     ii  the man who was going nowhere   the cabin in which i found myself was small and rather untidy a youngish man with flaxen hair a bristly strawcoloured moustache and a dropping nether lip was sitting and holding my wrist for a minute we stared at each other without speaking he had watery grey eyes oddly void of expression then just overhead came a sound like an iron bedstead being knocked about and the low angry growling of some large animal at the same time the man spoke  he repeated his questionhow do you feel now  i think i said i felt all right  i could not recollect how i had got there  he must have seen the question in my face for my voice was inaccessible to me  you were picked up in a boat starving  the name on the boat was the lady vain and there were spots of blood on the gunwale  at the same time my eye caught my hand so thin that it looked like a dirty skinpurse full of loose bones and all the business of the boat came back to me  have some of this said he and gave me a dose of some scarlet stuff iced  it tasted like blood and made me feel stronger  you were in luck said he to get picked up by a ship with a medical man aboard  he spoke with a slobbering articulation with the ghost of a lisp  what ship is this  i said slowly hoarse from my long silence  its a little trader from arica and callao  i never asked where she came from in the beginningout of the land of born fools i guess  im a passenger myself from arica the silly ass who owns herhes captain too named davieshes lost his certificate or something  you know the kind of mancalls the thing the ipecacuanha of all silly infernal names though when theres much of a sea without any wind she certainly acts according  then the noise overhead began again a snarling growl and the voice of a human being together  then another voice telling some heavenforsaken idiot to desist  you were nearly dead said my interlocutor  it was a very near thing indeed  but ive put some stuff into you now notice your arms sore  injections  youve been insensible for nearly thirty hours  i thought slowly  i was distracted now by the yelping of a number of dogs am i eligible for solid food i asked  thanks to me he said  even now the mutton is boiling  yes i said with assurance i could eat some mutton  but said he with a momentary hesitation you know im dying to hear of how you came to be alone in that boat  damn that howling i thought i detected a certain suspicion in his eyes  he suddenly left the cabin and i heard him in violent controversy with some one who seemed to me to talk gibberish in response to him the matter sounded as though it ended in blows but in that i thought my ears were mistaken  then he shouted at the dogs and returned to the cabin  well said he in the doorway  you were just beginning to tell me  i told him my name edward prendick and how i had taken to natural history as a relief from the dulness of my comfortable independence  he seemed interested in this  ive done some science myself  i did my biology at university collegegetting out the ovary of the earthworm and the radula of the snail and all that  lord  its ten years ago but go on go on tell me about the boat  he was evidently satisfied with the frankness of my story which i told in concise sentences enough for i felt horribly weak and when it was finished he reverted at once to the topic of natural history and his own biological studies  he began to question me closely about tottenham court road and gower street is caplatzi still flourishing  what a shop that was he had evidently been a very ordinary medical student and drifted incontinently to the topic of the music halls  he told me some anecdotes  left it all he said ten years ago  how jolly it all used to be but i made a young ass of myselfplayed myself out before i was twentyone i daresay its all different now  but i must look up that ass of a cook and see what hes done to your mutton  the growling overhead was renewed so suddenly and with so much savage anger that it startled me  whats that  i called after him but the door had closed  he came back again with the boiled mutton and i was so excited by the appetising smell of it that i forgot the noise of the beast that had troubled me  after a day of alternate sleep and feeding i was so far recovered as to be able to get from my bunk to the scuttle and see the green seas trying to keep pace with us  i judged the schooner was running before the wind  montgomerythat was the name of the flaxenhaired mancame in again as i stood there and i asked him for some clothes he lent me some duck things of his own for those i had worn in the boat had been thrown overboard  they were rather loose for me for he was large and long in his limbs  he told me casually that the captain was threeparts drunk in his own cabin  as i assumed the clothes i began asking him some questions about the destination of the ship he said the ship was bound to hawaii but that it had to land him first  where said i  its an island where i live  so far as i know it hasnt got a name  he stared at me with his nether lip dropping and looked so wilfully stupid of a sudden that it came into my head that he desired to avoid my questions  i had the discretion to ask no more     iii  the strange face   we left the cabin and found a man at the companion obstructing our way  he was standing on the ladder with his back to us peering over the combing of the hatchway  he was i could see a misshapen man short broad and clumsy with a crooked back a hairy neck and a head sunk between his shoulders  he was dressed in darkblue serge and had peculiarly thick coarse black hair i heard the unseen dogs growl furiously and forthwith he ducked backcoming into contact with the hand i put out to fend him off from myself  he turned with animal swiftness  in some indefinable way the black face thus flashed upon me shocked me profoundly  it was a singularly deformed one the facial part projected forming something dimly suggestive of a muzzle and the huge halfopen mouth showed as big white teeth as i had ever seen in a human mouth  his eyes were bloodshot at the edges with scarcely a rim of white round the hazel pupils there was a curious glow of excitement in his face  confound you said montgomery  why the devil dont you get out of the way  the blackfaced man started aside without a word i went on up the companion staring at him instinctively as i did so  montgomery stayed at the foot for a moment you have no business here you know he said in a deliberate tone your place is forward  the blackfaced man cowered  theywont have me forward he spoke slowly with a queer hoarse quality in his voice  wont have you forward said montgomery in a menacing voice but i tell you to go  he was on the brink of saying something further then looked up at me suddenly and followed me up the ladder  i had paused half way through the hatchway looking back still astonished beyond measure at the grotesque ugliness of this blackfaced creature i had never beheld such a repulsive and extraordinary face before and yetif the contradiction is crediblei experienced at the same time an odd feeling that in some way i had already encountered exactly the features and gestures that now amazed me afterwards it occurred to me that probably i had seen him as i was lifted aboard and yet that scarcely satisfied my suspicion of a previous acquaintance  yet how one could have set eyes on so singular a face and yet have forgotten the precise occasion passed my imagination  montgomerys movement to follow me released my attention and i turned and looked about me at the flush deck of the little schooner i was already half prepared by the sounds i had heard for what i saw certainly i never beheld a deck so dirty  it was littered with scraps of carrot shreds of green stuff and indescribable filth fastened by chains to the mainmast were a number of grisly staghounds who now began leaping and barking at me and by the mizzen a huge puma was cramped in a little iron cage far too small even to give it turning room farther under the starboard bulwark were some big hutches containing a number of rabbits and a solitary llama was squeezed in a mere box of a cage forward  the dogs were muzzled by leather straps the only human being on deck was a gaunt and silent sailor at the wheel  the patched and dirty spankers were tense before the wind and up aloft the little ship seemed carrying every sail she had the sky was clear the sun midway down the western sky long waves capped by the breeze with froth were running with us we went past the steersman to the taffrail and saw the water come foaming under the stern and the bubbles go dancing and vanishing in her wake  i turned and surveyed the unsavoury length of the ship  is this an ocean menagerie said i  looks like it said montgomery  what are these beasts for  merchandise curios  does the captain think he is going to sell them somewhere in the south seas  it looks like it doesnt it said montgomery and turned towards the wake again  suddenly we heard a yelp and a volley of furious blasphemy from the companion hatchway and the deformed man with the black face came up hurriedly  he was immediately followed by a heavy redhaired man in a white cap  at the sight of the former the staghounds who had all tired of barking at me by this time became furiously excited howling and leaping against their chains the black hesitated before them and this gave the redhaired man time to come up with him and deliver a tremendous blow between the shoulderblades the poor devil went down like a felled ox and rolled in the dirt among the furiously excited dogs it was lucky for him that they were muzzled  the redhaired man gave a yawp of exultation and stood staggering and as it seemed to me in serious danger of either going backwards down the companion hatchway or forwards upon his victim  so soon as the second man had appeared montgomery had started forward steady on there he cried in a tone of remonstrance a couple of sailors appeared on the forecastle  the blackfaced man howling in a singular voice rolled about under the feet of the dogs no one attempted to help him  the brutes did their best to worry him butting their muzzles at him  there was a quick dance of their lithe greyfigured bodies over the clumsy prostrate figure the sailors forward shouted as though it was admirable sport montgomery gave an angry exclamation and went striding down the deck and i followed him  the blackfaced man scrambled up and staggered forward going and leaning over the bulwark by the main shrouds where he remained panting and glaring over his shoulder at the dogs  the redhaired man laughed a satisfied laugh  look here captain said montgomery with his lisp a little accentuated gripping the elbows of the redhaired man this wont do  i stood behind montgomery  the captain came half round and regarded him with the dull and solemn eyes of a drunken man wha wont do he said and added after looking sleepily into montgomerys face for a minute blasted sawbones  with a sudden movement he shook his arms free and after two ineffectual attempts stuck his freckled fists into his side pockets  that mans a passenger said montgomery  id advise you to keep your hands off him  go to hell said the captain loudly  he suddenly turned and staggered towards the side  do what i like on my own ship he said  i think montgomery might have left him then seeing the brute was drunk but he only turned a shade paler and followed the captain to the bulwarks  look you here captain he said that man of mine is not to be illtreated he has been hazed ever since he came aboard  for a minute alcoholic fumes kept the captain speechless blasted sawbones was all he considered necessary  i could see that montgomery had one of those slow pertinacious tempers that will warm day after day to a white heat and never again cool to forgiveness and i saw too that this quarrel had been some time growing  the mans drunk said i perhaps officiously youll do no good  montgomery gave an ugly twist to his dropping lip  hes always drunk do you think that excuses his assaulting his passengers  my ship began the captain waving his hand unsteadily towards the cages was a clean ship  look at it now it was certainly anything but clean  crew continued the captain clean respectable crew  you agreed to take the beasts  i wish id never set eyes on your infernal island  what the devilwant beasts for on an island like that  then that man of yoursunderstood he was a man  hes a lunatic and he hadnt no business aft  do you think the whole damned ship belongs to you  your sailors began to haze the poor devil as soon as he came aboard  thats just what he ishes a devil an ugly devil  my men cant stand him  i cant stand him  none of us cant stand him nor you either  montgomery turned away  you leave that man alone anyhow he said nodding his head as he spoke  but the captain meant to quarrel now  he raised his voice  if he comes this end of the ship again ill cut his insides out i tell you cut out his blasted insides  who are you to tell me what im to do i tell you im captain of this shipcaptain and owner im the law here i tell youthe law and the prophets i bargained to take a man and his attendant to and from arica and bring back some animals  i never bargained to carry a mad devil and a silly sawbones a  well never mind what he called montgomery  i saw the latter take a step forward and interposed  hes drunk said i the captain began some abuse even fouler than the last  shut up i said turning on him sharply for i had seen danger in montgomerys white face with that i brought the downpour on myself  however i was glad to avert what was uncommonly near a scuffle even at the price of the captains drunken illwill i do not think i have ever heard quite so much vile language come in a continuous stream from any mans lips before though i have frequented eccentric company enough  i found some of it hard to endure though i am a mildtempered man but certainly when i told the captain to shut up i had forgotten that i was merely a bit of human flotsam cut off from my resources and with my fare unpaid a mere casual dependant on the bounty or speculative enterprise of the ship he reminded me of it with considerable vigour but at any rate i prevented a fight     iv  at the schooners rail   that night land was sighted after sundown and the schooner hove to  montgomery intimated that was his destination it was too far to see any details it seemed to me then simply a lowlying patch of dim blue in the uncertain bluegrey sea an almost vertical streak of smoke went up from it into the sky the captain was not on deck when it was sighted  after he had vented his wrath on me he had staggered below and i understand he went to sleep on the floor of his own cabin  the mate practically assumed the command he was the gaunt taciturn individual we had seen at the wheel apparently he was in an evil temper with montgomery  he took not the slightest notice of either of us  we dined with him in a sulky silence after a few ineffectual efforts on my part to talk it struck me too that the men regarded my companion and his animals in a singularly unfriendly manner  i found montgomery very reticent about his purpose with these creatures and about his destination and though i was sensible of a growing curiosity as to both i did not press him  we remained talking on the quarter deck until the sky was thick with stars  except for an occasional sound in the yellowlit forecastle and a movement of the animals now and then the night was very still the puma lay crouched together watching us with shining eyes a black heap in the corner of its cage  montgomery produced some cigars he talked to me of london in a tone of halfpainful reminiscence asking all kinds of questions about changes that had taken place he spoke like a man who had loved his life there and had been suddenly and irrevocably cut off from it  i gossiped as well as i could of this and that  all the time the strangeness of him was shaping itself in my mind and as i talked i peered at his odd pallid face in the dim light of the binnacle lantern behind me  then i looked out at the darkling sea where in the dimness his little island was hidden  this man it seemed to me had come out of immensity merely to save my life  tomorrow he would drop over the side and vanish again out of my existence  even had it been under commonplace circumstances it would have made me a trifle thoughtful but in the first place was the singularity of an educated man living on this unknown little island and coupled with that the extraordinary nature of his luggage i found myself repeating the captains question what did he want with the beasts  why too had he pretended they were not his when i had remarked about them at first  then again in his personal attendant there was a bizarre quality which had impressed me profoundly these circumstances threw a haze of mystery round the man  they laid hold of my imagination and hampered my tongue  towards midnight our talk of london died away and we stood side by side leaning over the bulwarks and staring dreamily over the silent starlit sea each pursuing his own thoughts it was the atmosphere for sentiment and i began upon my gratitude  if i may say it said i after a time you have saved my life  chance he answered  just chance  i prefer to make my thanks to the accessible agent  thank no one  you had the need and i had the knowledge and i injected and fed you much as i might have collected a specimen i was bored and wanted something to do  if id been jaded that day or hadnt liked your face wellits a curious question where you would have been now  this damped my mood a little  at any rate i began  its a chance i tell you he interrupted as everything is in a mans life  only the asses wont see it  why am i here now an outcast from civilisation instead of being a happy man enjoying all the pleasures of london  simply because eleven years agoi lost my head for ten minutes on a foggy night  he stopped  yes said i  thats all  we relapsed into silence  presently he laughed theres something in this starlight that loosens ones tongue im an ass and yet somehow i would like to tell you  whatever you tell me you may rely upon my keeping to myselfif thats it  he was on the point of beginning and then shook his head doubtfully  dont said i  it is all the same to me  after all it is better to keep your secret  theres nothing gained but a little relief if i respect your confidence  if i dontwell  he grunted undecidedly  i felt i had him at a disadvantage had caught him in the mood of indiscretion and to tell the truth i was not curious to learn what might have driven a young medical student out of london i have an imagination  i shrugged my shoulders and turned away over the taffrail leant a silent black figure watching the stars it was montgomerys strange attendant  it looked over its shoulder quickly with my movement then looked away again  it may seem a little thing to you perhaps but it came like a sudden blow to me  the only light near us was a lantern at the wheel the creatures face was turned for one brief instant out of the dimness of the stern towards this illumination and i saw that the eyes that glanced at me shone with a palegreen light  i did not know then that a reddish luminosity at least is not uncommon in human eyes the thing came to me as stark inhumanity  that black figure with its eyes of fire struck down through all my adult thoughts and feelings and for a moment the forgotten horrors of childhood came back to my mind then the effect passed as it had come  an uncouth black figure of a man a figure of no particular import hung over the taffrail against the starlight and i found montgomery was speaking to me  im thinking of turning in then said he if youve had enough of this  i answered him incongruously  we went below and he wished me goodnight at the door of my cabin  that night i had some very unpleasant dreams  the waning moon rose late  its light struck a ghostly white beam across my cabin and made an ominous shape on the planking by my bunk then the staghounds woke and began howling and baying so that i dreamt fitfully and scarcely slept until the approach of dawn     v  the man who had nowhere to go   in the early morning it was the second morning after my recovery and i believe the fourth after i was picked up i awoke through an avenue of tumultuous dreamsdreams of guns and howling mobsand became sensible of a hoarse shouting above me  i rubbed my eyes and lay listening to the noise doubtful for a little while of my whereabouts then came a sudden pattering of bare feet the sound of heavy objects being thrown about a violent creaking and the rattling of chains i heard the swish of the water as the ship was suddenly brought round and a foamy yellowgreen wave flew across the little round window and left it streaming  i jumped into my clothes and went on deck  as i came up the ladder i saw against the flushed skyfor the sun was just risingthe broad back and red hair of the captain and over his shoulder the puma spinning from a tackle rigged on to the mizzen spankerboom  the poor brute seemed horribly scared and crouched in the bottom of its little cage  overboard with em bawled the captain  overboard with em well have a clean ship soon of the whole bilin of em  he stood in my way so that i had perforce to tap his shoulder to come on deck  he came round with a start and staggered back a few paces to stare at me  it needed no expert eye to tell that the man was still drunk  hullo said he stupidly and then with a light coming into his eyes why its mistermister  prendick said i  prendick be damned said he  shutupthats your name mister shutup  it was no good answering the brute but i certainly did not expect his next move  he held out his hand to the gangway by which montgomery stood talking to a massive greyhaired man in dirtyblue flannels who had apparently just come aboard  that way mister blasted shutup that way roared the captain  montgomery and his companion turned as he spoke  what do you mean  i said  that way mister blasted shutupthats what i mean overboard mister shutupand sharp  were cleaning the ship outcleaning the whole blessed ship out and overboard you go  i stared at him dumfounded  then it occurred to me that it was exactly the thing i wanted  the lost prospect of a journey as sole passenger with this quarrelsome sot was not one to mourn over i turned towards montgomery  cant have you said montgomerys companion concisely  you cant have me said i aghast  he had the squarest and most resolute face i ever set eyes upon  look here i began turning to the captain  overboard said the captain  this ship aint for beasts and cannibals and worse than beasts any more  overboard you go mister shutup if they cant have you you goes overboard but anyhow you gowith your friends  ive done with this blessed island for evermore amen  ive had enough of it  but montgomery i appealed  he distorted his lower lip and nodded his head hopelessly at the greyhaired man beside him to indicate his powerlessness to help me  ill see to you presently said the captain  then began a curious threecornered altercation alternately i appealed to one and another of the three menfirst to the greyhaired man to let me land and then to the drunken captain to keep me aboard  i even bawled entreaties to the sailors montgomery said never a word only shook his head youre going overboard i tell you was the captains refrain law be damned  im king here  at last i must confess my voice suddenly broke in the middle of a vigorous threat i felt a gust of hysterical petulance and went aft and stared dismally at nothing  meanwhile the sailors progressed rapidly with the task of unshipping the packages and caged animals  a large launch with two standing lugs lay under the lea of the schooner and into this the strange assortment of goods were swung i did not then see the hands from the island that were receiving the packages for the hull of the launch was hidden from me by the side of the schooner  neither montgomery nor his companion took the slightest notice of me but busied themselves in assisting and directing the four or five sailors who were unloading the goods the captain went forward interfering rather than assisting i was alternately despairful and desperate  once or twice as i stood waiting there for things to accomplish themselves i could not resist an impulse to laugh at my miserable quandary i felt all the wretcheder for the lack of a breakfast hunger and a lack of bloodcorpuscles take all the manhood from a man i perceived pretty clearly that i had not the stamina either to resist what the captain chose to do to expel me or to force myself upon montgomery and his companion so i waited passively upon fate and the work of transferring montgomerys possessions to the launch went on as if i did not exist  presently that work was finished and then came a struggle i was hauled resisting weakly enough to the gangway even then i noticed the oddness of the brown faces of the men who were with montgomery in the launch but the launch was now fully laden and was shoved off hastily  a broadening gap of green water appeared under me and i pushed back with all my strength to avoid falling headlong  the hands in the launch shouted derisively and i heard montgomery curse at them and then the captain the mate and one of the seamen helping him ran me aft towards the stern  the dingey of the lady vain had been towing behind it was half full of water had no oars and was quite unvictualled i refused to go aboard her and flung myself full length on the deck in the end they swung me into her by a rope for they had no stern ladder and then they cut me adrift  i drifted slowly from the schooner  in a kind of stupor i watched all hands take to the rigging and slowly but surely she came round to the wind the sails fluttered and then bellied out as the wind came into them i stared at her weatherbeaten side heeling steeply towards me and then she passed out of my range of view  i did not turn my head to follow her  at first i could scarcely believe what had happened  i crouched in the bottom of the dingey stunned and staring blankly at the vacant oily sea  then i realised that i was in that little hell of mine again now half swamped and looking back over the gunwale i saw the schooner standing away from me with the redhaired captain mocking at me over the taffrail and turning towards the island saw the launch growing smaller as she approached the beach  abruptly the cruelty of this desertion became clear to me i had no means of reaching the land unless i should chance to drift there i was still weak you must remember from my exposure in the boat i was empty and very faint or i should have had more heart but as it was i suddenly began to sob and weep as i had never done since i was a little child  the tears ran down my face  in a passion of despair i struck with my fists at the water in the bottom of the boat and kicked savagely at the gunwale  i prayed aloud for god to let me die     vi  the evillooking boatmen   but the islanders seeing that i was really adrift took pity on me i drifted very slowly to the eastward approaching the island slantingly and presently i saw with hysterical relief the launch come round and return towards me  she was heavily laden and i could make out as she drew nearer montgomerys whitehaired broadshouldered companion sitting cramped up with the dogs and several packingcases in the stern sheets this individual stared fixedly at me without moving or speaking the blackfaced cripple was glaring at me as fixedly in the bows near the puma  there were three other men besidesthree strange brutishlooking fellows at whom the staghounds were snarling savagely montgomery who was steering brought the boat by me and rising caught and fastened my painter to the tiller to tow me for there was no room aboard  i had recovered from my hysterical phase by this time and answered his hail as he approached bravely enough i told him the dingey was nearly swamped and he reached me a piggin i was jerked back as the rope tightened between the boats for some time i was busy baling  it was not until i had got the water under for the water in the dingey had been shipped the boat was perfectly sound that i had leisure to look at the people in the launch again  the whitehaired man i found was still regarding me steadfastly but with an expression as i now fancied of some perplexity when my eyes met his he looked down at the staghound that sat between his knees  he was a powerfullybuilt man as i have said with a fine forehead and rather heavy features but his eyes had that odd drooping of the skin above the lids which often comes with advancing years and the fall of his heavy mouth at the corners gave him an expression of pugnacious resolution he talked to montgomery in a tone too low for me to hear  from him my eyes travelled to his three men and a strange crew they were i saw only their faces yet there was something in their facesi knew not whatthat gave me a queer spasm of disgust i looked steadily at them and the impression did not pass though i failed to see what had occasioned it  they seemed to me then to be brown men but their limbs were oddly swathed in some thin dirty white stuff down even to the fingers and feet i have never seen men so wrapped up before and women so only in the east they wore turbans too and thereunder peered out their elfin faces at mefaces with protruding lowerjaws and bright eyes they had lank black hair almost like horsehair and seemed as they sat to exceed in stature any race of men i have seen the whitehaired man who i knew was a good six feet in height sat a head below any one of the three  i found afterwards that really none were taller than myself but their bodies were abnormally long and the thighpart of the leg short and curiously twisted at any rate they were an amazingly ugly gang and over the heads of them under the forward lug peered the black face of the man whose eyes were luminous in the dark  as i stared at them they met my gaze and then first one and then another turned away from my direct stare and looked at me in an odd furtive manner  it occurred to me that i was perhaps annoying them and i turned my attention to the island we were approaching  it was low and covered with thick vegetationchiefly a kind of palm that was new to me  from one point a thin white thread of vapour rose slantingly to an immense height and then frayed out like a down feather we were now within the embrace of a broad bay flanked on either hand by a low promontory  the beach was of dullgrey sand and sloped steeply up to a ridge perhaps sixty or seventy feet above the sealevel and irregularly set with trees and undergrowth half way up was a square enclosure of some greyish stone which i found subsequently was built partly of coral and partly of pumiceous lava two thatched roofs peeped from within this enclosure a man stood awaiting us at the waters edge  i fancied while we were still far off that i saw some other and very grotesquelooking creatures scuttle into the bushes upon the slope but i saw nothing of these as we drew nearer  this man was of a moderate size and with a black negroid face  he had a large almost lipless mouth extraordinary lank arms long thin feet and bowlegs and stood with his heavy face thrust forward staring at us he was dressed like montgomery and his whitehaired companion in jacket and trousers of blue serge  as we came still nearer this individual began to run to and fro on the beach making the most grotesque movements  at a word of command from montgomery the four men in the launch sprang up and with singularly awkward gestures struck the lugs montgomery steered us round and into a narrow little dock excavated in the beach  then the man on the beach hastened towards us this dock as i call it was really a mere ditch just long enough at this phase of the tide to take the longboat i heard the bows ground in the sand staved the dingey off the rudder of the big boat with my piggin and freeing the painter landed the three muffled men with the clumsiest movements scrambled out upon the sand and forthwith set to landing the cargo assisted by the man on the beach  i was struck especially by the curious movements of the legs of the three swathed and bandaged boatmennot stiff they were but distorted in some odd way almost as if they were jointed in the wrong place  the dogs were still snarling and strained at their chains after these men as the whitehaired man landed with them  the three big fellows spoke to one another in odd guttural tones and the man who had waited for us on the beach began chattering to them excitedlya foreign language as i fanciedas they laid hands on some bales piled near the stern somewhere i had heard such a voice before and i could not think where the whitehaired man stood holding in a tumult of six dogs and bawling orders over their din  montgomery having unshipped the rudder landed likewise and all set to work at unloading  i was too faint what with my long fast and the sun beating down on my bare head to offer any assistance  presently the whitehaired man seemed to recollect my presence and came up to me  you look said he as though you had scarcely breakfasted his little eyes were a brilliant black under his heavy brows i must apologise for that  now you are our guest we must make you comfortablethough you are uninvited you know he looked keenly into my face  montgomery says you are an educated man mr prendick says you know something of science  may i ask what that signifies  i told him i had spent some years at the royal college of science and had done some researches in biology under huxley  he raised his eyebrows slightly at that  that alters the case a little mr prendick he said with a trifle more respect in his manner  as it happens we are biologists here  this is a biological stationof a sort his eye rested on the men in white who were busily hauling the puma on rollers towards the walled yard  i and montgomery at least he added  then when you will be able to get away i cant say were off the track to anywhere  we see a ship once in a twelvemonth or so  he left me abruptly and went up the beach past this group and i think entered the enclosure  the other two men were with montgomery erecting a pile of smaller packages on a lowwheeled truck the llama was still on the launch with the rabbit hutches the staghounds were still lashed to the thwarts the pile of things completed all three men laid hold of the truck and began shoving the tonweight or so upon it after the puma presently montgomery left them and coming back to me held out his hand  im glad said he for my own part  that captain was a silly ass hed have made things lively for you  it was you said i that saved me again  that depends  youll find this island an infernally rum place i promise you  id watch my goings carefully if i were you he he hesitated and seemed to alter his mind about what was on his lips  i wish youd help me with these rabbits he said  his procedure with the rabbits was singular  i waded in with him and helped him lug one of the hutches ashore no sooner was that done than he opened the door of it and tilting the thing on one end turned its living contents out on the ground they fell in a struggling heap one on the top of the other he clapped his hands and forthwith they went off with that hopping run of theirs fifteen or twenty of them i should think up the beach  increase and multiply my friends said montgomery replenish the island  hitherto weve had a certain lack of meat here  as i watched them disappearing the whitehaired man returned with a brandyflask and some biscuits  something to go on with prendick said he in a far more familiar tone than before  i made no ado but set to work on the biscuits at once while the whitehaired man helped montgomery to release about a score more of the rabbits three big hutches however went up to the house with the puma the brandy i did not touch for i have been an abstainer from my birth     vii  the locked door   the reader will perhaps understand that at first everything was so strange about me and my position was the outcome of such unexpected adventures that i had no discernment of the relative strangeness of this or that thing  i followed the llama up the beach and was overtaken by montgomery who asked me not to enter the stone enclosure i noticed then that the puma in its cage and the pile of packages had been placed outside the entrance to this quadrangle  i turned and saw that the launch had now been unloaded run out again and was being beached and the whitehaired man was walking towards us he addressed montgomery  and now comes the problem of this uninvited guest  what are we to do with him  he knows something of science said montgomery  im itching to get to work againwith this new stuff said the whitehaired man nodding towards the enclosure his eyes grew brighter  i daresay you are said montgomery in anything but a cordial tone  we cant send him over there and we cant spare the time to build him a new shanty and we certainly cant take him into our confidence just yet  im in your hands said i i had no idea of what he meant by over there  ive been thinking of the same things montgomery answered theres my room with the outer door  thats it said the elder man promptly looking at montgomery and all three of us went towards the enclosure  im sorry to make a mystery mr prendick but youll remember youre uninvited our little establishment here contains a secret or so is a kind of bluebeards chamber in fact  nothing very dreadful really to a sane man but just now as we dont know you  decidedly said i i should be a fool to take offence at any want of confidence  he twisted his heavy mouth into a faint smilehe was one of those saturnine people who smile with the corners of the mouth downand bowed his acknowledgment of my complaisance  the main entrance to the enclosure was passed it was a heavy wooden gate framed in iron and locked with the cargo of the launch piled outside it and at the corner we came to a small doorway i had not previously observed the whitehaired man produced a bundle of keys from the pocket of his greasy blue jacket opened this door and entered his keys and the elaborate lockingup of the place even while it was still under his eye struck me as peculiar  i followed him and found myself in a small apartment plainly but not uncomfortably furnished and with its inner door which was slightly ajar opening into a paved courtyard  this inner door montgomery at once closed a hammock was slung across the darker corner of the room and a small unglazed window defended by an iron bar looked out towards the sea  this the whitehaired man told me was to be my apartment and the inner door which for fear of accidents he said he would lock on the other side was my limit inward he called my attention to a convenient deckchair before the window and to an array of old books chiefly i found surgical works and editions of the latin and greek classics languages i cannot read with any comfort on a shelf near the hammock he left the room by the outer door as if to avoid opening the inner one again  we usually have our meals in here said montgomery and then as if in doubt went out after the other  moreau i heard him call and for the moment i do not think i noticed then as i handled the books on the shelf it came up in consciousness where had i heard the name of moreau before  i sat down before the window took out the biscuits that still remained to me and ate them with an excellent appetite  moreau  through the window i saw one of those unaccountable men in white lugging a packingcase along the beach  presently the windowframe hid him then i heard a key inserted and turned in the lock behind me after a little while i heard through the locked door the noise of the staghounds that had now been brought up from the beach they were not barking but sniffing and growling in a curious fashion i could hear the rapid patter of their feet and montgomerys voice soothing them  i was very much impressed by the elaborate secrecy of these two men regarding the contents of the place and for some time i was thinking of that and of the unaccountable familiarity of the name of moreau but so odd is the human memory that i could not then recall that wellknown name in its proper connection  from that my thoughts went to the indefinable queerness of the deformed man on the beach i never saw such a gait such odd motions as he pulled at the box i recalled that none of these men had spoken to me though most of them i had found looking at me at one time or another in a peculiarly furtive manner quite unlike the frank stare of your unsophisticated savage  indeed they had all seemed remarkably taciturn and when they did speak endowed with very uncanny voices what was wrong with them  then i recalled the eyes of montgomerys ungainly attendant  just as i was thinking of him he came in  he was now dressed in white and carried a little tray with some coffee and boiled vegetables thereon i could hardly repress a shuddering recoil as he came bending amiably and placed the tray before me on the table  then astonishment paralysed me  under his stringy black locks i saw his ear it jumped upon me suddenly close to my face  the man had pointed ears covered with a fine brown fur  your breakfast sair he said  i stared at his face without attempting to answer him  he turned and went towards the door regarding me oddly over his shoulder i followed him out with my eyes and as i did so by some odd trick of unconscious cerebration there came surging into my head the phrase the moreau hollowswas it  the moreau ah  it sent my memory back ten years  the moreau horrors  the phrase drifted loose in my mind for a moment and then i saw it in red lettering on a little buffcoloured pamphlet to read which made one shiver and creep then i remembered distinctly all about it  that longforgotten pamphlet came back with startling vividness to my mind i had been a mere lad then and moreau was i suppose about fiftya prominent and masterful physiologist wellknown in scientific circles for his extraordinary imagination and his brutal directness in discussion  was this the same moreau  he had published some very astonishing facts in connection with the transfusion of blood and in addition was known to be doing valuable work on morbid growths then suddenly his career was closed  he had to leave england a journalist obtained access to his laboratory in the capacity of laboratoryassistant with the deliberate intention of making sensational exposures and by the help of a shocking accident if it was an accident his gruesome pamphlet became notorious on the day of its publication a wretched dog flayed and otherwise mutilated escaped from moreaus house  it was in the silly season and a prominent editor a cousin of the temporary laboratoryassistant appealed to the conscience of the nation it was not the first time that conscience has turned against the methods of research  the doctor was simply howled out of the country it may be that he deserved to be but i still think that the tepid support of his fellowinvestigators and his desertion by the great body of scientific workers was a shameful thing  yet some of his experiments by the journalists account were wantonly cruel he might perhaps have purchased his social peace by abandoning his investigations but he apparently preferred the latter as most men would who have once fallen under the overmastering spell of research he was unmarried and had indeed nothing but his own interest to consider  i felt convinced that this must be the same man  everything pointed to it  it dawned upon me to what end the puma and the other animalswhich had now been brought with other luggage into the enclosure behind the housewere destined and a curious faint odour the halitus of something familiar an odour that had been in the background of my consciousness hitherto suddenly came forward into the forefront of my thoughts  it was the antiseptic odour of the dissectingroom i heard the puma growling through the wall and one of the dogs yelped as though it had been struck  yet surely and especially to another scientific man there was nothing so horrible in vivisection as to account for this secrecy and by some odd leap in my thoughts the pointed ears and luminous eyes of montgomerys attendant came back again before me with the sharpest definition  i stared before me out at the green sea frothing under a freshening breeze and let these and other strange memories of the last few days chase one another through my mind  what could it all mean  a locked enclosure on a lonely island a notorious vivisector and these crippled and distorted men     viii  the crying of the puma   montgomery interrupted my tangle of mystification and suspicion about one oclock and his grotesque attendant followed him with a tray bearing bread some herbs and other eatables a flask of whiskey a jug of water and three glasses and knives i glanced askance at this strange creature and found him watching me with his queer restless eyes  montgomery said he would lunch with me but that moreau was too preoccupied with some work to come  moreau said i  i know that name  the devil you do said he  what an ass i was to mention it to you i might have thought  anyhow it will give you an inkling of ourmysteries  whiskey  no thanks im an abstainer  i wish id been  but its no use locking the door after the steed is stolen  it was that infernal stuff which led to my coming herethat and a foggy night i thought myself in luck at the time when moreau offered to get me off its queer  montgomery said i suddenly as the outer door closed why has your man pointed ears  damn he said over his first mouthful of food  he stared at me for a moment and then repeated pointed ears  little points to them said i as calmly as possible with a catch in my breath and a fine black fur at the edges  he helped himself to whiskey and water with great deliberation i was under the impressionthat his hair covered his ears  i saw them as he stooped by me to put that coffee you sent to me on the table  and his eyes shine in the dark  by this time montgomery had recovered from the surprise of my question i always thought he said deliberately with a certain accentuation of his flavouring of lisp that there was something the matter with his ears from the way he covered them what were they like  i was persuaded from his manner that this ignorance was a pretence still i could hardly tell the man that i thought him a liar pointed i said rather small and furrydistinctly furry but the whole man is one of the strangest beings i ever set eyes on  a sharp hoarse cry of animal pain came from the enclosure behind us its depth and volume testified to the puma  i saw montgomery wince  yes he said  where did you pick up the creature  san francisco  hes an ugly brute i admit  halfwitted you know cant remember where he came from  but im used to him you know we both are  how does he strike you  hes unnatural i said  theres something about himdont think me fanciful but it gives me a nasty little sensation a tightening of my muscles when he comes near me  its a touchof the diabolical in fact  montgomery had stopped eating while i told him this  rum he said i cant see it  he resumed his meal  i had no idea of it he said and masticated  the crew of the schooner must have felt it the same  made a dead set at the poor devil  you saw the captain  suddenly the puma howled again this time more painfully montgomery swore under his breath  i had half a mind to attack him about the men on the beach  then the poor brute within gave vent to a series of short sharp cries  your men on the beach said i what race are they  excellent fellows arent they said he absentmindedly knitting his brows as the animal yelled out sharply  i said no more  there was another outcry worse than the former he looked at me with his dull grey eyes and then took some more whiskey  he tried to draw me into a discussion about alcohol professing to have saved my life with it  he seemed anxious to lay stress on the fact that i owed my life to him  i answered him distractedly  presently our meal came to an end the misshapen monster with the pointed ears cleared the remains away and montgomery left me alone in the room again  all the time he had been in a state of illconcealed irritation at the noise of the vivisected puma he had spoken of his odd want of nerve and left me to the obvious application  i found myself that the cries were singularly irritating and they grew in depth and intensity as the afternoon wore on they were painful at first but their constant resurgence at last altogether upset my balance  i flung aside a crib of horace i had been reading and began to clench my fists to bite my lips and to pace the room  presently i got to stopping my ears with my fingers  the emotional appeal of those yells grew upon me steadily grew at last to such an exquisite expression of suffering that i could stand it in that confined room no longer  i stepped out of the door into the slumberous heat of the late afternoon and walking past the main entrancelocked again i noticedturned the corner of the wall  the crying sounded even louder out of doors  it was as if all the pain in the world had found a voice  yet had i known such pain was in the next room and had it been dumb i believei have thought sincei could have stood it well enough  it is when suffering finds a voice and sets our nerves quivering that this pity comes troubling us but in spite of the brilliant sunlight and the green fans of the trees waving in the soothing seabreeze the world was a confusion blurred with drifting black and red phantasms until i was out of earshot of the house in the chequered wall     ix  the thing in the forest   i strode through the undergrowth that clothed the ridge behind the house scarcely heeding whither i went passed on through the shadow of a thick cluster of straightstemmed trees beyond it and so presently found myself some way on the other side of the ridge and descending towards a streamlet that ran through a narrow valley  i paused and listened the distance i had come or the intervening masses of thicket deadened any sound that might be coming from the enclosure the air was still  then with a rustle a rabbit emerged and went scampering up the slope before me  i hesitated and sat down in the edge of the shade  the place was a pleasant one  the rivulet was hidden by the luxuriant vegetation of the banks save at one point where i caught a triangular patch of its glittering water on the farther side i saw through a bluish haze a tangle of trees and creepers and above these again the luminous blue of the sky here and there a splash of white or crimson marked the blooming of some trailing epiphyte  i let my eyes wander over this scene for a while and then began to turn over in my mind again the strange peculiarities of montgomerys man  but it was too hot to think elaborately and presently i fell into a tranquil state midway between dozing and waking  from this i was aroused after i know not how long by a rustling amidst the greenery on the other side of the stream for a moment i could see nothing but the waving summits of the ferns and reeds  then suddenly upon the bank of the stream appeared somethingat first i could not distinguish what it was it bowed its round head to the water and began to drink then i saw it was a man going on allfours like a beast  he was clothed in bluish cloth and was of a coppercoloured hue with black hair it seemed that grotesque ugliness was an invariable character of these islanders  i could hear the suck of the water at his lips as he drank  i leant forward to see him better and a piece of lava detached by my hand went pattering down the slope  he looked up guiltily and his eyes met mine  forthwith he scrambled to his feet and stood wiping his clumsy hand across his mouth and regarding me his legs were scarcely half the length of his body so staring one another out of countenance we remained for perhaps the space of a minute  then stopping to look back once or twice he slunk off among the bushes to the right of me and i heard the swish of the fronds grow faint in the distance and die away long after he had disappeared i remained sitting up staring in the direction of his retreat  my drowsy tranquillity had gone  i was startled by a noise behind me and turning suddenly saw the flapping white tail of a rabbit vanishing up the slope i jumped to my feet  the apparition of this grotesque halfbestial creature had suddenly populated the stillness of the afternoon for me i looked around me rather nervously and regretted that i was unarmed then i thought that the man i had just seen had been clothed in bluish cloth had not been naked as a savage would have been and i tried to persuade myself from that fact that he was after all probably a peaceful character that the dull ferocity of his countenance belied him  yet i was greatly disturbed at the apparition  i walked to the left along the slope turning my head about and peering this way and that among the straight stems of the trees why should a man go on allfours and drink with his lips  presently i heard an animal wailing again and taking it to be the puma i turned about and walked in a direction diametrically opposite to the sound this led me down to the stream across which i stepped and pushed my way up through the undergrowth beyond  i was startled by a great patch of vivid scarlet on the ground and going up to it found it to be a peculiar fungus branched and corrugated like a foliaceous lichen but deliquescing into slime at the touch and then in the shadow of some luxuriant ferns i came upon an unpleasant thingthe dead body of a rabbit covered with shining flies but still warm and with the head torn off i stopped aghast at the sight of the scattered blood here at least was one visitor to the island disposed of there were no traces of other violence about it  it looked as though it had been suddenly snatched up and killed and as i stared at the little furry body came the difficulty of how the thing had been done the vague dread that had been in my mind since i had seen the inhuman face of the man at the stream grew distincter as i stood there i began to realise the hardihood of my expedition among these unknown people  the thicket about me became altered to my imagination every shadow became something more than a shadowbecame an ambush every rustle became a threat  invisible things seemed watching me i resolved to go back to the enclosure on the beach  i suddenly turned away and thrust myself violently possibly even frantically through the bushes anxious to get a clear space about me again  i stopped just in time to prevent myself emerging upon an open space it was a kind of glade in the forest made by a fall seedlings were already starting up to struggle for the vacant space and beyond the dense growth of stems and twining vines and splashes of fungus and flowers closed in again  before me squatting together upon the fungoid ruins of a huge fallen tree and still unaware of my approach were three grotesque human figures  one was evidently a female the other two were men  they were naked save for swathings of scarlet cloth about the middle and their skins were of a dull pinkishdrab colour such as i had seen in no savages before they had fat heavy chinless faces retreating foreheads and a scant bristly hair upon their heads  i never saw such bestiallooking creatures  they were talking or at least one of the men was talking to the other two and all three had been too closely interested to heed the rustling of my approach  they swayed their heads and shoulders from side to side the speakers words came thick and sloppy and though i could hear them distinctly i could not distinguish what he said he seemed to me to be reciting some complicated gibberish presently his articulation became shriller and spreading his hands he rose to his feet  at that the others began to gibber in unison also rising to their feet spreading their hands and swaying their bodies in rhythm with their chant  i noticed then the abnormal shortness of their legs and their lank clumsy feet  all three began slowly to circle round raising and stamping their feet and waving their arms a kind of tune crept into their rhythmic recitation and a refrainaloola or balloola it sounded like their eyes began to sparkle and their ugly faces to brighten with an expression of strange pleasure  saliva dripped from their lipless mouths  suddenly as i watched their grotesque and unaccountable gestures i perceived clearly for the first time what it was that had offended me what had given me the two inconsistent and conflicting impressions of utter strangeness and yet of the strangest familiarity the three creatures engaged in this mysterious rite were human in shape and yet human beings with the strangest air about them of some familiar animal  each of these creatures despite its human form its rag of clothing and the rough humanity of its bodily form had woven into itinto its movements into the expression of its countenance into its whole presencesome now irresistible suggestion of a hog a swinish taint the unmistakable mark of the beast  i stood overcome by this amazing realisation and then the most horrible questionings came rushing into my mind  they began leaping in the air first one and then the other whooping and grunting  then one slipped and for a moment was on allfoursto recover indeed forthwith but that transitory gleam of the true animalism of these monsters was enough  i turned as noiselessly as possible and becoming every now and then rigid with the fear of being discovered as a branch cracked or a leaf rustled i pushed back into the bushes it was long before i grew bolder and dared to move freely my only idea for the moment was to get away from these foul beings and i scarcely noticed that i had emerged upon a faint pathway amidst the trees then suddenly traversing a little glade i saw with an unpleasant start two clumsy legs among the trees walking with noiseless footsteps parallel with my course and perhaps thirty yards away from me the head and upper part of the body were hidden by a tangle of creeper i stopped abruptly hoping the creature did not see me the feet stopped as i did  so nervous was i that i controlled an impulse to headlong flight with the utmost difficulty then looking hard i distinguished through the interlacing network the head and body of the brute i had seen drinking  he moved his head there was an emerald flash in his eyes as he glanced at me from the shadow of the trees a halfluminous colour that vanished as he turned his head again  he was motionless for a moment and then with a noiseless tread began running through the green confusion in another moment he had vanished behind some bushes i could not see him but i felt that he had stopped and was watching me again  what on earth was heman or beast  what did he want with me i had no weapon not even a stick  flight would be madness at any rate the thing whatever it was lacked the courage to attack me setting my teeth hard i walked straight towards him i was anxious not to show the fear that seemed chilling my backbone i pushed through a tangle of tall whiteflowered bushes and saw him twenty paces beyond looking over his shoulder at me and hesitating  i advanced a step or two looking steadfastly into his eyes  who are you said i  he tried to meet my gaze  no he said suddenly and turning went bounding away from me through the undergrowth  then he turned and stared at me again  his eyes shone brightly out of the dusk under the trees  my heart was in my mouth but i felt my only chance was bluff and walked steadily towards him  he turned again and vanished into the dusk  once more i thought i caught the glint of his eyes and that was all  for the first time i realised how the lateness of the hour might affect me  the sun had set some minutes since the swift dusk of the tropics was already fading out of the eastern sky and a pioneer moth fluttered silently by my head  unless i would spend the night among the unknown dangers of the mysterious forest i must hasten back to the enclosure  the thought of a return to that painhaunted refuge was extremely disagreeable but still more so was the idea of being overtaken in the open by darkness and all that darkness might conceal  i gave one more look into the blue shadows that had swallowed up this odd creature and then retraced my way down the slope towards the stream going as i judged in the direction from which i had come  i walked eagerly my mind confused with many things and presently found myself in a level place among scattered trees the colourless clearness that comes after the sunset flush was darkling the blue sky above grew momentarily deeper and the little stars one by one pierced the attenuated light the interspaces of the trees the gaps in the further vegetation that had been hazy blue in the daylight grew black and mysterious i pushed on  the colour vanished from the world the treetops rose against the luminous blue sky in inky silhouette and all below that outline melted into one formless blackness presently the trees grew thinner and the shrubby undergrowth more abundant  then there was a desolate space covered with a white sand and then another expanse of tangled bushes i did not remember crossing the sandopening before i began to be tormented by a faint rustling upon my right hand i thought at first it was fancy for whenever i stopped there was silence save for the evening breeze in the treetops then when i turned to hurry on again there was an echo to my footsteps  i turned away from the thickets keeping to the more open ground and endeavouring by sudden turns now and then to surprise something in the act of creeping upon me  i saw nothing and nevertheless my sense of another presence grew steadily  i increased my pace and after some time came to a slight ridge crossed it and turned sharply regarding it steadfastly from the further side  it came out black and clearcut against the darkling sky and presently a shapeless lump heaved up momentarily against the skyline and vanished again i felt assured now that my tawnyfaced antagonist was stalking me once more and coupled with that was another unpleasant realisation that i had lost my way  for a time i hurried on hopelessly perplexed and pursued by that stealthy approach  whatever it was the thing either lacked the courage to attack me or it was waiting to take me at some disadvantage i kept studiously to the open  at times i would turn and listen and presently i had half persuaded myself that my pursuer had abandoned the chase or was a mere creation of my disordered imagination then i heard the sound of the sea  i quickened my footsteps almost into a run and immediately there was a stumble in my rear  i turned suddenly and stared at the uncertain trees behind me one black shadow seemed to leap into another  i listened rigid and heard nothing but the creep of the blood in my ears i thought that my nerves were unstrung and that my imagination was tricking me and turned resolutely towards the sound of the sea again  in a minute or so the trees grew thinner and i emerged upon a bare low headland running out into the sombre water the night was calm and clear and the reflection of the growing multitude of the stars shivered in the tranquil heaving of the sea some way out the wash upon an irregular band of reef shone with a pallid light of its own  westward i saw the zodiacal light mingling with the yellow brilliance of the evening star the coast fell away from me to the east and westward it was hidden by the shoulder of the cape  then i recalled the fact that moreaus beach lay to the west  a twig snapped behind me and there was a rustle  i turned and stood facing the dark trees  i could see nothingor else i could see too much every dark form in the dimness had its ominous quality its peculiar suggestion of alert watchfulness  so i stood for perhaps a minute and then with an eye to the trees still turned westward to cross the headland and as i moved one among the lurking shadows moved to follow me  my heart beat quickly  presently the broad sweep of a bay to the westward became visible and i halted again the noiseless shadow halted a dozen yards from me a little point of light shone on the further bend of the curve and the grey sweep of the sandy beach lay faint under the starlight perhaps two miles away was that little point of light to get to the beach i should have to go through the trees where the shadows lurked and down a bushy slope  i could see the thing rather more distinctly now  it was no animal for it stood erect  at that i opened my mouth to speak and found a hoarse phlegm choked my voice  i tried again and shouted who is there  there was no answer  i advanced a step the thing did not move only gathered itself together  my foot struck a stone  that gave me an idea  without taking my eyes off the black form before me i stooped and picked up this lump of rock but at my motion the thing turned abruptly as a dog might have done and slunk obliquely into the further darkness  then i recalled a schoolboy expedient against big dogs and twisted the rock into my handkerchief and gave this a turn round my wrist  i heard a movement further off among the shadows as if the thing was in retreat then suddenly my tense excitement gave way i broke into a profuse perspiration and fell atrembling with my adversary routed and this weapon in my hand  it was some time before i could summon resolution to go down through the trees and bushes upon the flank of the headland to the beach at last i did it at a run and as i emerged from the thicket upon the sand i heard some other body come crashing after me at that i completely lost my head with fear and began running along the sand  forthwith there came the swift patter of soft feet in pursuit  i gave a wild cry and redoubled my pace some dim black things about three or four times the size of rabbits went running or hopping up from the beach towards the bushes as i passed  so long as i live i shall remember the terror of that chase i ran near the waters edge and heard every now and then the splash of the feet that gained upon me  far away hopelessly far was the yellow light  all the night about us was black and still splash splash came the pursuing feet nearer and nearer i felt my breath going for i was quite out of training it whooped as i drew it and i felt a pain like a knife at my side  i perceived the thing would come up with me long before i reached the enclosure and desperate and sobbing for my breath i wheeled round upon it and struck at it as it came up to mestruck with all my strength the stone came out of the sling of the handkerchief as i did so as i turned the thing which had been running on allfours rose to its feet and the missile fell fair on its left temple the skull rang loud and the animalman blundered into me thrust me back with its hands and went staggering past me to fall headlong upon the sand with its face in the water and there it lay still  i could not bring myself to approach that black heap  i left it there with the water rippling round it under the still stars and giving it a wide berth pursued my way towards the yellow glow of the house and presently with a positive effect of relief came the pitiful moaning of the puma the sound that had originally driven me out to explore this mysterious island at that though i was faint and horribly fatigued i gathered together all my strength and began running again towards the light i thought i heard a voice calling me     x  the crying of the man   as i drew near the house i saw that the light shone from the open door of my room and then i heard coming from out of the darkness at the side of that orange oblong of light the voice of montgomery shouting prendick  i continued running presently i heard him again  i replied by a feeble hullo and in another moment had staggered up to him  where have you been said he holding me at arms length so that the light from the door fell on my face  we have both been so busy that we forgot you until about half an hour ago he led me into the room and sat me down in the deck chair for awhile i was blinded by the light  we did not think you would start to explore this island of ours without telling us he said and then i was afraidbutwhathullo  my last remaining strength slipped from me and my head fell forward on my chest  i think he found a certain satisfaction in giving me brandy  for gods sake said i fasten that door  youve been meeting some of our curiosities eh said he  he locked the door and turned to me again  he asked me no questions but gave me some more brandy and water and pressed me to eat i was in a state of collapse  he said something vague about his forgetting to warn me and asked me briefly when i left the house and what i had seen  i answered him as briefly in fragmentary sentences  tell me what it all means said i in a state bordering on hysterics  its nothing so very dreadful said he  but i think you have had about enough for one day  the puma suddenly gave a sharp yell of pain  at that he swore under his breath im damned said he if this place is not as bad as gower street with its cats  montgomery said i what was that thing that came after me was it a beast or was it a man  if you dont sleep tonight he said youll be off your head tomorrow  i stood up in front of him  what was that thing that came after me i asked  he looked me squarely in the eyes and twisted his mouth askew his eyes which had seemed animated a minute before went dull from your account said he im thinking it was a bogle  i felt a gust of intense irritation which passed as quickly as it came i flung myself into the chair again and pressed my hands on my forehead the puma began once more  montgomery came round behind me and put his hand on my shoulder look here prendick he said i had no business to let you drift out into this silly island of ours  but its not so bad as you feel man  your nerves are worked to rags let me give you something that will make you sleep  thatwill keep on for hours yet  you must simply get to sleep or i wont answer for it  i did not reply  i bowed forward and covered my face with my hands presently he returned with a small measure containing a dark liquid this he gave me  i took it unresistingly and he helped me into the hammock  when i awoke it was broad day  for a little while i lay flat staring at the roof above me  the rafters i observed were made out of the timbers of a ship  then i turned my head and saw a meal prepared for me on the table  i perceived that i was hungry and prepared to clamber out of the hammock which very politely anticipating my intention twisted round and deposited me upon allfours on the floor  i got up and sat down before the food  i had a heavy feeling in my head and only the vaguest memory at first of the things that had happened over night  the morning breeze blew very pleasantly through the unglazed window and that and the food contributed to the sense of animal comfort which i experienced presently the door behind methe door inward towards the yard of the enclosureopened  i turned and saw montgomerys face  all right said he  im frightfully busy  and he shut the door  afterwards i discovered that he forgot to relock it then i recalled the expression of his face the previous night and with that the memory of all i had experienced reconstructed itself before me  even as that fear came back to me came a cry from within but this time it was not the cry of a puma i put down the mouthful that hesitated upon my lips and listened silence save for the whisper of the morning breeze  i began to think my ears had deceived me  after a long pause i resumed my meal but with my ears still vigilant presently i heard something else very faint and low i sat as if frozen in my attitude  though it was faint and low it moved me more profoundly than all that i had hitherto heard of the abominations behind the wall  there was no mistake this time in the quality of the dim broken sounds no doubt at all of their source for it was groaning broken by sobs and gasps of anguish it was no brute this time it was a human being in torment  as i realised this i rose and in three steps had crossed the room seized the handle of the door into the yard and flung it open before me  prendick man  stop cried montgomery intervening  a startled deerhound yelped and snarled  there was blood i saw in the sinkbrown and some scarletand i smelt the peculiar smell of carbolic acid  then through an open doorway beyond in the dim light of the shadow i saw something bound painfully upon a framework scarred red and bandaged and then blotting this out appeared the face of old moreau white and terrible in a moment he had gripped me by the shoulder with a hand that was smeared red had twisted me off my feet and flung me headlong back into my own room  he lifted me as though i was a little child i fell at full length upon the floor and the door slammed and shut out the passionate intensity of his face then i heard the key turn in the lock and montgomerys voice in expostulation  ruin the work of a lifetime i heard moreau say  he does not understand said montgomery  and other things that were inaudible  i cant spare the time yet said moreau  the rest i did not hear  i picked myself up and stood trembling my mind a chaos of the most horrible misgivings  could it be possible i thought that such a thing as the vivisection of men was carried on here  the question shot like lightning across a tumultuous sky and suddenly the clouded horror of my mind condensed into a vivid realisation of my own danger     xi  the hunting of the man   it came before my mind with an unreasonable hope of escape that the outer door of my room was still open to me  i was convinced now absolutely assured that moreau had been vivisecting a human being all the time since i had heard his name i had been trying to link in my mind in some way the grotesque animalism of the islanders with his abominations and now i thought i saw it all the memory of his work on the transfusion of blood recurred to me these creatures i had seen were the victims of some hideous experiment these sickening scoundrels had merely intended to keep me back to fool me with their display of confidence and presently to fall upon me with a fate more horrible than deathwith torture and after torture the most hideous degradation it is possible to conceiveto send me off a lost soul a beast to the rest of their comus rout  i looked round for some weapon  nothing  then with an inspiration i turned over the deck chair put my foot on the side of it and tore away the side rail  it happened that a nail came away with the wood and projecting gave a touch of danger to an otherwise petty weapon i heard a step outside and incontinently flung open the door and found montgomery within a yard of it  he meant to lock the outer door i raised this nailed stick of mine and cut at his face but he sprang back  i hesitated a moment then turned and fled round the corner of the house  prendick man  i heard his astonished cry dont be a silly ass man  another minute thought i and he would have had me locked in and as ready as a hospital rabbit for my fate  he emerged behind the corner for i heard him shout prendick  then he began to run after me shouting things as he ran  this time running blindly i went northeastward in a direction at right angles to my previous expedition  once as i went running headlong up the beach i glanced over my shoulder and saw his attendant with him i ran furiously up the slope over it then turning eastward along a rocky valley fringed on either side with jungle i ran for perhaps a mile altogether my chest straining my heart beating in my ears and then hearing nothing of montgomery or his man and feeling upon the verge of exhaustion i doubled sharply back towards the beach as i judged and lay down in the shelter of a canebrake there i remained for a long time too fearful to move and indeed too fearful even to plan a course of action  the wild scene about me lay sleeping silently under the sun and the only sound near me was the thin hum of some small gnats that had discovered me  presently i became aware of a drowsy breathing sound the soughing of the sea upon the beach  after about an hour i heard montgomery shouting my name far away to the north  that set me thinking of my plan of action as i interpreted it then this island was inhabited only by these two vivisectors and their animalised victims  some of these no doubt they could press into their service against me if need arose i knew both moreau and montgomery carried revolvers and save for a feeble bar of deal spiked with a small nail the merest mockery of a mace i was unarmed  so i lay still there until i began to think of food and drink and at that thought the real hopelessness of my position came home to me i knew no way of getting anything to eat  i was too ignorant of botany to discover any resort of root or fruit that might lie about me i had no means of trapping the few rabbits upon the island it grew blanker the more i turned the prospect over  at last in the desperation of my position my mind turned to the animal men i had encountered  i tried to find some hope in what i remembered of them in turn i recalled each one i had seen and tried to draw some augury of assistance from my memory  then suddenly i heard a staghound bay and at that realised a new danger i took little time to think or they would have caught me then but snatching up my nailed stick rushed headlong from my hidingplace towards the sound of the sea  i remember a growth of thorny plants with spines that stabbed like penknives i emerged bleeding and with torn clothes upon the lip of a long creek opening northward i went straight into the water without a minutes hesitation wading up the creek and presently finding myself kneedeep in a little stream i scrambled out at last on the westward bank and with my heart beating loudly in my ears crept into a tangle of ferns to await the issue i heard the dog there was only one draw nearer and yelp when it came to the thorns  then i heard no more and presently began to think i had escaped  the minutes passed the silence lengthened out and at last after an hour of security my courage began to return to me by this time i was no longer very much terrified or very miserable i had as it were passed the limit of terror and despair i felt now that my life was practically lost and that persuasion made me capable of daring anything  i had even a certain wish to encounter moreau face to face and as i had waded into the water i remembered that if i were too hard pressed at least one path of escape from torment still lay open to methey could not very well prevent my drowning myself  i had half a mind to drown myself then but an odd wish to see the whole adventure out a queer impersonal spectacular interest in myself restrained me i stretched my limbs sore and painful from the pricks of the spiny plants and stared around me at the trees and so suddenly that it seemed to jump out of the green tracery about it my eyes lit upon a black face watching me  i saw that it was the simian creature who had met the launch upon the beach  he was clinging to the oblique stem of a palmtree i gripped my stick and stood up facing him he began chattering  you you you was all i could distinguish at first  suddenly he dropped from the tree and in another moment was holding the fronds apart and staring curiously at me  i did not feel the same repugnance towards this creature which i had experienced in my encounters with the other beast men you he said in the boat  he was a man thenat least as much of a man as montgomerys attendantfor he could talk  yes i said i came in the boat  from the ship  oh he said and his bright restless eyes travelled over me to my hands to the stick i carried to my feet to the tattered places in my coat and the cuts and scratches i had received from the thorns he seemed puzzled at something  his eyes came back to my hands he held his own hand out and counted his digits slowly one two three four fiveeigh  i did not grasp his meaning then afterwards i was to find that a great proportion of these beast people had malformed hands lacking sometimes even three digits  but guessing this was in some way a greeting i did the same thing by way of reply he grinned with immense satisfaction  then his swift roving glance went round again he made a swift movementand vanished the fern fronds he had stood between came swishing together  i pushed out of the brake after him and was astonished to find him swinging cheerfully by one lank arm from a rope of creepers that looped down from the foliage overhead  his back was to me  hullo said i  he came down with a twisting jump and stood facing me  i say said i where can i get something to eat  eat he said  eat mans food now  and his eye went back to the swing of ropes  at the huts  but where are the huts  oh  im new you know  at that he swung round and set off at a quick walk all his motions were curiously rapid  come along said he  i went with him to see the adventure out  i guessed the huts were some rough shelter where he and some more of these beast people lived i might perhaps find them friendly find some handle in their minds to take hold of  i did not know how far they had forgotten their human heritage  my apelike companion trotted along by my side with his hands hanging down and his jaw thrust forward  i wondered what memory he might have in him  how long have you been on this island said i  how long he asked and after having the question repeated he held up three fingers  the creature was little better than an idiot  i tried to make out what he meant by that and it seems i bored him after another question or two he suddenly left my side and went leaping at some fruit that hung from a tree  he pulled down a handful of prickly husks and went on eating the contents i noted this with satisfaction for here at least was a hint for feeding i tried him with some other questions but his chattering prompt responses were as often as not quite at cross purposes with my question some few were appropriate others quite parrotlike  i was so intent upon these peculiarities that i scarcely noticed the path we followed  presently we came to trees all charred and brown and so to a bare place covered with a yellowwhite incrustation across which a drifting smoke pungent in whiffs to nose and eyes went drifting  on our right over a shoulder of bare rock i saw the level blue of the sea  the path coiled down abruptly into a narrow ravine between two tumbled and knotty masses of blackish scoriae into this we plunged  it was extremely dark this passage after the blinding sunlight reflected from the sulphurous ground  its walls grew steep and approached each other  blotches of green and crimson drifted across my eyes my conductor stopped suddenly  home said he and i stood in a floor of a chasm that was at first absolutely dark to me i heard some strange noises and thrust the knuckles of my left hand into my eyes  i became aware of a disagreeable odor like that of a monkeys cage illcleaned beyond the rock opened again upon a gradual slope of sunlit greenery and on either hand the light smote down through narrow ways into the central gloom     xii  the sayers of the law   then something cold touched my hand  i started violently and saw close to me a dim pinkish thing looking more like a flayed child than anything else in the world  the creature had exactly the mild but repulsive features of a sloth the same low forehead and slow gestures  as the first shock of the change of light passed i saw about me more distinctly  the little slothlike creature was standing and staring at me  my conductor had vanished  the place was a narrow passage between high walls of lava a crack in the knotted rock and on either side interwoven heaps of seamat palmfans and reeds leaning against the rock formed rough and impenetrably dark dens the winding way up the ravine between these was scarcely three yards wide and was disfigured by lumps of decaying fruitpulp and other refuse which accounted for the disagreeable stench of the place  the little pink slothcreature was still blinking at me when my apeman reappeared at the aperture of the nearest of these dens and beckoned me in  as he did so a slouching monster wriggled out of one of the places further up this strange street and stood up in featureless silhouette against the bright green beyond staring at me i hesitated having half a mind to bolt the way i had come and then determined to go through with the adventure i gripped my nailed stick about the middle and crawled into the little evilsmelling leanto after my conductor  it was a semicircular space shaped like the half of a beehive and against the rocky wall that formed the inner side of it was a pile of variegated fruits cocoanuts among others  some rough vessels of lava and wood stood about the floor and one on a rough stool there was no fire  in the darkest corner of the hut sat a shapeless mass of darkness that grunted hey as i came in and my apeman stood in the dim light of the doorway and held out a split cocoanut to me as i crawled into the other corner and squatted down i took it and began gnawing it as serenely as possible in spite of a certain trepidation and the nearly intolerable closeness of the den the little pink slothcreature stood in the aperture of the hut and something else with a drab face and bright eyes came staring over its shoulder  hey came out of the lump of mystery opposite  it is a man  it is a man gabbled my conductor a man a man a fiveman like me  shut up said the voice from the dark and grunted i gnawed my cocoanut amid an impressive stillness  i peered hard into the blackness but could distinguish nothing  it is a man the voice repeated  he comes to live with us  it was a thick voice with something in ita kind of whistling overtonethat struck me as peculiar but the english accent was strangely good  the apeman looked at me as though he expected something i perceived the pause was interrogative  he comes to live with you i said  it is a man  he must learn the law  i began to distinguish now a deeper blackness in the black a vague outline of a hunchedup figure  then i noticed the opening of the place was darkened by two more black heads my hand tightened on my stick  the thing in the dark repeated in a louder tone say the words i had missed its last remark  not to go on allfours that is the law it repeated in a kind of singsong  i was puzzled  say the words said the apeman repeating and the figures in the doorway echoed this with a threat in the tone of their voices  i realised that i had to repeat this idiotic formula and then began the insanest ceremony  the voice in the dark began intoning a mad litany line by line and i and the rest to repeat it as they did so they swayed from side to side in the oddest way and beat their hands upon their knees and i followed their example i could have imagined i was already dead and in another world that dark hut these grotesque dim figures just flecked here and there by a glimmer of light and all of them swaying in unison and chanting       not to go on allfours that is the law  are we not men      not to suck up drink that is the law  are we not men      not to eat fish or flesh that is the law  are we not men      not to claw the bark of trees that is the law  are we not men      not to chase other men that is the law  are we not men  and so from the prohibition of these acts of folly on to the prohibition of what i thought then were the maddest most impossible and most indecent things one could well imagine a kind of rhythmic fervour fell on all of us we gabbled and swayed faster and faster repeating this amazing law superficially the contagion of these brutes was upon me but deep down within me the laughter and disgust struggled together we ran through a long list of prohibitions and then the chant swung round to a new formula       his is the house of pain      his is the hand that makes      his is the hand that wounds      his is the hand that heals  and so on for another long series mostly quite incomprehensible gibberish to me about him whoever he might be  i could have fancied it was a dream but never before have i heard chanting in a dream  his is the lightning flash we sang  his is the deep salt sea  a horrible fancy came into my head that moreau after animalising these men had infected their dwarfed brains with a kind of deification of himself  however i was too keenly aware of white teeth and strong claws about me to stop my chanting on that account  his are the stars in the sky  at last that song ended  i saw the apemans face shining with perspiration and my eyes being now accustomed to the darkness i saw more distinctly the figure in the corner from which the voice came it was the size of a man but it seemed covered with a dull grey hair almost like a skyeterrier what was it  what were they all imagine yourself surrounded by all the most horrible cripples and maniacs it is possible to conceive and you may understand a little of my feelings with these grotesque caricatures of humanity about me  he is a fiveman a fiveman a fivemanlike me said the apeman  i held out my hands  the grey creature in the corner leant forward  not to run on allfours that is the law  are we not men he said  he put out a strangely distorted talon and gripped my fingers the thing was almost like the hoof of a deer produced into claws i could have yelled with surprise and pain  his face came forward and peered at my nails came forward into the light of the opening of the hut and i saw with a quivering disgust that it was like the face of neither man nor beast but a mere shock of grey hair with three shadowy overarchings to mark the eyes and mouth  he has little nails said this grisly creature in his hairy beard it is well  he threw my hand down and instinctively i gripped my stick  eat roots and herbs it is his will said the apeman  i am the sayer of the law said the grey figure  here come all that be new to learn the law  i sit in the darkness and say the law  it is even so said one of the beasts in the doorway  evil are the punishments of those who break the law none escape  none escape said the beast folk glancing furtively at one another  none none said the apemannone escape  see  i did a little thing a wrong thing once  i jabbered jabbered stopped talking none could understand  i am burnt branded in the hand  he is great he is good  none escape said the grey creature in the corner  none escape said the beast people looking askance at one another  for every one the want that is bad said the grey sayer of the law what you will want we do not know we shall know  some want to follow things that move to watch and slink and wait and spring to kill and bite bite deep and rich sucking the blood it is bad  not to chase other men that is the law are we not men  not to eat flesh or fish that is the law  are we not men  none escape said a dappled brute standing in the doorway  for every one the want is bad said the grey sayer of the law some want to go tearing with teeth and hands into the roots of things snuffing into the earth  it is bad  none escape said the men in the door  some go clawing trees some go scratching at the graves of the dead some go fighting with foreheads or feet or claws some bite suddenly none giving occasion some love uncleanness  none escape said the apeman scratching his calf  none escape said the little pink slothcreature  punishment is sharp and sure  therefore learn the law say the words  and incontinently he began again the strange litany of the law and again i and all these creatures began singing and swaying my head reeled with this jabbering and the close stench of the place but i kept on trusting to find presently some chance of a new development  not to go on allfours that is the law  are we not men  we were making such a noise that i noticed nothing of a tumult outside until some one who i think was one of the two swine men i had seen thrust his head over the little pink slothcreature and shouted something excitedly something that i did not catch incontinently those at the opening of the hut vanished my apeman rushed out the thing that had sat in the dark followed him i only observed that it was big and clumsy and covered with silvery hair and i was left alone  then before i reached the aperture i heard the yelp of a staghound  in another moment i was standing outside the hovel my chairrail in my hand every muscle of me quivering  before me were the clumsy backs of perhaps a score of these beast people their misshapen heads half hidden by their shoulderblades they were gesticulating excitedly other halfanimal faces glared interrogation out of the hovels looking in the direction in which they faced i saw coming through the haze under the trees beyond the end of the passage of dens the dark figure and awful white face of moreau  he was holding the leaping staghound back and close behind him came montgomery revolver in hand  for a moment i stood horrorstruck i turned and saw the passage behind me blocked by another heavy brute with a huge grey face and twinkling little eyes advancing towards me i looked round and saw to the right of me and a halfdozen yards in front of me a narrow gap in the wall of rock through which a ray of light slanted into the shadows  stop cried moreau as i strode towards this and then hold him  at that first one face turned towards me and then others their bestial minds were happily slow  i dashed my shoulder into a clumsy monster who was turning to see what moreau meant and flung him forward into another  i felt his hands fly round clutching at me and missing me  the little pink slothcreature dashed at me and i gashed down its ugly face with the nail in my stick and in another minute was scrambling up a steep side pathway a kind of sloping chimney out of the ravine i heard a howl behind me and cries of catch him  hold him and the greyfaced creature appeared behind me and jammed his huge bulk into the cleft  go on go on they howled i clambered up the narrow cleft in the rock and came out upon the sulphur on the westward side of the village of the beast men  that gap was altogether fortunate for me for the narrow chimney slanting obliquely upward must have impeded the nearer pursuers i ran over the white space and down a steep slope through a scattered growth of trees and came to a lowlying stretch of tall reeds through which i pushed into a dark thick undergrowth that was black and succulent under foot as i plunged into the reeds my foremost pursuers emerged from the gap i broke my way through this undergrowth for some minutes the air behind me and about me was soon full of threatening cries i heard the tumult of my pursuers in the gap up the slope then the crashing of the reeds and every now and then the crackling crash of a branch  some of the creatures roared like excited beasts of prey the staghound yelped to the left  i heard moreau and montgomery shouting in the same direction  i turned sharply to the right  it seemed to me even then that i heard montgomery shouting for me to run for my life  presently the ground gave rich and oozy under my feet but i was desperate and went headlong into it struggled through kneedeep and so came to a winding path among tall canes  the noise of my pursuers passed away to my left  in one place three strange pink hopping animals about the size of cats bolted before my footsteps this pathway ran up hill across another open space covered with white incrustation and plunged into a canebrake again then suddenly it turned parallel with the edge of a steepwalled gap which came without warning like the haha of an english parkturned with an unexpected abruptness  i was still running with all my might and i never saw this drop until i was flying headlong through the air  i fell on my forearms and head among thorns and rose with a torn ear and bleeding face  i had fallen into a precipitous ravine rocky and thorny full of a hazy mist which drifted about me in wisps and with a narrow streamlet from which this mist came meandering down the centre  i was astonished at this thin fog in the full blaze of daylight but i had no time to stand wondering then i turned to my right downstream hoping to come to the sea in that direction and so have my way open to drown myself it was only later i found that i had dropped my nailed stick in my fall  presently the ravine grew narrower for a space and carelessly i stepped into the stream  i jumped out again pretty quickly for the water was almost boiling  i noticed too there was a thin sulphurous scum drifting upon its coiling water  almost immediately came a turn in the ravine and the indistinct blue horizon the nearer sea was flashing the sun from a myriad facets i saw my death before me but i was hot and panting with the warm blood oozing out on my face and running pleasantly through my veins i felt more than a touch of exultation too at having distanced my pursuers  it was not in me then to go out and drown myself yet i stared back the way i had come  i listened  save for the hum of the gnats and the chirp of some small insects that hopped among the thorns the air was absolutely still then came the yelp of a dog very faint and a chattering and gibbering the snap of a whip and voices  they grew louder then fainter again the noise receded up the stream and faded away  for a while the chase was over but i knew now how much hope of help for me lay in the beast people     xiii  a parley   i turned again and went on down towards the sea  i found the hot stream broadened out to a shallow weedy sand in which an abundance of crabs and longbodied manylegged creatures started from my footfall i walked to the very edge of the salt water and then i felt i was safe i turned and stared arms akimbo at the thick green behind me into which the steamy ravine cut like a smoking gash but as i say i was too full of excitement and a true saying though those who have never known danger may doubt it too desperate to die  then it came into my head that there was one chance before me yet while moreau and montgomery and their bestial rabble chased me through the island might i not go round the beach until i came to their enclosuremake a flank march upon them in fact and then with a rock lugged out of their looselybuilt wall perhaps smash in the lock of the smaller door and see what i could find knife pistol or what not to fight them with when they returned it was at any rate something to try  so i turned to the westward and walked along by the waters edge the setting sun flashed his blinding heat into my eyes the slight pacific tide was running in with a gentle ripple presently the shore fell away southward and the sun came round upon my right hand  then suddenly far in front of me i saw first one and then several figures emerging from the bushesmoreau with his grey staghound then montgomery and two others at that i stopped  they saw me and began gesticulating and advancing  i stood watching them approach  the two beast men came running forward to cut me off from the undergrowth inland  montgomery came running also but straight towards me  moreau followed slower with the dog  at last i roused myself from my inaction and turning seaward walked straight into the water  the water was very shallow at first i was thirty yards out before the waves reached to my waist dimly i could see the intertidal creatures darting away from my feet  what are you doing man cried montgomery  i turned standing waist deep and stared at them montgomery stood panting at the margin of the water  his face was brightred with exertion his long flaxen hair blown about his head and his dropping nether lip showed his irregular teeth moreau was just coming up his face pale and firm and the dog at his hand barked at me  both men had heavy whips  farther up the beach stared the beast men  what am i doing  i am going to drown myself said i  montgomery and moreau looked at each other  why asked moreau  because that is better than being tortured by you  i told you so said montgomery and moreau said something in a low tone  what makes you think i shall torture you asked moreau  what i saw i said  and thoseyonder  hush said moreau and held up his hand  i will not said i they were men  what are they now i at least will not be like them  i looked past my interlocutors  up the beach were mling montgomerys attendant and one of the whiteswathed brutes from the boat farther up in the shadow of the trees i saw my little apeman and behind him some other dim figures  who are these creatures said i pointing to them and raising my voice more and more that it might reach them  they were men men like yourselves whom you have infected with some bestial taintmen whom you have enslaved and whom you still fear  you who listen i cried pointing now to moreau and shouting past him to the beast menyou who listen  do you not see these men still fear you go in dread of you  why then do you fear them you are many  for gods sake cried montgomery stop that prendick  prendick cried moreau  they both shouted together as if to drown my voice and behind them lowered the staring faces of the beast men wondering their deformed hands hanging down their shoulders hunched up they seemed as i fancied to be trying to understand me to remember i thought something of their human past  i went on shouting i scarcely remember whatthat moreau and montgomery could be killed that they were not to be feared that was the burden of what i put into the heads of the beast people i saw the greeneyed man in the dark rags who had met me on the evening of my arrival come out from among the trees and others followed him to hear me better  at last for want of breath i paused  listen to me for a moment said the steady voice of moreau and then say what you will  well said i  he coughed thought then shouted  latin prendick bad latin schoolboy latin but try and understand  hi non sunt homines sunt animalia qui nos habemusvivisected  a humanising process i will explain  come ashore  i laughed  a pretty story said i they talk build houses they were men  its likely ill come ashore  the water just beyond where you stand is deepand full of sharks  thats my way said i short and sharp  presently  wait a minute  he took something out of his pocket that flashed back the sun and dropped the object at his feet  thats a loaded revolver said he  montgomery here will do the same  now we are going up the beach until you are satisfied the distance is safe then come and take the revolvers  not i  you have a third between you  i want you to think over things prendick  in the first place i never asked you to come upon this island  if we vivisected men we should import men not beasts  in the next we had you drugged last night had we wanted to work you any mischief and in the next now your first panic is over and you can think a little is montgomery here quite up to the character you give him we have chased you for your good  because this island is full of inimical phenomena  besides why should we want to shoot you when you have just offered to drown yourself  why did you setyour people onto me when i was in the hut  we felt sure of catching you and bringing you out of danger afterwards we drew away from the scent for your good  i mused  it seemed just possible  then i remembered something again but i saw said i in the enclosure  that was the puma  look here prendick said montgomery youre a silly ass come out of the water and take these revolvers and talk we cant do anything more than we could do now  i will confess that then and indeed always i distrusted and dreaded moreau but montgomery was a man i felt i understood  go up the beach said i after thinking and added holding your hands up  cant do that said montgomery with an explanatory nod over his shoulder  undignified  go up to the trees then said i as you please  its a damned silly ceremony said montgomery  both turned and faced the six or seven grotesque creatures who stood there in the sunlight solid casting shadows moving and yet so incredibly unreal  montgomery cracked his whip at them and forthwith they all turned and fled helterskelter into the trees and when montgomery and moreau were at a distance i judged sufficient i waded ashore and picked up and examined the revolvers to satisfy myself against the subtlest trickery i discharged one at a round lump of lava and had the satisfaction of seeing the stone pulverised and the beach splashed with lead  still i hesitated for a moment  ill take the risk said i at last and with a revolver in each hand i walked up the beach towards them  thats better said moreau without affectation  as it is you have wasted the best part of my day with your confounded imagination and with a touch of contempt which humiliated me he and montgomery turned and went on in silence before me  the knot of beast men still wondering stood back among the trees i passed them as serenely as possible  one started to follow me but retreated again when montgomery cracked his whip  the rest stood silentwatching  they may once have been animals but i never before saw an animal trying to think     xiv  doctor moreau explains   and now prendick i will explain said doctor moreau so soon as we had eaten and drunk  i must confess that you are the most dictatorial guest i ever entertained i warn you that this is the last i shall do to oblige you the next thing you threaten to commit suicide about i shant doeven at some personal inconvenience  he sat in my deck chair a cigar half consumed in his white dexterouslooking fingers  the light of the swinging lamp fell on his white hair he stared through the little window out at the starlight i sat as far away from him as possible the table between us and the revolvers to hand  montgomery was not present i did not care to be with the two of them in such a little room  you admit that the vivisected human being as you called it is after all only the puma said moreau  he had made me visit that horror in the inner room to assure myself of its inhumanity  it is the puma i said still alive but so cut and mutilated as i pray i may never see living flesh again  of all vile  never mind that said moreau at least spare me those youthful horrors  montgomery used to be just the same you admit that it is the puma  now be quiet while i reel off my physiological lecture to you  and forthwith beginning in the tone of a man supremely bored but presently warming a little he explained his work to me he was very simple and convincing  now and then there was a touch of sarcasm in his voice  presently i found myself hot with shame at our mutual positions  the creatures i had seen were not men had never been men they were animals humanised animalstriumphs of vivisection  you forget all that a skilled vivisector can do with living things said moreau  for my own part im puzzled why the things i have done here have not been done before  small efforts of course have been madeamputation tonguecutting excisions of course you know a squint may be induced or cured by surgery then in the case of excisions you have all kinds of secondary changes pigmentary disturbances modifications of the passions alterations in the secretion of fatty tissue  i have no doubt you have heard of these things  of course said i but these foul creatures of yours  all in good time said he waving his hand at me i am only beginning those are trivial cases of alteration  surgery can do better things than that  there is building up as well as breaking down and changing you have heard perhaps of a common surgical operation resorted to in cases where the nose has been destroyed  a flap of skin is cut from the forehead turned down on the nose and heals in the new position this is a kind of grafting in a new position of part of an animal upon itself  grafting of freshly obtained material from another animal is also possiblethe case of teeth for example the grafting of skin and bone is done to facilitate healing the surgeon places in the middle of the wound pieces of skin snipped from another animal or fragments of bone from a victim freshly killed hunters cockspurpossibly you have heard of thatflourished on the bulls neck and the rhinoceros rats of the algerian zouaves are also to be thought ofmonsters manufactured by transferring a slip from the tail of an ordinary rat to its snout and allowing it to heal in that position  monsters manufactured said i then you mean to tell me  yes  these creatures you have seen are animals carven and wrought into new shapes  to that to the study of the plasticity of living forms my life has been devoted  i have studied for years gaining in knowledge as i go  i see you look horrified and yet i am telling you nothing new  it all lay in the surface of practical anatomy years ago but no one had the temerity to touch it it is not simply the outward form of an animal which i can change the physiology the chemical rhythm of the creature may also be made to undergo an enduring modificationof which vaccination and other methods of inoculation with living or dead matter are examples that will no doubt be familiar to you  a similar operation is the transfusion of bloodwith which subject indeed i began these are all familiar cases  less so and probably far more extensive were the operations of those mediaeval practitioners who made dwarfs and beggarcripples showmonsterssome vestiges of whose art still remain in the preliminary manipulation of the young mountebank or contortionist  victor hugo gives an account of them in lhomme qui ritbut perhaps my meaning grows plain now you begin to see that it is a possible thing to transplant tissue from one part of an animal to another or from one animal to another to alter its chemical reactions and methods of growth to modify the articulations of its limbs and indeed to change it in its most intimate structure  and yet this extraordinary branch of knowledge has never been sought as an end and systematically by modern investigators until i took it up some such things have been hit upon in the last resort of surgery most of the kindred evidence that will recur to your mind has been demonstrated as it were by accidentby tyrants by criminals by the breeders of horses and dogs by all kinds of untrained clumsyhanded men working for their own immediate ends i was the first man to take up this question armed with antiseptic surgery and with a really scientific knowledge of the laws of growth yet one would imagine it must have been practised in secret before such creatures as the siamese twinsand in the vaults of the inquisition  no doubt their chief aim was artistic torture but some at least of the inquisitors must have had a touch of scientific curiosity  but said i these thingsthese animals talk  he said that was so and proceeded to point out that the possibility of vivisection does not stop at a mere physical metamorphosis a pig may be educated  the mental structure is even less determinate than the bodily  in our growing science of hypnotism we find the promise of a possibility of superseding old inherent instincts by new suggestions grafting upon or replacing the inherited fixed ideas very much indeed of what we call moral education he said is such an artificial modification and perversion of instinct pugnacity is trained into courageous selfsacrifice and suppressed sexuality into religious emotion  and the great difference between man and monkey is in the larynx he continuedin the incapacity to frame delicately different soundsymbols by which thought could be sustained  in this i failed to agree with him but with a certain incivility he declined to notice my objection he repeated that the thing was so and continued his account of his work  i asked him why he had taken the human form as a model there seemed to me then and there still seems to me now a strange wickedness for that choice  he confessed that he had chosen that form by chance  i might just as well have worked to form sheep into llamas and llamas into sheep i suppose there is something in the human form that appeals to the artistic turn of mind more powerfully than any animal shape can but ive not confined myself to manmaking once or twice he was silent for a minute perhaps  these years  how they have slipped by and here i have wasted a day saving your life and am now wasting an hour explaining myself  but said i i still do not understand  where is your justification for inflicting all this pain  the only thing that could excuse vivisection to me would be some application  precisely said he  but you see i am differently constituted we are on different platforms  you are a materialist  i am not a materialist i began hotly  in my viewin my view  for it is just this question of pain that parts us  so long as visible or audible pain turns you sick so long as your own pains drive you so long as pain underlies your propositions about sinso long i tell you you are an animal thinking a little less obscurely what an animal feels this pain  i gave an impatient shrug at such sophistry  oh but it is such a little thing  a mind truly opened to what science has to teach must see that it is a little thing it may be that save in this little planet this speck of cosmic dust invisible long before the nearest star could be attainedit may be i say that nowhere else does this thing called pain occur but the laws we feel our way towardswhy even on this earth even among living things what pain is there  as he spoke he drew a little penknife from his pocket opened the smaller blade and moved his chair so that i could see his thigh then choosing the place deliberately he drove the blade into his leg and withdrew it  no doubt he said you have seen that before  it does not hurt a pinprick but what does it show  the capacity for pain is not needed in the muscle and it is not placed thereis but little needed in the skin and only here and there over the thigh is a spot capable of feeling pain  pain is simply our intrinsic medical adviser to warn us and stimulate us  not all living flesh is painful nor is all nerve not even all sensory nerve theres no taint of pain real pain in the sensations of the optic nerve  if you wound the optic nerve you merely see flashes of lightjust as disease of the auditory nerve merely means a humming in our ears  plants do not feel pain nor the lower animals its possible that such animals as the starfish and crayfish do not feel pain at all  then with men the more intelligent they become the more intelligently they will see after their own welfare and the less they will need the goad to keep them out of danger i never yet heard of a useless thing that was not ground out of existence by evolution sooner or later  did you  and pain gets needless  then i am a religious man prendick as every sane man must be it may be i fancy that i have seen more of the ways of this worlds maker than youfor i have sought his laws in my way all my life while you i understand have been collecting butterflies and i tell you pleasure and pain have nothing to do with heaven or hell pleasure and painbah  what is your theologians ecstasy but mahomets houri in the dark  this store which men and women set on pleasure and pain prendick is the mark of the beast upon themthe mark of the beast from which they came  pain pain and pleasure they are for us only so long as we wriggle in the dust  you see i went on with this research just the way it led me that is the only way i ever heard of true research going i asked a question devised some method of obtaining an answer and got a fresh question  was this possible or that possible you cannot imagine what this means to an investigator what an intellectual passion grows upon him  you cannot imagine the strange colourless delight of these intellectual desires the thing before you is no longer an animal a fellowcreature but a problem  sympathetic painall i know of it i remember as a thing i used to suffer from years ago  i wantedit was the one thing i wantedto find out the extreme limit of plasticity in a living shape  but said i the thing is an abomination  to this day i have never troubled about the ethics of the matter he continued  the study of nature makes a man at last as remorseless as nature  i have gone on not heeding anything but the question i was pursuing and the material hasdripped into the huts yonder it is nearly eleven years since we came here i and montgomery and six kanakas  i remember the green stillness of the island and the empty ocean about us as though it was yesterday the place seemed waiting for me  the stores were landed and the house was built  the kanakas founded some huts near the ravine  i went to work here upon what i had brought with me  there were some disagreeable things happened at first i began with a sheep and killed it after a day and a half by a slip of the scalpel  i took another sheep and made a thing of pain and fear and left it bound up to heal  it looked quite human to me when i had finished it but when i went to it i was discontented with it it remembered me and was terrified beyond imagination and it had no more than the wits of a sheep  the more i looked at it the clumsier it seemed until at last i put the monster out of its misery these animals without courage these fearhaunted paindriven things without a spark of pugnacious energy to face tormentthey are no good for manmaking  then i took a gorilla i had and upon that working with infinite care and mastering difficulty after difficulty i made my first man all the week night and day i moulded him  with him it was chiefly the brain that needed moulding much had to be added much changed i thought him a fair specimen of the negroid type when i had finished him and he lay bandaged bound and motionless before me it was only when his life was assured that i left him and came into this room again and found montgomery much as you are he had heard some of the cries as the thing grew humancries like those that disturbed you so  i didnt take him completely into my confidence at first  and the kanakas too had realised something of it  they were scared out of their wits by the sight of me  i got montgomery over to mein a way but i and he had the hardest job to prevent the kanakas deserting finally they did and so we lost the yacht  i spent many days educating the brutealtogether i had him for three or four months i taught him the rudiments of english gave him ideas of counting even made the thing read the alphabet  but at that he was slow though ive met with idiots slower  he began with a clean sheet mentally had no memories left in his mind of what he had been when his scars were quite healed and he was no longer anything but painful and stiff and able to converse a little i took him yonder and introduced him to the kanakas as an interesting stowaway  they were horribly afraid of him at first somehowwhich offended me rather for i was conceited about him but his ways seemed so mild and he was so abject that after a time they received him and took his education in hand  he was quick to learn very imitative and adaptive and built himself a hovel rather better it seemed to me than their own shanties  there was one among the boys a bit of a missionary and he taught the thing to read or at least to pick out letters and gave him some rudimentary ideas of morality but it seems the beasts habits were not all that is desirable  i rested from work for some days after this and was in a mind to write an account of the whole affair to wake up english physiology then i came upon the creature squatting up in a tree and gibbering at two of the kanakas who had been teasing him  i threatened him told him the inhumanity of such a proceeding aroused his sense of shame and came home resolved to do better before i took my work back to england i have been doing better  but somehow the things drift back again the stubborn beastflesh grows day by day back again but i mean to do better things still  i mean to conquer that this puma  but thats the story  all the kanaka boys are dead now one fell overboard of the launch and one died of a wounded heel that he poisoned in some way with plantjuice three went away in the yacht and i suppose and hope were drowned the other onewas killed  well i have replaced them montgomery went on much as you are disposed to do at first and then  what became of the other one said i sharplythe other kanaka who was killed  the fact is after i had made a number of human creatures i made a thing  he hesitated  yes said i  it was killed  i dont understand said i do you mean to say  it killed the kanakayes  it killed several other things that it caught  we chased it for a couple of days  it only got loose by accidenti never meant it to get away  it wasnt finished it was purely an experiment  it was a limbless thing with a horrible face that writhed along the ground in a serpentine fashion it was immensely strong and in infuriating pain  it lurked in the woods for some days until we hunted it and then it wriggled into the northern part of the island and we divided the party to close in upon it  montgomery insisted upon coming with me the man had a rifle and when his body was found one of the barrels was curved into the shape of an s and very nearly bitten through montgomery shot the thing  after that i stuck to the ideal of humanityexcept for little things  he became silent  i sat in silence watching his face  so for twenty years altogethercounting nine years in englandi have been going on and there is still something in everything i do that defeats me makes me dissatisfied challenges me to further effort sometimes i rise above my level sometimes i fall below it but always i fall short of the things i dream  the human shape i can get now almost with ease so that it is lithe and graceful or thick and strong but often there is trouble with the hands and the clawspainful things that i dare not shape too freely  but it is in the subtle grafting and reshaping one must needs do to the brain that my trouble lies the intelligence is often oddly low with unaccountable blank ends unexpected gaps  and least satisfactory of all is something that i cannot touch somewherei cannot determine wherein the seat of the emotions  cravings instincts desires that harm humanity a strange hidden reservoir to burst forth suddenly and inundate the whole being of the creature with anger hate or fear these creatures of mine seemed strange and uncanny to you so soon as you began to observe them but to me just after i make them they seem to be indisputably human beings  its afterwards as i observe them that the persuasion fades  first one animal trait then another creeps to the surface and stares out at me but i will conquer yet  each time i dip a living creature into the bath of burning pain i say this time i will burn out all the animal this time i will make a rational creature of my own  after all what is ten years  men have been a hundred thousand in the making he thought darkly  but i am drawing near the fastness this puma of mine after a silence and they revert as soon as my hand is taken from them the beast begins to creep back begins to assert itself again  another long silence  then you take the things you make into those dens said i  they go  i turn them out when i begin to feel the beast in them and presently they wander there  they all dread this house and me there is a kind of travesty of humanity over there  montgomery knows about it for he interferes in their affairs  he has trained one or two of them to our service  hes ashamed of it but i believe he half likes some of those beasts  its his business not mine they only sicken me with a sense of failure  i take no interest in them i fancy they follow in the lines the kanaka missionary marked out and have a kind of mockery of a rational life poor beasts theres something they call the law  sing hymns about all thine they build themselves their dens gather fruit and pull herbsmarry even  but i can see through it all see into their very souls and see there nothing but the souls of beasts beasts that perish anger and the lusts to live and gratify themselvesyet theyre odd complex like everything else alive  there is a kind of upward striving in them part vanity part waste sexual emotion part waste curiosity  it only mocks me  i have some hope of this puma i have worked hard at her head and brain  and now said he standing up after a long gap of silence during which we had each pursued our own thoughts what do you think  are you in fear of me still  i looked at him and saw but a whitefaced whitehaired man with calm eyes  save for his serenity the touch almost of beauty that resulted from his set tranquillity and his magnificent build he might have passed muster among a hundred other comfortable old gentlemen then i shivered  by way of answer to his second question i handed him a revolver with either hand  keep them he said and snatched at a yawn  he stood up stared at me for a moment and smiled  you have had two eventful days said he  i should advise some sleep  im glad its all clear goodnight he thought me over for a moment then went out by the inner door  i immediately turned the key in the outer one  i sat down again sat for a time in a kind of stagnant mood so weary emotionally mentally and physically that i could not think beyond the point at which he had left me  the black window stared at me like an eye at last with an effort i put out the light and got into the hammock very soon i was asleep     xv  concerning the beast folk   i woke early  moreaus explanation stood before my mind clear and definite from the moment of my awakening  i got out of the hammock and went to the door to assure myself that the key was turned  then i tried the windowbar and found it firmly fixed that these manlike creatures were in truth only bestial monsters mere grotesque travesties of men filled me with a vague uncertainty of their possibilities which was far worse than any definite fear  a tapping came at the door and i heard the glutinous accents of mling speaking  i pocketed one of the revolvers keeping one hand upon it and opened to him  goodmorning sair he said bringing in in addition to the customary herbbreakfast an illcooked rabbit  montgomery followed him his roving eye caught the position of my arm and he smiled askew  the puma was resting to heal that day but moreau who was singularly solitary in his habits did not join us  i talked with montgomery to clear my ideas of the way in which the beast folk lived in particular i was urgent to know how these inhuman monsters were kept from falling upon moreau and montgomery and from rending one another he explained to me that the comparative safety of moreau and himself was due to the limited mental scope of these monsters in spite of their increased intelligence and the tendency of their animal instincts to reawaken they had certain fixed ideas implanted by moreau in their minds which absolutely bounded their imaginations they were really hypnotised had been told that certain things were impossible and that certain things were not to be done and these prohibitions were woven into the texture of their minds beyond any possibility of disobedience or dispute  certain matters however in which old instinct was at war with moreaus convenience were in a less stable condition a series of propositions called the law i had already heard them recited battled in their minds with the deepseated everrebellious cravings of their animal natures  this law they were ever repeating i found and ever breaking  both montgomery and moreau displayed particular solicitude to keep them ignorant of the taste of blood they feared the inevitable suggestions of that flavour montgomery told me that the law especially among the feline beast people became oddly weakened about nightfall that then the animal was at its strongest that a spirit of adventure sprang up in them at the dusk when they would dare things they never seemed to dream about by day to that i owed my stalking by the leopardman on the night of my arrival but during these earlier days of my stay they broke the law only furtively and after dark in the daylight there was a general atmosphere of respect for its multifarious prohibitions  and here perhaps i may give a few general facts about the island and the beast people  the island which was of irregular outline and lay low upon the wide sea had a total area i suppose of seven or eight square miles2 it was volcanic in origin and was now fringed on three sides by coral reefs some fumaroles to the northward and a hot spring were the only vestiges of the forces that had long since originated it  now and then a faint quiver of earthquake would be sensible and sometimes the ascent of the spire of smoke would be rendered tumultuous by gusts of steam but that was all  the population of the island montgomery informed me now numbered rather more than sixty of these strange creations of moreaus art not counting the smaller monstrosities which lived in the undergrowth and were without human form altogether he had made nearly a hundred and twenty but many had died and otherslike the writhing footless thing of which he had told mehad come by violent ends  in answer to my question montgomery said that they actually bore offspring but that these generally died when they lived moreau took them and stamped the human form upon them there was no evidence of the inheritance of their acquired human characteristics  the females were less numerous than the males and liable to much furtive persecution in spite of the monogamy the law enjoined       2 this description corresponds in every respect to nobles isle           c e p  it would be impossible for me to describe these beast people in detail my eye has had no training in details and unhappily i cannot sketch most striking perhaps in their general appearance was the disproportion between the legs of these creatures and the length of their bodies and yetso relative is our idea of gracemy eye became habituated to their forms and at last i even fell in with their persuasion that my own long thighs were ungainly another point was the forward carriage of the head and the clumsy and inhuman curvature of the spine  even the apeman lacked that inward sinuous curve of the back which makes the human figure so graceful  most had their shoulders hunched clumsily and their short forearms hung weakly at their sides  few of them were conspicuously hairy at least until the end of my time upon the island  the next most obvious deformity was in their faces almost all of which were prognathous malformed about the ears with large and protuberant noses very furry or very bristly hair and often strangelycoloured or strangelyplaced eyes none could laugh though the apeman had a chattering titter beyond these general characters their heads had little in common each preserved the quality of its particular species the human mark distorted but did not hide the leopard the ox or the sow or other animal or animals from which the creature had been moulded  the voices too varied exceedingly the hands were always malformed and though some surprised me by their unexpected human appearance almost all were deficient in the number of the digits clumsy about the fingernails and lacking any tactile sensibility  the two most formidable animal men were my leopardman and a creature made of hyena and swine  larger than these were the three bullcreatures who pulled in the boat  then came the silveryhairyman who was also the sayer of the law mling and a satyrlike creature of ape and goat there were three swinemen and a swinewoman a marerhinoceroscreature and several other females whose sources i did not ascertain there were several wolfcreatures a bearbull and a saintbernardman i have already described the apeman and there was a particularly hateful and evilsmelling old woman made of vixen and bear whom i hated from the beginning  she was said to be a passionate votary of the law smaller creatures were certain dappled youths and my little slothcreature but enough of this catalogue  at first i had a shivering horror of the brutes felt all too keenly that they were still brutes but insensibly i became a little habituated to the idea of them and moreover i was affected by montgomerys attitude towards them  he had been with them so long that he had come to regard them as almost normal human beings his london days seemed a glorious impossible past to him only once in a year or so did he go to arica to deal with moreaus agent a trader in animals there  he hardly met the finest type of mankind in that seafaring village of spanish mongrels the men aboardship he told me seemed at first just as strange to him as the beast men seemed to meunnaturally long in the leg flat in the face prominent in the forehead suspicious dangerous and coldhearted in fact he did not like men  his heart had warmed to me he thought because he had saved my life i fancied even then that he had a sneaking kindness for some of these metamorphosed brutes a vicious sympathy with some of their ways but that he attempted to veil it from me at first  mling the blackfaced man montgomerys attendant the first of the beast folk i had encountered did not live with the others across the island but in a small kennel at the back of the enclosure the creature was scarcely so intelligent as the apeman but far more docile and the most humanlooking of all the beast folk and montgomery had trained it to prepare food and indeed to discharge all the trivial domestic offices that were required it was a complex trophy of moreaus horrible skilla bear tainted with dog and ox and one of the most elaborately made of all his creatures it treated montgomery with a strange tenderness and devotion sometimes he would notice it pat it call it halfmocking halfjocular names and so make it caper with extraordinary delight sometimes he would illtreat it especially after he had been at the whiskey kicking it beating it pelting it with stones or lighted fusees but whether he treated it well or ill it loved nothing so much as to be near him  i say i became habituated to the beast people that a thousand things which had seemed unnatural and repulsive speedily became natural and ordinary to me  i suppose everything in existence takes its colour from the average hue of our surroundings montgomery and moreau were too peculiar and individual to keep my general impressions of humanity well defined i would see one of the clumsy bovinecreatures who worked the launch treading heavily through the undergrowth and find myself asking trying hard to recall how he differed from some really human yokel trudging home from his mechanical labours or i would meet the foxbear womans vulpine shifty face strangely human in its speculative cunning and even imagine i had met it before in some city byway  yet every now and then the beast would flash out upon me beyond doubt or denial  an uglylooking man a hunchbacked human savage to all appearance squatting in the aperture of one of the dens would stretch his arms and yawn showing with startling suddenness scissoredged incisors and sabrelike canines keen and brilliant as knives  or in some narrow pathway glancing with a transitory daring into the eyes of some lithe whiteswathed female figure i would suddenly see with a spasmodic revulsion that she had slitlike pupils or glancing down note the curving nail with which she held her shapeless wrap about her  it is a curious thing by the bye for which i am quite unable to account that these weird creaturesthe females i meanhad in the earlier days of my stay an instinctive sense of their own repulsive clumsiness and displayed in consequence a more than human regard for the decency and decorum of extensive costume     xvi  how the beast folk taste blood   my inexperience as a writer betrays me and i wander from the thread of my story  after i had breakfasted with montgomery he took me across the island to see the fumarole and the source of the hot spring into whose scalding waters i had blundered on the previous day both of us carried whips and loaded revolvers  while going through a leafy jungle on our road thither we heard a rabbit squealing we stopped and listened but we heard no more and presently we went on our way and the incident dropped out of our minds montgomery called my attention to certain little pink animals with long hindlegs that went leaping through the undergrowth he told me they were creatures made of the offspring of the beast people that moreau had invented  he had fancied they might serve for meat but a rabbitlike habit of devouring their young had defeated this intention  i had already encountered some of these creaturesonce during my moonlight flight from the leopardman and once during my pursuit by moreau on the previous day by chance one hopping to avoid us leapt into the hole caused by the uprooting of a windblown tree before it could extricate itself we managed to catch it  it spat like a cat scratched and kicked vigorously with its hindlegs and made an attempt to bite but its teeth were too feeble to inflict more than a painless pinch it seemed to me rather a pretty little creature and as montgomery stated that it never destroyed the turf by burrowing and was very cleanly in its habits i should imagine it might prove a convenient substitute for the common rabbit in gentlemens parks  we also saw on our way the trunk of a tree barked in long strips and splintered deeply  montgomery called my attention to this not to claw bark of trees that is the law he said much some of them care for it  it was after this i think that we met the satyr and the apeman the satyr was a gleam of classical memory on the part of moreauhis face ovine in expression like the coarser hebrew type his voice a harsh bleat his nether extremities satanic he was gnawing the husk of a podlike fruit as he passed us both of them saluted montgomery  hail said they to the other with the whip  theres a third with a whip now said montgomery  so youd better mind  was he not made said the apeman he saidhe said he was made  the satyrman looked curiously at me  the third with the whip he that walks weeping into the sea has a thin white face  he has a thin long whip said montgomery  yesterday he bled and wept said the satyr  you never bleed nor weep the master does not bleed or weep  ollendorffian beggar said montgomery youll bleed and weep if you dont look out  he has five fingers he is a fiveman like me said the apeman  come along prendick said montgomery taking my arm and i went on with him  the satyr and the apeman stood watching us and making other remarks to each other  he says nothing said the satyr  men have voices  yesterday he asked me of things to eat said the apeman he did not know  then they spoke inaudible things and i heard the satyr laughing  it was on our way back that we came upon the dead rabbit the red body of the wretched little beast was rent to pieces many of the ribs stripped white and the backbone indisputably gnawed  at that montgomery stopped  good god said he stooping down and picking up some of the crushed vertebrae to examine them more closely good god he repeated what can this mean  some carnivore of yours has remembered its old habits i said after a pause  this backbone has been bitten through  he stood staring with his face white and his lip pulled askew i dont like this he said slowly  i saw something of the same kind said i the first day i came here  the devil you did  what was it  a rabbit with its head twisted off  the day you came here  the day i came here  in the undergrowth at the back of the enclosure when i went out in the evening  the head was completely wrung off  he gave a long low whistle  and what is more i have an idea which of your brutes did the thing its only a suspicion you know  before i came on the rabbit i saw one of your monsters drinking in the stream  sucking his drink  yes  not to suck your drink that is the law  much the brutes care for the law eh when moreaus not about  it was the brute who chased me  of course said montgomery its just the way with carnivores after a kill they drink  its the taste of blood you knowwhat was the brute like he continued  would you know him again he glanced about us standing astride over the mess of dead rabbit his eyes roving among the shadows and screens of greenery the lurkingplaces and ambuscades of the forest that bounded us in the taste of blood he said again  he took out his revolver examined the cartridges in it and replaced it then he began to pull at his dropping lip  i think i should know the brute again i said  i stunned him he ought to have a handsome bruise on the forehead of him  but then we have to prove that he killed the rabbit said montgomery i wish id never brought the things here  i should have gone on but he stayed there thinking over the mangled rabbit in a puzzleheaded way  as it was i went to such a distance that the rabbits remains were hidden  come on i said  presently he woke up and came towards me  you see he said almost in a whisper they are all supposed to have a fixed idea against eating anything that runs on land  if some brute has by any accident tasted blood  we went on some way in silence  i wonder what can have happened he said to himself  then after a pause again  i did a foolish thing the other day  that servant of minei showed him how to skin and cook a rabbit  its oddi saw him licking his handsit never occurred to me  then  we must put a stop to this  i must tell moreau  he could think of nothing else on our homeward journey  moreau took the matter even more seriously than montgomery and i need scarcely say that i was affected by their evident consternation  we must make an example said moreau  ive no doubt in my own mind that the leopardman was the sinner  but how can we prove it i wish montgomery you had kept your taste for meat in hand and gone without these exciting novelties  we may find ourselves in a mess yet through it  i was a silly ass said montgomery  but the things done now and you said i might have them you know  we must see to the thing at once said moreau  i suppose if anything should turn up mling can take care of himself  im not so sure of mling said montgomery  i think i ought to know him  in the afternoon moreau montgomery myself and mling went across the island to the huts in the ravine  we three were armed mling carried the little hatchet he used in chopping firewood and some coils of wire  moreau had a huge cowherds horn slung over his shoulder  you will see a gathering of the beast people said montgomery it is a pretty sight  moreau said not a word on the way but the expression of his heavy whitefringed face was grimly set  we crossed the ravine down which smoked the stream of hot water and followed the winding pathway through the canebrakes until we reached a wide area covered over with a thick powdery yellow substance which i believe was sulphur above the shoulder of a weedy bank the sea glittered  we came to a kind of shallow natural amphitheatre and here the four of us halted then moreau sounded the horn and broke the sleeping stillness of the tropical afternoon  he must have had strong lungs the hooting note rose and rose amidst its echoes to at last an earpenetrating intensity  ah said moreau letting the curved instrument fall to his side again  immediately there was a crashing through the yellow canes and a sound of voices from the dense green jungle that marked the morass through which i had run on the previous day then at three or four points on the edge of the sulphurous area appeared the grotesque forms of the beast people hurrying towards us i could not help a creeping horror as i perceived first one and then another trot out from the trees or reeds and come shambling along over the hot dust  but moreau and montgomery stood calmly enough and perforce i stuck beside them  first to arrive was the satyr strangely unreal for all that he cast a shadow and tossed the dust with his hoofs  after him from the brake came a monstrous lout a thing of horse and rhinoceros chewing a straw as it came then appeared the swinewoman and two wolfwomen then the foxbear witch with her red eyes in her peaked red face and then othersall hurrying eagerly as they came forward they began to cringe towards moreau and chant quite regardless of one another fragments of the latter half of the litany of the lawhis is the hand that wounds his is the hand that heals and so forth  as soon as they had approached within a distance of perhaps thirty yards they halted and bowing on knees and elbows began flinging the white dust upon their heads  imagine the scene if you can  we three blueclad men with our misshapen blackfaced attendant standing in a wide expanse of sunlit yellow dust under the blazing blue sky and surrounded by this circle of crouching and gesticulating monstrositiessome almost human save in their subtle expression and gestures some like cripples some so strangely distorted as to resemble nothing but the denizens of our wildest dreams and beyond the reedy lines of a canebrake in one direction a dense tangle of palmtrees on the other separating us from the ravine with the huts and to the north the hazy horizon of the pacific ocean  sixtytwo sixtythree counted moreau  there are four more  i do not see the leopardman said i  presently moreau sounded the great horn again and at the sound of it all the beast people writhed and grovelled in the dust then slinking out of the canebrake stooping near the ground and trying to join the dustthrowing circle behind moreaus back came the leopardman the last of the beast people to arrive was the little apeman the earlier animals hot and weary with their grovelling shot vicious glances at him  cease said moreau in his firm loud voice and the beast people sat back upon their hams and rested from their worshipping  where is the sayer of the law said moreau and the hairygrey monster bowed his face in the dust  say the words said moreau  forthwith all in the kneeling assembly swaying from side to side and dashing up the sulphur with their handsfirst the right hand and a puff of dust and then the leftbegan once more to chant their strange litany  when they reached not to eat flesh or fish that is the law moreau held up his lank white hand  stop he cried and there fell absolute silence upon them all  i think they all knew and dreaded what was coming i looked round at their strange faces  when i saw their wincing attitudes and the furtive dread in their bright eyes i wondered that i had ever believed them to be men  that law has been broken said moreau  none escape from the faceless creature with the silvery hair none escape repeated the kneeling circle of beast people  who is he cried moreau and looked round at their faces cracking his whip  i fancied the hyenaswine looked dejected so too did the leopardman moreau stopped facing this creature who cringed towards him with the memory and dread of infinite torment  who is he repeated moreau in a voice of thunder  evil is he who breaks the law chanted the sayer of the law  moreau looked into the eyes of the leopardman and seemed to be dragging the very soul out of the creature  who breaks the law said moreau taking his eyes off his victim and turning towards us it seemed to me there was a touch of exultation in his voice  goes back to the house of pain they all clamouredgoes back to the house of pain o master  back to the house of painback to the house of pain gabbled the apeman as though the idea was sweet to him  do you hear said moreau turning back to the criminal my friendhullo  for the leopardman released from moreaus eye had risen straight from his knees and now with eyes aflame and his huge feline tusks flashing out from under his curling lips leapt towards his tormentor i am convinced that only the madness of unendurable fear could have prompted this attack  the whole circle of threescore monsters seemed to rise about us  i drew my revolver  the two figures collided i saw moreau reeling back from the leopardmans blow  there was a furious yelling and howling all about us  every one was moving rapidly for a moment i thought it was a general revolt  the furious face of the leopardman flashed by mine with mling close in pursuit i saw the yellow eyes of the hyenaswine blazing with excitement his attitude as if he were half resolved to attack me the satyr too glared at me over the hyenaswines hunched shoulders i heard the crack of moreaus pistol and saw the pink flash dart across the tumult  the whole crowd seemed to swing round in the direction of the glint of fire and i too was swung round by the magnetism of the movement  in another second i was running one of a tumultuous shouting crowd in pursuit of the escaping leopardman  that is all i can tell definitely  i saw the leopardman strike moreau and then everything spun about me until i was running headlong mling was ahead close in pursuit of the fugitive  behind their tongues already lolling out ran the wolfwomen in great leaping strides the swine folk followed squealing with excitement and the two bullmen in their swathings of white  then came moreau in a cluster of the beast people his widebrimmed straw hat blown off his revolver in hand and his lank white hair streaming out the hyenaswine ran beside me keeping pace with me and glancing furtively at me out of his feline eyes and the others came pattering and shouting behind us  the leopardman went bursting his way through the long canes which sprang back as he passed and rattled in mlings face we others in the rear found a trampled path for us when we reached the brake  the chase lay through the brake for perhaps a quarter of a mile and then plunged into a dense thicket which retarded our movements exceedingly though we went through it in a crowd togetherfronds flicking into our faces ropy creepers catching us under the chin or gripping our ankles thorny plants hooking into and tearing cloth and flesh together  he has gone on allfours through this panted moreau now just ahead of me  none escape said the wolfbear laughing into my face with the exultation of hunting  we burst out again among rocks and saw the quarry ahead running lightly on allfours and snarling at us over his shoulder  at that the wolf folk howled with delight the thing was still clothed and at a distance its face still seemed human but the carriage of its four limbs was feline and the furtive droop of its shoulder was distinctly that of a hunted animal it leapt over some thorny yellowflowering bushes and was hidden mling was halfway across the space  most of us now had lost the first speed of the chase and had fallen into a longer and steadier stride  i saw as we traversed the open that the pursuit was now spreading from a column into a line the hyenaswine still ran close to me watching me as it ran every now and then puckering its muzzle with a snarling laugh at the edge of the rocks the leopardman realising that he was making for the projecting cape upon which he had stalked me on the night of my arrival had doubled in the undergrowth but montgomery had seen the manoeuvre and turned him again so panting tumbling against rocks torn by brambles impeded by ferns and reeds i helped to pursue the leopardman who had broken the law and the hyenaswine ran laughing savagely by my side i staggered on my head reeling and my heart beating against my ribs tired almost to death and yet not daring to lose sight of the chase lest i should be left alone with this horrible companion i staggered on in spite of infinite fatigue and the dense heat of the tropical afternoon  at last the fury of the hunt slackened  we had pinned the wretched brute into a corner of the island  moreau whip in hand marshalled us all into an irregular line and we advanced now slowly shouting to one another as we advanced and tightening the cordon about our victim he lurked noiseless and invisible in the bushes through which i had run from him during that midnight pursuit  steady cried moreau steady as the ends of the line crept round the tangle of undergrowth and hemmed the brute in  ware a rush came the voice of montgomery from beyond the thicket  i was on the slope above the bushes montgomery and moreau beat along the beach beneath  slowly we pushed in among the fretted network of branches and leaves  the quarry was silent  back to the house of pain the house of pain the house of pain yelped the voice of the apeman some twenty yards to the right  when i heard that i forgave the poor wretch all the fear he had inspired in me  i heard the twigs snap and the boughs swish aside before the heavy tread of the horserhinoceros upon my right then suddenly through a polygon of green in the half darkness under the luxuriant growth i saw the creature we were hunting i halted  he was crouched together into the smallest possible compass his luminous green eyes turned over his shoulder regarding me  it may seem a strange contradiction in mei cannot explain the factbut now seeing the creature there in a perfectly animal attitude with the light gleaming in its eyes and its imperfectly human face distorted with terror i realised again the fact of its humanity  in another moment other of its pursuers would see it and it would be overpowered and captured to experience once more the horrible tortures of the enclosure  abruptly i slipped out my revolver aimed between its terrorstruck eyes and fired as i did so the hyenaswine saw the thing and flung itself upon it with an eager cry thrusting thirsty teeth into its neck all about me the green masses of the thicket were swaying and cracking as the beast people came rushing together  one face and then another appeared  dont kill it prendick cried moreau  dont kill it and i saw him stooping as he pushed through under the fronds of the big ferns  in another moment he had beaten off the hyenaswine with the handle of his whip and he and montgomery were keeping away the excited carnivorous beast people and particularly mling from the still quivering body the hairygrey thing came sniffing at the corpse under my arm the other animals in their animal ardour jostled me to get a nearer view  confound you prendick said moreau  i wanted him  im sorry said i though i was not  it was the impulse of the moment  i felt sick with exertion and excitement turning i pushed my way out of the crowding beast people and went on alone up the slope towards the higher part of the headland under the shouted directions of moreau i heard the three whiteswathed bullmen begin dragging the victim down towards the water  it was easy now for me to be alone  the beast people manifested a quite human curiosity about the dead body and followed it in a thick knot sniffing and growling at it as the bullmen dragged it down the beach i went to the headland and watched the bullmen black against the evening sky as they carried the weighted dead body out to sea and like a wave across my mind came the realisation of the unspeakable aimlessness of things upon the island  upon the beach among the rocks beneath me were the apeman the hyenaswine and several other of the beast people standing about montgomery and moreau they were all still intensely excited and all overflowing with noisy expressions of their loyalty to the law yet i felt an absolute assurance in my own mind that the hyenaswine was implicated in the rabbitkilling a strange persuasion came upon me that save for the grossness of the line the grotesqueness of the forms i had here before me the whole balance of human life in miniature the whole interplay of instinct reason and fate in its simplest form the leopardman had happened to go under  that was all the difference poor brute  poor brutes  i began to see the viler aspect of moreaus cruelty i had not thought before of the pain and trouble that came to these poor victims after they had passed from moreaus hands i had shivered only at the days of actual torment in the enclosure but now that seemed to me the lesser part  before they had been beasts their instincts fitly adapted to their surroundings and happy as living things may be  now they stumbled in the shackles of humanity lived in a fear that never died fretted by a law they could not understand their mockhuman existence begun in an agony was one long internal struggle one long dread of moreauand for what it was the wantonness of it that stirred me  had moreau had any intelligible object i could have sympathised at least a little with him  i am not so squeamish about pain as that i could have forgiven him a little even had his motive been only hate but he was so irresponsible so utterly careless  his curiosity his mad aimless investigations drove him on and the things were thrown out to live a year or so to struggle and blunder and suffer and at last to die painfully  they were wretched in themselves the old animal hate moved them to trouble one another the law held them back from a brief hot struggle and a decisive end to their natural animosities  in those days my fear of the beast people went the way of my personal fear for moreau  i fell indeed into a morbid state deep and enduring and alien to fear which has left permanent scars upon my mind i must confess that i lost faith in the sanity of the world when i saw it suffering the painful disorder of this island a blind fate a vast pitiless mechanism seemed to cut and shape the fabric of existence and i moreau by his passion for research montgomery by his passion for drink the beast people with their instincts and mental restrictions were torn and crushed ruthlessly inevitably amid the infinite complexity of its incessant wheels  but this condition did not come all at once i think indeed that i anticipate a little in speaking of it now     xvii  a catastrophe   scarcely six weeks passed before i had lost every feeling but dislike and abhorrence for this infamous experiment of moreaus my one idea was to get away from these horrible caricatures of my makers image back to the sweet and wholesome intercourse of men my fellowcreatures from whom i was thus separated began to assume idyllic virtue and beauty in my memory  my first friendship with montgomery did not increase  his long separation from humanity his secret vice of drunkenness his evident sympathy with the beast people tainted him to me  several times i let him go alone among them i avoided intercourse with them in every possible way i spent an increasing proportion of my time upon the beach looking for some liberating sail that never appeareduntil one day there fell upon us an appalling disaster which put an altogether different aspect upon my strange surroundings  it was about seven or eight weeks after my landingrather more i think though i had not troubled to keep account of the timewhen this catastrophe occurred  it happened in the early morningi should think about six  i had risen and breakfasted early having been aroused by the noise of three beast men carrying wood into the enclosure  after breakfast i went to the open gateway of the enclosure and stood there smoking a cigarette and enjoying the freshness of the early morning  moreau presently came round the corner of the enclosure and greeted me  he passed by me and i heard him behind me unlock and enter his laboratory  so indurated was i at that time to the abomination of the place that i heard without a touch of emotion the puma victim begin another day of torture it met its persecutor with a shriek almost exactly like that of an angry virago  then suddenly something happenedi do not know what to this day  i heard a short sharp cry behind me a fall and turning saw an awful face rushing upon menot human not animal but hellish brown seamed with red branching scars red drops starting out upon it and the lidless eyes ablaze i threw up my arm to defend myself from the blow that flung me headlong with a broken forearm and the great monster swathed in lint and with redstained bandages fluttering about it leapt over me and passed  i rolled over and over down the beach tried to sit up and collapsed upon my broken arm  then moreau appeared his massive white face all the more terrible for the blood that trickled from his forehead  he carried a revolver in one hand he scarcely glanced at me but rushed off at once in pursuit of the puma  i tried the other arm and sat up  the muffled figure in front ran in great striding leaps along the beach and moreau followed her she turned her head and saw him then doubling abruptly made for the bushes  she gained upon him at every stride  i saw her plunge into them and moreau running slantingly to intercept her fired and missed as she disappeared  then he too vanished in the green confusion  i stared after them and then the pain in my arm flamed up and with a groan i staggered to my feet montgomery appeared in the doorway dressed and with his revolver in his hand  great god prendick he said not noticing that i was hurt that brutes loose  tore the fetter out of the wall have you seen them  then sharply seeing i gripped my arm whats the matter  i was standing in the doorway said i  he came forward and took my arm  blood on the sleeve said he and rolled back the flannel  he pocketed his weapon felt my arm about painfully and led me inside  your arm is broken he said and then tell me exactly how it happenedwhat happened  i told him what i had seen told him in broken sentences with gasps of pain between them and very dexterously and swiftly he bound my arm meanwhile  he slung it from my shoulder stood back and looked at me  youll do he said  and now  he thought  then he went out and locked the gates of the enclosure he was absent some time  i was chiefly concerned about my arm  the incident seemed merely one more of many horrible things  i sat down in the deck chair and i must admit swore heartily at the island  the first dull feeling of injury in my arm had already given way to a burning pain when montgomery reappeared  his face was rather pale and he showed more of his lower gums than ever  i can neither see nor hear anything of him he said ive been thinking he may want my help  he stared at me with his expressionless eyes  that was a strong brute he said it simply wrenched its fetter out of the wall  he went to the window then to the door and there turned to me  i shall go after him he said  theres another revolver i can leave with you to tell you the truth i feel anxious somehow  he obtained the weapon and put it ready to my hand on the table then went out leaving a restless contagion in the air i did not sit long after he left but took the revolver in hand and went to the doorway  the morning was as still as death  not a whisper of wind was stirring the sea was like polished glass the sky empty the beach desolate in my halfexcited halffeverish state this stillness of things oppressed me  i tried to whistle and the tune died away i swore againthe second time that morning  then i went to the corner of the enclosure and stared inland at the green bush that had swallowed up moreau and montgomery  when would they return and how then far away up the beach a little grey beast man appeared ran down to the waters edge and began splashing about i strolled back to the doorway then to the corner again and so began pacing to and fro like a sentinel upon duty once i was arrested by the distant voice of montgomery bawling cooeemoreau  my arm became less painful but very hot i got feverish and thirsty  my shadow grew shorter i watched the distant figure until it went away again  would moreau and montgomery never return  three seabirds began fighting for some stranded treasure  then from far away behind the enclosure i heard a pistolshot a long silence and then came another  then a yelling cry nearer and another dismal gap of silence  my unfortunate imagination set to work to torment me  then suddenly a shot close by i went to the corner startled and saw montgomeryhis face scarlet his hair disordered and the knee of his trousers torn his face expressed profound consternation  behind him slouched the beast man mling and round mlings jaws were some queer dark stains  has he come said montgomery  moreau said i no  my god  the man was panting almost sobbing  go back in he said taking my arm  theyre mad  theyre all rushing about mad  what can have happened  i dont know  ill tell you when my breath comes wheres some brandy  montgomery limped before me into the room and sat down in the deck chair mling flung himself down just outside the doorway and began panting like a dog  i got montgomery some brandyandwater he sat staring in front of him at nothing recovering his breath after some minutes he began to tell me what had happened  he had followed their track for some way  it was plain enough at first on account of the crushed and broken bushes white rags torn from the pumas bandages and occasional smears of blood on the leaves of the shrubs and undergrowth  he lost the track however on the stony ground beyond the stream where i had seen the beast man drinking and went wandering aimlessly westward shouting moreaus name then mling had come to him carrying a light hatchet  mling had seen nothing of the puma affair had been felling wood and heard him calling they went on shouting together  two beast men came crouching and peering at them through the undergrowth with gestures and a furtive carriage that alarmed montgomery by their strangeness he hailed them and they fled guiltily  he stopped shouting after that and after wandering some time farther in an undecided way determined to visit the huts  he found the ravine deserted  growing more alarmed every minute he began to retrace his steps then it was he encountered the two swinemen i had seen dancing on the night of my arrival bloodstained they were about the mouth and intensely excited  they came crashing through the ferns and stopped with fierce faces when they saw him  he cracked his whip in some trepidation and forthwith they rushed at him  never before had a beast man dared to do that  one he shot through the head mling flung himself upon the other and the two rolled grappling mling got his brute under and with his teeth in its throat and montgomery shot that too as it struggled in mlings grip he had some difficulty in inducing mling to come on with him thence they had hurried back to me  on the way mling had suddenly rushed into a thicket and driven out an undersized ocelotman also bloodstained and lame through a wound in the foot this brute had run a little way and then turned savagely at bay and montgomerywith a certain wantonness i thoughthad shot him  what does it all mean said i  he shook his head and turned once more to the brandy     xviii  the finding of moreau   when i saw montgomery swallow a third dose of brandy i took it upon myself to interfere  he was already more than half fuddled i told him that some serious thing must have happened to moreau by this time or he would have returned before this and that it behoved us to ascertain what that catastrophe was montgomery raised some feeble objections and at last agreed we had some food and then all three of us started  it is possibly due to the tension of my mind at the time but even now that start into the hot stillness of the tropical afternoon is a singularly vivid impression  mling went first his shoulder hunched his strange black head moving with quick starts as he peered first on this side of the way and then on that he was unarmed his axe he had dropped when he encountered the swineman teeth were his weapons when it came to fighting montgomery followed with stumbling footsteps his hands in his pockets his face downcast he was in a state of muddled sullenness with me on account of the brandy  my left arm was in a sling it was lucky it was my left and i carried my revolver in my right soon we traced a narrow path through the wild luxuriance of the island going northwestward and presently mling stopped and became rigid with watchfulness  montgomery almost staggered into him and then stopped too  then listening intently we heard coming through the trees the sound of voices and footsteps approaching us  he is dead said a deep vibrating voice  he is not dead he is not dead jabbered another  we saw we saw said several voices  hullo suddenly shouted montgomery hullo there  confound you said i and gripped my pistol  there was a silence then a crashing among the interlacing vegetation first here then there and then halfadozen faces appearedstrange faces lit by a strange light  mling made a growling noise in his throat  i recognised the apeman i had indeed already identified his voice and two of the whiteswathed brownfeatured creatures i had seen in montgomerys boat with these were the two dappled brutes and that grey horribly crooked creature who said the law with grey hair streaming down its cheeks heavy grey eyebrows and grey locks pouring off from a central parting upon its sloping foreheada heavy faceless thing with strange red eyes looking at us curiously from amidst the green  for a space no one spoke  then montgomery hiccoughed whosaid he was dead  the monkeyman looked guiltily at the hairygrey thing  he is dead said this monster  they saw  there was nothing threatening about this detachment at any rate they seemed awestricken and puzzled  where is he said montgomery  beyond and the grey creature pointed  is there a law now asked the monkeyman is it still to be this and that  is he dead indeed  is there a law repeated the man in white  is there a law thou other with the whip  he is dead said the hairygrey thing  and they all stood watching us  prendick said montgomery turning his dull eyes to me hes dead evidently  i had been standing behind him during this colloquy i began to see how things lay with them  i suddenly stepped in front of montgomery and lifted up my voicechildren of the law i said he is not dead  mling turned his sharp eyes on me he has changed his shape he has changed his body i went on for a time you will not see him  he isthere i pointed upward where he can watch you  you cannot see him but he can see you fear the law  i looked at them squarely  they flinched  he is great he is good said the apeman peering fearfully upward among the dense trees  and the other thing  i demanded  the thing that bled and ran screaming and sobbingthat is dead too said the grey thing still regarding me  thats well grunted montgomery  the other with the whip began the grey thing  well said i  said he was dead  but montgomery was still sober enough to understand my motive in denying moreaus death  he is not dead he said slowly not dead at all no more dead than i am  some said i have broken the law  they will die  some have died show us now where his old body liesthe body he cast away because he had no more need of it  it is this way man who walked in the sea said the grey thing  and with these six creatures guiding us we went through the tumult of ferns and creepers and treestems towards the northwest then came a yelling a crashing among the branches and a little pink homunculus rushed by us shrieking  immediately after appeared a monster in headlong pursuit bloodbedabbled who was amongst us almost before he could stop his career  the grey thing leapt aside mling with a snarl flew at it and was struck aside  montgomery fired and missed bowed his head threw up his arm and turned to run i fired and the thing still came on fired again pointblank into its ugly face  i saw its features vanish in a flash  its face was driven in  yet it passed me gripped montgomery and holding him fell headlong beside him and pulled him sprawling upon itself in its deathagony  i found myself alone with mling the dead brute and the prostrate man montgomery raised himself slowly and stared in a muddled way at the shattered beast man beside him  it more than half sobered him he scrambled to his feet  then i saw the grey thing returning cautiously through the trees  see said i pointing to the dead brute is the law not alive this came of breaking the law  he peered at the body  he sends the fire that kills said he in his deep voice repeating part of the ritual the others gathered round and stared for a space  at last we drew near the westward extremity of the island we came upon the gnawed and mutilated body of the puma its shoulderbone smashed by a bullet and perhaps twenty yards farther found at last what we sought  moreau lay face downward in a trampled space in a canebrake  one hand was almost severed at the wrist and his silvery hair was dabbled in blood his head had been battered in by the fetters of the puma the broken canes beneath him were smeared with blood his revolver we could not find  montgomery turned him over resting at intervals and with the help of the seven beast people for he was a heavy man we carried moreau back to the enclosure the night was darkling  twice we heard unseen creatures howling and shrieking past our little band and once the little pink slothcreature appeared and stared at us and vanished again but we were not attacked again  at the gates of the enclosure our company of beast people left us mling going with the rest we locked ourselves in and then took moreaus mangled body into the yard and laid it upon a pile of brushwood then we went into the laboratory and put an end to all we found living there     xix  montgomerys bank holiday   when this was accomplished and we had washed and eaten montgomery and i went into my little room and seriously discussed our position for the first time  it was then near midnight he was almost sober but greatly disturbed in his mind he had been strangely under the influence of moreaus personality i do not think it had ever occurred to him that moreau could die this disaster was the sudden collapse of the habits that had become part of his nature in the ten or more monotonous years he had spent on the island he talked vaguely answered my questions crookedly wandered into general questions  this silly ass of a world he said what a muddle it all is i havent had any life  i wonder when its going to begin sixteen years being bullied by nurses and schoolmasters at their own sweet will five in london grinding hard at medicine bad food shabby lodgings shabby clothes shabby vice a blunderi didnt know any betterand hustled off to this beastly island ten years here  whats it all for prendick  are we bubbles blown by a baby  it was hard to deal with such ravings  the thing we have to think of now said i is how to get away from this island  whats the good of getting away  im an outcast where am i to join on  its all very well for you prendick poor old moreau  we cant leave him here to have his bones picked as it isand besides what will become of the decent part of the beast folk  well said i that will do tomorrow ive been thinking we might make the brushwood into a pyre and burn his bodyand those other things then what will happen with the beast folk  i dont know  i suppose those that were made of beasts of prey will make silly asses of themselves sooner or later  we cant massacre the lotcan we  i suppose thats what your humanity would suggest but theyll change  they are sure to change  he talked thus inconclusively until at last i felt my temper going  damnation he exclaimed at some petulance of mine cant you see im in a worse hole than you are  and he got up and went for the brandy drink he said returning you logicchopping chalkyfaced saint of an atheist drink  not i said i and sat grimly watching his face under the yellow paraffine flare as he drank himself into a garrulous misery  i have a memory of infinite tedium  he wandered into a maudlin defence of the beast people and of mling mling he said was the only thing that had ever really cared for him and suddenly an idea came to him  im damned said he staggering to his feet and clutching the brandy bottle  by some flash of intuition i knew what it was he intended you dont give drink to that beast  i said rising and facing him  beast said he  youre the beast  he takes his liquor like a christian  come out of the way prendick  for gods sake said i  getout of the way he roared and suddenly whipped out his revolver  very well said i and stood aside halfminded to fall upon him as he put his hand upon the latch but deterred by the thought of my useless arm  youve made a beast of yourselfto the beasts you may go  he flung the doorway open and stood half facing me between the yellow lamplight and the pallid glare of the moon his eyesockets were blotches of black under his stubbly eyebrows  youre a solemn prig prendick a silly ass  youre always fearing and fancying  were on the edge of things  im bound to cut my throat tomorrow im going to have a damned bank holiday tonight he turned and went out into the moonlight  mling he cried mling old friend  three dim creatures in the silvery light came along the edge of the wan beachone a whitewrapped creature the other two blotches of blackness following it  they halted staring then i saw mlings hunched shoulders as he came round the corner of the house  drink cried montgomery drink you brutes  drink and be men damme im the cleverest  moreau forgot this this is the last touch drink i tell you  and waving the bottle in his hand he started off at a kind of quick trot to the westward mling ranging himself between him and the three dim creatures who followed  i went to the doorway  they were already indistinct in the mist of the moonlight before montgomery halted  i saw him administer a dose of the raw brandy to mling and saw the five figures melt into one vague patch  sing  i heard montgomery shoutsing all together confound old prendick  thats right now again confound old prendick  the black group broke up into five separate figures and wound slowly away from me along the band of shining beach each went howling at his own sweet will yelping insults at me or giving whatever other vent this new inspiration of brandy demanded presently i heard montgomerys voice shouting right turn and they passed with their shouts and howls into the blackness of the landward trees  slowly very slowly they receded into silence  the peaceful splendour of the night healed again the moon was now past the meridian and travelling down the west it was at its full and very bright riding through the empty blue sky the shadow of the wall lay a yard wide and of inky blackness at my feet the eastward sea was a featureless grey dark and mysterious and between the sea and the shadow the grey sands of volcanic glass and crystals flashed and shone like a beach of diamonds behind me the paraffine lamp flared hot and ruddy  then i shut the door locked it and went into the enclosure where moreau lay beside his latest victimsthe staghounds and the llama and some other wretched bruteswith his massive face calm even after his terrible death and with the hard eyes open staring at the dead white moon above  i sat down upon the edge of the sink and with my eyes upon that ghastly pile of silvery light and ominous shadows began to turn over my plans  in the morning i would gather some provisions in the dingey and after setting fire to the pyre before me push out into the desolation of the high sea once more i felt that for montgomery there was no help that he was in truth half akin to these beast folk unfitted for human kindred  i do not know how long i sat there scheming  it must have been an hour or so  then my planning was interrupted by the return of montgomery to my neighbourhood  i heard a yelling from many throats a tumult of exultant cries passing down towards the beach whooping and howling and excited shrieks that seemed to come to a stop near the waters edge  the riot rose and fell i heard heavy blows and the splintering smash of wood but it did not trouble me then a discordant chanting began  my thoughts went back to my means of escape  i got up brought the lamp and went into a shed to look at some kegs i had seen there then i became interested in the contents of some biscuittins and opened one  i saw something out of the tail of my eyea red figureand turned sharply  behind me lay the yard vividly blackandwhite in the moonlight and the pile of wood and faggots on which moreau and his mutilated victims lay one over another  they seemed to be gripping one another in one last revengeful grapple  his wounds gaped black as night and the blood that had dripped lay in black patches upon the sand then i saw without understanding the cause of my phantoma ruddy glow that came and danced and went upon the wall opposite i misinterpreted this fancied it was a reflection of my flickering lamp and turned again to the stores in the shed i went on rummaging among them as well as a onearmed man could finding this convenient thing and that and putting them aside for tomorrows launch  my movements were slow and the time passed quickly  insensibly the daylight crept upon me  the chanting died down giving place to a clamour then it began again and suddenly broke into a tumult  i heard cries of more more a sound like quarrelling and a sudden wild shriek the quality of the sounds changed so greatly that it arrested my attention  i went out into the yard and listened then cutting like a knife across the confusion came the crack of a revolver  i rushed at once through my room to the little doorway as i did so i heard some of the packingcases behind me go sliding down and smash together with a clatter of glass on the floor of the shed but i did not heed these  i flung the door open and looked out  up the beach by the boathouse a bonfire was burning raining up sparks into the indistinctness of the dawn  around this struggled a mass of black figures  i heard montgomery call my name i began to run at once towards this fire revolver in hand  i saw the pink tongue of montgomerys pistol lick out once close to the ground he was down  i shouted with all my strength and fired into the air i heard some one cry the master  the knotted black struggle broke into scattering units the fire leapt and sank down the crowd of beast people fled in sudden panic before me up the beach in my excitement i fired at their retreating backs as they disappeared among the bushes  then i turned to the black heaps upon the ground  montgomery lay on his back with the hairygrey beastman sprawling across his body  the brute was dead but still gripping montgomerys throat with its curving claws near by lay mling on his face and quite still his neck bitten open and the upper part of the smashed brandybottle in his hand two other figures lay near the firethe one motionless the other groaning fitfully every now and then raising its head slowly then dropping it again  i caught hold of the grey man and pulled him off montgomerys body his claws drew down the torn coat reluctantly as i dragged him away montgomery was dark in the face and scarcely breathing  i splashed seawater on his face and pillowed his head on my rolledup coat mling was dead  the wounded creature by the fireit was a wolfbrute with a bearded grey facelay i found with the fore part of its body upon the still glowing timber  the wretched thing was injured so dreadfully that in mercy i blew its brains out at once the other brute was one of the bullmen swathed in white he too was dead  the rest of the beast people had vanished from the beach  i went to montgomery again and knelt beside him cursing my ignorance of medicine  the fire beside me had sunk down and only charred beams of timber glowing at the central ends and mixed with a grey ash of brushwood remained  i wondered casually where montgomery had got his wood  then i saw that the dawn was upon us the sky had grown brighter the setting moon was becoming pale and opaque in the luminous blue of the day  the sky to the eastward was rimmed with red  suddenly i heard a thud and a hissing behind me and looking round sprang to my feet with a cry of horror  against the warm dawn great tumultuous masses of black smoke were boiling up out of the enclosure and through their stormy darkness shot flickering threads of bloodred flame  then the thatched roof caught i saw the curving charge of the flames across the sloping straw a spurt of fire jetted from the window of my room  i knew at once what had happened  i remembered the crash i had heard when i had rushed out to montgomerys assistance i had overturned the lamp  the hopelessness of saving any of the contents of the enclosure stared me in the face  my mind came back to my plan of flight and turning swiftly i looked to see where the two boats lay upon the beach  they were gone  two axes lay upon the sands beside me chips and splinters were scattered broadcast and the ashes of the bonfire were blackening and smoking under the dawn montgomery had burnt the boats to revenge himself upon me and prevent our return to mankind  a sudden convulsion of rage shook me  i was almost moved to batter his foolish head in as he lay there helpless at my feet then suddenly his hand moved so feebly so pitifully that my wrath vanished  he groaned and opened his eyes for a minute i knelt down beside him and raised his head  he opened his eyes again staring silently at the dawn and then they met mine the lids fell  sorry he said presently with an effort  he seemed trying to think the last he murmured the last of this silly universe what a mess  i listened  his head fell helplessly to one side  i thought some drink might revive him but there was neither drink nor vessel in which to bring drink at hand  he seemed suddenly heavier  my heart went cold i bent down to his face put my hand through the rent in his blouse he was dead and even as he died a line of white heat the limb of the sun rose eastward beyond the projection of the bay splashing its radiance across the sky and turning the dark sea into a weltering tumult of dazzling light  it fell like a glory upon his deathshrunken face  i let his head fall gently upon the rough pillow i had made for him and stood up  before me was the glittering desolation of the sea the awful solitude upon which i had already suffered so much behind me the island hushed under the dawn its beast people silent and unseen the enclosure with all its provisions and ammunition burnt noisily with sudden gusts of flame a fitful crackling and now and then a crash the heavy smoke drove up the beach away from me rolling low over the distant treetops towards the huts in the ravine beside me were the charred vestiges of the boats and these five dead bodies  then out of the bushes came three beast people with hunched shoulders protruding heads misshapen hands awkwardly held and inquisitive unfriendly eyes and advanced towards me with hesitating gestures     xx  alone with the beast folk   i faced these people facing my fate in them singlehanded nowliterally singlehanded for i had a broken arm  in my pocket was a revolver with two empty chambers  among the chips scattered about the beach lay the two axes that had been used to chop up the boats the tide was creeping in behind me  there was nothing for it but courage  i looked squarely into the faces of the advancing monsters they avoided my eyes and their quivering nostrils investigated the bodies that lay beyond me on the beach  i took halfadozen steps picked up the bloodstained whip that lay beneath the body of the wolfman and cracked it  they stopped and stared at me  salute said i bow down  they hesitated  one bent his knees  i repeated my command with my heart in my mouth and advanced upon them  one knelt then the other two  i turned and walked towards the dead bodies keeping my face towards the three kneeling beast men very much as an actor passing up the stage faces the audience  they broke the law said i putting my foot on the sayer of the law they have been slaineven the sayer of the law even the other with the whip  great is the law  come and see  none escape said one of them advancing and peering  none escape said i therefore hear and do as i command they stood up looking questioningly at one another  stand there said i  i picked up the hatchets and swung them by their heads from the sling of my arm turned montgomery over picked up his revolver still loaded in two chambers and bending down to rummage found halfadozen cartridges in his pocket  take him said i standing up again and pointing with the whip take him and carry him out and cast him into the sea  they came forward evidently still afraid of montgomery but still more afraid of my cracking red whiplash and after some fumbling and hesitation some whipcracking and shouting they lifted him gingerly carried him down to the beach and went splashing into the dazzling welter of the sea  on said i on  carry him far  they went in up to their armpits and stood regarding me  let go said i and the body of montgomery vanished with a splash something seemed to tighten across my chest  good said i with a break in my voice and they came back hurrying and fearful to the margin of the water leaving long wakes of black in the silver  at the waters edge they stopped turning and glaring into the sea as though they presently expected montgomery to arise therefrom and exact vengeance  now these said i pointing to the other bodies  they took care not to approach the place where they had thrown montgomery into the water but instead carried the four dead beast people slantingly along the beach for perhaps a hundred yards before they waded out and cast them away  as i watched them disposing of the mangled remains of mling i heard a light footfall behind me and turning quickly saw the big hyenaswine perhaps a dozen yards away  his head was bent down his bright eyes were fixed upon me his stumpy hands clenched and held close by his side  he stopped in this crouching attitude when i turned his eyes a little averted  for a moment we stood eye to eye  i dropped the whip and snatched at the pistol in my pocket for i meant to kill this brute the most formidable of any left now upon the island at the first excuse it may seem treacherous but so i was resolved  i was far more afraid of him than of any other two of the beast folk his continued life was i knew a threat against mine  i was perhaps a dozen seconds collecting myself  then cried i salute bow down  his teeth flashed upon me in a snarl  who are you that i should  perhaps a little too spasmodically i drew my revolver aimed quickly and fired  i heard him yelp saw him run sideways and turn knew i had missed and clicked back the cock with my thumb for the next shot but he was already running headlong jumping from side to side and i dared not risk another miss  every now and then he looked back at me over his shoulder  he went slanting along the beach and vanished beneath the driving masses of dense smoke that were still pouring out from the burning enclosure  for some time i stood staring after him  i turned to my three obedient beast folk again and signalled them to drop the body they still carried then i went back to the place by the fire where the bodies had fallen and kicked the sand until all the brown bloodstains were absorbed and hidden  i dismissed my three serfs with a wave of the hand and went up the beach into the thickets  i carried my pistol in my hand my whip thrust with the hatchets in the sling of my arm i was anxious to be alone to think out the position in which i was now placed  a dreadful thing that i was only beginning to realise was that over all this island there was now no safe place where i could be alone and secure to rest or sleep i had recovered strength amazingly since my landing but i was still inclined to be nervous and to break down under any great stress i felt that i ought to cross the island and establish myself with the beast people and make myself secure in their confidence but my heart failed me  i went back to the beach and turning eastward past the burning enclosure made for a point where a shallow spit of coral sand ran out towards the reef  here i could sit down and think my back to the sea and my face against any surprise and there i sat chin on knees the sun beating down upon my head and unspeakable dread in my mind plotting how i could live on against the hour of my rescue if ever rescue came i tried to review the whole situation as calmly as i could but it was difficult to clear the thing of emotion  i began turning over in my mind the reason of montgomerys despair they will change he said they are sure to change  and moreau what was it that moreau had said  the stubborn beastflesh grows day by day back again  then i came round to the hyenaswine i felt sure that if i did not kill that brute he would kill me the sayer of the law was dead  worse luck  they knew now that we of the whips could be killed even as they themselves were killed were they peering at me already out of the green masses of ferns and palms over yonder watching until i came within their spring were they plotting against me  what was the hyenaswine telling them my imagination was running away with me into a morass of unsubstantial fears  my thoughts were disturbed by a crying of seabirds hurrying towards some black object that had been stranded by the waves on the beach near the enclosure  i knew what that object was but i had not the heart to go back and drive them off i began walking along the beach in the opposite direction designing to come round the eastward corner of the island and so approach the ravine of the huts without traversing the possible ambuscades of the thickets  perhaps half a mile along the beach i became aware of one of my three beast folk advancing out of the landward bushes towards me  i was now so nervous with my own imaginings that i immediately drew my revolver even the propitiatory gestures of the creature failed to disarm me he hesitated as he approached  go away cried i  there was something very suggestive of a dog in the cringing attitude of the creature  it retreated a little way very like a dog being sent home and stopped looking at me imploringly with canine brown eyes  go away said i do not come near me  may i not come near you it said  no go away i insisted and snapped my whip  then putting my whip in my teeth i stooped for a stone and with that threat drove the creature away  so in solitude i came round by the ravine of the beast people and hiding among the weeds and reeds that separated this crevice from the sea i watched such of them as appeared trying to judge from their gestures and appearance how the death of moreau and montgomery and the destruction of the house of pain had affected them  i know now the folly of my cowardice had i kept my courage up to the level of the dawn had i not allowed it to ebb away in solitary thought i might have grasped the vacant sceptre of moreau and ruled over the beast people as it was i lost the opportunity and sank to the position of a mere leader among my fellows  towards noon certain of them came and squatted basking in the hot sand the imperious voices of hunger and thirst prevailed over my dread i came out of the bushes and revolver in hand walked down towards these seated figures  one a wolfwoman turned her head and stared at me and then the others  none attempted to rise or salute me i felt too faint and weary to insist and i let the moment pass  i want food said i almost apologetically and drawing near  there is food in the huts said an oxboarman drowsily and looking away from me  i passed them and went down into the shadow and odours of the almost deserted ravine  in an empty hut i feasted on some specked and halfdecayed fruit and then after i had propped some branches and sticks about the opening and placed myself with my face towards it and my hand upon my revolver the exhaustion of the last thirty hours claimed its own and i fell into a light slumber hoping that the flimsy barricade i had erected would cause sufficient noise in its removal to save me from surprise     xxi  the reversion of the beast folk   in this way i became one among the beast people in the island of doctor moreau  when i awoke it was dark about me  my arm ached in its bandages  i sat up wondering at first where i might be i heard coarse voices talking outside  then i saw that my barricade had gone and that the opening of the hut stood clear my revolver was still in my hand  i heard something breathing saw something crouched together close beside me  i held my breath trying to see what it was it began to move slowly interminably  then something soft and warm and moist passed across my hand  all my muscles contracted  i snatched my hand away  a cry of alarm began and was stifled in my throat then i just realised what had happened sufficiently to stay my fingers on the revolver  who is that  i said in a hoarse whisper the revolver still pointed  imaster  who are you  they say there is no master now  but i know i know  i carried the bodies into the sea o walker in the sea the bodies of those you slew i am your slave master  are you the one i met on the beach i asked  the same master  the thing was evidently faithful enough for it might have fallen upon me as i slept  it is well i said extending my hand for another licking kiss  i began to realise what its presence meant and the tide of my courage flowed  where are the others i asked  they are mad they are fools said the dogman  even now they talk together beyond there  they say the master is dead the other with the whip is dead  that other who walked in the sea is as we are  we have no master no whips no house of pain any more there is an end  we love the law and will keep it but there is no pain no master no whips for ever again  so they say but i know master i know  i felt in the darkness and patted the dogmans head  it is well i said again  presently you will slay them all said the dogman  presently i answered i will slay them allafter certain days and certain things have come to pass  every one of them save those you spare every one of them shall be slain  what the master wishes to kill the master kills said the dogman with a certain satisfaction in his voice  and that their sins may grow i said let them live in their folly until their time is ripe  let them not know that i am the master  the masters will is sweet said the dogman with the ready tact of his canine blood  but one has sinned said i him i will kill whenever i may meet him when i say to you that is he see that you fall upon him and now i will go to the men and women who are assembled together  for a moment the opening of the hut was blackened by the exit of the dogman then i followed and stood up almost in the exact spot where i had been when i had heard moreau and his staghound pursuing me but now it was night and all the miasmatic ravine about me was black and beyond instead of a green sunlit slope i saw a red fire before which hunched grotesque figures moved to and fro farther were the thick trees a bank of darkness fringed above with the black lace of the upper branches  the moon was just riding up on the edge of the ravine and like a bar across its face drove the spire of vapour that was for ever streaming from the fumaroles of the island  walk by me said i nerving myself and side by side we walked down the narrow way taking little heed of the dim things that peered at us out of the huts  none about the fire attempted to salute me  most of them disregarded me ostentatiously  i looked round for the hyenaswine but he was not there  altogether perhaps twenty of the beast folk squatted staring into the fire or talking to one another  he is dead he is dead the master is dead said the voice of the apeman to the right of me  the house of painthere is no house of pain  he is not dead said i in a loud voice  even now he watches us  this startled them  twenty pairs of eyes regarded me  the house of pain is gone said i it will come again the master you cannot see yet even now he listens among you  true true said the dogman  they were staggered at my assurance  an animal may be ferocious and cunning enough but it takes a real man to tell a lie  the man with the bandaged arm speaks a strange thing said one of the beast folk  i tell you it is so i said  the master and the house of pain will come again  woe be to him who breaks the law  they looked curiously at one another  with an affectation of indifference i began to chop idly at the ground in front of me with my hatchet they looked i noticed at the deep cuts i made in the turf  then the satyr raised a doubt  i answered him  then one of the dappled things objected and an animated discussion sprang up round the fire every moment i began to feel more convinced of my present security i talked now without the catching in my breath due to the intensity of my excitement that had troubled me at first  in the course of about an hour i had really convinced several of the beast folk of the truth of my assertions and talked most of the others into a dubious state i kept a sharp eye for my enemy the hyenaswine but he never appeared every now and then a suspicious movement would startle me but my confidence grew rapidly  then as the moon crept down from the zenith one by one the listeners began to yawn showing the oddest teeth in the light of the sinking fire and first one and then another retired towards the dens in the ravine and i dreading the silence and darkness went with them knowing i was safer with several of them than with one alone  in this manner began the longer part of my sojourn upon this island of doctor moreau  but from that night until the end came there was but one thing happened to tell save a series of innumerable small unpleasant details and the fretting of an incessant uneasiness so that i prefer to make no chronicle for that gap of time to tell only one cardinal incident of the ten months i spent as an intimate of these halfhumanised brutes  there is much that sticks in my memory that i could writethings that i would cheerfully give my right hand to forget but they do not help the telling of the story  in the retrospect it is strange to remember how soon i fell in with these monsters ways and gained my confidence again i had my quarrels with them of course and could show some of their teethmarks still but they soon gained a wholesome respect for my trick of throwing stones and for the bite of my hatchet and my saintbernardmans loyalty was of infinite service to me i found their simple scale of honour was based mainly on the capacity for inflicting trenchant wounds  indeed i may saywithout vanity i hopethat i held something like preeminence among them one or two whom in a rare access of high spirits i had scarred rather badly bore me a grudge but it vented itself chiefly behind my back and at a safe distance from my missiles in grimaces  the hyenaswine avoided me and i was always on the alert for him my inseparable dogman hated and dreaded him intensely i really believe that was at the root of the brutes attachment to me it was soon evident to me that the former monster had tasted blood and gone the way of the leopardman he formed a lair somewhere in the forest and became solitary  once i tried to induce the beast folk to hunt him but i lacked the authority to make them cooperate for one end again and again i tried to approach his den and come upon him unaware but always he was too acute for me and saw or winded me and got away he too made every forest pathway dangerous to me and my ally with his lurking ambuscades  the dogman scarcely dared to leave my side  in the first month or so the beast folk compared with their latter condition were human enough and for one or two besides my canine friend i even conceived a friendly tolerance the little pink slothcreature displayed an odd affection for me and took to following me about  the monkeyman bored me however he assumed on the strength of his five digits that he was my equal and was for ever jabbering at mejabbering the most arrant nonsense one thing about him entertained me a little  he had a fantastic trick of coining new words  he had an idea i believe that to gabble about names that meant nothing was the proper use of speech he called it big thinks to distinguish it from little thinks the sane everyday interests of life  if ever i made a remark he did not understand he would praise it very much ask me to say it again learn it by heart and go off repeating it with a word wrong here or there to all the milder of the beast people he thought nothing of what was plain and comprehensible i invented some very curious big thinks for his especial use i think now that he was the silliest creature i ever met he had developed in the most wonderful way the distinctive silliness of man without losing one jot of the natural folly of a monkey  this i say was in the earlier weeks of my solitude among these brutes during that time they respected the usage established by the law and behaved with general decorum  once i found another rabbit torn to piecesby the hyenaswine i am assuredbut that was all it was about may when i first distinctly perceived a growing difference in their speech and carriage a growing coarseness of articulation a growing disinclination to talk  my monkeymans jabber multiplied in volume but grew less and less comprehensible more and more simian some of the others seemed altogether slipping their hold upon speech though they still understood what i said to them at that time can you imagine language once clearcut and exact softening and guttering losing shape and import becoming mere lumps of sound again and they walked erect with an increasing difficulty  though they evidently felt ashamed of themselves every now and then i would come upon one or another running on toes and fingertips and quite unable to recover the vertical attitude  they held things more clumsily drinking by suction feeding by gnawing grew commoner every day i realised more keenly than ever what moreau had told me about the stubborn beastflesh they were reverting and reverting very rapidly  some of themthe pioneers in this i noticed with some surprise were all femalesbegan to disregard the injunction of decency deliberately for the most part  others even attempted public outrages upon the institution of monogamy  the tradition of the law was clearly losing its force  i cannot pursue this disagreeable subject  my dogman imperceptibly slipped back to the dog again day by day he became dumb quadrupedal hairy  i scarcely noticed the transition from the companion on my right hand to the lurching dog at my side  as the carelessness and disorganisation increased from day to day the lane of dwelling places at no time very sweet became so loathsome that i left it and going across the island made myself a hovel of boughs amid the black ruins of moreaus enclosure some memory of pain i found still made that place the safest from the beast folk  it would be impossible to detail every step of the lapsing of these monstersto tell how day by day the human semblance left them how they gave up bandagings and wrappings abandoned at last every stitch of clothing how the hair began to spread over the exposed limbs how their foreheads fell away and their faces projected how the quasihuman intimacy i had permitted myself with some of them in the first month of my loneliness became a shuddering horror to recall  the change was slow and inevitable  for them and for me it came without any definite shock  i still went among them in safety because no jolt in the downward glide had released the increasing charge of explosive animalism that ousted the human day by day but i began to fear that soon now that shock must come my saintbernardbrute followed me to the enclosure every night and his vigilance enabled me to sleep at times in something like peace the little pink sloththing became shy and left me to crawl back to its natural life once more among the treebranches we were in just the state of equilibrium that would remain in one of those happy family cages which animaltamers exhibit if the tamer were to leave it for ever  of course these creatures did not decline into such beasts as the reader has seen in zoological gardensinto ordinary bears wolves tigers oxen swine and apes  there was still something strange about each in each moreau had blended this animal with that one perhaps was ursine chiefly another feline chiefly another bovine chiefly but each was tainted with other creaturesa kind of generalised animalism appearing through the specific dispositions and the dwindling shreds of the humanity still startled me every now and thena momentary recrudescence of speech perhaps an unexpected dexterity of the forefeet a pitiful attempt to walk erect  i too must have undergone strange changes  my clothes hung about me as yellow rags through whose rents showed the tanned skin my hair grew long and became matted together  i am told that even now my eyes have a strange brightness a swift alertness of movement  at first i spent the daylight hours on the southward beach watching for a ship hoping and praying for a ship i counted on the ipecacuanha returning as the year wore on but she never came  five times i saw sails and thrice smoke but nothing ever touched the island  i always had a bonfire ready but no doubt the volcanic reputation of the island was taken to account for that  it was only about september or october that i began to think of making a raft  by that time my arm had healed and both my hands were at my service again  at first i found my helplessness appalling i had never done any carpentry or suchlike work in my life and i spent day after day in experimental chopping and binding among the trees i had no ropes and could hit on nothing wherewith to make ropes none of the abundant creepers seemed limber or strong enough and with all my litter of scientific education i could not devise any way of making them so  i spent more than a fortnight grubbing among the black ruins of the enclosure and on the beach where the boats had been burnt looking for nails and other stray pieces of metal that might prove of service now and then some beastcreature would watch me and go leaping off when i called to it  there came a season of thunderstorms and heavy rain which greatly retarded my work but at last the raft was completed  i was delighted with it  but with a certain lack of practical sense which has always been my bane i had made it a mile or more from the sea and before i had dragged it down to the beach the thing had fallen to pieces  perhaps it is as well that i was saved from launching it but at the time my misery at my failure was so acute that for some days i simply moped on the beach and stared at the water and thought of death  i did not however mean to die and an incident occurred that warned me unmistakably of the folly of letting the days pass sofor each fresh day was fraught with increasing danger from the beast people  i was lying in the shade of the enclosure wall staring out to sea when i was startled by something cold touching the skin of my heel and starting round found the little pink slothcreature blinking into my face  he had long since lost speech and active movement and the lank hair of the little brute grew thicker every day and his stumpy claws more askew  he made a moaning noise when he saw he had attracted my attention went a little way towards the bushes and looked back at me  at first i did not understand but presently it occurred to me that he wished me to follow him and this i did at lastslowly for the day was hot  when we reached the trees he clambered into them for he could travel better among their swinging creepers than on the ground and suddenly in a trampled space i came upon a ghastly group my saintbernardcreature lay on the ground dead and near his body crouched the hyenaswine gripping the quivering flesh with its misshapen claws gnawing at it and snarling with delight as i approached the monster lifted its glaring eyes to mine its lips went trembling back from its redstained teeth and it growled menacingly  it was not afraid and not ashamed the last vestige of the human taint had vanished  i advanced a step farther stopped and pulled out my revolver  at last i had him face to face  the brute made no sign of retreat but its ears went back its hair bristled and its body crouched together i aimed between the eyes and fired  as i did so the thing rose straight at me in a leap and i was knocked over like a ninepin it clutched at me with its crippled hand and struck me in the face its spring carried it over me  i fell under the hind part of its body but luckily i had hit as i meant and it had died even as it leapt i crawled out from under its unclean weight and stood up trembling staring at its quivering body  that danger at least was over but this i knew was only the first of the series of relapses that must come  i burnt both of the bodies on a pyre of brushwood but after that i saw that unless i left the island my death was only a question of time the beast people by that time had with one or two exceptions left the ravine and made themselves lairs according to their taste among the thickets of the island  few prowled by day most of them slept and the island might have seemed deserted to a newcomer but at night the air was hideous with their calls and howling i had half a mind to make a massacre of them to build traps or fight them with my knife  had i possessed sufficient cartridges i should not have hesitated to begin the killing  there could now be scarcely a score left of the dangerous carnivores the braver of these were already dead  after the death of this poor dog of mine my last friend i too adopted to some extent the practice of slumbering in the daytime in order to be on my guard at night i rebuilt my den in the walls of the enclosure with such a narrow opening that anything attempting to enter must necessarily make a considerable noise  the creatures had lost the art of fire too and recovered their fear of it  i turned once more almost passionately now to hammering together stakes and branches to form a raft for my escape  i found a thousand difficulties  i am an extremely unhandy man my schooling was over before the days of slojd but most of the requirements of a raft i met at last in some clumsy circuitous way or other and this time i took care of the strength the only insurmountable obstacle was that i had no vessel to contain the water i should need if i floated forth upon these untravelled seas i would have even tried pottery but the island contained no clay i used to go moping about the island trying with all my might to solve this one last difficulty  sometimes i would give way to wild outbursts of rage and hack and splinter some unlucky tree in my intolerable vexation  but i could think of nothing  and then came a day a wonderful day which i spent in ecstasy i saw a sail to the southwest a small sail like that of a little schooner and forthwith i lit a great pile of brushwood and stood by it in the heat of it and the heat of the midday sun watching  all day i watched that sail eating or drinking nothing so that my head reeled and the beasts came and glared at me and seemed to wonder and went away  it was still distant when night came and swallowed it up and all night i toiled to keep my blaze bright and high and the eyes of the beasts shone out of the darkness marvelling in the dawn the sail was nearer and i saw it was the dirty lugsail of a small boat  but it sailed strangely  my eyes were weary with watching and i peered and could not believe them two men were in the boat sitting low downone by the bows the other at the rudder  the head was not kept to the wind it yawed and fell away  as the day grew brighter i began waving the last rag of my jacket to them but they did not notice me and sat still facing each other  i went to the lowest point of the low headland and gesticulated and shouted there was no response and the boat kept on her aimless course making slowly very slowly for the bay  suddenly a great white bird flew up out of the boat and neither of the men stirred nor noticed it it circled round and then came sweeping overhead with its strong wings outspread  then i stopped shouting and sat down on the headland and rested my chin on my hands and stared  slowly slowly the boat drove past towards the west  i would have swum out to it but somethinga cold vague fearkept me back  in the afternoon the tide stranded the boat and left it a hundred yards or so to the westward of the ruins of the enclosure the men in it were dead had been dead so long that they fell to pieces when i tilted the boat on its side and dragged them out one had a shock of red hair like the captain of the ipecacuanha and a dirty white cap lay in the bottom of the boat  as i stood beside the boat three of the beasts came slinking out of the bushes and sniffing towards me  one of my spasms of disgust came upon me  i thrust the little boat down the beach and clambered on board her  two of the brutes were wolfbeasts and came forward with quivering nostrils and glittering eyes the third was the horrible nondescript of bear and bull when i saw them approaching those wretched remains heard them snarling at one another and caught the gleam of their teeth a frantic horror succeeded my repulsion  i turned my back upon them struck the lug and began paddling out to sea  i could not bring myself to look behind me  i lay however between the reef and the island that night and the next morning went round to the stream and filled the empty keg aboard with water  then with such patience as i could command i collected a quantity of fruit and waylaid and killed two rabbits with my last three cartridges  while i was doing this i left the boat moored to an inward projection of the reef for fear of the beast people     xxii  the man alone   in the evening i started and drove out to sea before a gentle wind from the southwest slowly steadily and the island grew smaller and smaller and the lank spire of smoke dwindled to a finer and finer line against the hot sunset  the ocean rose up around me hiding that low dark patch from my eyes  the daylight the trailing glory of the sun went streaming out of the sky was drawn aside like some luminous curtain and at last i looked into the blue gulf of immensity which the sunshine hides and saw the floating hosts of the stars  the sea was silent the sky was silent i was alone with the night and silence  so i drifted for three days eating and drinking sparingly and meditating upon all that had happened to menot desiring very greatly then to see men again  one unclean rag was about me my hair a black tangle no doubt my discoverers thought me a madman  it is strange but i felt no desire to return to mankind i was only glad to be quit of the foulness of the beast people and on the third day i was picked up by a brig from apia to san francisco neither the captain nor the mate would believe my story judging that solitude and danger had made me mad and fearing their opinion might be that of others i refrained from telling my adventure further and professed to recall nothing that had happened to me between the loss of the lady vain and the time when i was picked up againthe space of a year  i had to act with the utmost circumspection to save myself from the suspicion of insanity  my memory of the law of the two dead sailors of the ambuscades of the darkness of the body in the canebrake haunted me and unnatural as it seems with my return to mankind came instead of that confidence and sympathy i had expected a strange enhancement of the uncertainty and dread i had experienced during my stay upon the island  no one would believe me i was almost as queer to men as i had been to the beast people i may have caught something of the natural wildness of my companions they say that terror is a disease and anyhow i can witness that for several years now a restless fear has dwelt in my mindsuch a restless fear as a halftamed lion cub may feel  my trouble took the strangest form  i could not persuade myself that the men and women i met were not also another beast people animals half wrought into the outward image of human souls and that they would presently begin to revertto show first this bestial mark and then that  but i have confided my case to a strangely able mana man who had known moreau and seemed half to credit my story a mental specialistand he has helped me mightily though i do not expect that the terror of that island will ever altogether leave me at most times it lies far in the back of my mind a mere distant cloud a memory and a faint distrust but there are times when the little cloud spreads until it obscures the whole sky  then i look about me at my fellowmen and i go in fear  i see faces keen and bright others dull or dangerous others unsteady insincerenone that have the calm authority of a reasonable soul  i feel as though the animal was surging up through them that presently the degradation of the islanders will be played over again on a larger scale i know this is an illusion that these seeming men and women about me are indeed men and womenmen and women for ever perfectly reasonable creatures full of human desires and tender solicitude emancipated from instinct and the slaves of no fantastic lawbeings altogether different from the beast folk  yet i shrink from them from their curious glances their inquiries and assistance and long to be away from them and alone  for that reason i live near the broad free downland and can escape thither when this shadow is over my soul and very sweet is the empty downland then under the windswept sky  when i lived in london the horror was wellnigh insupportable i could not get away from men  their voices came through windows locked doors were flimsy safeguards  i would go out into the streets to fight with my delusion and prowling women would mew after me furtive craving men glance jealously at me weary pale workers go coughing by me with tired eyes and eager paces like wounded deer dripping blood old people bent and dull pass murmuring to themselves and all unheeding a ragged tail of gibing children then i would turn aside into some chapeland even there such was my disturbance it seemed that the preacher gibbered big thinks even as the apeman had done or into some library and there the intent faces over the books seemed but patient creatures waiting for prey  particularly nauseous were the blank expressionless faces of people in trains and omnibuses they seemed no more my fellowcreatures than dead bodies would be so that i did not dare to travel unless i was assured of being alone and even it seemed that i too was not a reasonable creature but only an animal tormented with some strange disorder in its brain which sent it to wander alone like a sheep stricken with gid  this is a mood however that comes to me now i thank god more rarely  i have withdrawn myself from the confusion of cities and multitudes and spend my days surrounded by wise booksbright windows in this life of ours lit by the shining souls of men i see few strangers and have but a small household my days i devote to reading and to experiments in chemistry and i spend many of the clear nights in the study of astronomy there isthough i do not know how there is or why there isa sense of infinite peace and protection in the glittering hosts of heaven there it must be i think in the vast and eternal laws of matter and not in the daily cares and sins and troubles of men that whatever is more than animal within us must find its solace and its hope  i hope or i could not live  and so in hope and solitude my story ends  edward prendick   note  the substance of the
