from rock to rock i went   from hill to hill in discontent   of pleasure high and turbulent           most pleasd when most uneasy   but now my own delights i make   my thirst at every rill can slake   and gladly natures love partake           of thee sweet daisy    when soothed a while by milder airs   thee winter in the garland wears                         10   that thinly shades his few grey hairs            spring cannot shun thee   whole summer fields are thine by right   and autumn melancholy wight   doth in thy crimson head delight            when rains are on thee    in shoals and bands a morrice train   thou greetst the traveller in the lane   if welcome once thou countst it gain            thou art not daunted                           20   nor carst if thou be set at naught   and oft alone in nooks remote   we meet thee like a pleasant thought            when such are wanted    be violets in their secret mews   the flowers the wanton zephyrs chuse   proud be the rose with rains and dews           her head impearling   thou livst with less ambitious aim   yet hast not gone without thy fame                      30   thou art indeed by many a claim           the poets darling    if to a rock from rains he fly   or some bright day of april sky   imprisond by hot sunshine lie           near the green holly   and wearily at length should fare   he need but look about and there   thou art a friend at hand to scare           his melancholy                                  40    a hundred times by rock or bower   ere thus i have lain couchd an hour   have i derived from thy sweet power           some apprehension   some steady love some brief delight   some memory that had taken flight   some chime of fancy wrong or right           or stray invention    if stately passions in me burn   and one chance look to thee should turn                 50   i drink out of an humbler urn           a lowlier pleasure   the homely sympathy that heeds   the common life our nature breeds   a wisdom fitted to the needs           of hearts at leisure    when smitten by the morning ray   i see thee rise alert and gay   then chearful flower my spirits play           with kindred motion                             60   at dusk ive seldom markd thee press   the ground as if in thankfulness   without some feeling more or less           of true devotion    and all day long i number yet   all seasons through another debt   which i wherever thou art met           to thee am owing   an instinct call it a blind sense   a happy genial influence                               70   coming one knows not how nor whence           nor whither going    child of the year that round dost run   thy course bold lover of the sun   and chearful when the days begun           as morning leveret   thou long the poets praise shalt gain   thou wilt be more belovd by men   in times to come thou not in vain           art natures favorite                            80     louisa                                         i met louisa in the shade   and having seen that lovely maid   why should i fear to say   that she is ruddy fleet and strong   and down the rocks can leap along   like rivulets in may    and she hath smiles to earth unknown   smiles that with motion of their own   do spread and sink and rise   that come and go with endless play                      10   and ever as they pass away   are hidden in her eyes    she loves her fire her cottagehome   yet oer the moorland will she roam   in weather rough and bleak   and when against the wind she strains   oh might i kiss the mountain rains   that sparkle on her cheek    take all thats mine beneath the moon   if i with her but half a noon                            20   may sit beneath the walls   of some old cave or mossy nook   when up she winds along the brook   to hunt the waterfalls     fidelity                                         a barking sound the shepherd hears   a cry as of a dog or fox   he halts and searches with his eyes   among the scatterd rocks   and now at distance can discern   a stirring in a brake of fern   from which immediately leaps out   a dog and yelping runs about    the dog is not of mountain breed   its motions too are wild and shy                      10   with something as the shepherd thinks   unusual in its cry   nor is there any one in sight   all round in hollow or on height   nor shout nor whistle strikes his ear   what is the creature doing here    it was a cove a huge recess   that keeps till june decembers snow   a lofty precipice in front   a silent tarn 1 below                                  20   far in the bosom of helvellyn   remote from public road or dwelling   pathway or cultivated land   from trace of human foot or hand  footnote 1 a tarn is a small mere or lake mostly high up in the mountains    there sometimes does a leaping fish   send through the tarn a lonely chear   the crags repeat the ravens croak   in symphony austere   thither the rainbow comes the cloud   and mists that spread the flying shroud                 30   and sunbeams and the sounding blast   that if it could would hurry past   but that enormous barrier binds it fast    not knowing what to think a while   the shepherd stood then makes his way   towards the dog oer rocks and stones   as quickly as he may   nor far had gone before he found   a human skeleton on the ground   sad sight the shepherd with a sigh                      40   looks round to learn the history    from those abrupt and perilous rocks   the man had fallen that place of fear   at length upon the shepherds mind   it breaks and all is clear   he instantly recalld the name   and who he was and whence he came   rememberd too the very day   on which the traveller passd this way    but hear a wonder now for sake                          50   of which this mournful tale i tell   a lasting monument of words   this wonder merits well   the dog which still was hovering nigh   repeating the same timid cry   this dog had been through three months space   a dweller in that savage place    yes proof was plain that since the day   on which the traveller thus had died   the dog had watchd about the spot                      60   or by his masters side   how nourishd here through such long time   he knows who gave that love sublime   and gave that strength of feeling great   above all human estimate    she was a phantom of delight                                         she was a phantom of delight   when first she gleamd upon my sight   a lovely apparition sent   to be a moments ornament   her eyes as stars of twilight fair   like twilights too her dusky hair   but all things else about her drawn   from maytime and the chearful dawn   a dancing shape an image gay   to haunt to startle and waylay                       10    i saw her upon nearer view   a spirit yet a woman too   her household motions light and free   and steps of virgin liberty   a countenance in which did meet   sweet records promises as sweet   a creature not too bright or good   for human natures daily food   for transient sorrows simple wiles   praise blame love kisses tears and smiles          20    and now i see with eye serene   the very pulse of the machine   a being breathing thoughtful breath   a traveller betwixt life and death   the reason firm the temperate will   endurance foresight strength and skill   a perfect woman nobly plannd   to warn to comfort and command   and yet a spirit still and bright   with something of an angel light                        30     the

good       our consecrated robin   that after their bewildering   did cover with leaves the little children       so painfully in the wood    what aild thee robin that thou couldst pursue       a beautiful creature   that is gentle by nature   beneath the summer sky   from flower to flower let him fly                       30   tis all that he wishes to do    the chearer thou of our indoor

the sailors mother                                           one morning raw it was and wet     a foggy day in winter time     a woman in the road i met     not old though something past her prime

country bred     such strength a dignity so fair                      10     she beggd an alms like one in poor estate   i lookd at her again nor did my pride abate      when from these lofty thoughts i woke     with the first word i had to spare     i said to her beneath your cloak     whats that which on your arm you bear     she answerd soon as she the question heard   a simple burthen sir a little singingbird      and thus continuing she said     i had a son who many a day                           20     saild on the seas but he is dead     in denmark he was cast away     and i have been as far as hull to see   what clothes he might have left or other property      the bird and cage they both were his     twas my sons bird and neat and trim     he kept it many voyages     this singingbird hath gone with him     when last he saild he left the bird behind   as it might be perhaps from bodings of his mind      30      he to a fellowlodgers care     had left it to be watchd and fed     till he came back again and there     i found it when my son was dead     and now god help me for my little wit   i trail it with me sir he took so much delight in it     to the small

every man in arms should wish to be   it is the generous spirit who when brought   among the tasks of real life hath wrought   upon the plan that pleased his childish thought   whose high endeavours are an inward light   that make the path before him always bright   who with a natural instinct to discern   what knowledge can perform is diligent to learn   abides by this resolve and stops not there             10   but makes his moral being his prime care   who doomd to go in company with pain   and fear and bloodshed miserable train   turns his necessity to glorious gain   in face of these doth exercise a power   which is our humannatures highest dower   controls them and subdues transmutes bereaves   of their bad influence and their good receives   by objects which might force the soul to abate   her feeling renderd more compassionate                20   is placable because occasions rise   so often that demand such sacrifice   more skilful in selfknowledge even more pure   as tempted more more able to endure   as more exposd to suffering and distress   thence also more alive to tenderness   tis he whose law is reason who depends   upon that law as on the best of friends   whence in a state where men are tempted still   to evil for a guard against worse ill                   30   and what in quality or act is best   doth seldom on a right foundation rest   he fixes good on good alone and owes   to virtue every triumph that he knows   who if he rise to station of command   rises by open means and there will stand   on honourable terms or else retire   and in himself possess his own desire   who comprehends his trust and to the same   keeps faithful with a singleness of aim                 40   and therefore does not stoop nor lie in wait   for wealth or honors or for worldly state   whom they must follow on whose head must fall   like showers of manna if they come at all   whose powers shed round him in the common strife   or mild concerns of ordinary life   a constant influence a peculiar grace   but who if he be called upon to face   some awful moment to which heaven has joind   great issues good or bad for humankind                50   is happy as a lover and attired   with sudden brightness like a man inspired   and through the heat of conflict keeps the law   in calmness made and sees what he foresaw   or if an unexpected call succeed   come when it will is equal to the need   he who though thus endued as with a sense   and faculty for storm and turbulence   is yet a soul whose master bias leans   to homefelt pleasures and to gentle scenes             60   sweet images which wheresoeer he be   are at his heart and such fidelity   it is his darling passion to approve   more brave for this that he hath much to love   tis finally the man who lifted high   conspicuous object in a nations eye   or left unthoughtof in obscurity   who with a toward or untoward lot   prosperous or adverse to his wish or not   plays in the many games of life that one               70   where what he most doth value must be won   whom neither shape of danger can dismay   nor thought of tender happiness betray   who not content that former worth stand fast   looks forward persevering to the last   from well to better daily selfsurpast   who whether praise of him must walk the earth   for ever and to noble deeds give birth   or he must go to dust without his fame   and leave a dead unprofitable name                      80   finds comfort in himself and in his cause   and while the mortal mist is gathering draws   his breath in confidence of heavens applause   this is the happy warrior this is he   whom every man in arms should wish to be                                       the above verses mere written soon after tidings had been received of the death of lord nelson which event directed the authors thoughts to the subject his respect for the memory of his great fellowcountryman induces him to mention this though he is well aware that the verses must suffer from any connection in the readers mind with a name so illustrious     the horn of egremont castle    when the brothers reachd the gateway   eustace pointed with his lance   to the horn which there was hanging   horn of the inheritance   horn it was which none could sound   no one upon living ground   save he who came as rightful heir   to egremonts domains and castle fair    heirs from ages without record   had the house of lucie born                             10   who of right had claimd the lordship   by the proof upon the horn   each at the appointed hour   tried the horn it ownd his power   he was acknowledged and the blast   which good sir eustace sounded was the last    with his lance sir eustace pointed   and to hubert thus said he   what i speak this horn shall witness   for thy better memory                                   20   hear then and neglect me not   at this time and on this spot   the words are utterd from my heart   as my last earnest prayer ere we depart    on good service we are going   life to risk by sea and land   in which course if christ our saviour   do my sinful soul demand   hither come thou back straightway   hubert if alive that day                               30   return and sound the horn that we   may have a living house still left in thee    fear not quickly answerd hubert   as i am thy fathers son   what thou askest noble brother   with gods favour shall be done   so were both right well content   from the castle forth they went   and at the head of their array   to palestine the brothers took their way                40    side by side they fought the lucies   were a line for valour famd   and whereer their strokes alighted   there the saracens were tamd   whence then could it come the thought   by what evil spirit brought   oh can a brave man wish to take   his brothers life for lands and castles sake    sir the ruffians said to hubert   deep he lies in jordan flood                        50   stricken by this ill assurance   pale and trembling hubert stood   take your earningsoh that i   could have seen my brother die   it was a pang that vexd him then   and oft returned again and yet again    months passd on and no sir eustace   nor of him were tidings heard   wherefore bold as day the murderer   back again to england steerd                           60   to his castle hubert sped   he has nothing now to dread   but silent and by stealth he came   and at an hour which nobody could name    none could tell if it were nighttime   night or day at even or morn   for the sound was heard by no one   of the proclamationhorn   but bold hubert lives in glee   months and years went smilingly                         70   with plenty was his table spread   and bright the lady is who shares his bed    likewise he had sons and daughters   and as good men do he sate   at his board by these surrounded   flourishing in fair estate   and while thus in open day   once he sate as old books say   a blast was utterd from the horn   where by the castlegate it hung forlorn                80    tis the breath of good sir eustace   he is come to claim his right   ancient castle woods and mountains   hear the challenge with delight   hubert though the blast be blown   he is helpless and alone   thou hast a dungeon speak the word   and there he may be lodgd and thou be lord    speak astounded hubert cannot   and if power to speak he had                            90   all are daunted all the household   smitten to the heart and sad   tis sir eustace if it be   living man it must be he   thus hubert thought in his dismay   and by a posterngate he slunk away    long and long was he unheard of   to his brother then he came   made confession askd forgiveness   askd it by a brothers name                           100   and by all the saints in heaven   and of eustace was forgivn   then in a convent went to hide   his melancholy head and there

i heard it as before    at length i to the boy calld out   he stoppd his horses at the word                         10   but neither cry nor voice nor shout   nor aught else like it could be heard    the boy then smackd his whip and fast   the horses scamperd through the rain   and soon i heard upon the blast   the voice and bade him halt again    said i alighting on the ground   what can it be this piteous moan   and there a little girl i found   sitting behind the chaise alone                          20    my cloak the word was last and first   and loud and bitterly she wept   as if her

racd about with joy   i heard the woods and distant waters roar   or heard them not as happy as a boy   the pleasant season did my heart employ   my old remembrances went from me wholly

before me unawares   the oldest man he seemd that ever wore grey hairs    my course i stopped as soon as i espied   the old man in that naked wilderness   close by a pond upon the further side   he stood alone a minutes space i guess                 60   i watchd him he continuing motionless   to the pools further margin then i drew   he being all the while before me full in view    as a huge

sense   like a seabeast crawld forth which on a shelf   of rock or sand reposeth there to sun itself             70    such seemd this man not all alive nor dead   nor all asleep in his extreme old age   his body was bent double feet and head   coming together in their pilgrimage   as if some dire constraint of pain or rage   of sickness felt by him in times long past   a more than human weight upon his frame had cast    himself he proppd his body limbs and face   upon a long grey staff of shaven wood   and still as i drew near with gentle pace                80   beside the little pond or moorish flood   motionless as a cloud the old man stood   that heareth not the loud winds when they call   and moveth altogether if it move at all    at length himself unsettling he the pond   stirred with his staff and fixedly did look   upon the muddy water which he connd   as if he had been reading in a book   and now such freedom as i could i took   and drawing to his side to him did say                  90   this morning gives us promise of a glorious day    a gentle answer did the old man make   in courteous speech which forth he slowly drew   and him with further words i thus bespake   what kind of work is that which you pursue   this is a lonesome place for one like you   he answerd me with pleasure and surprize   and there was while he spake a fire about his eyes    his words came feebly from a feeble chest   yet each in solemn order followd each                   100   with something of a lofty utterance drest   choice word and measured phrase above the reach   of ordinary men a stately speech   such as grave livers do in scotland use   religious men who give to god and man their dues    he told me that he to this pond had come   to gather leeches being old and poor   employment hazardous and wearisome   and he had many hardships to endure   from pond to pond he roamd from moor to moor           110   housing with gods good help by choice or chance   and in this way he gaind an honest maintenance    the old man still stood talking by my side   but now his voice to me was like a stream   scarce heard nor word from word could i divide   and the whole body of the man did seem   like one whom i had met with in a dream   or like a man from some far region sent   to give me human strength and strong admonishment    my former thoughts returnd the fear that kills         120   the hope that is unwilling to be fed   cold pain and labour and all fleshly ills   and mighty poets in their misery dead   and now not knowing what the old man had said   my question eagerly did i renew   how is it that you live and what is it you do    he with a smile did then his words repeat   and said that gathering leeches far and wide   he travelled stirring thus about his feet   the waters of the ponds where they abide               130   once i could meet with them on every side   but they have dwindled long by slow decay   yet still i persevere and find them where i may    while he was talking thus the lonely place   the old mans shape and speech all troubled me   in my minds eye i seemd to see him pace   about the weary moors continually   wandering about alone and silently   while i these thoughts within myself pursued   he having made a pause the same discourse renewed      140    and soon with this he other matter blended   chearfully uttered with demeanour kind   but stately in the main and when he ended   i could have laughd myself to scorn to find   in that decrepit man so firm a mind   god said i be my help and stay secure   ill think

trees green arbours and ground flowers in flocks   and wild rose tiptoe upon hawthorn stocks   like to a bonny lass who plays her pranks   at wakes and fairs with wandering mountebanks   when she stands cresting the clowns head and mocks   the crowd beneath her verily i think   such place to me is sometimes like a dream   or map of the whole world thoughts link by link   enter through ears and eyesight with such gleam   of all things that at last in fear i shrink   and leap at once from the delicious stream     2                                         where lies the land to which yon ship must go   festively she puts forth in trim array   as vigorous as a lark at break of day   is she for tropic suns or polar snow   what boots the enquiry neither friend nor foe   she cares for let her travel where she may   she finds familiar names a beaten way   ever before her and a wind to blow   yet still i ask what haven is her mark   and almost as it was when ships were rare   from time to

the hamilton hills yorkshire     ere we had reachd the wishdfor place night fell   we were too late at least by one dark hour   and nothing could we see of all that power   of prospect whereof many thousands tell   the western sky did recompence us well   with grecian temple minaret and bower   and in one part a minster with its tower   substantially distinct a place for bell   or clock to toll from many a glorious pile   did we behold sights that might well repay   all disappointment and as such the eye   delighted in them but we felt the while   we should forget them they are of the sky   and from our earthly memory fade away     4       they are of the sky     and from our earthly memory fade away    these words were utterd in a pensive mood   even while mine eyes were on that solemn sight   a contrast and reproach to gross delight   and lifes unspiritual pleasures daily wood   but now upon this thought i cannot brood   it is unstable and deserts me quite   nor will i praise a cloud however bright   disparaging mans gifts and proper food   the grove the skybuilt temple and the dome   though clad in colours beautiful and pure   find in the heart of man no natural home   the

small birds melodies   must hear first utterd from my orchard trees   and the first cuckoos melancholy cry   even thus last night and two nights more i lay   and could not win thee sleep by any stealth   so do not let me wear to night away   without thee what is all the mornings wealth   come blessed barrier betwixt day and day   dear mother of fresh thoughts and joyous health     7 to sleep

miserable crowd   sick hale old young who cried before that cloud   thou art our king o death to thee we groan   i seemd to mount those steps the vapours gave   smooth way and i beheld the face of one

that earths best hopes rest all with thee     22  october 1803    when looking on the present face of things   i see one man of men the meanest too   raisd up to sway the world to do undo   with mighty nations for his underlings   the great events with which old story rings   seem vain and hollow i find nothing great   nothing is left which i can venerate   so that almost a doubt within me springs   of providence such emptiness at length   seems at the heart of all things but great god   i measure back the steps which i have trod   and tremble seeing as i do the strength   of such poor instruments with thoughts sublime   i tremble at the sorrow of the time     23 to the men of kent  october 1803    vanguard of liberty ye men of kent   ye children of a soil that doth advance   its
