89203715	mosses from an old manse                        by nathaniel hawthorne                            the old manse         the author makes the reader acquainted with his abode   between two tall gateposts of roughhewn stone the gate itself having fallen from its hinges at some unknown epoch we beheld the gray front of the old parsonage terminating the vista of an avenue of blackash trees  it was now a twelvemonth since the funeral procession of the venerable clergyman its last inhabitant had turned from that gateway towards the village buryingground  the wheeltrack leading to the door as well as the whole breadth of the avenue was almost overgrown with grass affording dainty mouthfuls to two or three vagrant cows and an old white horse who had his own living to pick up along the roadside the glimmering shadows that lay half asleep between the door of the house and the public highway were a kind of spiritual medium seen through which the edifice had not quite the aspect of belonging to the material world  certainly it had little in common with those ordinary abodes which stand so imminent upon the road that every passerby can thrust his head as it were into the domestic circle  from these quiet windows the figures of passing travellers looked too remote and dim to disturb the sense of privacy  in its near retirement and accessible seclusion it was the very spot for the residence of a clergymana man not estranged from human life yet enveloped in the midst of it with a veil woven of intermingled gloom and brightness  it was worthy to have been one of the timehonored parsonages of england in which through many generations a succession of holy occupants pass from youth to age and bequeath each an inheritance of sanctity to pervade the house and hover over it as with an atmosphere  nor in truth had the old manse ever been profaned by a lay occupant until that memorable summer afternoon when i entered it as my home  a priest had built it a priest had succeeded to it other priestly men from time to time had dwelt in it and children born in its chambers had grown up to assume the priestly character  it was awful to reflect how many sermons must have been written there  the latest inhabitant alonehe by whose translation to paradise the dwelling was left vacanthad penned nearly three thousand discourses besides the better if not the greater number that gushed living from his lips how often no doubt had he paced to and fro along the avenue attuning his meditations to the sighs and gentle murmurs and deep and solemn peals of the wind among the lofty tops of the trees  in that variety of natural utterances he could find something accordant with every passage of his sermon were it of tenderness or reverential fear  the boughs over my head seemed shadowy with solemn thoughts as well as with rustling leaves  i took shame to myself for having been so long a writer of idle stories and ventured to hope that wisdom would descend upon me with the falling leaves of the avenue and that i should light upon an intellectual treasure in the old manse well worth those hoards of longhidden gold which people seek for in mossgrown houses profound treatises of morality a laymans unprofessional and therefore unprejudiced views of religion histories such as bancroft might have written had he taken up his abode here as he once purposed bright with picture gleaming over a depth of philosophic thoughtthese were the works that might fitly have flowed from such a retirement  in the humblest event i resolved at least to achieve a novel that should evolve some deep lesson and should possess physical substance enough to stand alone  in furtherance of my design and as if to leave me no pretext for not fulfilling it there was in the rear of the house the most delightful little nook of a study that ever afforded its snug seclusion to a scholar  it was here that emerson wrote nature for he was then an inhabitant of the manse and used to watch the assyrian dawn and paphian sunset and moonrise from the summit of our eastern hill  when i first saw the room its walls were blackened with the smoke of unnumbered years and made still blacker by the grim prints of puritan ministers that hung around these worthies looked strangely like bad angels or at least like men who had wrestled so continually and so sternly with the devil that somewhat of his sooty fierceness had been imparted to their own visages  they had all vanished now a cheerful coat of paint and goldentinted paperhangings lighted up the small apartment while the shadow of a willowtree that swept against the overhanging eaves atempered the cheery western sunshine  in place of the grim prints there was the sweet and lovely head of one of raphaels madonnas and two pleasant little pictures of the lake of como  the only other decorations were a purple vase of flowers always fresh and a bronze one containing graceful ferns  my books few and by no means choice for they were chiefly such waifs as chance had thrown in my way stood in order about the room seldom to be disturbed  the study had three windows set with little oldfashioned panes of glass each with a crack across it  the two on the western side looked or rather peeped between the willow branches down into the orchard with glimpses of the river through the trees the third facing northward commanded a broader view of the river at a spot where its hitherto obscure waters gleam forth into the light of history  it was at this window that the clergyman who then dwelt in the manse stood watching the outbreak of a long and deadly struggle between two nations he saw the irregular array of his parishioners on the farther side of the river and the glittering line of the british on the hither bank he awaited in an agony of suspense the rattle of the musketry it came and there needed but a gentle wind to sweep the battlesmoke around this quiet house  perhaps the reader whom i cannot help considering as my guest in the old manse and entitled to all courtesy in the way of sightshowingperhaps he will choose to take a nearer view of the memorable spot we stand now on the rivers brink  it may well be called the concordthe river of peace and quietness for it is certainly the most unexcitable and sluggish stream that ever loitered imperceptibly towards its eternitythe sea positively i had lived three weeks beside it before it grew quite clear to my perception which way the current flowed  it never has a vivacious aspect except when a northwestern breeze is vexing its surface on a sunshiny day  from the incurable indolence of its nature the stream is happily incapable of becoming the slave of human ingenuity as is the fate of so many a wild free mountain torrent  while all things else are compelled to subserve some useful purpose it idles its sluggish life away in lazy liberty without turning a solitary spindle or affording even waterpower enough to grind the corn that grows upon its banks  the torpor of its movement allows it nowhere a bright pebbly shore nor so much as a narrow strip of glistening sand in any part of its course  it slumbers between broad prairies kissing the long meadow grass and bathes the overhanging boughs of elderbushes and willows or the roots of elms and ashtrees and clumps of maples  flags and rushes grow along its plashy shore the yellow waterlily spreads its broad flat leaves on the margin and the fragrant white pondlily abounds generally selecting a position just so far from the rivers brink that it cannot be grasped save at the hazard of plunging in  it is a marvel whence this perfect flower derives its loveliness and perfume springing as it does from the black mud over which the river sleeps and where lurk the slimy eel and speckled frog and the mudturtle whom continual washing cannot cleanse it is the very same black mud out of which the yellow lily sucks its obscene life and noisome odor  thus we see too in the world that some persons assimilate only what is ugly and evil from the same moral circumstances which supply good and beautiful resultsthe fragrance of celestial flowersto the daily life of others  the reader must not from any testimony of mine contract a dislike towards our slumberous stream  in the light of a calm and golden sunset it becomes lovely beyond expression the more lovely for the quietude that so well accords with the hour when even the wind after blustering all day long usually hushes itself to rest  each tree and rock and every blade of grass is distinctly imaged and however unsightly in reality assumes ideal beauty in the reflection  the minutest things of earth and the broad aspect of the firmament are pictured equally without effort and with the same felicity of success all the sky glows downward at our feet the rich clouds float through the unruffled bosom of the stream like heavenly thoughts through a peaceful heart  we will not then malign our river as gross and impure while it can glorify itself with so adequate a picture of the heaven that broods above it or if we remember its tawny hue and the muddiness of its bed let it be a symbol that the earthiest human soul has an infinite spiritual capacity and may contain the better world within its depths  but indeed the same lesson might be drawn out of any mudpuddle in the streets of a city and being taught us everywhere it must be true  come we have pursued a somewhat devious track in our walk to the battleground  here we are at the point where the river was crossed by the old bridge the possession of which was the immediate object of the contest  on the hither side grow two or three elms throwing a wide circumference of shade but which must have been planted at some period within the threescore years and ten that have passed since the battleday  on the farther shore overhung by a clump of elderbushes we discern the stone abutment of the bridge  looking down into the river i once discovered some heavy fragments of the timbers all green with half a centurys growth of watermoss for during that length of time the tramp of horses and human footsteps have ceased along this ancient highway  the stream has here about the breadth of twenty strokes of a swimmers arma space not too wide when the bullets were whistling across  old people who dwell hereabouts will point out the very spots on the western bank where our countrymen fell down and died and on this side of the river an obelisk of granite has grown up from the soil that was fertilized with british blood  the monument not more than twenty feet in height is such as it befitted the inhabitants of a village to erect in illustration of a matter of local interest rather than what was suitable to commemorate an epoch of national history still by the fathers of the village this famous deed was done and their descendants might rightfully claim the privilege of building a memorial  a humbler token of the fight yet a more interesting one than the granite obelisk may be seen close under the stone wall which separates the battleground from the precincts of the parsonage it is the gravemarked by a small mossgrown fragment of stone at the head and another at the footthe grave of two british soldiers who were slain in the skirmish and have ever since slept peacefully where zechariah brown and thomas davis buried them  soon was their warfare ended a weary nightmarch from boston a rattling volley of musketry across the river and then these many years of rest  in the long procession of slain invaders who passed into eternity from the battlefields of the revolution these two nameless soldiers led the way  lowell the poet as we were once standing over this grave told me a tradition in reference to one of the inhabitants below  the story has something deeply impressive though its circumstances cannot altogether be reconciled with probability  a youth in the service of the clergyman happened to be chopping wood that april morning at the back door of the manse and when the noise of battle rang from side to side of the bridge he hastened across the intervening field to see what might be going forward  it is rather strange by the way that this lad should have been so diligently at work when the whole population of town and country were startled out of their customary business by the advance of the british troops  be that as it might the tradition says that the lad now left his task and hurried to the battlefield with the axe still in his hand  the british had by this time retreated the americans were in pursuit and the late scene of strife was thus deserted by both parties  two soldiers lay on the groundone was a corpse but as the young newenglander drew nigh the other briton raised himself painfully upon his hands and knees and gave a ghastly stare into his face  the boyit must have been a nervous impulse without purpose without thought and betokening a sensitive and impressible nature rather than a hardened onethe boy uplifted his axe and dealt the wounded soldier a fierce and fatal blow upon the head  i could wish that the grave might be opened for i would fain know whether either of the skeleton soldiers has the mark of an axe in his skull  the story comes home to me like truth oftentimes as an intellectual and moral exercise i have sought to follow that poor youth through his subsequent career and observe how his soul was tortured by the bloodstain contracted as it had been before the long custom of war had robbed human life of its sanctity and while it still seemed murderous to slay a brother man  this one circumstance has borne more fruit for me than all that history tells us of the fight  many strangers come in the summertime to view the battleground for my own part i have never found my imagination much excited by this or any other scene of historic celebrity nor would the placid margin of the river have lost any of its charm for me had men never fought and died there  there is a wilder interest in the tract of landperhaps a hundred yards in breadthwhich extends between the battlefield and the northern face of our old manse with its contiguous avenue and orchard here in some unknown age before the white man came stood an indian village convenient to the river whence its inhabitants must have drawn so large a part of their substance  the site is identified by the spear and arrowheads the chisels and other implements of war labor and the chase which the plough turns up from the soil  you see a splinter of stone half hidden beneath a sod it looks like nothing worthy of note but if you have faith enough to pick it up behold a relic thoreau who has a strange faculty of finding what the indians have left behind them first set me on the search and i afterwards enriched myself with some very perfect specimens so rudely wrought that it seemed almost as if chance had fashioned them  their great charm consists in this rudeness and in the individuality of each article so different from the productions of civilized machinery which shapes everything on one pattern  there is exquisite delight too in picking up for ones self an arrowhead that was dropped centuries ago and has never been handled since and which we thus receive directly from the hand of the red hunter who purposed to shoot it at his game or at an enemy  such an incident builds up again the indian village and its encircling forest and recalls to life the painted chiefs and warriors the squaws at their household toil and the children sporting among the wigwams while the little windrocked pappose swings from the branch of a tree  it can hardly be told whether it is a joy or a pain after such a momentary vision to gaze around in the broad daylight of reality and see stone fences white houses potatofields and men doggedly hoeing in their shirtsleeves and homespun pantaloons  but this is nonsense the old manse is better than a thousand wigwams  the old manse  we had almost forgotten it but will return thither through the orchard  this was set out by the last clergyman in the decline of his life when the neighbors laughed at the hoaryheaded man for planting trees from which he could have no prospect of gathering fruit  even had that been the case there was only so much the better motive for planting them in the pure and unselfish hope of benefiting his successorsan end so seldom achieved by more ambitious efforts but the old minister before reaching his patriarchal age of ninety ate the apples from this orchard during many years and added silver and gold to his annual stipend by disposing of the superfluity  it is pleasant to think of him walking among the trees in the quiet afternoons of early autumn and picking up here and there a windfall while he observes how heavily the branches are weighed down and computes the number of empty flourbarrels that will be filled by their burden  he loved each tree doubtless as if it had been his own child  an orchard has a relation to mankind and readily connects itself with matters of the heart  the trees possess a domestic character they have lost the wild nature of their forest kindred and have grown humanized by receiving the care of man as well as by contributing to his wants there is so much individuality of character too among apple trees that it gives them all additional claim to be the objects of human interest  one is harsh and crabbed in its manifestations another gives us fruit as mild as charity  one is churlish and illiberal evidently grudging the few apples that it bears another exhausts itself in freehearted benevolence  the variety of grotesque shapes into which apple trees contort themselves has its effect on those who get acquainted with them they stretch out their crooked branches and take such hold of the imagination that we remember them as humorists and odd fellows and what is more melancholy than the old appletrees that linger about the spot where once stood a homestead but where there is now only a ruined chimney rising out of a grassy and weedgrown cellar  they offer their fruit to every wayfarerapples that are bitter sweet with the moral of times vicissitude  i have met with no other such pleasant trouble in the world as that of finding myself with only the two or three mouths which it was my privilege to feed the sole inheritor of the old clergymans wealth of fruits  throughout the summer there were cherries and currants and then came autumn with his immense burden of apples dropping them continually from his overladen shoulders as he trudged along  in the stillest afternoon if i listened the thump of a great apple was audible falling without a breath of wind from the mere necessity of perfect ripeness and besides there were peartrees that flung down bushels upon bushels of heavy pears and peachtrees which in a good year tormented me with peaches neither to be eaten nor kept nor without labor and perplexity to be given away  the idea of an infinite generosity and exhaustless bounty on the part of our mother nature was well worth obtaining through such cares as these  that feeling can be enjoyed in perfection only by the natives of summer islands where the breadfruit the cocoa the palm and the orange grow spontaneously and hold forth the everready meal but likewise almost as well by a man long habituated to city life who plunges into such a solitude as that of the old manse where he plucks the fruit of trees that he did not plant and which therefore to my heterodox taste bear the closest resemblance to those that grew in eden  it has been an apothegm these five thousand years that toil sweetens the bread it earns for my part speaking from hard experience acquired while belaboring the rugged furrows of brook farm i relish best the free gifts of providence  not that it can be disputed that the light toil requisite to cultivate a moderately sized garden imparts such zest to kitchen vegetables as is never found in those of the marketgardener childless men if they would know something of the bliss of paternity should plant a seedbe it squash bean indian corn or perhaps a mere flower or worthless weedshould plant it with their own hands and nurse it from infancy to maturity altogether by their own care  if there be not too many of them each individual plant becomes an object of separate interest my garden that skirted the avenue of the manse was of precisely the right extent  an hour or two of morning labor was all that it required  but i used to visit and revisit it a dozen times a day and stand in deep contemplation over my vegetable progeny with a love that nobody could share or conceive of who had never taken part in the process of creation  it was one of the most bewitching sights in the world to observe a hill of beans thrusting aside the soil or a row of early peas just peeping forth sufficiently to trace a line of delicate green later in the season the hummingbirds were attracted by the blossoms of a peculiar variety of bean and they were a joy to me those little spiritual visitants for deigning to sip airy food out of my nectarcups  multitudes of bees used to bury themselves in the yellow blossoms of the summersquashes  this too was a deep satisfaction although when they had laden themselves with sweets they flew away to some unknown hive which would give back nothing in requital of what my garden had contributed  but i was glad thus to fling a benefaction upon the passing breeze with the certainty that somebody must profit by it and that there would be a little more honey in the world to allay the sourness and bitterness which mankind is always complaining of  yes indeed my life was the sweeter for that honey  speaking of summersquashes i must say a word of their beautiful and varied forms  they presented an endless diversity of urns and vases shallow or deep scalloped or plain moulded in patterns which a sculptor would do well to copy since art has never invented anything more graceful  a hundred squashes in the garden were worth in my eyes at least of being rendered indestructible in marble  if ever providence but i know it never will should assign me a superfluity of gold part of it shall be expended for a service of plate or most delicate porcelain to be wrought into the shapes of summersquashes gathered from vines which i will plant with my own hands  as dishes for containing vegetables they would be peculiarly appropriate  but not merely the squeamish love of the beautiful was gratified by my toil in the kitchengarden  there was a hearty enjoyment likewise in observing the growth of the crooknecked wintersquashes from the first little bulb with the withered blossom adhering to it until they lay strewn upon the soil big round fellows hiding their heads beneath the leaves but turning up their great yellow rotundities to the noontide sun  gazing at them i felt that by my agency something worth living for had been done  a new substance was born into the world  they were real and tangible existences which the mind could seize hold of and rejoice in  a cabbage tooespecially the early dutch cabbage which swells to a monstrous circumference until its ambitious heart often bursts asunderis a matter to be proud of when we can claim a share with the earth and sky in producing it but after all the hugest pleasure is reserved until these vegetable children of ours are smoking on the table and we like saturn make a meal of them  what with the river the battlefield the orchard and the garden the reader begins to despair of finding his way back into the old manse but in agreeable weather it is the truest hospitality to keep him out of doors  i never grew quite acquainted with my habitation till a long spell of sulky rain had confined me beneath its roof there could not be a more sombre aspect of external nature than as then seen from the windows of my study  the great willowtree had caught and retained among its leaves a whole cataract of water to be shaken down at intervals by the frequent gusts of wind  all day long and for a week together the rain was dripdripdripping and splashsplashsplashing from the eaves and bubbling and foaming into the tubs beneath the spouts  the old unpainted shingles of the house and outbuildings were black with moisture and the mosses of ancient growth upon the walls looked green and fresh as if they were the newest things and afterthought of time  the usually mirrored surface of the river was blurred by an infinity of raindrops the whole landscape had a completely watersoaked appearance conveying the impression that the earth was wet through like a sponge while the summit of a wooded hill about a mile distant was enveloped in a dense mist where the demon of the tempest seemed to have his abidingplace and to be plotting still direr inclemencies  nature has no kindness no hospitality during a rain  in the fiercest beat of sunny days she retains a secret mercy and welcomes the wayfarer to shady nooks of the woods whither the sun cannot penetrate but she provides no shelter against her storms it makes us shiver to think of those deep umbrageous recesses those overshadowing banks where we found such enjoyment during the sultry afternoons  not a twig of foliage there but would dash a little shower into our faces  looking reproachfully towards the impenetrable skyif sky there be above that dismal uniformity of cloudwe are apt to murmur against the whole system of the universe since it involves the extinction of so many summer days in so short a life by the hissing and spluttering rain  in such spells of weatherand it is to be supposed such weather cameeves bower in paradise must have been but a cheerless and aguish kind of shelter nowise comparable to the old parsonage which had resources of its own to beguile the weeks imprisonment  the idea of sleeping on a couch of wet roses  happy the man who in a rainy day can betake himself to a huge garret stored like that of the manse with lumber that each generation has left behind it from a period before the revolution  our garret was an arched hall dimly illuminated through small and dusty windows it was but a twilight at the best and there were nooks or rather caverns of deep obscurity the secrets of which i never learned being too reverent of their dust and cobwebs  the beams and rafters roughly hewn and with strips of bark still on them and the rude masonry of the chimneys made the garret look wild and uncivilized an aspect unlike what was seen elsewhere in the quiet and decorous old house but on one side there was a little whitewashed apartment which bore the traditionary title of the saints chamber because holy men in their youth had slept and studied and prayed there with its elevated retirement its one window its small fireplace and its closet convenient for an oratory it was the very spot where a young man might inspire himself with solemn enthusiasm and cherish saintly dreams  the occupants at various epochs had left brief records and ejaculations inscribed upon the walls  there too hung a tattered and shrivelled roll of canvas which on inspection proved to be the forcibly wrought picture of a clergyman in wig band and gown holding a bible in his hand  as i turned his face towards the light he eyed me with an air of authority such as men of his profession seldom assume in our days  the original had been pastor of the parish more than a century ago a friend of whitefield and almost his equal in fervid eloquence  i bowed before the effigy of the dignified divine and felt as if i had now met face to face with the ghost by whom as there was reason to apprehend the manse was haunted  houses of any antiquity in new england are so invariably possessed with spirits that the matter seems hardly worth alluding to  our ghost used to heave deep sighs in a particular corner of the parlor and sometimes rustled paper as if he were turning over a sermon in the long upper entrywhere nevertheless he was invisible in spite of the bright moonshine that fell through the eastern window  not improbably he wished me to edit and publish a selection from a chest full of manuscript discourses that stood in the garret  once while hillard and other friends sat talking with us in the twilight there came a rustling noise as of a ministers silk gown sweeping through the very midst of the company so closely as almost to brush against the chairs  still there was nothing visible  a yet stranger business was that of a ghostly servantmaid who used to be heard in the kitchen at deepest midnight grinding coffee cooking ironingperforming in short all kinds of domestic laboralthough no traces of anything accomplished could be detected the next morning some neglected duty of her servitude some illstarched ministerial band disturbed the poor damsel in her grave and kept her at work without any wages  but to return from this digression  a part of my predecessors library was stored in the garretno unfit receptacle indeed for such dreary trash as comprised the greater number of volumes the old books would have been worth nothing at an auction  in this venerable garret however they possessed an interest quite apart from their literary value as heirlooms many of which had been transmitted down through a series of consecrated hands from the days of the mighty puritan divines autographs of famous names were to be seen in faded ink on some of their flyleaves and there were marginal observations or interpolated pages closely covered with manuscript in illegible shorthand perhaps concealing matter of profound truth and wisdom the world will never be the better for it  a few of the books were latin folios written by catholic authors others demolished papistry as with a sledgehammer in plain english  a dissertation on the book of jobwhich only job himself could have had patience to readfilled at least a score of small thickset quartos at the rate of two or three volumes to a chapter  then there was a vast folio body of divinitytoo corpulent a body it might be feared to comprehend the spiritual element of religion  volumes of this form dated back two hundred years or more and were generally bound in black leather exhibiting precisely such an appearance as we should attribute to books of enchantment  others equally antique were of a size proper to be carried in the large waistcoat pockets of old timesdiminutive but as black as their bulkier brethren and abundantly interfused with greek and latin quotations  these little old volumes impressed me as if they had been intended for very large ones but had been unfortunately blighted at an early stage of their growth  the rain pattered upon the roof and the sky gloomed through the dusty garretwindows while i burrowed among these venerable books in search of any living thought which should burn like a coal of fire or glow like an inextinguishable gem beneath the dead trumpery that had long hidden it but i found no such treasure all was dead alike and i could not but muse deeply and wonderingly upon the humiliating fact that the works of mans intellect decay like those of his hands thought grows mouldy what was good and nourishing food for the spirits of one generation affords no sustenance for the next  books of religion however cannot be considered a fair test of the enduring and vivacious properties of human thought because such books so seldom really touch upon their ostensible subject and have therefore so little business to be written at all  so long as an unlettered soul can attain to saving grace there would seem to be no deadly error in holding theological libraries to be accumulations of for the most part stupendous impertinence  many of the books had accrued in the latter years of the last clergymans lifetime  these threatened to be of even less interest than the elder works a century hence to any curious inquirer who should then rummage then as i was doing now volumes of the liberal preacher and christian examiner occasional sermons controversial pamphlets tracts and other productions of a like fugitive nature took the place of the thick and heavy volumes of past time  in a physical point of view there was much the same difference as between a feather and a lump of lead but intellectually regarded the specific gravity of old and new was about upon a par  both also were alike frigid  the elder books nevertheless seemed to have been earnestly written and might be conceived to have possessed warmth at some former period although with the lapse of time the heated masses had cooled down even to the freezingpoint the frigidity of the modern productions on the other hand was characteristic and inherent and evidently had little to do with the writers qualities of mind and heart  in fine of this whole dusty heap of literature i tossed aside all the sacred part and felt myself none the less a christian for eschewing it  there appeared no hope of either mounting to the better world on a gothic staircase of ancient folios or of flying thither on the wings of a modern tract  nothing strange to say retained any sap except what had been written for the passing day and year without the remotest pretension or idea of permanence  there were a few old newspapers and still older almanacs which reproduced to my mental eye the epochs when they had issued from the press with a distinctness that was altogether unaccountable  it was as if i had found bits of magic lookingglass among the books with the images of a vanished century in them  i turned my eyes towards the tattered picture above mentioned and asked of the austere divine wherefore it was that he and his brethren after the most painful rummaging and groping into their minds had been able to produce nothing half so real as these newspaper scribblers and almanacmakers had thrown off in the effervescence of a moment the portrait responded not so i sought an answer for myself  it is the age itself that writes newspapers and almanacs which therefore have a distinct purpose and meaning at the time and a kind of intelligible truth for all times whereas most other worksbeing written by men who in the very act set themselves apart from their ageare likely to possess little significance when new and none at all when old genius indeed melts many ages into one and thus effects something permanent yet still with a similarity of office to that of the more ephemeral writer a work of genius is but the newspaper of a century or perchance of a hundred centuries  lightly as i have spoken of these old books there yet lingers with me a superstitious reverence for literature of all kinds  a bound volume has a charm in my eyes similar to what scraps of manuscript possess for the good mussulman  he imagines that those windwafted records are perhaps hallowed by some sacred verse and i that every new book or antique one may contain the open sesamethe spell to disclose treasures hidden in some unsuspected cave of truth  thus it was not without sadness that i turned away from the library of the old manse  blessed was the sunshine when it came again at the close of another stormy day beaming from the edge of the western horizon while the massive firmament of clouds threw down all the gloom it could but served only to kindle the golden light into a more brilliant glow by the strongly contrasted shadows  heaven smiled at the earth so long unseen from beneath its heavy eyelid  tomorrow for the hilltops and the woodpaths  or it might be that ellery charming came up the avenue to join me in a fishing excursion on the river  strange and happy times were those when we cast aside all irksome forms and straitlaced habitudes and delivered ourselves up to the free air to live like the indians or any less conventional race during one bright semicircle of the sun rowing our boat against the current between wide meadows we turned aside into the assabeth  a more lovely stream than this for a mile above its junction with the concord has never flowed on earth nowhere indeed except to lave the interior regions of a poets imagination  it is sheltered from the breeze by woods and a hillside so that elsewhere there might be a hurricane and here scarcely a ripple across the shaded water  the current lingers along so gently that the mere force of the boatmans will seems sufficient to propel his craft against it  it comes flowing softly through the midmost privacy and deepest heart of a wood which whispers it to be quiet while the stream whispers back again from its sedgy borders as if river and wood were hushing one another to sleep yes the river sleeps along its course and dreams of the sky and of the clustering foliage amid which fall showers of broken sunlight imparting specks of vivid cheerfulness in contrast with the quiet depth of the prevailing tint  of all this scene the slumbering river has a dreampicture in its bosom  which after all was the most realthe picture or the originalthe objects palpable to our grosser senses or their apotheosis in the stream beneath  surely the disembodied images stand in closer relation to the soul  but both the original and the reflection had here an ideal charm and had it been a thought more wild i could have fancied that this river had strayed forth out of the rich scenery of my companions inner world only the vegetation along its banks should then have had an oriental character  gentle and unobtrusive as the river is yet the tranquil woods seem hardly satisfied to allow it passage  the trees are rooted on the very verge of the water and dip their pendent branches into it  at one spot there is a lofty bank on the slope of which grow some hemlocks declining across the stream with outstretched arms as if resolute to take the plunge  in other places the banks are almost on a level with the water so that the quiet congregation of trees set their feet in the flood and are fringed with foliage down to the surface  cardinalflowers kindle their spiral flames and illuminate the dark nooks among the shrubbery  the pondlily grows abundantly along the marginthat delicious flower which as thoreau tells me opens its virgin bosom to the first sunlight and perfects its being through the magic of that genial kiss  he has beheld beds of them unfolding in due succession as the sunrise stole gradually from flower to flowera sight not to be hoped for unless when a poet adjusts his inward eye to a proper focus with the outward organ grapevines here and there twine themselves around shrub and tree and hang their clusters over the water within reach of the boatmans hand oftentimes they unite two trees of alien race in an inextricable twine marrying the hemlock and the maple against their will and enriching them with a purple offspring of which neither is the parent one of these ambitious parasites has climbed into the upper branches of a tall whitepine and is still ascending from bough to bough unsatisfied till it shall crown the trees airy summit with a wreath of its broad foliage and a cluster of its grapes  the winding course of the stream continually shut out the scene behind us and revealed as calm and lovely a one before  we glided from depth to depth and breathed new seclusion at every turn  the shy kingfisher flew from the withered branch close at hand to another at a distance uttering a shrill cry of anger or alarm  ducks that had been floating there since the preceding eve were startled at our approach and skimmed along the glassy river breaking its dark surface with a bright streak the pickerel leaped from among the lilypads the turtle sunning itself upon a rock or at the root of a tree slid suddenly into the water with a plunge  the painted indian who paddled his canoe along the assabeth three hundred years ago could hardly have seen a wilder gentleness displayed upon its banks and reflected in its bosom than we did  nor could the same indian have prepared his noontide meal with more simplicity  we drew up our skiff at some point where the overarching shade formed a natural bower and there kindled a fire with the pine cones and decayed branches that lay strewn plentifully around  soon the smoke ascended among the trees impregnated with a savory incense not heavy dull and surfeiting like the steam of cookery within doors but sprightly and piquant the smell of our feast was akin to the woodland odors with which it mingled there was no sacrilege committed by our intrusion there the sacred solitude was hospitable and granted us free leave to cook and eat in the recess that was at once our kitchen and banquetinghall it is strange what humble offices may be performed in a beautiful scene without destroying its poetry our fire red gleaming among the trees and we beside it busied with culinary rites and spreading out our meal on a mossgrown log all seemed in unison with the river gliding by and the foliage rustling over us  and what was strangest neither did our mirth seem to disturb the propriety of the solemn woods although the hobgoblins of the old wilderness and the willofthewisps that glimmered in the marshy places might have come trooping to share our tabletalk and have added their shrill laughter to our merriment  it was the very spot in which to utter the extremest nonsense or the profoundest wisdom or that ethereal product of the mind which partakes of both and may become one or the other in correspondence with the faith and insight of the auditor  so amid sunshine and shadow rustling leaves and sighing waters up gushed our talk like the babble of a fountain  the evanescent spray was ellerys and his too the lumps of golden thought that lay glimmering in the fountains bed and brightened both our faces by the reflection could he have drawn out that virgin gold and stamped it with the mintmark that alone gives currency the world might have had the profit and he the fame my mind was the richer merely by the knowledge that it was there but the chief profit of those wild days to him and me lay not in any definite idea not in any angular or rounded truth which we dug out of the shapeless mass of problematical stuff but in the freedom which we thereby won from all custom and conventionalism and fettering influences of man on man  we were so free today that it was impossible to be slaves again tomorrow  when we crossed the threshold of the house or trod the thronged pavements of a city still the leaves of the trees that overhang the assabeth were whispering to us be free be free therefore along that shady riverbank there are spots marked with a heap of ashes and halfconsumed brands only less sacred in my remembrance than the hearth of a household fire  and yet how sweet as we floated homeward adown the golden river at sunsethow sweet was it to return within the system of human society not as to a dungeon and a chain but as to a stately edifice whence we could go forth at will into stateher simplicity  how gently too did the sight of the old manse best seen from the river overshadowed with its willow and all environed about with the foliage of its orchard and avenuehow gently did its gray homely aspect rebuke the speculative extravagances of the day  it had grown sacred in connection with the artificial life against which we inveighed it had been a home for many years in spite of all it was my home too and with these thoughts it seemed to me that all the artifice and conventionalism of life was but an impalpable thinness upon its surface and that the depth below was none the worse for it once as we turned our boat to the bank there was a cloud in the shape of an immensely gigantic figure of a hound couched above the house as if keeping guard over it  gazing at this symbol i prayed that the upper influences might long protect the institutions that had grown out of the heart of mankind  if ever my readers should decide to give up civilized life cities houses and whatever moral or material enormities in addition to these the perverted ingenuity of our race has contrived let it be in the early autumn  then nature will love him better than at any other season and will take him to her bosom with a more motherly tenderness i could scarcely endure the roof of the old house above me in those first autumnal days how early in the summer too the prophecy of autumn comes earlier in some years than in others sometimes even in the first weeks of july  there is no other feeling like what is caused by this faint doubtful yet real perceptionif it be not rather a forebodingof the years decay so blessedly sweet and sad in the same breath  did i say that there was no feeling like it  ah but there is a halfacknowledged melancholy like to this when we stand in the perfected vigor of our life and feel that time has now given us all his flowers and that the next work of his neveridle fingers must be to steal them one by one away  i have forgotten whether the song of the cricket be not as early a token of autumns approach as any otherthat song which may be called an audible stillness for though very loud and heard afar yet the mind does not take note of it as a sound so completely is its individual existence merged among the accompanying characteristics of the season alas for the pleasant summertime  in august the grass is still verdant on the hills and in the valleys the foliage of the trees is as dense as ever and as green the flowers gleam forth in richer abundance along the margin of the river and by the stone walls and deep among the woods the days too are as fervid now as they were a month ago and yet in every breath of wind and in every beam of sunshine we hear the whispered farewell and behold the parting smile of a dear friend  there is a coolness amid all the heat a mildness in the blazing noon  not a breeze can stir but it thrills us with the breath of autumn  a pensive glory is seen in the far golden gleams among the shadows of the trees the flowerseven the brightest of them and they are the most gorgeous of the yearhave this gentle sadness wedded to their pomp and typify the character of the delicious time each within itself  the brilliant cardinalflower has never seemed gay to me  still later in the season natures tenderness waxes stronger  it is impossible not to be fond of our mother now for she is so fond of us at other periods she does not make this impression on me or only at rare intervals but in those genial days of autumn when she has perfected her harvests and accomplished every needful thing that was given her to do then she overflows with a blessed superfluity of love she has leisure to caress her children now  it is good to be alive and at such times thank heaven for breathyes for mere breathwhen it is made up of a heavenly breeze like this  it comes with a real kiss upon our cheeks it would linger fondly around us if it might but since it must be gone it embraces us with its whole kindly heart and passes onward to embrace likewise the next thing that it meets  a blessing is flung abroad and scattered far and wide over the earth to be gathered up by all who choose  i recline upon the still unwithered grass and whisper to myself o perfect day  o beautiful world  o beneficent god  and it is the promise of a blessed eternity for our creator would never have made such lovely days and have given us the deep hearts to enjoy them above and beyond all thought unless we were meant to be immortal  this sunshine is the golden pledge thereof  it beams through the gates of paradise and shows us glimpses far inward  by and by in a little time the outward world puts on a drear austerity  on some october morning there is a heavy hoarfrost on the grass and along the tops of the fences and at sunrise the leaves fall from the trees of our avenue without a breath of wind quietly descending by their own weight  all summer long they have murmured like the noise of waters they have roared loudly while the branches were wrestling with the thundergust they have made music both glad and solemn they have attuned my thoughts by their quiet sound as i paced to and fro beneath the arch of intermingling boughs  now they can only rustle under my feet  henceforth the gray parsonage begins to assume a larger importance and draws to its firesidefor the abomination of the airtight stove is reserved till wintry weatherdraws closer and closer to its fireside the vagrant impulses that had gone wandering about through the summer  when summer was dead and buried the old manse became as lonely as a hermitage  not that everin my time at leastit had been thronged with company but at no rare intervals we welcomed some friend out of the dusty glare and tumult of the world and rejoiced to share with him the transparent obscurity that was floating over us  in one respect our precincts were like the enchanted ground through which the pilgrim travelled on his way to the celestial city  the guests each and all felt a slumberous influence upon them they fell asleep in chairs or took a more deliberate siesta on the sofa or were seen stretched among the shadows of the orchard looking up dreamily through the boughs they could not have paid a more acceptable compliment to my abode nor to my own qualities as a host  i held it as a proof that they left their cares behind them as they passed between the stone gateposts at the entrance of our avenue and that the so powerful opiate was the abundance of peace and quiet within and all around us  others could give them pleasure and amusement or instructionthese could be picked up anywhere but it was for me to give them restrest in a life of trouble  what better could be done for those weary and worldworn spiritsfor him whose career of perpetual action was impeded and harassed by the rarest of his powers and the richest of his acquirementsfor another who had thrown his ardent heart from earliest youth into the strife of politics and now perchance began to suspect that one lifetime is too brief for the accomplishment of any lofty aimfor her oil whose feminine nature had been imposed the heavy gift of intellectual power such as a strong man might have staggered under and with it the necessity to act upon the worldin a word not to multiply instances what better could be done for anybody who came within our magic circle than to throw the spell of a tranquil spirit over him  and when it had wrought its full effect then we dismissed him with but misty reminiscences as if he had been dreaming of us  were i to adopt a pet idea as so many people do and fondle it in my embraces to the exclusion of all others it would be that the great want which mankind labors under at this present period is sleep  the world should recline its vast head on the first convenient pillow and take an agelong nap  it has gone distracted through a morbid activity and while preternaturally wide awake is nevertheless tormented by visions that seem real to it now but would assume their true aspect and character were all things once set right by an interval of sound repose this is the only method of getting rid of old delusions and avoiding new ones of regenerating our race so that it might in due time awake as an infant out of dewy slumber of restoring to us the simple perception of what is right and the singlehearted desire to achieve it both of which have long been lost in consequence of this weary activity of brain and torpor or passion of the heart that now afflict the universe stimulants the only mode of treatment hitherto attempted cannot quell the disease they do but heighten the delirium  let not the above paragraph ever be quoted against the author for though tinctured with its modicum of truth it is the result and expression of what he knew while he was writing to be but a distorted survey of the state and prospects of mankind  there were circumstances around me which made it difficult to view the world precisely as it exists for severe and sober as was the old manse it was necessary to go but a little way beyond its threshold before meeting with stranger moral shapes of men than might have been encountered elsewhere in a circuit of a thousand miles  these hobgoblins of flesh and blood were attracted thither by the widespreading influence of a great original thinker who had his earthly abode at the opposite extremity of our village  his mind acted upon other minds of a certain constitution with wonderful magnetism and drew many men upon long pilgrimages to speak with him face to face  young visionariesto whom just so much of insight had been imparted as to make life all a labyrinth around themcame to seek the clew that should guide them out of their selfinvolved bewilderment  grayheaded theoristswhose systems at first air had finally imprisoned them in an iron frameworktravelled painfully to his door not to ask deliverance but to invite the free spirit into their own thraldom people that had lighted on a new thought or a thought that they fancied new came to emerson as the finder of a glittering gem hastens to a lapidary to ascertain its quality and value  uncertain troubled earnest wanderers through the midnight of the moral world beheld his intellectual fire as a beacon burning on a hilltop and climbing the difficult ascent looked forth into the surrounding obscurity more hopefully than hitherto  the light revealed objects unseen beforemountains gleaming lakes glimpses of a creation among the chaos but also as was unavoidable it attracted bats and owls and the whole host of night birds which flapped their dusky wings against the gazers eyes and sometimes were mistaken for fowls of angelic feather  such delusions always hover nigh whenever a beaconfire of truth is kindled  for myself there bad been epochs of my life when i too might have asked of this prophet the master word that should solve me the riddle of the universe but now being happy i felt as if there were no question to be put and therefore admired emerson as a poet of deep beauty and austere tenderness but sought nothing from him as a philosopher  it was good nevertheless to meet him in the woodpaths or sometimes in our avenue with that pure intellectual gleam diffused about his presence like the garment of a shining one and be so quiet so simple so without pretension encountering each man alive as if expecting to receive more than he could impart  and in truth the heart of many an ordinary man had perchance inscriptions which he could not read  but it was impossible to dwell in his vicinity without inhaling more or less the mountain atmosphere of his lofty thought which in the brains of some people wrought a singular giddinessnew truth being as heady as new wine  never was a poor little country village infested with such a variety of queer strangely dressed oddly behaved mortals most of whom took upon themselves to be important agents of the worlds destiny yet were simply bores of a very intense water  such i imagine is the invariable character of persons who crowd so closely about an original thinker as to draw in his unuttered breath and thus become imbued with a false originality  this triteness of novelty is enough to make any man of commonsense blaspheme at all ideas of less than a centurys standing and pray that the world may be petrified and rendered immovable in precisely the worst moral and physical state that it ever yet arrived at rather than be benefited by such schemes of such philosophers  and now i begin to feeland perhaps should have sooner feltthat we have talked enough of the old manse  mine honored reader it may be will vilify the poor author as an egotist for babbling through so many pages about a mossgrown country parsonage and his life within its walls and on the river and in the woods and the influences that wrought upon him from all these sources  my conscience however does not reproach me with betraying anything too sacredly individual to be revealed by a human spirit to its brother or sister spirit  how narrowhow shallow and scanty toois the stream of thought that has been flowing from my pen compared with the broad tide of dim emotions ideas and associations which swell around me from that portion of my existence  how little have i told  and of that little how almost nothing is even tinctured with any quality that makes it exclusively my own  has the reader gone wandering hand in hand with me through the inner passages of my being and have we groped together into all its chambers and examined their treasures or their rubbish  not so  we have been standing on the greensward but just within the caverns mouth where the common sunshine is free to penetrate and where every footstep is therefore free to come  i have appealed to no sentiment or sensibilities save such as are diffused among us all  so far as i am a man of really individual attributes i veil my face nor am i nor have i ever been one of those supremely hospitable people who serve up their own hearts delicately fried with brain sauce as a tidbit for their beloved public  glancing back over what i have written it seems but the scattered reminiscences of a single summer  in fairyland there is no measurement of time and in a spot so sheltered from the turmoil of lifes ocean three years hastened away with a noiseless flight as the breezy sunshine chases the cloudshadows across the depths of a still valley now came hints growing more and more distinct that the owner of the old house was pining for his native air  carpenters next appeared making a tremendous racket among the outbuildings strewing the green grass with pine shavings and chips of chestnut joists and vexing the whole antiquity of the place with their discordant renovations  soon moreover they divested our abode of the veil of woodbine which had crept over a large portion of its southern face  all the aged mosses were cleared unsparingly away and there were horrible whispers about brushing up the external walls with a coat of painta purpose as little to my taste as might be that of rouging the venerable cheeks of ones grandmother but the hand that renovates is always more sacrilegious than that which destroys  in fine we gathered up our household goods drank a farewell cup of tea in our pleasant little breakfastroomdelicately fragrant tea an unpurchasable luxury one of the many angel gifts that had fallen like dew upon usand passed forth between the tall stone gateposts as uncertain as the wandering arabs where our tent might next be pitched providence took me by the hand andan oddity of dispensation which i trust there is no irreverence in smiling athas led me as the newspapers announce while i am writing from the old manse into a customhouse  as a storyteller i have often contrived strange vicissitudes for my imaginary personages but none like this  the treasure of intellectual gold which i hoped to find in our secluded dwelling had never come to light  no profound treatise of ethics no philosophic history no novel even that could stand unsupported on its edges  all that i had to show as a man of letters were these few tales and essays which had blossomed out like flowers in the calm summer of my heart and mind  save editing an easy task the journal of my friend of many years the african cruiser i had done nothing else with these idle weeds and withering blossoms i have intermixed some that were produced long agoold faded things reminding me of flowers pressed between the leaves of a bookand now offer the bouquet such as it is to any whom it may please  these fitful sketches with so little of external life about them yet claiming no profundity of purposeso reserved even while they sometimes seem so frankoften but half in earnest and never even when most so expressing satisfactorily the thoughts which they profess to imagesuch trifles i truly feel afford no solid basis for a literary reputation nevertheless the publicif my limited number of readers whom i venture to regard rather as a circle of friends may be termed a publicwill receive them the more kindly as the last offering the last collection of this nature which it is my purpose ever to put forth unless i could do better i have done enough in this kind  for myself the book will always retain one charmas reminding me of the river with its delightful solitudes and of the avenue the garden and the orchard and especially the dear old manse with the little study on its western side and the sunshine glimmering through the willow branches while i wrote  let the reader if he will do me so much honor imagine himself my guest and that having seen whatever may be worthy of notice within and about the old manse he has finally been ushered into my study there after seating him in an antique elbowchair an heirloom of the house i take forth a roll of manuscript and entreat his attention to the following talesan act of personal inhospitality however which i never was guilty of nor ever will be even to my worst enemy
