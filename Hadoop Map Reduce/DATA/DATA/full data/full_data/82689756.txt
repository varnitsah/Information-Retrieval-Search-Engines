clattering closepacked with its load of somewhat frowsy humanity through the last of the pine forest which rolls westward north of the great lakes toward the wide bare levels of manitoba when alison leigh stood on the platform of a lurching car a bitter wind eddied about her for it was early in the canadian spring and there were still shattered fangs of ice in the slacker pools of the rivers now and then a shower of cinders that rattled upon the roof whirled down about her and the jolting brass rail to which she clung was unpleasantly greasy but the air was at least gloriously fresh out there and she shrank from the vitiated atmosphere of the stoveheated car she had learned during the past few years that it is not wise for a young woman who must earn her living to be fastidious but one has to face a good many unpleasantnesses when traveling colonist in a crowded train  a gray sky without a break in it hung low above the ragged spires of the pines the river the track skirted and presently crossed upon a wooden bridge shone in the gathering shadow with a wan chill gleam and the bare rocky ridges that flitted by now and then looked grim and forbidding indeed it was a singularly desolate landscape with no touch of human life in it and alison shivered as she gazed at it with a somewhat heavy heart and weary eyes her head ached from want of sleep and several days of continuous jolting she was physically worn out and her courage was slipping away from her she knew that she would need the latter for she was beginning to realize that it was a rather hazardous undertaking for a delicately brought up girl of twentyfour to set out to seek her fortune in western canada  leaning upon the greasy rails she recalled the events which had led her to decide on this course or to be more accurate which had forced it on her until three years ago she had led a sheltered life and then her father dying suddenly had left his affairs involved this she knew now had been the fault of her aspiring mother who had spent his by no means large income in an attempt to win a prominent position in secondrate smart society and had succeeded to the extent of marrying her other daughter well the latter however had displayed very little eagerness to offer financial assistance in the crisis which had followed her fathers death  in the end mrs leigh was found a scantily paid appointment as secretary of a womans club while alison was left to shift for herself and it came as a shock to the girl to discover that her few capabilities were apparently of no practical use to anybody she could paint and could play the violin indifferently well but she had not the gift of imparting to others even the little she knew a graceful manner and a nicely modulated voice appeared to possess no market value and the unpalatable truth that nothing she had been taught was likely to prove more than a drawback in the struggle for existence was promptly forced on her  she faced it with a certain courage however for her defects were the results of her upbringing and not inherent in her nature and she forthwith sought a remedy in spite of her mothers protests her sisters husband was induced to send her for a few months training to a business school and when she left the latter there followed a threeyears experience which was in some respects as painful as it was varied  her handwriting did not please the crabbed scientist who first engaged her as amanuensis her second employer favored her with personal compliments which were worse to bear than his predecessors sarcastic censure and she had afterward drifted from occupation to occupation sinking on each occasion a little lower in the social scale in the meanwhile her prosperous sisters manner became steadily chillier her few influential friends appeared desirous of forgetting her and at last she formed the desperate resolution of going out to canada nobody however objected to this and her brotherinlaw who was engaged in commerce sent her a very small check with significant readiness and by some means secured her a position as typist and stenographer in the service of a business firm in winnipeg  for the last three days she had lived on canned fruit and crackers in the train not because she liked that diet but because the charges at the diningstations were beyond her means she had now five dollars and a few cents in her little shabby purse that however did not much trouble her for she would reach winnipeg on the morrow and she supposed that she would begin her new duties immediately she was wondering with some misgivings what her employers would be like when a girl of about her own age appeared in the doorway of the vestibule  arent you coming in its getting late and im almost asleep she said  alison turned and with inward repugnance followed her into the long car it was brilliantly lighted by big oil lamps and it was undoubtedly warm for there was a stove in the vestibule but the frowsy odors that greeted her were almost overwhelming after the fresh night air an aisle ran down the middle of the car and already men and women and peevish children were retiring to rest there was very little attempt at privacy and a few wholly unabashed aliens were partially disrobing wherever they could find room for the operation some lay down upon boards pulled forward between two seats some upon little platforms that let down by chains from the roof and the car was filled with the complaining of tired children and a drowsy murmur of voices in many languages  alison sat down and glanced round at the passengers who had not yet retired in one corner were three young scandinavian girls freshfaced and towhaired of innocent and wholesome appearance going out as they had unblushingly informed her in broken english to look for husbands among the prairie farmers she was afterward to learn that such marriages not infrequently turned out well opposite them sat a young englishman with a hollow face and chest who could not stand his native climate and had been married so alison had heard to the delicate girl beside him the day before he sailed they were going to brandon on the prairie and had not the faintest notion what they would do when they got there  close by were a group of big blonde lithuanians hardened by toil in odoriferous garments a blackhaired pole a jewess whose beauty had run to fatness and her greasy ferreteyed husband farther on a burly englishman who had evidently laid in alcoholic refreshment farther back down the line was crooning a maudlin song there was however an interruption presently for a mans head was thrust out from behind a curtain which hung between the roof and one of the platforms above  let up he said  the song rose a little louder in response and a voice with a western intonation broke in  throw a boot at the hog  no sir replied the man above he might keep it and i guess theyre most used to heaving bottles where he comes from  the words were followed by a scuffling sound which seemed to indicate that the speaker was fumbling about the shelf for something and then he added  this will have to do are you going to sleep down there sonny  the englishman paused to inform anybody who cared to listen that he would go to sleep when he wanted and that it would take a trainload of canadians like the questioner whose personal appearance he alluded to in vitriolic terms to prevent him from singing when he desired after which he resumed the maudlin ditty immediately there was a rustle of snapping leaves as a volume of the detective literature that is commonly peddled on the trains went hurtling across the car it struck the woodwork behind the singer with a vicious thud and he stood up unsteadily  now he said i mean to show you what comes of insulting me  he moved forward a pace or two fell against a seat in an attempt to avoid a toddling child and grabbing at his disturbers platform endeavored to clamber up to it the chains rattled and it seemed that the light boards were bodily coming down when he felt with one hand behind the curtain part of which he rent from its fastenings then his hand reappeared clutching a stockinged foot and a bronzedfaced man in shirt and trousers dropped from a neighboring restingplace  you get out thundered the englishman teach you to be civil when ive done with him gimme time and ill settle the lot of you and the sausageshe presumably meant the lithuaniansafterward  the man above contrived to kick him in the face with his unembarrassed foot but he held on persistently to the other and a general fracas appeared imminent when the conductor strode into the car the latter had very little in common with the average english railway guard for he was a sharptongued domineering autocrat like most of his kind  now he demanded whats this circus about  the englishman informed him that he had been insulted and firmly intended to wipe it out in blood the conductor looked at him with a faint grim smile  go right back to your berth and sleep it off he advised  he stood still collectedly resolute clothed with authority and the englishman hesitated he had doubtless pluck enough and his blood was up but he had also the innate ingrained capacity for obedience to duly constituted power which is not as a rule a characteristic of the westerner then the conductor spoke again  get a move on ill dump you off into the bush if you try to make trouble here  it proved sufficient the singer let the captive foot go and turned away and when the conductor left peace had settled down upon the clattering car the little incident had however an unpleasant effect on alison for this was not the kind of thing to which she had been accustomed it was a moment or two before she turned to her companion  i shall be very glad to get off the train tomorrow millyand i suppose you will be quite as pleased she said  the girl blushed she was young and pretty in a homely fashion and had informed alison who had made her acquaintance on the steamer that she was to be married to a young englishman on her arrival at winnipeg  yes she replied jim will be there waiting i got a telegram at montreal its four years since ive seen him  the words were simple but there was something in the speakers voice and eyes which stirred alison to halfconscious envy it was not that marriage in the abstract had any attraction for her for the thought of it rather jarred on her temperament and it was perhaps not altogether astonishing that she had of late been brought into contact chiefly with the seamy side of the masculine character still lonely and cast adrift as she was she envied this girl who had somebody to take her troubles upon his shoulders and shelter her and she was faintly stirred by her evident tenderness for the man  four years she said reflectively its a very long time  oh declared milly it wouldnt matter if it had been a dozen now hes the sameonly a little handsomer in his last picture except for that he hasnt changed a biti read you some of his letters on the steamer  alison could not help a smile the girls upbringing had clearly been very different from her own and the extracts from jims letters had chiefly appealed to her sense of the ludicrous but now she felt that his badly expressed devotion rang true and her smile slowly faded it must she admitted be something to know that through the four years which had apparently been ones of constant stress and toil the mans affection had never wavered and that his every effort had been inspired by the thought that the result of it would bring his sweetheart in england so much nearer him until at last as the time grew rapidly shorter he had as he said worked half the night to make the rude prairie homestead more fit for her  i suppose he wasnt rich when he went out  no replied milly jim had nothing until an uncle died and left him three or four hundred pounds when he came and told me of it i made him go  you made him go exclaimed alison wondering  of course there was no chance for him in england i couldnt keep him just to have him near mealways poorand i knew that whatever he did in canada he would be true to me the poor boy had trouble his first crop was frozen and his plow oxen diedi think i told you he has a little farm three or four days ride back from the railroad the girls face colored again i sold one or two things i hada little gold watch and a locketand sent him the money i wouldnt tell him how i got it but he said it saved him  alison sat silent for the next moment or two she was touched by her companions words and the tenderness in her eyes alisons upbringing had in some respects not been a good one for she had been taught to shut her eyes to the realities of life and to believe that the smooth things it had to offer were though they must now and then be schemed for hers by right it was only the last three years that had given her comprehension and sympathy and in spite of the clearer insight she had gained during that time it seemed strange to her that this girl with her homely prettiness and still more homely speech and manners should be capable of such unfaltering fidelity to the man she had sent to canada and still more strange that she should ever have inspired him with a passion which had given him power to break down or endurance patiently to undermine the barriers that stood between them alison had yet to learn a good deal about the capacities of the english rank and file which become most manifest where they are given free scope in a new and fertile field  well she said conscious of the lameness of the speech i believe you will be happy  milly smiled compassionately as though this expression of opinion was quite superfluous and then with a tact which alison had scarcely expected she changed the subject  ive talked too much about myself you told me you had something to do when you got to winnipeg  yes was the answer im to begin at once as correspondent in a big hardware business  you have no friends there  no replied alison i havent a friend in canada except perhaps one who married a western wheatgrower two or three years ago and im not sure that she would be pleased to see me as it happens my mother was once or twice i am afraid a little rude to her  it was a rather inadequate description of the persecution of an inoffensive girl who had for a time been treated on a more or less friendly footing and made use of by a certain circle of suburban society interested in parochial philanthropy in which mrs leigh had aspired to rule supreme florence ashton had been tolerated in spite of the fact that she earned her living until an eloquent curate whose means were supposed to be ample happened to cast approving eyes on her when pressure was judicially brought to bear the girl had made a plucky fight but the odds against her were overwhelmingly heavy and the curate it seemed had not quite made up his mind in any case she was vanquished and tactfully forced out of a guild which paid her a very small stipend for certain services and eventually she married a canadian who had come over on a brief visit to the old country how florence had managed it alison who fancied that the phrase was in this case justifiable did not exactly know but she had reasons for believing that the girl had really liked the curate and would not readily forgive her mother  well said milly if ever you want a friend you must come to jim and me and after all you may want one some day she paused and glanced at alison critically of course so many girls have to work nowadays but you dont look like it somehow  this was true although alisons attire was a little faded and shabby its fit was irreproachable and nobody could have found fault with the color scheme she possessed without being unduly conscious of it an artistic taste and a natural grace of carriage which enabled her to wear almost anything so that it became her in addition to this she was besides being attractive in face and feature endued with a certain tranquillity of manner which suggested to the discerning that she had once held her own in high places it was deceptive to this extent that after all the places had been only very moderately elevated  im afraid thats rather a drawback than anything else she said in reference to millys last observation but its a little while since you told me that you were sleepy  they climbed up to two adjoining shelves they drew down from the roof and though this entailed a rather undignified scramble alison wished that her companion had refrained from a confused giggle then they closed the curtains they had hired and lay down to sleep if possible on the very thin mattresses the railway company supplies to colonist passengers for a consideration an attempt at disrobing would not have been advisable but after all a large proportion of the occupants of the car were probably more or less addicted to sleeping in their clothes  there was a change when alison descended early in the morning in order at least to dabble her hands and face in cold water which would not have been possible a little later even firstclass pullman passengers have as a rule something to put up with if they desire to be clean and colonist travelers are not expected to be endued with any particular sense of delicacy or seemliness as a matter of fact a good many of them have not the faintest idea of it it was chiefly for this reason that alison retired to the car platform after hasty ablutions and though it was very cold she stayed there until the rest had risen  the long train had run out of the forest in the night and was now speeding over a vast white level which lay soft and quaggy in the sunshine for the snow had lately gone here and there odd groves of birches went streaming by but for the most part there were only leafless willow copses about the gleaming strips of water which she afterward learned were sloos in between the white waste ran back bleached by the winter to the far horizon it looked strangely desolate for there was scarcely a house on it but at least the sun was shining and it was the first brightness she had seen in the land of the clear skies  most of the passengers were partly dressed for which she was thankful when she went back into the car and after one or two of them had kept her waiting she was at length permitted to set on the stove the tin kettle which was the joint property of herself and her companion then they made tea and after eating the last of their crackers and emptying the fruit can they set themselves to wait with as much patience as possible until the train reached winnipeg  the sun had disappeared and a fine rain was falling when at last the long cars came clanking into the station amid the doleful tolling of the locomotive bell alison stepping down from the platform noticed a man in a long fur coat and a wide soft hat running toward the car then there was a cry and an outbreak of strained laughter and she saw him lift her companion down and hold her unabashed in his arms after that milly seized her by the shoulder  this is jim she announced miss alison leigh i told her that if ever she wanted a home out here she was to come to us  the man who had a pleasant bronzed face laughed and held out his hand  if youre a friend of millys well take you now he said she ought to have one bridesmaid anyway come along and stay with her until you get used to the country  milly blushed and giggled but it was evident that she seconded the invitation and once more alison was touched the offer was frank and spontaneous and she fancied that the man meant it she explained however that she was beginning work on the morrow and jim giving her his address presently turned away with milly  after that alison felt very desolate as she stood alone amid the swarm of frowsy aliens who poured out from the train the station was cold and sloppy everything was strange and unfamiliar there was a new intonation in the voices she heard and even the dress of the citizens who scurried by her was different in details from that to which she had been accustomed in the meanwhile jim and milly had disappeared and as she had been told that the railroad people would take care of her baggage until she produced her check she decided to proceed at once to her employers establishment and inform them of her arrival  a man of whom she made inquiries gave her a few hasty directions and walking out of the station she presently boarded a streetcar and was carried through the city until she alighted in front of a big hardware store being sent to an office at the back of it she noticed that the smart clerk looked at her in a curious fashion when she asked for the manager by name  hes not here he said wont be back again  alison leaned against the counter with a sudden presage of disaster  how is that she asked  company went under a few days ago creditors selling the stock up im acting for the liquidator  alison felt physically dizzy but she contrived to ask another question or two and then went out utterly cast down and desperate into the steadily falling rain she was alone in the big western city with very little money in her purse and no idea as to what she should do  she stood still for several minutes until she remembered having heard that accommodation of an elementary kind was provided in buildings near the station where emigrants just arrived could live for a time at least free of charge though they must provide their own food as she knew that every cent was precious now she turned back on foot along the miry street     chapter ii  maverick thorne   alison slept soundly that night the blow had been so heavy and unexpected that it had deadened her sensibility and kindly nature had her way besides the very hard berth she occupied was at least still and she was not kept awake by the distressful vibration that had disturbed her in the colonist car awakening refreshed in the morning she sallied out to purchase provisions for the day and was unpleasantly astonished at the cost of them she had yet to learn that a dollar goes a very little way in a country where rents and wages are high  returning to the emigrant quarters which were provided with a cookingstove she made a frugal breakfast and then after a conversation with an official who gave her all the information in his power she spent the day offering her services at stores and hotels and offices up and down the city nobody however seemed to want her it was she learned a time of general bad trade for the wheat harvest on which that city largely depends had failed the previous year  day followed day with much the same result until alison who never looked back upon them afterward without a shiver had at last parted with most of her slender stock of garments to one of the jew dealers who then occupied a row of rickety wooden shacks near the station at winnipeg he gave her remarkably little for them and one night she sat down dejectedly in the emigrant quarters to grapple with the crisis by and by a girl who had traveled in the same car and had spoken to her now and then sat down beside her  nothing yet she asked  no said alison wearily i have heard of nothing that i could turn my hands to  then advised her companion youll just have to do the same as the rest of us youre almost as goodlooking as i am she lowered her voice a little i dare say you have noticed that those norwegians have gone  alison had noticed that and also that two or three lean and wiry men with faces almost blackened by exposure to the frost had been hanging about the emigrant quarters for a day or two preceding the disappearance of the girls the blood crept into her cheeks as she remembered it but her companion laughed somewhat harshly  oh she explained theyre married and gone off to farm but what i want to tell you is that im going to follow their example tomorrow its quite straight were to be married in the morning he says hes got a nice house and he looks as if hed treat me decently she laid her hand on alisons arm and seemed to hesitate a neighbor another farmer came in with himand he hasnt found anybody yet  alison shrank from her white in face now with an almost intolerable sense of disgust but in another moment or two the blood surged into her cheeks and her companion made a halfashamed gesture  oh well she said i think youre foolish but i wont say any more about it besides i had only a minute or two charleys waiting in the street for me now  she withdrew somewhat hastily and alison sat still almost too troubled to be capable of indignation forcing herself to think one thing was becoming clear she must escape from winnipeg before the unpleasant suggestion was made to her again perhaps by some man in person and go on farther west after all she had one friend the one her mother had persecuted living somewhere within reach of a station which she had discovered was situated about three hundred miles down the line and florence might take her in for a time at least she decided to set out and try to find her the next day rising with sudden determination she walked across to the station to make inquiries about the train and as she reached it a man strode up to her it was evident that he meant to speak and as there was just then no official to whom she could appeal she drew herself up and faced him resolutely he was a young man neatly dressed in store clothes though he did not look like an inhabitant of the city and he had what she could not help admitting was a pleasant expression  youre miss leigh he said taking off his wide gray hat and his intonation betrayed him to be an englishman  how did you learn my name alison asked chillingly  i made inquiries he confessed the fact is i asked miss carstairs to get me an introduction and to tell the truth i wasnt very much astonished when she said you wouldnt hear of it  alison recognized now that the man was the one her companion had alluded to as her prospective husbands neighbor and for a moment she felt that she could have struck him that feeling however passed there was a hint of deference in his attitude he met the one indignant glance she flashed at him which was somehow reassuring and since she could not run away ignominiously she stood her ground  thats why i thought id make an attempt to plead my cause in person he added  what do you want alison asked in desperation though she was quite aware that this was giving him a lead  the mans gesture seemed to beseech her forbearance  im afraid it will sound rather alarming but in the first place id betterclear the ground the plain truth is that i want a wife  oh cried alison how dare you say this to me  well he answered quietly the fact that i expected you to look at it in that way was one of the things that influenced me a selfrespecting girl with any delicacy of feeling would naturally resent it but im not sure yet that its altogether an insult im offering you let me own that ive been here some little time and that ive spent a good deal of it in watching you he raised his hand as he saw the indignation in her eyes give me a minute or two and then if you think it justified you can be angry i want to say just this we live in a pretty primitive fashion on our hundredandsixtyacre holdings out on the prairie and conventions dont count for much with us what is more to the purpose we are forced to make some irregular venture of this kind if we think of marrying now i have a comparatively decent place about two hundred miles from here and my wife would not have to work as hard as you would certainly have to do in a hotel or store thats to begin with to go on i dont think ive ever been unkind to any one or any thing and though it must seem a horrible piece of assurance i said the day i saw you get out of the train that you were the girl for me i would do what i could everything i could to make things smooth for you  alison felt that strange as it seemed she could believe him the man did not look as if he would be unkind to any one what was more he was apparently a man of some education  now he added what i should like to do is this id find you quarters in a decent boardinghouse and just call and take you round to show you the city for an hour or two each afternoon id try to satisfy you as towell say my mode of life and character and you could perhaps form some idea of me i dont want to form any idea of youive done that already then if my offer appears as repugnant as im afraid it does now id try to take my dismissal in good part and i think i could find you a post in a creamery on the prairie if you would care for it  he broke off and alison wondered at herself while he stood watching her anxiously her anger and disgust had gone she could see the ludicrous aspect of the situation but that was not her clearest impression for she felt that this most unconventional stranger was after all a man one could have confidence in still she had not the least intention of marrying him  thank you she said quietly what you suggest is however quite out of the question  the mans face fell and she felt extraordinary as it seemed almost sorry that she had been compelled to hurt him but once more he took off his soft hat  well he said i suppose i must accept that andthough i dont know if its a complimenti shall go back alone theres just another matter if you have any knowledge of business i could have you made clerk at the creamery  urgent as her need was alison would not entertain the proposal she felt that it would be equally impossible to accept a favor from or to live near him  no she replied it is generous of you but i am going west tomorrow  the man saying nothing further turned away and she thought of him long afterward with a feeling of halfamused goodwill it was the first offer of marriage she had ever had made in a deserted halflighted station by a man to whom she had never spoken until that evening she was to learn however that the strangeness of any event naturally depends very largely on what one has been accustomed to and that one meets with many things which at least appear remarkable when one ventures out of the beaten track  she went on with the westbound train the next afternoon and early in the morning alighted at a wayside station which consisted of one wooden shanty and a big watertank a cluster of little frame houses stood beneath the huge bulk of two grain elevators beyond the unfenced track which ran straight as the crow flies across a bare white waste of prairie as the train sped out along this and grew smaller and smaller alison stood forlornly beside the halfempty trunk which contained the remnant of her few possessions she had then just two dollars in her pocket it was a raw cold morning for spring was unusually late that year and a bitter wind swept across the desolate waste in a minute or two the stationagent came out of the shanty and looked at her with obvious curiosity  i guess youve got off at the right place he said in a manner which made the words seem less of a statement than an inquiry  alison asked him if he knew a mr hunter who lived near grahams bluff and how it was possible to reach his homestead  i know hunter but the bluff is quite a way from here the man replied the boys drive in now and then and a freighter goes through with a wagon about once a fortnight  he saw the girls face fall and added as though something had suddenly struck him  theres a man in the settlement who said he was going that way today or tomorrow and its quite likely that hed drive you over guess you had better ask for maverick thorne at the hotel  alison thanked him and crossing the track made for the rude frame building he indicated her thin boots were very muddy before she reached it for there was no semblance of a street and the space between the houses and elevators was torn up and deeply rutted by wagon wheels she now understood why a high plank sidewalk usually ran as she had noticed along the front of the buildings in the smaller prairie towns  it was with a good deal of diffidence that she walked into the hotel and entered a long and very barely furnished room which just then was occupied by a group of men  several of them wore ordinary city clothes and were she supposed clerks or storekeepers in the little town but the rest had weatherdarkened faces and their garments were flecked with sundried mire and stained with soil while the dilapidated skin coats thrown down here and there evidently belonged to them some were just finishing breakfast and the others stood lighting their pipes about a big rusty stove the place reeked of the smell of cooking and tobacco smoke and looked very comfortless with its uncovered walls and roughly boarded floor there was however no bar in it and it was consoling to see a very neat maid gathering up the plates  is mr maverick thorne here just now she asked the girl  she was unpleasantly conscious that the men had gazed at her with some astonishment when she walked in and it was clear that they had heard her inquiry because several of them smiled  quit talking mavy heres a lady asking for you said one and a man who had been surrounded by a laughing group moved toward her  she glanced at him apprehensively for after her recent experience she was signally shy of seeking a favor from any of his kind he was a tall man bronzed and somewhat lean as most of the inhabitants of the prairie seemed to be and the state of his attire was not calculated to impress a stranger in his favor his long boots were caked with mire and the fur was coming off the battered cap he held in one hand his blue duck trousers were rent at one knee and a very old jacket hung over his coarse blue shirt still his face was reassuring and he had whimsical brown eyes  mr thorne she said  the man made her a respectful inclination which was not what she had expected  at your command he replied  she stood silent a moment or two hesitating and he watched her unobtrusively he saw a jaded girl in a badly creased and somewhat shabby dress who nevertheless had an air of refinement about her which he immediately recognized her face was delicately pretty and cleanly cut though it was weary and a little anxious then and she had fine hazel eyes still the redlipped mouth was somehow determined and there was a hint of decision of character in the way she looked at him from under straightdrawn brows her hair as much as he could see of it was neither brown nor golden but of a shade between and he decided that the contrast between the warm color in her cheeks and the creamy whiteness of the rest of her face was a little more marked than usual as indeed it was for alison was troubled with a very natural embarrassment just then  i want to go to grahams bluff she said the man at the station told me that you were driving there  he did not answer immediately and she awaited his reply in tense anxiety it was evident that she could not stay where she was even if she had been possessed of the means to pay for such rude accommodation as the place provided which was not the case in the meanwhile it occurred to the man that she looked very forlorn in the big bare room and something in her expression appealed to him he was as it happened a compassionate person  well he replied i could take you though as ive a round to make it will be quite a long drive i had thought of starting this afternoon but we had perhaps better get off in the next hour or so  he turned to the girl who was gathering up the plates  wont you try to get this lady some breakfast kristine  the girl said that she would see what she could do but alison was not aware until afterward that it was only due to the fact that the man was a favorite in the place that food was presently set before her the average westerner gets through his breakfast in about ten minutes and as a rule the traveler who arrives at a prairie hotel a few minutes after a meal is over must wait with what patience he can command until the next is ready  in any case alison was astonished when porridge and maple syrup a thin hard steak and a great bowl of potatoes besides strong green tea and a dish of desiccated apricots stewed down to pulp were laid in front of her it was most unlike an english breakfast but she was to learn that there is very little difference between any of the three daily meals served in that country its inhabitants who rise for the most part at sunup do not require to be tempted by dainties which is fortunate since they could not by any means obtain them and in a land where the liquor prohibition laws are generally applied and men work twelve and fourteen hours daily morning appetizers are quite unnecessary  in the meanwhile thorne and his companions had disappeared for which alison was thankful though they left an acrid reek of tobacco smoke behind them but when kristine presently demanded fifty cents she realized with a fresh pang of anxiety that she had now just a dollar and a half in her possession and she scarcely dared contemplate what might happen if florence hunter should not be disposed to welcome her besides this there was the unpleasant possibility that the man might expect more than she could pay him for driving her to grahams bluff and it was with some misgivings that she rose when he appeared an hour later to intimate that the team was ready  going out with him she saw two roughcoated horses apparently endeavoring to kick in the front of a high fourwheeled vehicle until they desisted and backed it violently into the side of the hotel there are various rigs as they term thembuckboards sulkies and the humble bobsledsin use in that country but the favorite one is the narrow generalpurpose wagon mounted on tall slender wheels which will carry a moderate load though light enough to go reasonably fast  thorne helped alison up and as he swung himself into the vehicle several loungers hurled laughing questions at him  arent you going to trade that man the gramophone youd get him sure in half an hour called one  webster wants a tonic that will fix his wooden leg cried another and a third suggested that a chinaman in the vicinity was open to purchase some hairrestorer alison did not know then that probably because he wears only one tail of it a chinamans hair usually grows without the least assistance three feet long  thorne smiled at them and then calling to kristine who was standing near the door he leaned down and handed her a bottle which he took from an open case  i guess you havent much use for anything of this kind but that elixir will make your cheeks bloom like peaches if you rub it in he informed her i sold some round stanbury down the line not long ago and there wasnt an unmarried girl near the place when i next came along  there was only two before and one of them was crosseyed said a grinning man  thorne without answering this told alison to hold fast and flicked the horses with the whip they plunged forward at a mad gallop scattering clods of halfdried mud and the wagon bounced violently into and out of the ruts it seemed to leap into the air when the wheels struck the rails as they crossed the track and then thornes arms grew rigid and there was a further kicking and plunging as he pulled the team up outside the little station shed a man who appeared from within condescended to hand alisons light trunk up which she did not know then was a very great favor and in another moment or two they were flying out across the white waste of prairie  it ran dead level like a frozen sea to where it met the crystalline blueness that hung over it for the grasses which had lain for months in the grip of the iron frost shone in the sunlight a pale silvery gray there was not a trail of smoke or a house on it only here and there a formless blur that was in reality a bluff of straggling birches or a clump of willows and to complete the illusion when alison looked around by and by the houses had sunk down beneath the rim and only the bulk of the wheat elevators rose up like island crags against the sky  it was however warm at last and a wonderful fresh breeze which had the quality of an elixir in it rippled the whitened grass alison felt her heart grow lighter the vast plain was certainly desolate but it had lost its forbidding grimness it had no limit or boundary one felt free out there and cares and apprehensions melted in the sunshine that flooded it she began to understand why she had seen no pinched and pallid faces in this new land its inhabitants laughed wholeheartedly looked one in the eyes and walked with a quick jaunty swing they seemed alert selfconfident optimistic and quaintly whimsical it was hard to believe there was not some nook in it that she could fill  in the meanwhile she was becoming more reassured about her companion she decided that his age was twentysix and that he had a pleasant face his eyes were clear and brown and steady his nose and lips clearly cut and there was a suggestive cleanness about his deeply bronzed skin which was the result of a simple and wholesome life led out in the wind and the sun alison was puzzled however by something in both his manner and his voice that hinted at a careful upbringing and intelligence it certainly was not in keeping with his clothes or his profession which was apparently that of a pedler she had already noticed the nerve and coolness with which he controlled the halfbroken team  im afraid you started before you were quite ready she said at length  the man laughed  i might have planted a gramophone on to one of the boys and a few bottles of generalpurpose specifics among the rest they arehis eyes twinkled humorouslyquite harmless anyway ive no doubt i can unload them on to somebody next time so far at least i havent any rivals in this neighborhood  then you sell things  anything to anybody if i havent got what the buyer wants i promise to bring it next journey or bewilder him with an oration until he gives me a dollar for something he has no possible use for that however isnt a thing you can do very frequently which is why some folks in my profession fail disastrously they cant realize that if you sell a man what he doesnt want too often hes apt to turn out with a club on the next occasion he paused and sighed whimsically if i hadnt been troubled with a conscience i could have been running a store by now that is it must be added if i had wanted to  you find a conscience handicaps you alison inquired for she was half amused and half interested in him  im afraid it does for instance i came across a man with a badly sprained wrist the other day and he offered me two dollars for anything that would cure it now it would have been singularly easy to have affixed a different label to my unrivaled peachbloom cosmetic and have supplied him with a suretoheal embrocation as it was i got my supper at his place and recommended coldwater bandages there was another man i cured of a broken leg and i resisted the temptation to brace him up with hairrestorer  what remedy did you use for the broken leg  splints said thorne dryly after id set it  but isnt that a difficult thing how did you know how to go about it  oh id seen it done  on the prairie  no replied thorne with a rather curious smile in an edinburgh hospital  something in his manner warned her that it might not be judicious to pursue her inquiries any further though she was without exactly knowing why a little curious upon the point it occurred to her that if he had been a patient in the hospital the injured man would in all probability not have been treated in his sight while it seemed somewhat strange that he should now be peddling patent medicines in canada had he been qualifying for his diploma he however said nothing more and they drove on in silence for a while     chapter iii  the camp in the bluff   they stopped in a thin grove of birches at midday for a meal which thorne prepared and it was late in the afternoon when alison who ached with the jolting asked if grahams bluff was very much farther it struck her that the fact that she had not made the inquiry earlier said a good deal for her companions conversational powers  oh yes he answered casually its most of thirty miles  alison started with dismay  but she said and stopped for it was evident that her misgivings could not very well be expressed  were not going through tonight thorne explained the team have had about enough already and theres a farmer ahead wholl take us in if we reach the bluff by tomorrow afternoon it will be as much as one could expect  alison did not care to ask whether the farmer was married though as there seemed to be singularly few women in the country she was afraid that it was scarcely probable there was however no doubt that she must face the unusual and somewhat embarrassing situation  i had no idea it was a two days drive she said  its possible to get through in the same day if you start early thorne replied ive a call to make however which is taking me a good many miles off the direct trail anyway if you hadnt come with me you would have had to wait a week at the hotel  do you know mrs hunter  well answered thorne with a certain dryness we are certainly acquainted when you use the other term in england it to some extent implies that you could be regarded as a friend of the person mentioned  i wonder whether you like her alison was conscious that the speech was not a very judicious one  thornes eyes twinkled in a way that she had noticed already  i must confess that i liked her better when she first came to canada she hadnt begun to remodel arrangements at her husbands homestead then hunter i understand came into some money shortly before he married her and he paused with a little laughmost of my friends are poor  this was not very definite but it tended to confirm the misgivings concerning her reception which already troubled alison she noticed the tact with which the man had refrained from making any inquiries as to her business with mrs hunter indeed he said nothing for the next halfhour and then as they reached the crest of a low rise he pointed to a cluster of what seemed to be ridiculously small buildings on the wide plain below  thats as far as well go tonight he said  the buildings rapidly grew into clearer shape until alison recognized that one was a diminutive frame house which looked as though it had been made for dolls to live in it rose abruptly from the prairie without sheltering tree or fence or garden but near it there was a pile of straw and two shapeless structures which seemed to be composed of soil or sods behind them the vast sweep of silvery gray grass was broken by a narrow strip of ochretinted stubble  presently they reached the lonely homestead and a neatly dressed woman with hard red hands and a worn face appeared in the doorway when thorne helped alison down the girl felt sincerely pleased to see her  ive no doubt youll take my companion whos going on toward the bluff tomorrow in for the night and let me camp in the barn said thorne is tom anywhere around i want to see him about a horse he talked of selling  the woman said that he had gone off to borrow a team of oxen and would not be back until the next day and then she led alison into a little roughly matchboarded room with an uncovered floor and very little furniture except the big stove in the middle of it a child was toddling about the floor and another a very little girl lay with a flushed face in a canvas chair the woman asked alison no questions but set about getting supper ready and after a while thorne who had apparently been putting up the team came in as he did so the child in the chair held out her hands to him  candies mavy she cried got some candies for me  thorne picked her up and sat down with her on his knee and taking a parcel out of his pocket he unwrapped and handed some of its contents to her while she munched the sweetmeats he glanced at her mother interrogatively  yes declared the woman im right glad you came shes been like this three or four days i dont know what to do with her or whats the matter  thorne looked down at the child before he turned toward his hostess  well he said i have at least a notion a little feverish for one thing  he asked a question or two and then held the child out to her mother  will you take her while i get a draught mixed im not sure that shell sit down again in her chair  the child bore this out for she would neither sit alone nor go to her mother  if mavy goes out i sure go along with him she persisted  the man got rid of her with some difficulty and going out to where his wagon stood he came back with a little brassstrapped box in his hand he asked for some water and disappeared into an adjoining room out of which there presently rose the clink of glass and a slight rattling then he called the woman who gave the child to alison and when she came back somewhat relieved in face she laid out the supper it much resembled the breakfast alison had made at the hotel only that strips of untempting salt pork were substituted for the hard steak  an hour or two later she was given a very rude bunk filled with straw and a couple of blankets in an unoccupied room and being tired out she slept soundly lying still when she awakened early the next morning she heard the woman moving about the adjoining room until the outer door opened and a man whose voice she recognized as thornes came in  ill go through and look at the kiddie if i may he said  alison heard him cross the room and when he came back his hostess evidently walked toward the outer door of the house with him  youll have to be careful of her for a few days but if you give her the stuff i left as i told you shell cause you no trouble then he said im sorry i didnt see tom but well have to get on after breakfast  what am i to give you for the medicine the woman asked  alison who listened unabashed heard thornes laugh  breakfast he answered that will put us square ive been selling gramophones and little mirrors by the dozen right along the line and when ive struck a streak of that kind i dont rob my friends  though she did not know exactly why alison had expected such an answer and she remembered with a curious feeling that he had said his friends were poor she heard the woman thank him and then a flush crept into her face for she certainly had not expected the next question  are you going to quit the peddling and take up a quartersection with the girl  no laughed thorne i dont know where you got that idea  shes your kind replied his hostess and this appeared significant to alison ive seen folks like her back in montreal  its quite likely said thorne shes going to mrs hunter  mrs hunter why didnt they send for her whats her name  i havent a notion she walked into browns hotel yesterday looking played out and anxious and said somebody had told her i was going to the bluff as i felt sorry for her i started at once  well responded the woman i guess you couldnt help it its just the kind of thing you would do  thorne apparently went out after this and alison lay still for a time while her hostess clattered about the room she was troubled by what she had heard for although she recognized that she had need of it there was something unpleasant in the fact that she was indebted to this strangers charity he had confessed that he was sorry for her rising a little later she breakfasted with the others and then when thorne went out to harness his team she diffidently asked the woman what she owed her  nothing was the uncompromising reply  but alison began and the woman checked her  were not running a hotel you can stop right now  alison realized that expostulation would be useless and this as a matter of fact was in one respect a relief to her for just then there were but two silver coins in her possession a few minutes later thorne helped her into the wagon and they drove away  the prairie was flooded with sunlight and it was no longer monotonously level it stretched away before her in long billowy rises which dipped again to vast shallow hollows when the team plodded over the crest of them and here and there little specks of flowers peeped out among the whitened grass or there was a faint sprinkling of tender green the air was cool yet and exhilarating as wine alison refreshed by her sound sleep rejoiced in it and it was some time before she spoke to her companion  i felt slightly embarrassed she said that woman would let me pay nothing for my entertainment she cant have very much either  she hasnt replied thorne her husband had his crop hailed out last fall still you see that kind of thing is a custom of the country theyre a hospitable people and in a general way when you are in need of a kindness youre most likely to get it from people who are as hard up as you are he paused with a whimsical smile one cant logically feel hurt at the other kind for standing aside or shutting their eyes but when they proceed to point out that if you had only emulated their virtues you would be equally prosperous it becomes exasperating especially as it isnt true so far as my observation goes it isnt the practice of the stricter virtues that leads to riches  why didnt you say your experience alison inquired its the usual word  it would suggest that i had tried the thing and im afraid that ive only watched other people to get knowledge that way is considerably easier but i presume i was taking too much for granted in supposing that you hadany reason for agreeing with my previous observation  alison felt that this was a question delicately put so that if it pleased her she could avoid a definite reply she did not in the least resent it and something urged her to take this stranger into her confidence  if you mean that i dont know what it is to be poor you are wrong she confessed at the present moment im unpleasantly close to the end of my resources  but you said that you were going to mrs hunters  i dont know whether she will take me in i shouldnt be astonished if she didnt  the man saw the warmth in her face and looked at her thoughtfully  well he said you have courage and that goes quite a way out here i dont think you need be unduly anxious in any case  he flicked the team with his whip and by and by they reached a straggling birch bluff on the crest of a steeper slope a rutted trail led between the trees and as the team moved a little faster down the dip the wagon jolted sharply then one of the beasts stumbled plunged and recovered itself again and thorne seizing alisons arm as she was almost flung from her seat pulled them up and swung himself down looking over the side she saw him stoop and lift one of the horses feet it was a few minutes before he came back again  a badger hole he explained volador fell into it an accident of that kind makes trouble now and then  he drove slowly for the next few miles but so far as alison noticed the horse showed no sign of injury and it was midday when they stopped for a meal beside a creek which wound through a deep hollow on setting out again however the horse began to flag and thorne who got down once or twice in the meanwhile was driving at a walking pace when they reached a birch bluff larger than the last one he pulled the team up and springing to the ground looked at alison a few minutes later  voladors going very lame he said it would be cruelty to drive him much farther  alison was conscious of a shock of dismay sitting in the wagon on the crest of the rise she could look down across the birches upon a vast sweep of prairie and there was no sign of a house anywhere on it it almost seemed as if she must spend the night in the bluff  what is to be done she asked  can you ride  alison said she had never tried and the mans expression hinted that the expedient he had suggested was out of the question  do you think you could walk sixteen miles he asked  im afraid i couldnt alison confessed though if the feat had appeared within her powers she would gladly have attempted it  then youll have to camp here in the wagon though i can fix it up quite comfortably  he held up his hand  you may as well get down and well set about making supper  she was glad that he spoke without any sign of diffidence or hesitation which would have suggested that he expected her to be embarrassed by the situation though this was undoubtedly the case it seemed to her that his manner implied the possession of a certain amount of tact and delicacy for all that she looked out across the prairie with her face turned away from him when she reached the ground  now he said presently handing down a big box if you will open that and fill the kettle at the creek down there among the trees ill bring some branches to make a fire  she moved away with the kettle and when she came back the horses had disappeared and she could hear the thud of her companions ax some distance away in the bush when he reappeared with an armful of dry branches she had laid out a fryingpan an enameled plate or two a bag of flour a big piece of bacon which however seemed to be termed pork in that country and a paper package of desiccated apples she was looking at them somewhat helplessly for she knew very little about cooking thorne made a fire between two birches which he hewed down for the purpose and laid several strips of pork in the fryingpan which she heard him call a spider these he presently emptied out on to a plate laid near the fire after which he poured some water into a basin partly filled with flour  flapjacks are the usual standby in camp he informed her if id known we would be held up here id have soaked those apples do you mind sprinkling this flour with a pinch or two of the yeastpowder in yonder tin though its a thing a sourdough would never come down to  a sourdough inquired alison doing as he requested  an oldtimer explained thorne who splashed himself rather freely as he proceeded to beat up the flour and water sourdough has much the same significance as unleavened bread only that our pioneers kept on eating it more or less regularly in the land of promise for all that i wouldnt wish for better bread than the kind still made with a preparation of sour potatoes and boileddown hops stirred in with the flour in this operation however the great thing is to whip fast enough  he splashed another white smear upon his jacket and rubbed it with his hand before he poured some of the mixture into the hot spider out of which he presently shook what appeared to be a very light pancake three or four more followed in quick succession and then he poured water on to the green tea and handed alison a plate containing two flapjacks and some pork she found them palatable even the desiccated apples which from want of soaking were somewhat leathery did not come amiss and the flavor of the wood smoke failed to spoil the strong green tea then thorne poured a little hot water over the plates and as there was no vessel that would hold them she overruled his objections when she volunteered to go down and wash them thoroughly in the creek when she came back she found that he had made up a clear fire and spread out a blanket as a seat for her  you are satisfied now he asked  alison smiled she was astonished to find herself so much at ease with him  yes she answered i felt that i could at least wash the plates in a way it wasnt altogether my fault that i could do nothing else you see i was never taught to cook  isnt that rather a pity thorne suggested  its more said alison with what was in her case unusual warmth its an injustice still there are thousands of us brought up in that way yonder and when some unexpected thing brings disaster we are left to wonder what use we are to anybody i suppose she added the answer must benone  thorne expressed no opinion on this point but presently took out his pipe  you wont mind he asked i suppose they taught you something  yes answered alison accomplishments i can play and sing indifferently and paint simple landscapes if there are no figures in thembecause figures imply serious study i can follow a french conversation if they dont speak fast and read italian with a dictionary before any of these things will bring a girl in sixpence she must do them excellently and they seem very unlikely to be of the least service in this part of canada  she was angry with herself for the outbreak as soon as she had spoken as it seemed absurd that she should supply a stranger with these personal details but the longing to utter some protest against the halfeducation which had been merely a handicap during the last three bitter years was too much for her thorne however made a sign of sympathetic comprehension  yes he assented that kind of things rather a pity did you never learn anythingpractical  shorthand replied alison i can generally though not always read what ive written if it hasnt exceeded about eighty words a minute then i can type about twothirds as fast as one really ought to and can keep simple accounts so long as neatness is not insisted on i naturally had to learn all this after i left home it seems to me that to bring up english girls in such a way is downright cruelty  thorne laughed  its not remarkably different in our case theres a man in a town not far along the line who used to shine at the oxford union and is now uncommonly glad to earn a few dollars by his talents as an auctioneer thats how they estimate oratory on the prairie theres another who devoted most of his time at cambridge to physical culture and as the result of it he gets pretty steady employment on the railroad track as a ballast shoveler  then he changed his tone  have you any idea as to what you will do if you dont stay with mrs hunter  no confessed alison somewhat ruefully  well said thorne as i believe i mentioned i dont think you need worry about the matter its very probable that some of the small wheatgrowers wives would be glad to have you  but i cant even sew decently  the mans eyes twinkled  in a general way theyre too busy to be fastidious  there was silence for a little after this and alison cast one or two swift unobtrusive glances at her companion who lay smoking opposite her on the other side of the fire the sun now hung low above the great white waste and the red light streamed in upon them both between the leafless birches again she decided that he had a pleasant face and what was more in spite of his attire his whole personality seemed to suggest a clean and wholesome virility  she had seen that he could be gentle in the sick childs case and she suspected that he could be generous but there was something about him that also hinted at force then she remembered some of the men with whom she had been brought into unpleasant contact in the citiesmany who bore the unmistakable mark of the beast the cheap swagger of others and the inane attempts at gallantries which some of the rest indulged in they were not all like that she realized there were true men everywhere but now that her first shrinking from the grim and lonely land was lessening it seemed to her that it had in some respects at least a more bracing influence on those who lived in it than that other still very dear one on which she had turned her back then she realized that she was after all appraising its inhabitants by a single specimen she had yet to learn that they are now and then a little too aggressively proud of themselves in western canada though it must be said that the boaster is usually ready to pour out the sweat of tensest effort with ax and saw or oxteam to prove his vaunting warranted  after a while the sun dipped and it grew chilly as dusk crept up from the hazy east across the leagues of grass thorne brought her another blanket to lay over her shoulders and lying down again relighted his pipe there was not a breath of wind and though she could hear the kneehobbled horses moving every now and then the silence became impressive she felt impelled to break it presently for it seemed to her that casual conversation would lessen the probability of the somewhat unusual situation having too marked an effect on either of them  how is it that you have so many provisions in your wagon she asked  thorne laughed  i live in it all summer  and you drive about selling things is it very remunerative  no admitted thorne dryly i cant say that it is but you see i like it im afraid that ive a rooted objection to staying in one place very long and while i can get a meal and the few things i need by selling an odd bottle of cosmetic a gramophone or a mirror im content he made a humorous gesture thats the kind of man i am  then he stood up  its getting rather late and youll find the wagon fixed up ready if you hear a doleful howling you neednt be alarmed it will only be the coyotes  he disappeared into the shadows and alison turned away toward the wagon     chapter iv  the farquhar homestead   when she reached the wagon alison found it covered by a heavy waterproof sheet which was stretched across a pole loose hay had been strewn between a row of wooden cases and one side of the vehicle and the space beneath the sheeted roof was filled with a faint aromatic odor which she afterward learned was the smell of the wild peppermint that grows in the prairie grass when she had spread one blanket on the hay the couch felt seductively soft and she sank into it contentedly tired as she was however she did not go to sleep immediately for it was the first night she had ever spent in the open and for a time the strangeness of her surroundings reacted on her  the front of the tent was open and resting on one elbow she could see the sinking fires still burning red among the leafless trees and the pale wisps of smoke that drifted among their spectral stems at the foot of the slope there was a wan gleam of water and beyond that in turn the prairie rolled away vast and dim and shadowy with a silver halfmoon hanging low above its eastern rim to one who had lived in the cities as she had done the silence was at first so deep as to be almost overwhelming but by degrees she became conscious that it was broken by tiny sounds there was a very faint elfin tinkle of running water a whispering of grasses that bent to the little cold breeze which had just sprung up and the softest caressing rustle of the lacelike birch twigs then as the moon rose higher the vast sweep of wilderness and sky gathered depth of color and became a wonderful nocturne in blue and silver  in the meanwhile a pleasant warmth was creeping through her wearied body and she began to wonder with a sense of compunction how many blankets thorne possessed and where he was it was at least certain that he was nowhere near the fire for she had carefully satisfied herself on that point then a wild drawnout howl drifted up to her across the faintly gleaming prairie and she started and held her breath until she remembered that thorne had said there was no reason why she should be alarmed if she heard a coyote he was she felt a man one could believe the beast did not howl again but she continued to think of her companion as her eyes grew heavy there was no doubt that he had a pleasant voice and a handsome face then her eyes closed altogether and her yielding elbow slipped down among the hay  the sun was where the moon had been when she opened her eyes again climbing down from the wagon she saw no sign of thorne a bucket filled with very cold water however stood beneath a tree where she did not remember having noticed it on the previous evening and a towel hung close by a few minutes later she took down the towel and glanced at it dubiously it was by no means overclean and she wondered with misgivings what the man did with it it seemed within the bounds of possibility that he dried the plates on it and what was worse that he might do so again in the meanwhile however the hair on her forehead was dripping and the water was trickling down her neck so she shut her eyes tight and applied the towel after which she concealed it carefully in the wagon  a quarter of an hour later thorne appeared and she was relieved upon one point at least whether he had slept with blankets or without them he did not look cold and his appearance indeed suggested that he had been in the neighboring creek she was astonished to notice that he had brushed himself carefully and had sewed up the rent in the knee of his overalls clothesbrushes she correctly supposed were scarce on the canadian prairie but it seemed probable that he would require a brush of some kind to clean his horses  if you wouldnt mind laying out breakfast ill make a fire and catch the team he said its a glorious morning but once the winters over we have a good many of them here  yes assented alison everything is so delightfully fresh  his eyes rested on her for a moment and she was unpleasantly conscious that her dress was badly creased and crumpled as well as shabby but he did not seem to notice this  that he said is what struck me a minute or two ago  he busied himself about the fire and when he strode away through the bluff in search of the horses she heard him singing softly to himself she recognized the aria and wondered a little for it was not one that could be considered as popular music  they had breakfast when he came back and both laughed when she prepared the flapjacks under his direction she felt no restraint in this strangers company indeed she was conscious of a pleasant sense of camaraderie which seemed the best name for it though she had hired him to drive her to mrs hunters and was very uncertain as to whether she could pay him  he harnessed the team when the meal was over and explained that although volador was still lame they might contrive to reach grahams bluff at sundown by proceeding by easy stages and alison tactfully led him on to talk about himself as they drove away though there were one or two points on which he was reserved he displayed very little diffidence which however is a quality not often met with among the inhabitants of western canada  well he said with an air of whimsical reflection in answer to one question i suppose my chief complaint is an excess of individuality they beat it out of you with clubs in england unless youre richreally richwhen you can of course do anything on the other hand the man who is merely stodgily prosperous is hampered by more rules than anybody else this is i must explain another notion ive arrived at by observation and not from experience  one supposes that a certain amount of uniformity and subordination is necessary to progress commented alison  oh yes agreed thorne thats the trouble progress marches with massed battalions and makes so much dust that its not always able to see where its going perhaps its that or the bewildering change of leaders that renders so much countermarching unavoidable  then you prefer to act with the vedettes and skirmishers  no said thorne not that exactly some of us are more like the campfollowers we collect our toll on the booty and when thats too difficult we live on the country after all mines an ancient if not a very respectable calling there were always pilgrims minstrels and pedlers  it cant be a luxurious life  thorne looked amused  are you quite sure you didnt mean a useful one  alison felt uncomfortable because this idea had been in her mind  ill answer the question anyway continued thorne these people and those in the wheatgrowing lands across the frontier work twelve and fourteen hours every day its always the same unceasing toil with themthey have no diversions we go round and carry the news from place to place tell them the latest stories and now and then sing to them we dont tax them too much eithera supper when theyre poora dollar for a mirror or a bottle of elixir which it must be confessed most of them have no possible use for  did you never do anything else alison inquired that is in canada  oh yes replied her companion i was clerk in an implement store which i walked out of at its proprietors request after an attack of injudicious candor you see a rather big farmer came in one day and spent most of the morning examining our seeders and pointing out their defects then he inquired why we had the assurance to demand so much for our implement when he could buy a very much better one several dollars cheaper i asked him if he was sure of that and when he said he was i suggested that it would be considerably wiser to go right away and buy it instead of wasting his time and mine the proprietor desired to know how we expected him to make a living if we talked to customers like that and i pointed out that we couldnt do so anyway by answering insane questions  alison laughed delightedly she felt that this was not mere rodomontade but that the man was perfectly capable of doing as he had said  had you any more experiences of the same kind she asked  i was shortly afterward projected out of a wheat brokers office  projected  thorne grinned  i believe that describes it you see they were three to one but i took part of the office fittings along with me i must own that i lost my temper and insulted them  but why did you do so  well answered thorne reflectively i like the colonial and especially the westerner though hes rather fond of insisting on his superiority over the rest of mankind one gets used to this but it now and then grows galling when he compares himself with the folks who come out from the old country on the day in question the trouble arose from a repetition of the usual formula that if it wasnt for the ocean theyd have the whole scum of europe coming over i however shook hands with the man who said it not long afterward and he told me that after i had gone which was how he expressed it they sat down and laughed until they ached thinking what the wheat broker who was out on business would say when he saw his office  alison was genuinely amused and she ventured another question  did you leave your situations in england in the same fashion  the mans face darkened for a moment  as it happened i hadnt any  alison turned the conversation into what promised to be a safer channel and they drove along very slowly all morning when they set out again after a lengthy stop at noon thorne asked her if she would mind walking for a while as volador was becoming very lame he added that he would make for an outlying homestead where they would find entertainment instead of grahams bluff and that they should reach mrs hunters on the following day  it was six oclock in the evening when they arrived at a frame house which stood roofed with cedar shingles in the shelter of a big birch bluff there was a very rude sodbuilt stable a small log barn and a great pile of straw which appeared to be hollow inside and used as a store of some kind a middleaged man with a goodhumored look met them at the door and his wife greeted alison in a kindly fashion when thorne explained the cause of their visit indeed alison was pleased with the womans face and manner though like many of the small wheatgrowers wives she looked a little worn and faded though the men toil strenuously on the newly broken prairie the heavier burden not infrequently falls to the womans share  farquhar their host went out to work after supper but came back a little before dusk and when they sat out on the stoop together thorne got his banjo and sang twice at mrs farquhars request once some amusing jingle he had heard in winnipeg and afterward mandalay  the song was not new to alison but she fancied that she had never heard it rendered as maverick thorne sang it then it was not his voice though that was a fine one but the knowledge that had given him power of expression which held her tense and still this man knew and had indulged in and probably suffered for the longing for something that was strange and different from all that his experience had touched before he was one of the freelances who could not sit snugly at home and in her heart alison sympathized with him  she had never seen the glowing sensuous east and south but the new west lay open before her in all its clean pristine virility a vast sweep of sky that was duskily purple eastward stretched overhead a wonderful crystalline bluish green until it changed far off on the grasslands rim to a streak of smoky red under it the prairie rolled back like a great silent sea there was something that set the blood stirring in the dewchilled air and the faint smell of the wood smoke and the calling of the wild fowl on a distant sloo intensified the sense of the new and unfamiliar one could be free in that wide land she felt and as she thought of the customs castes and conventions to which one must submit at home she wondered whether they were needed guides and guards or mere cramping fetters they seemed to have none of them in western canada  she said thank you when thorne laid down his banjo and felt that the spoken word had its limits though she was careful not to look at him directly just then and soon afterward she retired this house was larger and much better furnished than the one she had last slept in though she supposed that it would have looked singularly comfortless and almost empty in england there was for one thing neither a curtain at a window nor a carpet on the floor  when she joined the others at breakfast the next morning her host informed thorne that if they could wait until noon he could lend him a horse to replace the lame volador he had he explained sent his hired man off with a team on the previous day for a plow which was being repaired by a smith who lived at a distance and he had some work for the second pair that morning the men went out together when breakfast was over and mrs farquhar sat down opposite alison after she had cleared the table  thorne tells me you are going to mrs hunters though you dont know yet whether you will stay with her or not she said  it occurred to alison that this was a tactful way of expressing it though she was not sure that the delicacy was altogether thornes for she had no doubt that her hostess had once been accustomed to a much smoother life in the canadian cities  no she replied i really cant tell until i get there  then in case you dont decide to stay we should be glad to have you here  alison was astonished but in spite of her usual outward calm there was a vein of impulsiveness in her and she leaned forward in her chair  i dont suppose you know that i am quite useless at any kind of housework she said i cant wash things i cant cook and i can scarcely sew  mrs farquhar smiled  when i first came out here from toronto it was much the same with me and there was nobody to teach me its fortunate that men are not very fastidious in this part of canada in any case i had perhaps better mention that while i would be glad to pay you at the usual rate and you would be required to help you would live with us as one of the family i want a companion with my husband at work from sunup until dark its often lonely here besides the arrangement would give you an opportunity for learning a little and finding out how you like the country  alison thought hard for a few moments what she was offered was a situation as a servant but she decided that it would be more pleasant here than she supposed it must generally be in england she felt inclined to like this woman and her husbands manner was reassuring there was no doubt that they would treat her well  im afraid that in a little while you would be sorry you had suggested it she said  the question is would you like to try  im quite sure of that declared alison impulsively i dont suppose you know what it is to be offered a restingplace when you arrive feeling very friendless and forlorn in a new country  mrs farquhar smiled  then if you dont care to stay with mrs hunter you must come straight back here it would perhaps be better if you went to her in the first instance  but dont you want any references  i dont think i do in this case your face is sufficient and from experience we dont attach any great importance to vouchers of the other kind harry sometimes says that when a man is found to be insufferable in the old country they give him a walletful of letters of introduction crediting him with all the virtues and send him out to us besides even if you were really quite dreadful your friends wouldnt go back on you when i wrote to them  alison laughed and as the hired man appeared at noon with farquhars team she drove away with thorne soon after dinner when they had left the house behind she turned to him  you have been talking about me to mrs farquhar she said  yes admitted thorne with a smile i must confess that i have is there any reason why you should be angry  im not alison informed him but why did you do it  im far from sure that you will like mrs hunter in fact id be a little astonished if you did and if you were a relative of mine id try to make you stay with mrs farquhar  i wonder whether that means that mrs hunter doesnt like you  thorne laughed goodhumoredly  oh im much too insignificant a person to count either way mrs hunter is what you might call grande dame  have you any of them in western canada  well answered thorne with an air of whimsical reflection there are certainly not many and in spite of it the country gets along pretty well we have however quite a few women of excellent education and manners who dont seem to mind making their childrens dresses and washing their husbands clothes anyway if shes at home you can form your own opinion of florence hunter in an hour or two  is she often away  not infrequently every now and then she goes off to winnipeg toronto or montreal  but what about her husband can he leave his farm  hunter thorne replied dryly invariably stays at home  his manner made it clear that he intended to say no more on that subject and they talked about other matters while the wagon jolted on across the sunlit prairie     chapter v  thorne gives advice  it was early in the evening when they drove into sight of the hunter homestead and as they approached it alison glanced about her with some curiosity long rows of clods out of which rose a tangle of withered grass tussocks stretched across the foreground thorne told her that this was the breaking land won from the prairie too late for sowing in the previous year farther on they skirted another stretch of more friable and cleaner clods shattered and mellowed by the frost and then they came to a space of charred stubble beyond that a waste of yellow straw stood almost kneehigh and thorne said that as the latter had no value on the prairie it was generally burned off to clear the ground for the following crop he added that wheat was usually grown on the same land for several years without any attempt at fertilization  alison however knew nothing of farming and it was the house at which she gazed with most interest it stood not far from a broad shallow lake with a thin birch bluff on one side of it a commodious twostoried building with a wide veranda it was apparently built of wood but its severity of outline was relieved by gaily pickedout scrollwork and lattice shutters and in front of the entrance somebody had attempted to make a garden the stables and barns behind it were new frame buildings and there were wire fences stretching back from these after her experience of the last few days alison had not expected to see anything like it in western canada  then she began to wonder whether florence hunters life in the west had made much change in her she recollected her as a pretty but rather pallid girl with a manner a little too suggestive of selfconfidence and a look of calculating tenacity in her eyes alison had continued to treat her as a friend after she had incurred the hostility of mrs leigh but she realized that it was chiefly florences courage and resourcefulness that had impressed her and not her other qualities she had not seen florences husband  a few minutes later thorne drove up to the front of the house and alison saw a woman who hitherto had been hidden by one of the pillars lying in a canvas chair on the veranda with a book in her hand the sunlight that streamed in upon her called up fiery gleams in her red hair and shimmered on her long dress of soft filmy green alison promptly decided that the latter had come from new york or montreal there was no doubt that florence hunters appearance was striking though her expression even in repose seemed to indicate a dissatisfied exacting temperament at length she heard the rattle of wheels for she rose  alison by all thats wonderful she cried  there was astonishment in the exclamation but alison could not convince herself that there was any great pleasure and it was with a certain sense of constraint that she permitted thorne to help her down he walked with her up to the veranda and acknowledged mrs hunters casual greeting by lifting his hat  sit down said the latter to alison pointing to another chair where have you sprung from  from winnipeg i came out to earn my living and nobody seemed to want me there  florence laughed  you earn your living its clear that something very extraordinary must have happened but well talk of that after supper so you decided to come to me  it was alison realized merely a question and nothing more  im afraid i was a little presumptuous she replied there is of course no reason why you should have me  her companion looked at her with a curious smile  you are still in the habit of saying things of that kind i suppose it runs in the family  alison winced for she remembered that her mother could on occasion be painfully rude  you havent said anything to convince me that i was wrong  was it necessary florence asked languidly i was never very effusive as you ought to know of course youll stay here as long as it pleases you  the invitation was clear enough but there was no warmth in it and alison was relieved when a man came up the steps he was rather short in stature and there was nothing striking in his appearance he had a quiet brown face and very brown hands and he had evidently been working for he wore long boots a coarse blue shirt and blue duck overalls he shook hands with thorne cordially and then turned toward alison  my husband said florence miss leigh elcot i used to know her in england she has just arrived  alison noticed that hunter favored her with a glance of grave scrutiny but he did not seem in the least astonished nor did he glance at his wife this indicated that he was in the habit of accepting without question anything that the latter did then he held out his hand  im very glad to see you and well try to make you comfortable he said with a smile which softened the girls heart toward him then he turned to his wife  is supper ready i want to haul in another load of wood before its dark  it should have been ready now i dont know what theyre doing inside was the careless reply  it occurred to alison that her hostess might have gone to see but she was half annoyed with thorne when she noticed his badly dissembled grin then hunter inquired if she had had a comfortable journey  not very she answered you see i traveled colonist  how dreadful florence exclaimed  her husband smiled at alison  it depends he said its good enough if you can wait until after the steamboat train i used to travel that way myself once upon a time i had to do it then  elcot his wife explained is one of the most economically minded men living he grudges every dollar unless its for new implements  hunter did not contradict her he and thorne left the veranda and soon after they returned from leading the team to the stable a trim maid appeared to announce that supper was ready hunter led alison into a big and very simply furnished room a long table ran down one side and half a dozen men attired much as hunter was took their places about the uncovered lower half of it there was a cloth on the upper portion with a gap of several feet between its margin and the nearest of the teamsters seats it occurred to alison who had been told that the hired man generally ate with his employer on the prairie that this compromise was rather pitiful though she did not know that hunter had once or twice had words with his wife on the question as the meal which was bountiful proceeded he now and then spoke to the men but florence confined her attention to alison until at length she addressed thorne  to what do we owe the pleasure of seeing you she inquired  in the first place i came to bring miss leigh she hired me  thorne laid a very slight stress upon the hired it seemed to indicate that he recognized his station in relation to a guest of the house and alison felt a little uncomfortable for one thing though that did not quite account for her uneasiness she remembered that she had not paid him  then he added i called in the usual course of business i have for disposal a few tablets of very excellent english soap a case of peachbloom cosmetic and one or two other requisites of the kind  alison regretted that she laughed but she felt that florences attitude toward the man had rendered the thrust admissible and she saw a faint smile in hunters eyes her hostess however was equal to the occasion  if theyre not as rubbishy as usual ill buy a few things and give them to the maids is that the whole of your stock  ive a box of new gramophone records  florence looked at her husband and alison fancied that she had noticed and meant to punish him for his smile  youll buy them elcot  you havent tried the other lot hunter protested besides the instrument seemed to have contracted bronchitis when i last had it out  it will do to amuse the boys when the nights get dark replied florence then she turned to alison one could hardly get a dollar out of him with a lever  doesnt it depend on the kind of lever you use alison asked  thorne grinned but florence answered unhesitatingly  oh in the case of the average man it doesnt matter so long as its strong enough and you have a fulcrum well admit that the type can be generous but its only when it throws a reflected luster on themselves otherwise judicious pressure is necessary  are you going to camp with us tonight hunter asked thorne  no answered the latter i have some business at the bluff and i want to get off again early tomorrow  in a few more minutes the teamsters rose and hunter making excuses to alison went out with them florence looked after them and then turned to the girl with a disdainful lifting of her brows  cormorants she commented theyve been very slow tonight eight minutes is about their usual limit i dont think they even look at their foodit just goes down i have once or twice suggested to elcot that he is wasting his money by giving them the things he does its difficult though to make him listen to reason  alison said nothing and after a while florence rose  well have a talk on the veranda while they clear away  she pointed to a chair when they reached the veranda and then sank languidly into one close by  tell me all about it she said  it was not a pleasant task to alison for it entailed the mention of her fathers death and an account of the difficulties that had followed but she spoke for a few minutes and her companion casually expressed her sympathy  i can understand why you came out she added with a bitter laugh when i first met you i was earning just enough to keep me on the border line between respectability andthe other thingthat is by the exercise of the most unpleasant selfdenial what i should have done without the extra twelve pounds your mothers guild paid me for playing the piano twice a week at the working girls club i dont like to think that is why i made no complaint when they added to my duties the teaching of a class on another evening and the collecting of the subscriptions to the sewing society your mother i heard informed the committee that in her opinion twelve pounds was a good deal too much and i believe she added that such a rate of payment was apt to make a young woman of my class far too independent  alisons cheeks burned for she knew that florence had been correctly informed but she had no thought of mentioning that she had expostulated with her mother on the subject  well said florence it was not your fault and im sorry for you i suppose you haddifficultieswith some of your employers no doubt one or two of them tried to make love to you  alison made a little gesture of disgust  oh laughed florence i know you probably flared out at the offender and either got your work found fault with or lost your situation i didnt after all a smile costs nothing though its a little difficult now and then in my case it led to shorter hours higher wages an occasional saturday afternoon trip to the country i got what i could and in due time it was generally easy to turn round upon and get rid of the provider still it was just a little humiliating with a certain type of man and it was a relief when elcot took me out of it i try to remember that i owe him that when he gets unusually wearisome though one must do him the justice to admit that he never refers to it  alison sat silent shrinking from her companion she had faced a good many unpleasant things during the past few years but they had wrought but little change in her nature the part her hostess had played would have been a wholly hateful one to her  where did you come across thorne florence asked  alison told her and she looked thoughtful  when was that i supposed you had come straight from the station  four days ago answered alison unhesitatingly though she would have much preferred not to mention it  four days and you have been driving round the country since then with thorne  alison felt her face grow hot but her answer was clear and sharp  of course i couldnt help it we should have been here earlier only a horse went lame in any case after what you have told me i cannot see why you should adopt that tone  florence raised her brows  my dear she said i was a working woman of no account in england when i first met youbut things are rather different now it doesnt exactly please me that a guest of mine should indulge in an escapade of this description doesnt it strike you as hardly fitting  hunter who had come up the steps unobserved stopped beside them just then  rubbish he said curtly it was unavoidable ive had a talk with leslie he told me exactly what delayed him  florence waved her hand  oh she replied let it go at that i couldnt resist the temptation of sticking a pin or two into alison what has brought you back  we broke the wagon pole it didnt seem worth while to put in a new one tonight  he moved away and left them and alison turned to her companion  did he mean mr thorne by leslie  of course  but isnt his name maverick  did you call him that  i cant remember though i suppose i must have done so some of the others certainly did  florence looked amused  i suppose you havent an idea what a maverick is  alison said that she had none at all and her companion proceeded to inform her  its a steer that wont feed and follow tamely with the herd but goes off or gets wild and smashes things and generally does whats least desirable as you have spent some days with him you will no doubt understand why they have fixed the name on thorne  alison glanced at her with a sparkle in her eyes  i can only say this i have met a few men one could look up toafter all there are good people in the worldbut i havent yet come across one who showed more tact and considerate thoughtfulness than maverick thorne  florence was evidently amused at thisindeed to be sardonically amused at something seemed her favorite pose  i shouldnt like to disturb that kind of optimismand here he is ill leave you to talk to him as it happens elcot looks rather grumpy and the mailcarrier has just brought out a sheaf of my bills from winnipeg which he hasnt seen yet  she sailed away with a rustle of elaborate draperies and thorne sat down  im going on to the bluff in half an hour he informed her  alison was conscious of a certain hesitation but there was something to be said  how much do i owe you she asked  half a dollar  alison flushed  why didnt you say four or five dollars  since you evidently mean to insist on an answer there are several reasons for my modesty for one thing you would have to borrow the money from mrs hunter which i dont think you would like to do for another if you were a canadian id saynothingbut as youre not used to the country yet you wouldnt care to accept a favor from a stranger  but it would be a favor in any case  then you can get rid of the obligation by giving me half a dollar  the girl looked at him sharply as she laid the silver coin in his hand but he met her gaze with a whimsical smile  thank you he said i suppose you are going back to mrs farquhar  yes replied alison impulsively i believe i am but i may wait for a few days  i think youre wise you wouldnt find things very pleasant here  why  if youll permit me to mention it youre too pretty  alison straightened herself suddenly in her chair  you dont like mrs hunter but does that justify you in saying what you have you cant mean that she would bejealous  thats exactly what i do mean  he saw the angry color mantle in the face of the girl and raised his hand in expostulation  wait a little i want to explain first of all she wouldnt have the slightest cause for jealousy youre not the kind to give her one and elcot hunter is one of the best and straightest men i know in fact thats partly what is troubling me  why should it trouble you alison interrupted  thorne appeared to reflect and indignant with his presumption as she was the girl admitted that he did it very well  if you urge me for a precise answer im afraid ill have to confess that i dont quite know anyway because hunter is the sort of man i have described hed try to make things pleasant for you and theres no doubt that his wife would resent it whether shes fond of him at all or not i naturally cant say but she expects him to be entirely at her beck and call and i dont think shed tolerate any little courtesies he might show you  alison sat silent for a moment or two when he stopped looking at him with perplexed eyes though she felt that he was right  its curious isnt it she said at length florence must have had a very unpleasant time in england where she had to practise the strictest selfdenial one would have thought it would have made her content and compassionate now that she has everything that she could wish for  no responded thorne in a way its natural that kind of life often has the opposite effect those who lead it have so much to put up with that if once they escape it makes them determined never even to contemplate doing the least thing they dont like again  oh declared alison impulsively i shouldnt care to think that  well said thorne with unmoved gravity i dont know whether you have had as much to face as you say that she has though one or two things seem to suggest it but it certainly hasnt spoiled you  then he rose  as i want to reach the bluff tonight ill get my team harnessed  alison watched him go down the steps with a somewhat perplexing sense of regret she had met the man only four days ago but she felt that she was parting from a friend  a few minutes later florence hunter called her into the house and she stayed with her a week before she went to mrs farquhar she admitted that florence had given her no particular cause for leaving but she at least made no objections when alison acquainted her with her decision     chapter vi  thorne contemplates a change   alison had spent a few days with mrs farquhar without finding the least reason to regret the choice she had made when one evening farquhar helped her and his wife into his wagon in front of the little hotel at grahams bluff where he had passed the last halfhour in conversation with an implement dealer when they had taken their places he drove cautiously down the wide unpaved street which was seamed with ruts on either side of it straggling and singularly unpicturesque frame houses destitute of paint or any attempt at adornment rose abruptly from the prairie though here and there the usual plank sidewalk ran along the front of them alison was convinced that she had rarely seen a more uninteresting place though she had discovered that its inhabitants were not only quite satisfied with it but firmly believed in its roseate future this seemed somewhat curious as a number of them had come there from the cities but she did not know then that the optimistic assurance with which they were endued is common in the west and that it is as a rule in due time justified  turning a corner they came out into a wider space from which a riband of rutted trail led out into the wilderness farquhar pulled up his team close in front of them a crowd had gathered about a wagon and a man who stood upon a box in it seemed to be addressing the assembly alison could not see his face and his voice was for the most part drowned by bursts of laughter but he was waving his hands to emphasize his remarks and this and his general attitude reminded her of the itinerant auctioneers she had now and then seen in the marketplace of an english provincial town though the crowd and the surroundings were in this case very different  the prairie which was dusty white stretched back to the soft red glow of the far horizon and overhead there was a wonderful blue transparency the light was still sharp and the figures of the men stood out with a curious distinctness most of them were picturesque in wide gray hats and long boots with blue shirt and jacket hanging loose above the rather tight dustsmeared trousers though there were some who wore black hats and spruce store clothes these however looked very much out of place  thornes pitching it to the boys in great style tonight chuckled farquhar well get a little nearer i like to hear him when he has a good head of steam up  he started the team but alison was sensible of a slight shock of displeasure she was aware that thorne sold things because he had told her so but she had never seen him actively engaged in his profession and this kind of thing seemed extremely undignified she had got rid of a good many prejudices during the past few years and was for that matter in due time to discard some more but it hurt her to see a friend of hersand she admitted that she regarded him as suchplaying the part of mountebank to amuse the inhabitants of a forlorn prairie town  farquhar drew up his team again presently alison fancied that mrs farquhar was watching her and she fixed her eyes upon the crowd and thorne his remarks were received with uproarious laughter but she was quick to notice that there was nothing in what he said that any one could reasonably take exception to  presently there was an interruption for a man in white shirt and store clothing pushed forward through the crowd with another who was big and lank and hardfaced and wore old blue duck following close behind him  now exclaimed farquhar expectantly were going to have some fun thats sergeant the storekeeper who sells drugs and things and hes been on mavys trail for quite a while so far mavy has generally talked him down but tonight hes got a backer custer has the reputation of being a bad man and its generally supposed that he owes sergeant a good deal of money  hadnt we better drive on if theres likely to be any trouble suggested his wife  farquhar said that thorne would probably prove a match for his opponents without provoking actual hostilities and added that they could go on later if it seemed advisable alison laughed when a hoarse burst of merriment followed the orators last sally  it was really witty she said in fact its all clever i wonder how he learned to talk like that  mrs farquhar smiled  its probably in the blood i believe one of his close relatives is a bishop  it doesnt quite follow objected farquhar i heard one of them an english one in montreal who wasnt a patch on mavy anyway if you want to hold the boys here you have to be clever  then a protesting voice broke in upon thornes flowing periods  boys it said that man has played you for suckers bout long enough and this kind of thing is rough on every decent storekeeper in the town were making the place grow were always willing to make a deal when you have anything to sell and were generally open to supply you with better goods than he keeps at a lower figure  in my case thorne pointed out you get amusing tales and sound advice thrown in you can at any time consult me about anything from the best way to make your hair curl to the easiest means of getting rid of the mortgage man which in most cases is to pay his bill  i could tell way funnier tales than you do when i was asleep interrupted the storekeepers friend  thorne disregarded this  ive nothing to urge against the storekeepers boys theyre useful to the communityits possible that theyre more useful than i ambut it doesnt seem quite fitting to hold them up as deserving objects of your compassion if you have any doubt on that point you have only to look at their clothes i dont like to be personal but since there are two men here from whom i dont expect very much delicacy i feel inclined to wonder whether that is a brass watch and guard mr sergeant is wearing  no sir snapped the other who was evidently too disturbed in temper to notice the simple trap its english gold cost me most of a hundred and twenty dollars in winnipeg  thorne waved his hand  thats the point boys mine which was made in connecticut cost five i think you can see the inference if you dont i should like you to ask him where he got the hundred and twenty dollars  there was applauding laughter for the men were quite aware that they had furnished it but thorne proceeded  its likely that i could buy things of that kind and keep as smart a team as our friend does if i struck you for the interest he charges on your heldover accounts  thats quite right somebody cried they dont want no pity theyve got bonds on half our farms guess the usual interests blamed robbery  once more the storekeeper lifted up his voice  you wouldnt call it that if youd ever tried to collect it you stand out of your money until harvests in and then when you drive round the homesteads empty and somebodys written on the door sorry i couldnt pack the house off  this was followed by further laughter for as farquhar explained to alison pack signifies the transporting of ones possessions usually upon the owners back in most of western canada and the notice thus implies that the defaulting farmer had judiciously removed himself and everything of value except his dwelling before the arrival of his creditor  you could shut down on the land anyway retorted one man  could i sergeant inquired savagely when its freegrant land and the man hadnt broke enough to get his patent  the crowd encouraged by a word or two from thorne seemed disposed to drift off into a disquisition on the homestead laws but sergeant pulled them up  well keep to the point he said when you buy your drugs at my store you get just what you ask for with the makers label stuck fast on it maverick keeps loose ones and if you ask him to cure your liver its quite likely that hell give you hairrestorer  farquhar chuckled  im afraid theres some truth in that he admitted still its to mavys credit that when the case is serious he generally prescribes a visit to the nearest doctor  in the meanwhile the storekeeper had secured the attention of the assembly  what i said ill prove he added vehemently get up and tell them how he played you custer  his companion waved his hand  ill do that in the first place and when ive got through ill do a little more i went to maverick most two weeks ago when my stomach was sour and he gives me a bottle for a dollar  hes perfectly correct so far except that he hasnt produced the dollar yet thorne assented i should like to point out that i can cure the kind of sourness he said it was every time but i cant do very much when the troubles in the mans sour nature you took that stuff i gave you the day you got it custer  i did i was powerful sick next morning  he turned to the crowd speaking in a tragic voice  boys hed run out of the cure i wanted and gave me the first bottle handy with a wrong label on ive no use for a man who doses you with stuff that makes your inside feel like it was growing wool  there were delighted cries at this but custer appeared perfectly serious and thorne looked down at him  no he drawled in your case it would grow bristles  the laugh was with him now but it was a moment or two before custer who was evidently slow of comprehension quite grasped the nature of the compliment which had been paid him the term hog is a particularly offensive one in that country then he proceeded to clamber up into the wagon and thorne addressed those among his listeners who stood nearest it  hold on to him just a moment he cried and two men did as he directed i merely want to point out that our friend has supplied the explanation of the troublehe said he was sick the next morning well as my internal cure is a powerful one there are instructions on every bottle to take a tablespoonful every six hours which would have carried him on for several days its clear that he felt better after one dose which encouraged him to take the lot for the next one  he has probably hit it commented farquhar they do it now and then  now continued thorne to the men below you can let mr custer go if its the only thing that will satisfy him ill get down  youll get down sure bawled custer if youre not out when im ready ill pitch you  farquhar started his team  ive no doubt sergeant had the thing fixed beforehand but im inclined to fancy that custer will be sorry before hes through anyway well get on  he had driven only a few yards when his wife looked at him with a smile  was it a very great selfdenial harry  since you ask the question im afraid it was laughed farquhar  then i wont mind very much if you get down and see that they dont impose on mavyi mean too many of them i dont want him to get hurt if it can be prevented  farquhar swung himself over the side of the wagon  its hardly probable the boys like mavy but as sergeant has one or two toughs among the crowd ill go along  mrs farquhar smiled at alison as she drove on  one mustnt expect too much she said after all if he comes home with a swollen face it will be in a good cause  alison made no comment she was slightly disgusted and her pride was somewhat hurt she had made a friend of this man perhaps she thought too readily and the fact that he had laid himself out to amuse the crowd and had as the result of it been drawn into a discreditable brawl was far from pleasant she was compelled to confess on reflection that he could not very well have avoided the latter but it was equally clear that he had not even attempted it indeed she had noticed that he jumped down from his wagon with a suspicious alacrity  half an hour later a fast team overtook them and farquhar alighted from a twoseated vehicle he smiled at his wife as he sat down beside her  there was very little trouble he announced mavys friends kept the toughs off and i believe hell sell out everything he has in his wagon  and custer  i dont think he can see quite as well as he could an hour agoas one result replied farquhar dryly  then he flicked the team and they drove on faster into the dusk that was creeping up across the prairie  the next morning alison was standing in the sunshine outside the house when thorne drove into sight from behind the barn which cut off the view of one strip of prairie he got down from his wagon and appeared disconcerted when he saw the girl who fancied that she understood the reason for he had a discolored bruise on one cheek and a lump on his forehead  i want a few words with farquhar he explained i saw him at the settlement last night but i couldnt get hold of him  no returned alison disdainfully you were too busy then something impelled her to add you dont seem a very great deal the worse for your exploit  thorne leaned against the side of the wagon though she noticed that he first pulled the brim of his soft hat lower down over his face  that fact doesnt seem to cause you much satisfaction he observed  why should it  well let that pass on the other hand theres just as little reason why you should be displeased with me  are you sure that i am displeased inquired alison suspecting his intention of leading her up to some definite expression of indignation this would as she realized be tantamount to the betrayal of a greater interest in his doings than she was prepared to show  your appearance suggested it but well call it disgusted if you like he retorted with amusement in his eyes  it occurred to alison that as he had evidently taken her resentment for granted it might after all be wiser to prove it justifiable  then she said a scene of the kind you figured in last night is naturally repugnant to any one not accustomed to it  did it jar on mrs farquhar  no alison admitted i dont think it did  then shes not accustomed to such scenes either rows of any kind really arent very common in western canadabut she seems to have more comprehension than you have  this was turning the tables with a vengeance and alison was a trifle disconcerted for instead of standing on his defense the man had unexpectedly proceeded to attack  do you care to explain that she asked  ill try thorne replied genially perhaps because shes married mrs farquhar seems to understand that there are occasions when a man is driven into doing things he has an aversion for in a way its to his credit when he recognizes that the alternative is out of the question can you get hold of that  im not sure you see you suggest that there may be an alternative  its often the case the difficulty is that now and then the consequences of choosing it are a good deal worse than the other thing  alison could grasp the gist of this there was something to be said for the resolution that could boldly grapple with a crisis as soon as it arose instead of seeking the readiest means of escape from it  now added thorne i was quite sure when the storekeeper appeared on the scene that he had hired the biggest tough in the settlement to make trouble for me of course i could have backed down or at least i could have tried it but the result would naturally have been to make the opposition more determined on the next occasion it seemed wiser to face the situation then and there  again alison felt that he was right and she shifted her point of attack  you wish to assure me that it was with very great reluctance you jumped down from your wagon last night  thorne laughed softly  no he acknowledged if one must be honest i cant go quite so far as that  the girl was a little astonished at herself in spite of his last confession her disgustthough she felt that was not the right wordwith his conduct had greatly lessened and she was conscious of a certain curiosity about his sensations during the incident  you were not in the least afraid she asked  no but after all thats no great admission you see with most of us what we call courage is largely the result of experience now i knew i was a match for sergeants tough the man is big but he has only a hazy notion when to lead off and how to parry  how did you know thatfrom experience  oh no returned thorne smiling i once watched him endeavoring to convince another man that he was utterly wrong in maintaining that the country derived the least benefit from the liquor prohibition laws he succeeded because the other man didnt know any more than he did  alison laughed  after all i dont think the subject is of very great interest i wonder why you went to so much trouble to explain the thing to me  the man gazed at her a moment in somewhat natural astonishment and then he took off his wide hat ceremoniously though as a smile crept into his eyes she could not be sure whether it was done in seriousness or whimsically in any case he spoiled the effect by remembering his bruised face and hastily clapping it on again  may i say that i should like to retain your favorable opinion if its possible he replied and leaving his team plucking at the grass he turned away and entered the house as it happened farquhar had just come in for dinner which was not quite ready and thorne sat down opposite him  if your wife has no objections i want you to do me a favor harry he said  his host expressed his readiness but mrs farquhar looked at him inquiringly  its just this he explained you deal with grantly at the railroad settlement and its possible that he may not have formed a very accurate opinion of my character in fact i shouldnt wonder if odd things the boys have said have prejudiced him against me  its quite likely farquhar admitted with a grin  then i want you to assure him that im a perfectly responsible and reliable person  mrs farquhar laughed outright  arent you asking rather more than harry could consistently do  well thorne replied thoughtfully it might serve the purpose if he told grantly that i generally paid my bills i dont ask him to guarantee my account or back my draft it wouldnt be reasonable  it wouldnt assented mrs farquhar with uncompromising decision are you going to make some new venture  i have a hazy notion that i might take up a quartersection and turn farmer  his hostess flashed a significant glance at her husband who smiled  but why  if you dont get your crop hailed out droughted or frozen you can now and then pick up a few dollars that way thorne explained besides a farmer is a person of acknowledged status on the prairie  have you any other reasonsmore convincing ones  thorne regarded his hostess with undiminished gravity  if i have they may appear by and bywhen for instance ive doubled my holding and raised a record crop on three hundred and twenty acres  it isnt done in a day warned farquhar  it depends on how you begin and commencing with a tent a span of oxen and one breakerplow doesnt appeal to me i want a couple of horse teams the latest implements and the best seed i can get my hands on  i guess my word alone wont induce grantly to let you have themstill ill do what i can  thorne spread out his hands  if anything more is wanted hunter will be given an opportunity for supplying it i dont see any reason why i shouldnt distribute my favors  and when does the rash experiment begin  thorne straightened himself in his chair  it wont be an experiment if i take hold which isnt quite certain yet ill stay with the thing  then he broke into his usual careless laugh  ill take a long drive round all the outlying settlements and work off a last frolic first  yes observed his hostess the carnival before lent  after that she proceeded to lay out dinner and they let the subject drop but alison who entered the room just then wondered why mrs farquhar flashed a searching glance at her     chapter vii  a useful friend   thorne drove away after dinner and for it must be admitted that he preferred other peoples cookery to his own he contrived to reach the hunter homestead just as supper was being laid out one evening some days later during the meal he announced his intention of staying all night but he did not explain what had brought him there until he sat with his host and hostess on the veranda while dusk crept up across the prairie he felt inclined to wonder why mrs hunter had favored them with her company for he supposed that it was not altogether for the sake of enjoying the cool evening air this surmise as it happened was quite correct she had another purpose in her mind for since alisons visit she had taken a certain interest in the man  is there anything keeping you about the bluff she asked at length i hear you have been in the neighborhood several days  four said thorne if one must be precise for one thing there seemed to be a good demand for gramophones for another i wanted a talk with elcot and somebody said he was in at the railroad yesterday  i suppose you want to borrow a team from him again  no thorne replied tranquilly in this case my object is to borrow moneyor at least i want to raise it in such a way that if i dont meet my obligations your husband will be liable  he turned toward his host  do you think you could guarantee me to the extent of say a thousand dollars  if its merely a question of ability i believe i could whether it would be judicious is quite another matter what are you going to do with the money  thorne explained his purpose much as he had done to farquhar and hunter listened with quiet amusement  the whim might last a month and then thered probably be an auction of your stock and implements and we would get word that you had gone off on the trail again he said a quiet life wouldnt suit you you tried it once with bishop and its generally understood that you turned his house inside out one day during the winter you spent with him  theres just a little truth in that thorne confessed bishops a nice man but he has the most exasperating ways and one would need more patience than i have to stand them try to imagine itthree months of improving conversation and undeviating regularity breakfast to the minute the kettle to stand always on the same spot on the stove the potato pan on another your boots must be put in exactly the same corner  its unthinkable laughed mrs hunter we once had him here for a day or two but what was the particular cause of trouble  her husband smiled  house cleaning i believe bishop undertakes it systematically once a month in the winter  oftener interjected thorne that is when the temperatures high enough for him to wash the floor  it wasnt high enough on the day in question hunter proceeded but i understand that he insisted on putting his furniture outside so that he could brush the place thoroughly and thorne told him to get the door open and stand carefully clear  well mrs hunter prompted  thorne fired the things you see as quick as he could lift them first the chairs and table then the whole outfit of plates and cups and pots and pans when he got halfway through bishop who was horrorstruck made a protest thorne told him he would have the things put out and out they were going  mrs hunter laughed and addressed her guest  did you get a bump on your forehead on that occasion still i suppose one could manage it by falling out of a wagon  i didnt replied thorne for any further particulars about this one im afraid you must apply at the settlement but it seems to me that the subject im most anxious to talk about is being tactfully avoided  when you have so many friends up and down the prairie why did you come to elcot  your husband explained thorne unblushingly has the most money each will however be provided with an opportunity for contributing according to his ability ill borrow a team from one and a plow from another the man who cant spare either can lend me a mower in addition to this ill have to arrange a second loan  do you mean to stay with it hunter asked  give me a show and ill convince you thorne assured him with a sudden intentness in his eyes im dead serious now  hunter looked at him quietly for a minute or two before he answered  then he said ill guarantee you for a thousand dollars payable after harvest  thorne thanked him and presently strolled away to get something out of his wagon when he disappeared florence turned to her husband  elcot she protested you are going to throw every dollar of that money away  im far from sure of it returned hunter quietly  in any case its only a few days since you told me you couldnt face the expense when i said that i wanted to spend a month in toronto this spring  i should like to point out that you spent a good deal of the winter in montreal  would you expect me to live here altogether  hunter made a gesture of weariness  i did expect something of that kind once upon a time im sorry you have made it clear that i was wrong  florence favored him with a mocking smile  after all you have stood it rather well its only during the last few months you have been getting bitter but thats beside the question why are you so willing to waste on that man the money you cant spare for me  to begin with im by no means certain that ill have to pay it theres good stuff in him and i want to give him an opportunity for becoming a useful citizen in the next place the line must be drawn somewhere and the crop im putting in wouldnt stand the cost of a spring in toronto if its to be anything like the winter in montreal  florence saw that he meant it and changed the subject for there were times when she realized that it was not advisable to drive her husband too far after a while he strolled away toward the stables in search of thorne and a few minutes later they sat down together on the summit of a low rise hunter lighted his pipe and resting one elbow in the grass lay smoking thoughtfully for a while before he spoke to his companion  mavy he said you are going to do what would be the wisest thing in the case of the average manbut im not wholly sure it would be that in yours after all theres a good deal to be said for the life you lead  it will hurt a little to give it up thorne acknowledged but isnt there something to be said forthe other kind  hunter pointed with his pipe to where the rise ran into the birches  i spent my first summer as a farmer in a tent yonder and in several ways it was the happiest one ive ever known i couldnt cook and as a rule when i unyoked my oxen after the days work i was too played out to light a fire i lived on messes that would probably kill me now and my clothes went to bits before the summer was halfway through but i was bubbling over with aspirations and a wholehearted optimism then i had scarcely a dollar but i had what seemed betteran unwavering belief in the future it was just as good then to lie down healthily tired and listen to the little leaves whispering in the cool of the dusk as it was to get up with the dawn without a care fit and ready for what must be done  oh yes assented thorne i know they never cast a stove in a foundry that would give you the same warmth as the red fire in the birch bluff and the finest tea that goes to russia wouldnt taste as good as what you drink flavored with wood smoke out of a blackened can then theres the empty prairie with the long trail leading on to something you feel will be better still beyond the horizon silence space liberty how they get hold of you  then what do you expect instead of them when you give them up  it strikes me that you should be able to tell me  hunter smiled in a rather weary fashion and glanced back toward his house  well he said ive a place thats generally supposed to be the smartest one within sixty miles and some status in the country whatever it may be worthmy wife sees to that the grits would make me a leader if i cared for politics  then why dont you your wife would like it  i think you ought to know we both escaped from the cities and while you drive your wagon i follow the plow men like you and i have nothing to do with wirepullers tricks juggling committees and shouting crowds its my part to make a little more wheat grow  thorne looked at him with a thoughtful face  i wonder he said why you want to prevent me from doing the same  i dont i only want to warn you that if you make a success of it you cant own a house and land and teams without facing the cost  and that is  unconditional surrender in a little while theyll own you its probable that youll add a wife to them and then unless shes a woman of unusual courage youll find yourself shackled down to half the formulas you have run away from  still you get something in return  yes assented hunter slowly im optimist enough to believe thatbut its an elusive quantity i suppose it depends largely on what you expect  he stood up and emptied his pipe  its getting late and i have to start again at six tomorrow  they went back to the house together and thorne drove away early the next morning soon after midday hunter set out for grahams bluff where he had some business when he had gone florence carried a bundle of papers out to a little table placed in the shadow on the veranda and sitting down before it looked at them with a frown most of them were bills which she had once half thought of showing to her husband though she had not done so chiefly because the bankbook which she had recently sent up to be balanced revealed the fact that there was then just eighty dollars standing to her credit as florence seldom filled in the counterfoils of the checks she drew this information had been a painful shock to her it was evident that she had spent a good deal more money in montreal than she had supposed and that she could not pay the bills and there was no doubt that her husband would be signally displeased  as a rule he was very patient she was willing to own that though she now and then did so with a certain illogical irritation at his complacency but when it was a question of money he could be inflexible he had however treated her liberally and to save her the necessity of applying to him he paid so many dollars into her bank twice a year and within that limit left her to control the domestic expenses as she pleased this indeed was what chiefly troubled her for there should have been enough to her credit to carry her on until harvest when the next payment would be made this however was unfortunately not the case there was no doubt that she had to grapple with a financial crisis  she added up the bills several times and signally failed to make them any less though it was now perfectly clear that it would not be advisable to show them to her husband thrusting them aside she leaned back in her chair and presently decided with the renewal of an existing grievance that the situation was the result of elcots absurd retiring habits if he would only go about with her now and then or bring a few smart people out in the summer she might be able to take pleasure in less costly diversions and to some extent at least avoid extravagance on the other hand however there were as she had already realized one or two reasons why it seemed just as well that elcot should stay at home he now looked very much like a farmer though he had not been reared as one and she fancied that his rather grim reserve which was broken now and then by attacks of sardonic candor was scarcely likely to be appreciated in the world she visited as a matter of fact his own relatives with whom she sometimes stayed were in the habit of smiling significantly when they mentioned him he had it seemed flung up excellent prospects when in spite of his familys protests he went west with very inadequate means as a prairie farmer that he had succeeded was she understood largely due to the fact that an eccentric relative who agreed with him had subsequently died and left him a few hundred dollars  in the meanwhile these reflections brought her no nearer a solution of the difficulty there was a big deficit and she had no idea how she was to meet it then she remembered that when she was married elcot had among other things settled a certain strip of land on her he had failed to interest her in its management though she was pleased to receive the proceeds of its cultivation which he handed her after each harvest they were sowing again now and she had heard that it was possible to sell a crop or at least to raise money on it in some way beforehand she determined to question nevis who carried on a general business at the railroad settlement about the matter when he next drove over which he had said he would probably do during the next day or two he might even turn up that afternoon and as elcot was out of the way she wished he would he was a man of prepossessing appearance and easy manners and he had now and then paid her a deferential homage which was not unpleasant indeed she had once or twice contrasted him with elcot and the comparison had not been altogether in the latters favor  half an hour later he drove up in a light buggy and handed the horse over to one of the teamsters then he walked up on the veranda where florence was still sitting with the bills before her turning around when he had greeted her he pointed to the plodding teams which moved down the long furrows that ran back from the house  i didnt see elcot at work with the boys as i drove by he said  he is away and probably will not be back until after supper  im sorry i cant wait so long nevis replied taking the chair to which she pointed anyway it isnt a matter of much importance and ill try to call again  florence sent for some tea though it is seldom that refreshments of any kind are provided between the regular meals on the prairie and then leaned back in her chair watching him while he sat with his cup in his hand he was as she had decided on other occasions a wellfavored man darkhaired and darkeyed and as usual he was artistically dressed the hat he had laid on a neighboring chair was a genuine panama such as mexican halfbreeds spend months in weaving his rather tight lightcolored clothes were excellently cut and once more it struck her with a sense of injury that it was a pity elcot insisted on attiring himself as his teamsters did  i had half expected to find you gone he said you mentioned a visit to toronto when i last saw you after all if your husband can spare you it must be nice to get away you must feel that you are rather wasted here  this was a point on which florence was convinced already and she did not in the least object to his mentioning it  elcot she replied dryly has his farm  well responded nevis im glad you havent gone the rest of us can badly spare the one bright light which shines upon our primitive obscurity  his hostess did not check him the man was usually rather daring and she seldom resented a speech of this kind no matter from whom it came  in any case i am not going she informed him thatshe pointed to the bundle of papersis the reason  bills permit me  before she could prevent it he took them up and flicked them over then he turned and looked at her with a smile in his dark eyes  on examination of them im inclined to think the reasons a good one  florence recognized that he had ventured further in the last few minutes than elcot would have done in a month before he married her and though she was not greatly displeased she changed the subject for a time  what did you want to see my husband about she asked  im anxious to disarm his opposition to the part i feel like taking in the bluff creamery scheme im willing to back the experiment on reasonable terms but i understand that elcots dubious about permitting it and thorne has been advising the boys to have nothing to do with me rough on a man whos ready to finance them isnt it  florence did not care whether it was rough or not except that she would have liked to spend double her husbands income financial questions seldom interested her  i suppose you wish to do it to encourage themout of philanthropy she suggested with a yawn  nevis laughed goodhumoredly  you can put that question to your husband or thorne im willing to confess that in these affairs im out for business pure and simple though that doesnt prevent my taking an interest in my friends difficulties now and then he tapped the bills with his fingers you are at present short of three hundred dollars  im short of nine hundred corrected florence with candor  the next question was difficult in fact it was one that could not well be put directly and the mans voice became judiciously sympathetic  wheat sold badly last fall and elcot has no doubt his share of worries he suggested you naturally wouldnt like to add to them  they looked at each other and florence was quite aware that he would go a little farther as soon as he had ascertained whether she had any intention of mentioning the deficit to her husband she also recognized that the fact that she had drawn his attention to the bills would make this seem improbable  im not sure that im so unselfish she said with a laugh in any case im independent i dont care to bother other people with my troubles  the man leaned forward looking at her as though begging a favor  i suppose it hasnt occurred to you that such a course might be a little rough on some of them do you never make an exception  i havent done so yet  then said nevis eagerly if youll try it in this instance ill tell you what ill do the things in my line of business and ill find those nine hundred dollars for you  florence sat silent watching him for a few moments she meant to agree and though she quite realized that general opinion would have regarded this as tantamount to placing herself in the mans power that did not trouble her she had never yet been in any mans power and she did not intend to be  well she consented at length but it mustnt be a favor  nevis tactfully declared that it could be done on a purely business footing with which object he suggested after a few judicious questions that she should give him an order for the delivery of so many bushels of wheat after harvest which she did that the document was most informal and merely scribbled on a halfsheet of notepaper did not seem to concern him then he wrote her out a check  i dont mind saying that im going to make eight per cent out of you which is enough to content me he explained you see i never let an opportunity go by  florence made no comment whether or not he would continue to be content with the mere interest on the money was a question with which she would be competent to deal when it arose  in a few minutes he prepared to take his departure he bowed over her hand in a manner that was not common on the prairie and she watched him with a meaning smile when he drove away     chapter viii  a fit of temper   it was two days later that nevis led his wornout horse up the side of one of the deep ravines which every here and there wind through the prairie it was then about the middle of the afternoon and almost unpleasantly hot in the sheltered hollow the crest of it shut out the wind that swept the open levels and the sunshine struck down between the birches which were just then unfolding lacelike streamers of tiny leaves there were no other trees except the willows wrapped in a bright emerald flush along the banks of a little creek  nevis felt unpleasantly weary although a man of fine proportions he did not care for physical exertion and avoided it as far as possible but the commercial instinct was strong in him and he had driven a long way in pursuit of money during the last few days it was supposed that he picked up a good deal of it in the most unlikely as well as the more obvious places for he was troubled by few scruples and was endued with the faculty of getting money he was a young man evidently of excellent education though nobody seemed to know where he had received it or where he came from beginning as an implement dealer and general mortgage broker on a humble scale two or three years earlier he had extended his field of operations rapidly  it appears to be an unfortunate fact that the grip of the moneylender is firmly fastened on the small agriculturalist in many countries and strange to say perhaps more particularly in those where the soil he tills is his own in the new wheatlands of the west the possessions of the small farmers and ranchers on both sides of the frontier are as a rule mortgaged to the hilt or at least they were a few years ago they lived and no more for when the seasons vouchsafed them a bountiful harvest storekeeper land agency man or mortgage jobber usually swept the proceeds into his coffer it must nevertheless be said that many a man would be forced to abandon the struggle after an untimely frost in fall without the moneylenders help and that the latter has often to face a serious hazard which varies with the weather  nevis was halfway up the slope when his jaded horse refused to go on and he sat down on a fallen birch wondering where he could borrow another one or if this were not possible how he could reach the settlement he was then he supposed eight or nine miles from the nearest farm and it seemed very probable that even if he succeeded in reaching it every horse would be engaged in plowing he had no provisions with him and he had eaten nothing since breakfast that morning he was unpleasantly conscious of this fact for he usually lived well  a few minutes later a drumming of hoofs fell across the birches from the plain above and he saw a team swing over the brink of the declivity for a moment or two the horses disappeared among the trees but by the rapid beat of hoofs which mingled with the rattle of wheels they seemed to be coming down at a gallop nevis was aware that the prairie farmers as a rule wasted very little time in breaking young horses but harnessed them to plow or wagon as soon as they were amenable to any control at all  as the team above broke out furiously from among the trees a hoarse shout reached him directing him to pull his buggy clear but he decided to let it stay exactly where it was he fancied that the driver who could not get by could stop his team if he made a determined effort and this surmise proved correct for a minute or two later thorne braced backward on the drivingseat looked down at him with a wrathful face  what did you stop me for couldnt you get out of the way he asked  why were you driving at that breakneck pace  a jackrabbit bolted right under voladors feet ill get on again if youll move your buggy  nevis sat still  are you open to earn a few dollars  it depends replied thorne on what im expected to do and whom theyre coming from  im anxious to get hold of somebody wholl drive me to the settlement this horse is played out  in that case im not open im too busy  ill give you your own price for your time it will probably pay you better thanselling mirrors  thorne noticed the halfcontemptuous stress upon the last words  you should have been content with the reason i offered he retorted as you were not ill give you another im not a very particular person but i shouldnt like to touch your money  nevis stood up with a laugh of halfveiled malevolence  do you think that kind of thing is wise  i havent troubled to ask myself the question ive never been remarkably prudent and when i saw that you meant to hold me up my first impulse was to drive smash into your buggy it was only out of regard for the horses that i didnt do so  is there any particular reason for this gratuitous insolence  there are two explained thorne in the first place i dont like being stopped on an open trail and in the next ive spent the last few days borrowing things for a friend of mine whom you pitched out on to the prairie with his wife and child  nevis smiled  i might have guessed it was something of that kind youre rudimentary and havent the crudest notion of what you have up against you it would be about as sensible for one of your horses to start kicking because it didnt like your style of driving  that returned thorne is just where youre wrong ive no complaint against human nature in general or the way this countrys run my dislikes are concentrated on a few particularly obnoxious people who live in it of whom youre one youre a discredit even to the profession which you follow  its not as dangerous to the people i deal with as yours is nevis retorted  well let that pass ive already stopped here talking with you longer than i care about will you pull your buggy out of the way  nevis felt a strong inclination to let the buggy remain where it stood it was galling to be spoken to in that fashion by a wandering pedler and even more annoying to be left stranded nine miles from anywhere with a wornout horse but a glance at the lean determined face of the man on the drivingseat of the wagon decided him and he drew his rig aside then thorne looked down again  theres one thing you can do and thats to unyoke the beast and hobble it and then strike for taylors on your feet he advised the walk will probably do you good if only by convincing you that it doesnt pay to drive a horse to the verge of exhaustion  he swung his whip and the team plunged forward down the declivity with the wagon jolting and rattling behind them two or three hours later he pulled up in front of farquhars homestead where as he informed its owner he meant to stay the night and when the dusk was closing in he sat with the others on the stoop  did you meet anybody on the trail mrs farquhar asked  nevis answered thorne genially i believe i insulted him anyway i meant to but hes tough in the hide and im half afraid i wasnt quite up to my usual form  but why did you want to insult him  well replied thorne with an air of reflection i think it was his clothes that irritated me  his clothes alison broke in  thorne turned to her with a smile  yes he said unreasonable isnt it still you see the man was so immaculately neat from his tie which was a marvel to his very elegant pointed shoes i dare say hell find them most uncomfortable before he has walked nine miles in them  but why should that annoy you  if you mean the thought of his limping across the prairie for miles and getting very hot and dusty it certainly didnt if you mean his apparel too much neatness always acts as a red rag on me and in this case the manner in which he was got up seemed symbolical it hinted that only the best of everything would content him and that he meant to get it no matter what it cost anybody else there was his horse for instance played out foul with dust and thirstywith a creek close by hed driven the poor brute almost to death the last few days sooner than cut out a single visit to any one he wanted to see about the creamery  we have got to head him off that scheme declared farquhar and his wife joined in again  havent you some other grievance against him  if another one is needed theres langtons case answered thorne the mans a crank of course which is partly why i like him and he has some eccentric notions about farming but he has paid nevis his interest for quite a while besides buying everything he used from him at double prices and now the first time the moneys not forthcoming hes sold up nevis turned him out with his wife still ailing and the child  mrs farquhar started with a flush of indignation in her face  its the first ive heard of it why didnt you send us word  langtons rather out of your district and the boys have fixed him up they got a few things together and hes camped in a tent on government land i believe theyre going to build him a sod and birchpole house  i suppose interjected farquhar you were somewhere about  thats certain laughed his wife who went round and got the tent and the other things you mentioned mavy  thorne smiled  as soon as they heard of it the boys brought them in  alison cast a quick glance at him he was quite devoid of selfconsciousness and it was evident that he took the thing lightly but she fancied that there were strong chivalrous impulses in this humorous vagabond which would on due occasion lead him to ride a reckless tilt against overwhelming odds in the cause of the helpless and oppressed her heart warmed toward him as it had done once or twice before but she said nothing and it became evident that mrs farquhar shared the thought that was in her mind  mavy she cautioned im afraid youll get yourself hurt some day by doing more than is wise or needful nobody could find fault with you for helping langton but you should have stopped at that insulting men like nevis just because they dress well or for other reasons is apt to lead to trouble  then farquhar broke in and alison recognized that he meant to follow his wifes lead  it was langtons misfortune that he wouldnt fall into line he said if he had he wouldnt have been forced to borrow money from nevis for instance what has the electrical tension in the atmosphere he used to fret about to do with ones harrowing anyway unless it brings down rain and why must he cut his prairie hay two or three weeks after all his neighbors have theirs in  he says he likes it thoroughly ripened thorne answered with a laugh still i cant see why a man should be hounded down because he wont do exactly what everybody else does what do you think miss leigh  its rather a pity but im afraid men of that kind generally have to pay replied alison that is unless theyre very strong and fortunate and then they lead what was supposed to be a craze of theirs becomes a desirable custom and the others humbly copy them  and if the others wont questioned farquhar  even then its perhaps just as well there are a few men with the courage of their convictions who will couch the lance in the face of any opposition that can be brought against them and ride right home there must be something in their fancies and the stir they make clears the air stagnations unwholesome  mrs farquhar regarded her severely  you shouldnt encourage him its quite superfluous hed charge a locomotive any day with pleasure she said  well laughed thorne you will no doubt be consoled to hear that ive come into line there are now one hundred and sixty acres of virgin prairie recorded in my name and i believe a carload of sawed lumber and general fixings will arrive at the station in the next few days when they do ill borrow your wagon and hired man to haul them out though ill have to camp in a tent until i get my first crop in  farquhar and his wife looked astonished and both laughed when he gravely reproached them for not believing that he would carry out the project which he had already mentioned then the two men strolled away toward the barn together and alison was left with mrs farquhar the prairie was wrapped in shadow now and a halfmoon was rising above its eastern rim it was very still and there was a wonderful freshness in the chilly air looking out upon the vast sweep of dusky grass it seemed to alison that this wide country gave one clearness of vision and breadth of character  does thorne really mean to turn farmer she asked at length  it looks as if he does answered mrs farquhar why shouldnt he  i cant think of any reason replied alison still it isnt what i should have anticipated what can have influenced him  i have a suspicion that he means to get married he couldnt expect his wife to set up housekeeping in a wagon though for that matter i dont know whether he lives in the vehicle or camps on the ground beside it  alison knew however and on the whole she was glad that it was too dark for her companion to see her face clearly it was for no very ostensible reason not exactly pleasant to think of thornes getting married at all the idea of his being willing to contemplate marriage so to speak in the abstract as the men who went to winnipeg for their wives did was repugnant to her and the alternative possibility that he had somebody in particular in view already afforded her no great consolation  i suppose he wouldnt have very much trouble if that was his idea she said with a trace of disdain  no responded mrs farquhar there would be very little trouble in leslie thornes case whatever that man may lack it wont be the love of women  it occurred to alison that there was truth in this she could even confess that the mans lighthearted manner his whimsical generosity and his daring appealed to her  he doesnt seem to get on very well with florence hunter she said reflectively  mrs farquhar laughed  i think i may tell you a secret which mavy has never guessed he could have got on a good deal better with mrs hunter had he been anxious to and she hasnt forgiven him because he didnt realize it  alison started and a warmth crept into her face but her hostess proceeded  i dont mean very much by that mrs hunter merely wished toannexhim to command his respectful homage which he was quite ready to pay her as elcots wife though that wasnt quite what she intended theres an unpleasant streak in that womans nature  alison sat silent a moment or two for she was forced to confess that this sounded correct  but florence can have no complaint against her husband she objected he seems to indulge her and treat her generously  thats half the trouble was the answer some day shell wear his patience out and then hell take the other wayand theyll get on better afterward however thats a matter that doesnt concern us she paused a moment with a smile anyway im glad you decided to come to me  thank you said alison quietly  she had never regretted her choice the work she had undertaken was certainly not what she had expected to do when she came to canada and she smiled as she remembered the indignation her mother had expressed concerning it in her last letter but her duties were not unpleasant and she was growing fond of the unassuming but very sensible people with whom she dwelt their view was narrowed by no prejudices and they disdained pretense they toiled with cheerful courage and were as cheerfully willing to hold out an open hand to the stranger and the unfortunate the latter fact was once more made evident when farquhar followed by thorne strolled up to the door  i think ill start off at sunup and drive over to see how langtons getting on he said i couldnt very well be back the same night but youll have miss leigh with you  of course assented his wife smiling it was only yesterday that you declared you didnt know how you were going to get through with the sowing i suppose youll want to take a few things along with you  thorne produced a strip of paper and handed it to her  i cant always trust my memory he explained  they went into the house where a light was already burning and mrs farquhar glanced at the paper with a smile  well she said i suppose i can manage to let you have about half of what you ask for then she turned to alison as soon as he mentioned the matter i expected this     chapter ix  the raising   one afternoon when the prairie was flooded with sunshine and sprinkled with a flush of tender green farquhar drove his wife and alison up to thornes new holding a tent with loose curtain flapping in the breeze stood on a slight rise with sundry piles of boards and framed timber lying on the grass about it while thorne and a young lad stood beside a fire above which a fourgallon coaloil can hung boiling his face was smutted and there was grime on his hands while near him smoke was issuing from a beehiveshaped mass of soil which mrs farquhar informed alison was an earth oven  the girl waited behind a few moments when her companions greeted thorne looking about her with some curiosity an oblong of shattered clods almost hidden by the fresh green blades of oats stretched across the foreground and beyond it there was the usual vast sweep of grass on one side of the plowed land however a thin birch bluff in full leaf straggled up the rise and a little creek of clear water wound through a deep hollow not far away the situation she decided was an attractive one then she glanced at the piles of timber which seemed to be arranged in carefully planned order and surmised from the quantity of sawdust strewed among the grass that a good deal of work had been done on it by somebody there was also a row of birch logs evidently obtained from the bluff with notches cut in them and a heap of thin strips of wood which had a sweet resinous smell these were redcedar roofing shingles from british columbia  alison strolled forward and joined the group about the fire  it will be a couple of hours yet before the boys turn up and considering everything its just as well thorne was explaining still the bread ought to be ready and id be glad if somebody would get it out to cool i want the oven for the chickens  where are they mrs farquhar inquired  thorne suddenly stooped over the big coaloil can  i was almost forgetting them theyre here dave should have fished them out some time ago  alison glanced into the improvised cauldron and saw to her astonishment what looked like a mass of bedraggled fowls  oh she cried have you boiled them with their feathers on  well replied thorne somewhat ruefully i certainly didnt mean to in fact i put them in to bring their feathers off though ive hitherto generally done it beneath the blowdown valve of a thrashing engine  he turned to his young companion  be quick fish them out  the lad did it with a strip of shingle and when a number of dripping birds were strewed upon the grass alison was more astonished still  where have their heads gone she exclaimed  ill leave dave to tell you that i believe its his first attempt at dressing fowls chuckled thorne i just sent his employer word that i wanted chickens and this is how they were brought  the lad colored for he was very young  jackson drove off as soon as hed told stepney and me to get them he explained were both of us just out from toronto and we didnt know how to set about the thing he paused and looked at alison i dont mind admitting that neither of us enjoyed it but it had to be done  i must add that he told me he made stepney use the ax laughed thorne  i had to hold them anywayand that wasnt very much better retorted the lad  thorne turned to farquhar  youll have to pluck i dare say mrs farquhar and miss leigh will get out the bread and what crockery there is the boys will probably bring some plates and things along with them that is if theyre wise  he moved away and alison sat down on the grass and laughed  i believe he can cook better than i can but hes primitive in some respects she commented shall we all have to use the same things if the boys dont bring the cups  oh no mrs farquhar assured her hell no doubt provide a few old fruit cans anyway you must not expect too much of him he has been working his fingers off for the last six weeks and as there has been moonlight lately its very probable that he has cut himself down to an hour or twos sleep perhaps you havent noticed that it shows on him  as a matter of fact alison had done so she had seen very little of thorne for the last few weeks and now it struck her that his face was leaner and browner than it had been and that there were signs of tension in his eyes then she glanced at the strip of plowed land and the piles of timber  has he done all that she asked  most of it anyway some of the boys helped him when they could which wasnt very often i believe he has done about twice as much as harry considered possible ive an idea that mavy is going to open his neighbors eyes  alison glanced at the empty prairie and wondered where the neighbors lived but just them mrs farquhar called her to the oven which she opened with a spade and they raked out several big and somewhat blackened loaves after that they proceeded to the tent and busied themselves laying out the provisions it contained  it was an hour or two later when the guests arrived in dusty rigs of various kinds and different stages of decrepitude and alison noticed that those who were accompanied by their wives and daughters also brought baskets with them they were evidently acquainted with the limitations of bachelor housekeeping for the most part however the new arrivals were young men deeply bronzed and wiry though one whom they seemed to regard as leader had a lined face and grizzled hair he gathered them round him when the horses had been unyoked and tethered  boys he said you havent come here just for fun though youre going to get that later in the first place you have to earn your supper he turned to thorne will you send us to our places and tell us what to do  no replied thorne id rather leave the thing to the best man on the ground ill take my orders from him and stand in among the crowd  the elder man made a sign of acquiescence for he now knew where he stood and etiquette was satisfied he and thorne walked round and examined the piles of timber then he sent the men to their places one with a hammer here two or three with long steelshod poles there another with a saw at a corner and the rest spread out in a row  now he directed if youre ready well get the house on end the girls are watching you  they went at the work with a rush and the little oblong marked out upon the prairie sod became alive with toiling figures tall birch posts rose as by magic with struggling men thrusting with the long pikepoles beneath them stringers plates and ties seemed to fly into place and alison sitting on the grass with mrs farquhar wondered as the skeleton of the house grew moment by moment before her eyes she had never thought it possible that a dwelling could be built in a night but the men were clearly on their mettle and they worked with an almost bewildering activity they were on the ground one minute hauling ponderous masses of timber and the next climbing among the framing were standing with one foot on a slender beam or crawling along another on hands and knees there was a constant thudding of axheads on wooden pegs a sharper ringing of hammers on heavy nails curt orders broke through the clatter of boards and the persistent crunch of saws still there seemed to be no confusion each man knew exactly what to do for though houses are by no means invariably raised in this fashion on the prairie some of the men had learned their work in the bush of michigan and some in ontario when the hammers clattered more furiously and the skeleton became partly clothed there were cries of encouragement from the women  jake will have that plate pinned down before your spikes are in called one  are you going to let the boys from across the creek get ahead of you protested another  a third ran forward with both hands full of nails  theyre catching you up she shouted get them in i cant have the laugh put on my man  husband sweetheart and brother responded gallantly and the pace became faster still until at length thorne shouted and waved his hand  were through its time to quit he said youve done most twice as much as i ever figured on your getting in tonight  they had worked willingly but it was evident that most of them were as willing to stop hammers saws and axes were flung together and the men stood in groups hot and gasping in the early dusk thorne walked up to their leader  i can only say thank you though that doesnt go far enough he said what makes the thing seem more to me is that i havent the least call on one of you  there was a murmur of denial and then they waited until he turned to mrs farquhar though he addressed the company generally  now he invited ill ask you to come in and look at my place  he moved on ahead with mrs farquhar while the others fell in behind but it seemed that the selection he had made did not satisfy all of them for there was a laugh when somebody cried  she has got a good man already it isnt a square deal  then and how it came about alison was never sure though she had a suspicion that her employer must have connived at it mrs farquhar either moved or was quietly pushed aside and she and thorne were left to cross the threshold together at the head of the company this appeared to please his guests for there was further laughter when another voice cried  its the first time didnt they teach you manners in the old country mavy whats the matter with giving her your arm  alison was conscious of a certain embarrassment but she moved on quietly and shot one swift glance at thorne he was looking up at the beams above him of which she was glad for she was wondering whether the others attached any particular significance to the fact that she was the first woman to enter his new house with him dismissing the question as troublesome she glanced about her and saw the roof framing cutting black against the soft blue of the night overhead the house she supposed would eventually contain four rooms two on the ground floor and two above and though only the principal supports had been placed in position yet she once more wondered how the man and his companions had accomplished so much  what you have done is really astonishing she exclaimed i suppose you had everything ready but even then you are not a carpenter or a builder  thorne laughed  the fact that i can sell patent medicines to people who havent the least use for them ought to be a guaranty of my ability to do anything in reason  hes not quite right interposed farquhar appearing from behind them in a general way the man whos smart at business is good at nothing else most of those who are couldnt hammer a nail in anyway mavy hasnt the least bit of the true commercial instinct in him  havent i thorne appealed to mrs farquhar is there another man round here who could start off for a months drive and sell out most of a wagonload of mirrors and gramophones  no laughed mrs farquhar i dont think there is but thats not quite the point the proof of commercial ability lies not in the sales but in the margin after them and you never seemed to get much richer by your efforts you dont sell your things because youre a smart business man but because the boys like you  the rest had evidently heard her for there were cries of assent and alison was conscious of a little thrill of sympathy when thorne turned to his other guests  i should be a proud man if i were quite convinced that that is right  they assured him of it and there was no doubt about their sincerity a few minutes later they trooped out again when somebody announced that supper was ready there were neither chairs nor tables and though the dew was falling they sat down on the grass while a full moon that had sailed halfway up the heavens poured down a silver light on them the crockery proved insufficient and husbands and wives or sweethearts shared each others cups but they made an astonishing feast for the inhabitants of that land eat with the same strenuous vigor with which they work and live  in the meanwhile alison became interested in watching the women they were not very numerous and one and all were dressed in garments that were obviously the work of their own fingers they were not bronzed like the men and even in the moonlight it struck her that their faces lacked the delicate bloom of the average englishwomans skin their hands were hard and in most cases reddened but for all that there was a brightness in their eyes and an optimistic cheerfulness in their manner which she fancied would hardly have characterized such an assembly in the old country  then she noticed that one young woman sat at thornes side not far away and that they seemed to be talking confidentially she could not be sure that they had not one cup between them and this possibility irritated her the girl she confessed was not ungraceful although slighter and generally straighter in figure than most young englishwomen and she had rather fine hair it shone lustrously in the moonlight and there were golden gleams in it there was also no doubt that she had fine eyes alison could think of no reason why thorne should not talk to whom he liked but she was in spite of this not pleased with what she had noticed  after a while somebody tuned a fiddle and when they began dancing on the grass alison realized that most of them danced very well thorne led her out once but he seemed preoccupied and soon afterward he and the girl she had already noticed once more drew apart from the rest alison watched them sitting out two dances in the shadow of the house and she felt curious as to what they had to say to each other as a matter of fact thorne was looking at his companion very thoughtfully just then  lucy he said im afraid what jake has done is going to get him into trouble  i tried to make him see that but he said as theyd seized his homestead he couldnt stay here and he allowed that one way or another hed paid off all he owed the girl replied nevis put up all kinds of charges on him and bled him dry the past few years  of course he did assented thorne still thats not likely to count for a great deal in his favor the trouble is that they could jail him for selling off those cattle after he got notice of foreclosure what made him do it  lucy looked down  you may not have heard that we were to have been married most three years ago but my father said jake must wipe off his mortgage first when he died he left us nothing but the teams and implements and mother and i tried to run the place with a hired man but weve been going back ever since and jake was getting deeper in debt all the while  thorne made a sign of sympathy  now that nevis has shut down on him i suppose hes going away to work on the new branch line until he can get hold of another place farther west and send for you  yes returned lucy slowly now you understand the thing or anyway most of it only and she looked up at him with appealing eyesjake hasnt got very far yet and we had word that the police troopers are out after him  where is he  lucy turned and pointed toward the bluff  yonder  thorne started but he sat still again rather grim in face and his companion went on  he hasnt a horse he got out in a hurry with no provisions and if he went into the settlement for some it would put the troopers on to his trail she laid a hand on thornes arm mavy youre sure not going to let them get him  if id a grain of sense thats just what i would do as i havent i suppose i must try to get him off well it would be better for several reasons that jake shouldnt see me but if youll stuff a basket with eatables ill quietly drive a horse round toward the bluff while youre getting the things together ill have another dance  he led out a flushed matron and when at length he left her breathless only alison and one other person saw him slip away over the edge of the hollow through which the creek flowed there was something in the way he moved that aroused alisons curiosity and she walked forward a few yards until she reached the crest of the slope from which she saw him saddle one of the two hobbled horses that browsed apart from the rest she wondered why he did so but it was some relief to notice that the girl he had spoken to was not with him and when he moved on again toward the bluff she turned back to where the others were  he reappeared a few minutes later and claimed a dance which she gave him and some time had passed when a drumming of hoofs grew rapidly louder and two shadowy figures materialized out of the prairie then the music stopped as a couple of mounted police drew bridle in front of the astonished guests one who carried a carbine across his saddle threw up his hand commandingly  is jake winthrop here he asked  no answered thorne who strode forward he certainly is not corporal slaney  have you seen him tonight  i havent was the quiet answer  then said the corporal you may be surprised to hear that he was seen heading for this bluff two or three hours ago and that we struck his trail where he crossed the creek not a mile back  he turned in his saddle and looked at the others  can you give me any information  their faces were clear in the moonlight and alison felt that they at least had nothing to conceal but the corporal did not look quite satisfied with the assurances they offered him addressing two or three one after another he interrogated them sharply  ill have to trouble you to lead up your horses boys he said at length  they did it with some grumbling and when the corporal was convinced that not a beast was missing he turned to thorne  you keep a team here dont you  oh yes replied thorne carelessly though he had dreaded this question  the corporal swung round and looked at his companion who had quietly slipped away for a few minutes when they first rode in  theres one beast hobbled by the creek announced the trooper i can see no sign of the other  the corporal looked at thorne  do you feel like making any explanation  no if you have anything against me ill leave you to prove it  the corporal then turned to one of the guests  you rode in where did you put your saddle  on the ground with the rest  can you produce it  no admitted the man i may as well allow that i cant if the trooper has been round counting them  the corporal looked at him steadily  well he said what we have to do first of all is to pick up winthrops trail its quite likely well have a word for thorne and you later  he spoke to his companion and they rode out across the prairie when they disappeared thorne called to the fiddler to strike up another tune and the dance went on again     chapter x  thorne resents reproof   farquhar was sitting with his wife and alison on the stoop in the cool of the evening a week or two after the houseraising when thorne rode up out of the prairie leading a second horse he tethered the two beasts to a fence before he approached the house and alison noticed that he looked very lean and jaded he sat down wearily and flung off his hat when he had greeted the party  ive come to borrow your mower farquhar he announced i suppose i may as well get some hay in  you dont seem very sure about it remarked farquhar  as a matter of fact im not enthusiastic about cutting that hay ive been putting in sixteen hours a day lately and i expect im getting a little stale among other things id got most of the shingles on the house when one of the boys came along and told me id fixed them wrong then the police have been round again worrying me  have you got your horse back asked mrs farquhar  yes replied thorne with a soft laugh it was found near the railroad a day or two after it disappeared and a friend of mine sent it along i understand however that corporal slaney has failed to pick up winthrops trail  mrs farquhar regarded him severely  why did you mix yourself up in that affair  the thing rather appealed to me declared thorne i believe jake was justified ethically and anybody who takes a way thats not the recognized one has my sympathy  now youve reached the point farquhar laughed on the whole the fact you mention is unfortunate  im not sure thorne answered moodily plodding along the lauded beaten track now and then palls on one and it isnt the least bit easier than the other anyway i only did what i had to lucy said she had counted on me  this last confession which he seemed to make in a moment of forgetfulness stirred alison to a sense of irritation that astonished her a little  were you compelled to help a defaulting debtor escape she demanded i understand that is what winthrop is  if you knew the whole story you would hardly call him that thorne retorted with an indignant sparkle in his eyes  but he borrowed money on his cattle among other things didnt he and then sold them and ran away when the man who lent it to him wanted it back  he did thorne assented with some dryness im sorry i must confess it because a baldly correct statement of the kind you have just made which leaves out all extenuating details is often a most misleading thing  how can a statement of fact be misleading  farquhar smiled and thorne made a grimace  the aspect of any fact varies with ones point of view you evidently cant get away from the conventional one  alison was growing angry though subsequent reflection convinced her that this was not due to his last observation she had sympathized with his attitude when he had in the first instance mentioned his dislike of nevis and his willingness to side with the injured against the oppressor had certainly pleased her in the abstract it appeared wholly commendable but in particular that it should have led him to take up the cause of a girl against whom for no very clear reason she felt prejudiced was a different thing  well she responded it has by degrees become evident to society in general that it can only look at certain matters in a certain way and if you insist on doing the opposite you must expect to get into trouble im not sure you dont deserve it too  that returned thorne grimly is their idea in england and i must do them the justice to own that they act up to it i had however expected a little more liberalityfrom you anyway im not in the least sorry for what ive done  he rose and turned toward his host  hadnt we better get that mower farquhar  they strolled away thorne leading his team and mrs farquhar laughed  mavys very young in some respects im almost afraid you have succeeded in setting him off again  is the last remark warranted  mrs farquhar nodded  he has been sticking to what he probably finds a very uninteresting task with a patience i hardly thought was in him just now hes no doubt ready for an outbreak  an outbreak  ill say a frolic it wont be anything very shocking though i should expect it to be distinctly original  alison made a sign of impatience  isnt it absurd that he should fly off in this unbalanced fashion because of a few words  one mustnt expect perfection and it wasnt altogether what you saidthat merely fired the train mavy has been going steady for an unusual time and as a rule it doesnt take a great deal to drive him into some piece of rashness for instance he was quite willing to involve himself in trouble with the police at a word from lucy calvert  she fancied from alisons expression that this was where the grievance lay but the girl made no comment and they sat silent for a while until farquhar came back alone  mavys gone off with the mowerhe wouldnt come back he explained in fact he seemed a little out of temper  farquhar was correct in this surmise thorne was somewhat erratic by nature and any insistence on the strictly conventional point of view even when it was backed by sound sense usually acted upon him as a red rag after all he could not help his nature and he had been reared in an atmosphere of straightlaced respectability which had imposed on him an intolerable restraint what was perhaps more to the purpose he had been demanding too much of his bodily strength during the last two months and had been living in a spartan fashion on badly cooked and very irregular meals until at length his nervous system began to feel the strain that being so he felt himself justified in resenting alisons censorious attitude though it was not the mere fact that she had disagreed with what he had done that he found most irritating it was he knew because she had disappointed him he had regarded her as a broadminded clearsighted girl emancipated from the petty prejudices and traditions which were the bane of most young englishwomen and now he had discovered that she was as exasperatingly narrow as the rest of them  it was late when he reached his homestead and after sleeping a few hours he rose with the dawn and lighting a fire left the kettle to boil while he clambered to the roof to nail on cedar shingles he could not however get them to lie as he wanted them and being very dry they split every now and then as he drove in the nails besides this it was difficult to work upon the narrow rafters and when at length he descended for breakfast he found that the fire had gone out in the meanwhile he surveyed it and the kettle disgustedly with brows drawn down and then restraining a strong desire to fling the vessel into the birches he sat down and fished out of the congealed fat in the fryingpan a piece of cold pork left over from the previous day this with a piece of bread that had acquired a rocky texture from being left uncovered formed his breakfast and when he had eaten it he went back moodily to the roof he had for some time in a most determined manner concentrated his energies on a task generally regarded as a commendable one in that country but there was no doubt whatever that it was beginning to pall on him  he lay up on the rafters for several hours with a hot sun blazing down on his neck and shoulders while he nailed on shingles but in spite of every effort things would go wrong nails slipped through his fingers he dropped his hammer and had to climb down for it while every now and then a shingle he had just secured rent from top to bottom finally in a state of exasperation he struck a vicious blow at a nail which had evaded his previous attacks and hit his thumb instead this was the climax and he savagely hurled the hammer as far as he could throw it out upon the prairie then he swung himself down and walking resolutely to his tent dragged out a box containing about a dozen small cheap mirrors there were a few gramophone records in another box and after putting both cases a blanket or two and a bag of flour into his wagon he drove away across the sweep of grass at a gallop the horses which had done nothing worth mentioning for the last few weeks seemed as pleased with the change as he did  the next morning a man who was passing farquhars homestead pulled up his team to deliver its owner a note  mavy sent you this he said with a grin guess hes out on the trail again he had the boys sitting up half last night at the bluff hotel  farquhar read the note which was curt  thanks for the mower better go for it if you want the thing it ran im off for a change of air and havent the least notion when im coming back ive discovered that one has to get seasoned to a quiet life  going back into the house he handed the note to his wife who was sitting with alison at breakfast and she gave it to the girl in turn when she had read it  its too bad though i must say i expected it she remarked regarding her with reproachful eyes  if he has a singularly unbalanced nature can i help it alison asked  her companion appeared to consider  i dont know which to be most vexed with you or lucy he would be quietly cutting prairie hay now if you had both left him alone  farquhar watched them with a smile  mavy he observed will in all probability require a good deal of breaking in but thats no reason why one should despair of him ive known a young horse turn out an excellent hauler and go steady as a rock in double harness after in the first place kicking in the whole front of the wagon  why double harness his wife inquired with a twinkle in her eyes  well replied farquhar perhaps i was anticipating things  he lounged out and alison went on with her breakfast with an expressionless face though mrs farquhar noticed that she seemed preoccupied after that  three or four days later thorne sat on the veranda of a little wooden hotel after supper a couple of men lounged near him smoking and in front of them a double row of unpicturesque framehouses straggled beside the trail that led straight as the crow flies into a waste of prairie  ive had a notion that jake winthrop would look in here thorne remarked presently  one of his companions glanced round toward the house but there did not seem to be anybody within hearing just then  he did he confided baxter once worked with him on the railroad and jake crawled up to the back of his shack at night baxter gave him a different hat and a jacket  thats quite right said the other man i figured the troopers would know what he was wearing i drove him quite a piece toward the railroad early in the morning and ive a notion he got off with a freighttrain that was taking a crowd of boys from down east to do something farther on up the track if he did he must have jumped off quietly when they stopped to let the pacific express by next thing two or three troopers turned up and i guess they heard about the train and wired up the line but they havent got winthrop yet corporal slaney who sent two of them south is in the settlement now hes plumb sure that jakes hanging round here waiting to make a break for the u s boundary  what had he on when he first struck you thorne inquired  baxter told him and he laughed  then he declared slaneys trailing a man with an old black plug hat and a brown duck jacket the latter would certainly fix him as blues much more common now if he saw that man riding south at night hed probably call off the troopers and theyd work the trail right down to the frontier as they wouldnt get their man theyd no doubt give the thing up deciding hed already slipped across  but hows he going to see him when jakes up the track  it strikes me there ought to be a black plug hat and a brown duck jacket somewhere in this settlement drawled thorne ill leave you to find them  a light broke in upon his companions and they laughed but one of them pointed out that thorne might find himself unpleasantly situated if corporal slaney overtook him thorne however smiled at this  ive been driving easy the last few days and its hardly likely the police have a horse that could run volador down he said besides if he should press me too hard i could lose my man somehow in the big bluff on the mountain  they agreed with this and proceeded to elaborate a workable scheme suddenly baxter turned to thorne as though a thought had just struck him  why do you want to do it he asked jake winthrop wasnt a partner of yours  thorne broke into a whimsical smile now that he endeavored to analyze his reasons calmly he was conscious that none of them appeared sufficient to warrant any action at all on his part he was only certain that he disliked nevis and that an anxious girl had not long ago looked at him with an appeal in her eyes  since you ask me the question i dont quite know he confessed  baxter laughed and turned to his comrade  hes a daisy sure anyway ill look round for a hat and jacket like the one i burned you get him a saddle murray  thorne left them presently and drove away toward a ravine some miles from the settlement and soon after he started baxter saddled a horse and rode out to an outlying farm in the meanwhile corporal slaney sauntered into the general room of the hotel where murray and several others were then sitting smoking there was a box of crackers a sodawater fountain and a bottle of some highly colored syrup on one table but that was all the refreshment the place provided  seating himself in a corner the corporal sat unobtrusively listening to the conversation which murray presently turned into a particular channel for his especial benefit it was a hot evening and he sat astride a bench clad only in blue shirt and trousers with a glass of sodawater in front of him and a pipe in his hand a big tin lamp burned unsteadily above him for all the doors and windows were open and a hot smell of dust and baked earth flowed into the room the walls were formed of badly rent boards and there was as usual no covering on the roughly laid floor  as ive often said he observed the police will never get another man like old sergeant mackintyre he ran his man down right away every time  slaney pricked his ears and another of them broke in  mackintyre would have had jake winthrop jailed quite a while ago the boys arent up to trailing now  seems to me they didnt want winthrop much drawled murray they went prowling round the homesteads worrying folks who didnt know anything about him while he hit the trail for the frontier  a third man turned to slaney  didnt you send two of the boys off dakota way corporal  we did answered slaney shortly thats about all im open to tell you  two troopers couldnt cover a great deal of prairie remarked another guess he might have slipped through between them that is if hes not hanging round here somewhere waiting for a chance to break away  murray saw the gleam in the corporals eyes and he broke in again  now he said when you think of it thats quite likely after all theres three or four big bluffs a man could hide in and if he was stuck for a horse he wouldnt care to try the open if he lay by a while he might fix it up with somebody to bring him one of course he might have got away up the track but theyd wire on to watch the stations didnt you do that corporal  we did slaney answered  murray turned to the others  then one would allow that winthrop couldnt have cleared by train if hed done that theyd sure have got him he paused and hearing a beat of hoofs added thoughtfully it looks mighty like he was still in the neighborhood  something in slaneys expression suggested that he shared this opinion but the drumming of hoofs was growing louder and a man strolled toward the doorway  its baxter he announced  a few minutes later baxter came in flushed and dusty and helped himself at the sodawater fountain before he turned to the others with a cracker in his hand  its powerful warm boys and ive had a ride for nothing he informed them been over to lortons place and he wasnt in  hes at cricklewoods said murray if youd waited a little you would have met him on the trail  i didnt anyway was baxters indifferent reply i only met a stranger  corporal slaney had no reason to suspect that the brief conversation which had followed baxters arrival had been carefully prearranged for his benefit  where did you meet that stranger he asked  about two miles east of the bluff  did you speak to him  baxter smiled  i didnt he didnt give me a chance he was going south as fast as his horse could lay hoofs to the ground  what was he like did you see him clearly  well drawled baxter its only a halfmoon and the man wasnt very close but i think hed a black plug hat as most of us wear gray ones that kind of struck me ive a notion that his overall jacket was brown  he sat down as slaney vanished through the open door in a few moments there was a clatter of hoofs and the men crowding about the entrance saw a mounted figure riding at a gallop down the unpaved street then murray looked at his comrade with a grin  must have had his horse saddled ready he chuckled weve fixed the thing     chapter xi  an escapade   the night was still and clear when thorne rode out of the ravine in the hollow of which he had left his wagon and one hobbled horse reaching the level he drew bridle and sat still in his saddle for a minute or two looking about him the dew was settling heavily on the short wiry grass which shone faintly in the elusive light with patches of darker color where his horses hoofs had passed ahead the prairie rolled away a vast dimly lighted plain to the soft dusky grayness which obscured the horizon and he knew that somewhere beyond the dip of the latter stood the mountain a broken stretch of higher ground covered with birches and willows where if corporal slaney held on so long he must endeavor to evade him  volador seemed fit and fresh for which he was thankful for it was nearly twenty miles to the mountain and he was after all a little uncertain about the speed of the policemans horse though the appearance of the beast which he had seen in the hotel stable did not suggest any great powers in this respect it was however not the one slaney usually rode which he fancied might perhaps be significant at length he leaned down and patted voladors neck  youll have to go tonight old boy he said  the beast responded to his voice and a shake of the bridle and they set off southward at a trot the moon already hung rather low in the western sky and he calculated that in another couple of hours it would have dipped beneath the grasslands rim by then he should reach the mountain and the darkness would be in his favor if he had not already outdistanced his pursuer it was in a singularly buoyant mood that he rode quietly on and it was reluctantly that he checked the horse which once or twice attempted to gallop after the last few months of prosaic and unremitting toil the prospect of a mad night ride and the zest of the hazard attached to it proved strangely exhilarating to one of his temperament he admitted that as winthrop was not a particular friend of his there was no reason why he should have undertaken the thing at all but he remembered the appeal in lucy calverts eyes and that and the lust of a frolic was sufficient for him there are men of his kind who in their hearts at least never grow old  he had covered two or three miles when he saw a mounted man following the trail to the settlement and he rode on across the trail with a wave of his hat he did not feel inclined for conversation and everything had already been arranged the mounted figure presently sank out of sight again and he pulled volador up to a slow walk he would give baxter half an hour to reach the settlement and put slaney on his trail and there was no use in wasting his horses strength in the meanwhile  it was nearly an hour later and he was riding slowly a lonely moving speck in the center of a great level waste whose boundaries steadily receded before him when a faint drumming of hoofs came out of the silence then he pulled volador up altogether and sat still listening for a while until he felt sure that his pursuer who was apparently riding hard would hear him he did not wish the man to draw too close but it would on the other hand serve no purpose if he rode south unless slaney followed him it seemed only reasonable to suppose that once the police decided that winthrop had got safely away to dakota they would abandon the search for him in western canada  then something in the sound which was rapidly growing louder struck him as curious and he listened more closely with a frown for it was now becoming evident that instead of one pursuer he had two to deal with which was certainly not what he had desired or expected touching volador with his heels he let him go and for five or six minutes they fled south at a fast gallop with a thud of hoofs on sunbaked sod ringing far behind them then he pulled the horse up with a struggle and listened again he was at length certain that the police had heard him and were following as fast as possible there was no cover until he reached the mountain nothing but an open wilderness unbroken by even a ravine or a clump of willows and he must ride  once more he let volador go and the cool night air streamed past him whipping his hot face and bringing the blood to it while long billowy rises came back to him looking in the uncertain moonlight like the vast undulations of a glassy sea underrun by the swell of a distant gale each time he swung over the gradual crest of one a rhythmic staccato drumming became sharply audible and sank again as he dipped into the great grassy hollows volador seemed fresh still which was consoling for there was no doubt that the sound of the pursuit was as clear as it had been this was a fresh surprise  half an hour passed and they swung out upon a wide high level where for the first time he twisted in his saddle and looked behind him he could see rather more plainly than he cared about two dim figures spread out well apart on the verge of the plateau and it was evident that they were not dropping behind it would he recognized lead to unpleasant complications if they overtook him he raised a quirt he had borrowed but reflecting he let his arm drop again after all it might be desirable to let volador keep a little in hand then he glanced to the westward and was pleased to see that the moon was rapidly nearing the rim of the plain it would be dark when he reached the mountain  volador was flagging a little when at length they swept up the slope of another rise on crossing the top of this thorne was conscious of a difference in the drumming of hoofs behind one of the pursuers was clearly falling back which was satisfactory though he fancied that the other man was still holding his own then he saw away in front of him a blurred mass with an uneven crest which cut dimly black against the sky it stretched broad across his course and he struck volador with the quirt for he recognized it as the mountain and knew that he must ride in earnest now a mounted man would make a good deal of noise descending the ravines which seamed it and smashing through the undergrowth beneath the birches and it was desirable that he should reach their shelter well ahead of the troopers  the horse responded gallantly but the beat of hoofs which he longed to get away from grew no fainter and when five minutes had flown by he plied the quirt again he was very hot and somewhat anxious but the moon was now near the verge of the prairie it was large and red and already the light was failing though a long black shadow still fled beside him across the dewy grass  at last he fancied he was drawing ahead and a mad fit came upon him as they went flying down a rugged and broken slope to a watercourse while the mountain rose higher and blacker ahead stones clattered and rattled under them clouds of light soil flew up and then there was a great splashing as the horse plunged through the creek after that the pace grew slower as they faced the ascent and he swung low in the saddle when they sped in among the birches a branch struck him in the face and swept his hat away but it had done its work and he decided that he was better rid of it  a semblance of a trail that dipped into hollows and swung over rises led through the mountain though as a rule any one riding south skirted this thorne had already decided that he must leave it somewhere as quietly as possible and let corporal slaney go by he could not hear the trooper now and this was reassuring for he would have to stop soon and he did not wish his pursuer to notice that the noise in front of him had suddenly ceased  two or three minutes later however the sound he was beginning to dread once more reached him breaking in upon the crackle of dry sticks under his horses hoofs and the crash he made as he now and then blundered into a brake or thicket it was very dark in the bluff he could scarcely see the spectral trunks of the flitting trees and to pick the way or avoid the obstacles around which the trail here and there twisted was out of the question he faced the hazards as they came and rode savagely but the thud of pursuing hoofs and the smashing and crackling which mingled with it sounded very close when he reached the brink of a ravine which he understood it was almost impossible to descend on horseback to dismount would however as he realized entail his capture and setting his lips tight he drove the failing horse at the almost precipitous gully they plunged down with soil and stones sliding and rattling after them splashed into a creek and were halfway up the opposite side when a second clatter of falling stones was followed by a heavy downward rush of loosened soil then there was a dull thud and afterward a curiously impressive silence  thorne pulled up his badly blown horse and twisting in his saddle looked back across the ravine he could see nothing but a shadowy mass of trees which stood out dimly against a strip of soft blue sky he could feel his heart beating and the deep silence troubled him indeed it was with difficulty that he refrained from shouting to the fallen man but he reflected that as he had now and then spoken to slaney the latter would probably recognize his voice then he heard the man get up and the sounds which followed indicated that he was urging his horse to rise thorne once more tapped volador with his quirt  a hoarse cry rang after him commanding him to stop but this was on the whole a consolation for it did not seem likely that slaney was badly hurt if he could shout and thorne rode on with a laugh he scarcely supposed the policemans horse would be fit for much after a heavy fall but there was another trooper somewhere behind who might turn up at any moment he purposely rode through a brake or two in order that the crackle of undergrowth might make it clear that he was going on and then when some time had passed and there was no sign of any pursuit he turned sharply off the trail and headed into the bush it soon became necessary to dismount and lead his horse and finally he looped the bridle round a branch and sat down wearily  he fancied that half an hour had passed when he heard an increasing sound which suggested that two mounted men were riding cautiously along the trail some distance away he could hear an occasional sharp snapping of rotten branches and the crash of trodden undergrowth as well as the beat of hoofs listening carefully he decided that the riders were pushing straight on and he was sure of it later when the sound began to die away he sat still however for almost another hour and then succeeded with some difficulty in finding the trail following it back until it led him out of the mountain he stripped off his duck jacket and flung it where anybody who passed that way could not well help seeing it and then he took out a soft gray hat he had carried rolled up in his belt clad in blue shirt and trousers he rode on slowly into the prairie the dawn found him some miles from the mountain and at least as far from any trail in the open waste reaching a ravine he lay down at the bottom of it beside a creek and ate the breakfast he had brought with him while volador cropped the grass then he went quietly to sleep  it was midday when he awakened and falling dusk when he eventually reached the ravine near the settlement where he had left his wagon and the other horse there was nothing to suggest that anybody had visited the place in his absence and after making an excellent supper he lay down again inside the vehicle with a sigh of content everything had gone satisfactorily and it was most unlikely that winthrop would be further troubled by the police he did not know much about the extradition laws but it was generally believed that when a man once got across the frontier the troopers contented themselves with notifying the authorities and nothing further was heard of the matter unless the fugitive were guilty of some very serious offense a good deal of the boundary then ran through an empty wilderness and it was difficult to trace any one who managed to reach the settlements on its southern side indeed it was seldom that a determined attempt was made  early on the following morning thorne set out for his holding and on the day after he got there he set about cutting prairie hay as a rule nobody sows artificial grasses when taking up new land but as some fodder for the teams is required it is generally cut in a driedup sloo where the water gathers in the thaw in such places the grass grows tall and as it rapidly ripens and whitens in the sun all the farmer need do is to cut it and carry it home  thorne was stripped to shirt and trousers besides being grimed all over with dust when looking around for a moment he saw mrs farquhar and alison in a wagon not far away a black cloud of flies hovered about his head and followed his plodding horses while a thick haze of dust rose from the grass that went down before the clanging mower he stopped however and looked around with a tranquil smile when mrs farquhar pulled up her team  you seem astonished to see me he said  mrs farquhar turned and pointed to the long rows of fallen grass  im certainly astonished to see all that hay down  i wonder quizzed thorne if you intended that to be complimentary you see i rather cling to the idea that i can do as much as other people when im forced to it  you must have had the team out at sunup and have made the most of every minute since laughed mrs farquhar  it looks like it unless i had them out the previous evening  you hadnt declared alison and her companion broke in again  she is quite right you were not here yesterday it was partly to satisfy her curiosity that harry drove round to see  thorne fancied that alison was not exactly pleased with this statement but she made no attempt to contradict it  what strikes me most she said is the fact that you look as if you had never been away  that returned thorne is the impression i wished to give people now that ive had my frolic i want to forget it its a natural desire on the whole im sorry you took the trouble to ascertain that ive just come back  the question is what have you been doing while you were absent asked mrs farquhar severely  selling things most of the time its another example of what you can do if you try id given up half a case of tarnished mirrors as quite unsalable and somehow or other i got rid of every one of them  anything else  well replied thorne with a thoughtful air i had a rather pleasant ride in fact i feel so braced up by the whole trip that i expect i shall be able to go on steadily for another few months at least  and then alison inquired  thorne looked at her with a twinkle in his eyes  oh he said if any of my friends make too persistent attempts to reform me its quite possible i shall go off on the trail again  i dont think you need anticipate any further trouble of that kind alison assured him  thorne turned to mrs farquhar  may i drive over to supper tomorrow evening id like a talk with harryamong other things  of course responded mrs farquhar as a matter of fact though i dont suppose it would have much result i should like a talk with you in the meanwhile well get on it wouldnt be considerate to keep you back when youre seized by a fit of sensible activity  she drove away with the clang of the mower following her and a few minutes later she smiled at alison  hes very far from perfect and thats probably why he has so many friends she observed i should very much like to hear an unvarnished account of all his doings since he went away  alison though she would not confess it was sensible of a similar curiosity     chapter xii  hunter makes an enemy   the committee of the new creamery scheme were sitting in a room of the grahams bluff hotel one evening after supper when nevis laid his plan for the financing of the project before them he had come there at their invitation for that purpose and when he finished speaking they looked at one another with uncertainty in their faces there were six of them including hunter the chairman prairie farmers who had been chosen by their neighbors to decide on a means of raising the necessary capital all of them owned a few head of stock for they were beginning to raise cattle as well as wheat in that district and one or two more fortunate than their companions had an odd thousand dollars to their credit at the bank which was a somewhat unusual thing in the case of men of their calling the venture they contemplated would not have been justified now for the government has lately erected creameries where there is a reasonable demand for them in a few moments nevis a little astonished at his companions silence spoke again  you have heard my views gentlemen he said im prepared to find you half the money on the terms laid down it remains for you to decide whether you will bring my scheme before the next meetingin which case it will no doubt be adopted  still nobody said anything and he leaned on the back of a chair with a strip of paper in one hand watching them out of keen dark eyes as usual he was almost too neatly dressed in light tightfitting clothes and this and his white softskinned hands emphasized the contrast between him and his audience among the latter were one or two men of liberal education but their faces like those of the others were darkened by exposure to stinging frosts and scorching sun and their hands were hard and brown they looked what they were men who lived very plainly and spent their days in unremitting toil two indeed wore old soilstained jackets over their coarse blue shirts and there was no attempt at elegance in the attire of the others  hunter whose appearance was wholly inconspicuous sat at the head of the table with a quiet face waiting for somebody to speak though the reticence of his companions did not astonish him nevis was a power in that district and hunter had grounds for believing that three of those present were in his debt this made it reasonably evident that they would not care to offend a man who was generally understood to be an exacting creditor hunter had their case in his mind when at length he spoke  mr neviss scheme seems perfectly clear on the face of it and we have now to make up our minds whether well support it or not if none of you have any questions to put well ask him to excuse us for a few minutes while we consider the matter and vote on it i would suggest a ballotto be decided by a simple majority  a gleam which hunter noticed crept into neviss eyes and hinted that the suggestion did not meet with his approval it is possible he had expected that some of the men would not care to vote against him openly  that said one briefly strikes me as the squarest way ill second the proposition  well assented nevis i wont embarrass you if you want to talk it over you can send for me when you want me ill go down for a smoke  there was less reserve when he withdrew and they discussed his plan guardedly without arriving at any decision until hunter laid six little strips of paper and a pencil on the table  well vote on the schemethe words for or against will be sufficient without your names he said  each wrote on a scrap of paper and flung it into a hat in turn but two of them it was noticeable hesitated for a moment or so then hunter shook out the papers and counted them  its eventhree for and three against he announced since thats the case ill exercise my chairmans option its against  there was satisfaction in some of the faces and in the others uncertainty which however scarcely suggested much regret then they decided on hunters recommendation to raise what capital they could among their friends even if they had to content themselves with a smaller outlay nevis who was called in heard the result with an easy indifference  well he said i cant complain there was a risk in the thing anyway and i guess you know what you want best  he went out again and soon afterward the meeting broke up but hunter who remained after the others had gone was not astonished when nevis presently strolled into the room he sat down opposite hunter and lighted a cigar  i suppose i have you to thank for this he began  you mean the choosing of the alternative scheme how did you find out that you owed it to me  it was a difficult question put with a disconcerting quietness as it happened none of the committee had informed nevis that the matter had been decided by the chairmans vote and he was naturally reluctant to admit that three of them were under his influence  i didnt find out he answered i assumed it  on what grounds  this was still more troublesome to parry as it appeared quite possible to nevis that if he furnished hunter with a hint of the truth the latter would find means of getting rid of men who might under pressure be tempted to betray the confidence of their comrades he was beginning to realize that the plain brownfaced farmer with the unwavering eyes was a match for him which was a fact he had not suspected hitherto though he had been acquainted with him for some time then hunter smiled significantly  well let it pass he said i dont mind admitting that you were correct in your surmise the thing turned upon my vote and i gave it against your scheme what follows  it was not a conciliatory answer but it at least furnished nevis with the lead he desired  your decision isnt quite final yet he declared you have to report it to a general meeting and a good deal will depend on whether you merely lay your views before those present or urge them upon them now as my proposition isnt an unreasonable one ill ask you right out what your objections to it are  i havent anyto the scheme as you say its reasonable and it would save our raising a good deal of money  nevis was not particularly sensitive but something in his companions manner brought the blood to his cheek  then you object to mepersonally will you explain why  since you insist replied hunter to begin with we propose to start the creamery for the benefit of the stockraising farmers in this district and several things lead me to believe that if you once get your grip on the management it will in process of time be run for your benefit exclusively that is one reason i voted against your scheme and im rather glad the decision rested with me becausehe paused a momenti at least dont owe you any money  nevis with difficulty repressed a start at this if hunter was not in his debt his wife undoubtedly was and something might be made of the fact by and by in the meanwhile he was keenly anxious to secure an interest in the creamery once he could manage it he apprehended no insuperable difficulty in obtaining control but he could not get the necessary footing in the face of hunters opposition  it strikes me were only working around the point and shifting ground he said what makes you believe i dont mean to act straight  what happened in langtons and winthrops case  nevis sat silent a moment or two there was a vein of vindictiveness in him but he was avaricious first of all and he could generally keep his resentment in the background when it was a question of money  are you a friend of either of them he asked  not exactly but i took a certain interest in winthropi liked the man in fact i helped him out of a tight place once or twice and might have done it again only that i realized the one result would be to put a few more dollars into your pocket thatand hunter smileddidnt seem worth while  it was a straight deal i lent him the money at the usual interest he couldnt have got it cheaper from anybody else  hunter looked at him in a curious manner and nevis wondered somewhat uneasily how much this farmer knew he had been correct as far as he had gone but he had as he recognized left one opening for attack when he had foreclosed on winthrops stock and homestead there are exemption laws in parts of canada which to some extent protect the small farmers possessions from seizure for debt unless he has actually mortgaged them winthrop had done this but the mortgage was not a heavy one and nevis had afterward lent him further money with the deliberate intention of breaking him when the value of the possessions pledged greatly exceeds what has been advanced on them which is generally the case it is now and then profitable to foreclose even though any excess above the loan realized at the sale must ostensibly be handed to the borrower there are however means of preventing him from getting very much of it and though the process is sometimes risky this did not count for much with nevis  well said hunter quietly im not sure that what you tell me has any bearing on the matter  this might mean anything or nothing and nevis determining to force an issue leaned forward confidentially  lets face the point he replied i want a share in this creameryi can make it pay theres only you who really counts against me i may as well own it now cant we come to terms somehow i merely want you to abandon your opposition and you would have no difficulty in preventing my doing anything that appeared against the stockholders interests  ive already made up my mind that it would be safer to keep you out of it  thats your last word  yes i dont mean to be offensive its a matter of business  his companion took up his hat he had failed as indeed he had half expected to do but he bade hunter goodevening tranquilly and went out with strong resentment in his heart henceforward he meant to adopt an aggressive policy and the farmer who had thwarted him must stand upon his guard this decision however was largely prompted by business reasons for nevis had now no doubt that hunter who was looked up to as a leader by his neighbors would use his influence against him in other matters besides the creamery scheme unless something could be done to embarrass or discredit him the farmer he thought was open to attack in two waysthrough his wife and through the defaulting debtor he had befriended  when hunter walked out of the hotel a few minutes afterward he also was thinking of winthrop he found thorne harnessing his team  did winthrop ever show you his mortgage deed or any other papers relating to his deal with nevis he asked  no answered thorne i was only in his place three or four times why do you ask  theres a point in connection with it that occurs to me but i dare say he took them with him  hunter paused and flashed a quick glance at his companion  do you know where he is  i dont as a matter of fact i dont want to though its possible that i could find out the trouble is that if i made inquiries it might set other peoplenevis for instanceon his trail  yes assented hunter theres a good deal in that on the whole it might be wiser if you kept carefully clear of the thing particularly if corporal slaney feels inclined to move any further in the matter well as ive a long drive before me i must be getting on  he turned away toward the stables and thorne grinned cheerfully he had a respect for the astuteness of this quiet steadyeyed farmer and he was disposed to fancy that nevis would share it before the struggle which he forecasted was over what was more he was quite ready to act in any way as hunters ally and he believed that between them they could give the plotter something to think about  it was getting dark when hunter reached home and found his wife waiting for him in the general living room she was evidently a little out of temper  you are very late she said i suppose you have been to one of those creamery meetings again  hunter sat down where the lamplight fell upon his face and there was a trace of weariness in it  yes he answered i had to go on the whole im glad i did  a crisis of some kind you havent been increasing your interest in the scheme  no replied hunter with a smile not in money anyway you will no doubt be pleased to hear it  i am retorted florence if you had been ready to give those people anything they asked for it wouldnt have been flattering youre not remarkably generous where im concerned  hunter made a gesture of protest  im not giving them anything at all once we make it a success i can get back the money im putting into the undertaking at any time and if i dont i expect every bit of it to earn me something  he looked around at her directly for he knew where the grievance lay  thats a very different matter from handing you a big check for your expenses in toronto or montreal  oh yes pouted florence the latter would give me pleasure  she paused and there was a sudden change in her expression  elcot she added cant you realize that now and then you can lay out money without getting anything back for it and yet find that it pays you well  the man looked at her hesitatingly he knew what this question meant and he was half disposed to yield living simply and toiling hard he had treated her generously in comparison with his means which after all were not large but he remembered that he had yielded rather often of late and that each concession had merely led to a fresh demand  theres a limit flo he said still if three hundred dollars will meet the case i might stretch a point i suppose you are determined on that visit to toronto  the woman knew that any further attempt to win him round would fail and this being so it seemed a pity to waste energy on him the three hundred dollars would by no means suffice for the purpose this in itself was unpleasant but in the fact that he could not be induced to make what appeared to be a small sacrifice for her pleasure there lay an extra sting it was perhaps a pity that she had of late given him small cause for suspecting anything of the kind  it would be better than nothing she said coldly and then leaned back in her chair in a sudden fit of impatience with him and the whole situation  i sometimes wonder how i stand with you she exclaimed  first declared the man and he spoke the simple truth but unfortunately he was not wise enough to content himself with the brief assurance still he added i have other duties  to maverick thorne and winthrop and everybody in the district generally  well replied hunter with the hint of weariness creeping back into his expression i suppose that more or less fits the case you have all along been first with me and i think i have done what i could to please youand done it willingly still there are these othersi owe them something when i came here a poor man they held out their hands to me one lent me a team another when i had no mower cut and carried in my hay and some came over night after night to build my log barn i think i should have gone under if it hadnt been for them he looked up at his wife with resolute eyes now that i can pay them back without in all probability its costing me a dollar im at least going to try  florences lips set scornfully she had no liking for the surrounding farmers they were in her estimation mere unlettered toilerssimple unimaginative brownfaced men who thought about nothing but the seasons and the price of wheat what was perhaps as much to the purpose she had a suspicion that most of them were not greatly impressed in her favor now her husband was it seemed anxious to waste his means for their benefit  elcot she asked abruptly has it never occurred to you that you could make more of your life than you are doing here  hunter faced the question humorously  it would be astonishing if it hadnt since you have suggested it more than once but the answer is in the negative this place is paying pretty well and my means would certainly not keep us in winnipeg toronto or montreal anyway not in the comfort with which after all you have been surrounded of course i might for instance try to run a store but it doesnt strike me that this would be of much benefit to you would the kind of people you like welcome you as readily if your husband were retailing hats or groceries in the neighborhood  florence knew that it was most improbable though she would not confess it instead she decided to see if it were possible to irritate him  after all she retorted there is no great difference between a storekeeper and a farmer all my city friends know what you are and i can find no fault with the way they treat me  hunter laughed as he glanced down at his hard brown hands and dusty attire  the point is that in your case the farmer husband does not put in an appearance it might be different if he did  florence looked at him in silence for a moment or two though he had been to the creamery meeting he was very plainly dressed his bronzed face and battered nails told their own tale of arduous toil in the open and there was no doubt that he looked a prairie farmer yet he was as she realized now and then well favored in a way a man who might have made his mark in a different station widely read and quietly forceful indeed his inflexibility on certain points though it sometimes angered her compelled her deference  oh she cried at length it doesnt cost you much selfdenial to stay behind its easy for you to be content you like this life  yes returned hunter quietly im thankful that i do its what i was made for however i dont wish to force too much of it on you and so ill give you a check for the three hundred dollars  he crossed the room and opening a desk sat down at it for a minute or two then he came back and laid a strip of paper on the table in front of florence  after all she conceded as i was away a good deal of last winter its rather liberal elcot  hunter without answering her went quietly out     chapter xiii  nevis picks up a clue   a week had slipped by since the meeting of the creamery committee and it was about the middle of the afternoon when nevis lay cigar in hand in the shadow of a straggling bluff it was pleasantly cool there and scorching sunshine beat down upon the prairie across which he had plodded during the last half hour and he had still some miles to go before he could reach the farm at which he expected to borrow a team he was not fond of walking but the man who had driven him out from the settlement being in haste to reach grahams bluff had set him down some distance from the homestead he desired to visit nevis found it advisable to look his clients up every now and then and see how they were getting on this enabled him to sell to those who were not too deeply in his debt implements and stores at top prices and to put judicious pressure upon the ones whose payments had fallen behind  he was however thinking of hunter as he lay full length among the grass with a frown on his face it seemed desirable to let the man who had deprived him of what looked like a promising opportunity for lining his pockets feel that it would be wiser to refrain from interfering with his affairs in future and he fancied that if winthrop whom hunter had confessed to befriending should be brought to trial it would convey a useful hint this course was also advisable for other reasons it must be admitted that the bondholder does not always come out on top especially in bad seasons and nevis had already decided that the arrest of winthrop would serve as a warning to any of his neighbors who might feel tempted to evade their liabilities in a similar fashion he was still on the absconders trail though as yet it had not led him very far  by and by he heard a soft beat of hoofs and a rattle of wheels and looking up was pleased to see mrs hunter drive around a corner of the bluff he had of late been conscious of a growing delight in her company and what was almost as much to the purpose he had partly thought out a plan of attacking her husband through her he had however too much tact to force himself on her and he lay still apparently unobservant of her approach until she pulled up the horse  what are you doing here she asked  resting replied nevis rising to his feet im going across to jordans place walkings no doubt healthy but im afraid im not fond of it  he waited to see whether she would take the hint which he had made as plain as possible and as he did so a gleam crept into his eyes florence had an eye for color and an artistic taste in dress and she was attired then in filmy draperies of a faint shimmering greenthe color of clear seawater rippling over sand they suggested the fine contour of her form and emphasized the shifting tones of burnished copper in her hair and the clearness of her eyes what she saw in his expression did not appear but she smiled at him  then if you will get in i can drive you part of the way she said graciously  nevis did not wait for a second invitation and she turned to him when he had taken his place at her side  you havent come back to call on us  no responded nevis i saw your husband at one of the creamery meetings and im sorry to own there were one or two matters upon which we couldnt agree  he watched her to see how she would receive this but she laughed  im not responsible for all elcots opinions and i must do him the justice to say that he seldom attempts to force them on me for all that i shouldnt wonder if he were right  nevis was far too astute to disparage the man he did not like openly to his wife so he made a sign of assent  yes he said thoughtfully its possible that he was in one sense he generally is elcots what one might call altruistic he has a finer perception of ethical right than the rest of us and one could fancy it occasionally makes difficulties for him indeed its bound to when he rubs against ordinary mortals whore content to look out for whats going to benefit them  his companion recognized the truth of this and as he had expected it irritated her deep down in her nature there was a hidden respect for the quiet resolute man who though he seldom proclaimed them lived in what she now and then considered too strict compliance with his principles he recognized his duty toward her and had discharged it in most respects with a conscientious thoroughness but that accomplished he had also recognized his duty to others and had unwaveringly insisted on fulfilling this in turn there as nevis had cunningly suggested lay the grievance it would have been more pleasant for her andshe confessed thisin many little ways also for him had she stood alone in his eyes instead of merely standing first there was a marked and often inconvenient distinction between the two things now and then his point of view appealed to her but more often her pride received a jar and she thought of him bitterly when he befriended his neighbors as she tried to convince herself at her expense she could she felt have loved the man and perhaps have made an unconditional surrender to him but he must first be hers altogether and think of nobody else  then nevis interrupted her thoughts with a veiled purpose and once more touched the tender spot  most of the boys think a good deal of elcot and i guess its natural he has given quite a few of them a lift now and then theres winthrop and thorne for instancehe guaranteed maverick for a thousand dollars somebody told meand now hes putting a good deal more into this creamery scheme from experience of their habits i should say he must find that kind of thing expensive now and then perhaps if one might suggest it that is why he lives as plainly as he does in a way its rather fine of him though it wouldnt appeal to me  there was no doubt that any selfdenial on her husbands part in which she might be compelled to share did not appeal to florence either but she noticed the tact with which nevis had refrained from supporting his statement by a reference to his loan or the unpaid bills  well she declared i at least believe in getting the most one can out of life  that said nevis is my own idea and it leads up to the question why you havent gone away yet have your husbands benefactions made it impossible  he had at last attained his object florence had longed for the visit and had resented the fact that elcot had not been willing to indulge her in it at any cost he had certainly given her a check but while toronto is a cheaper place than montreal three hundred dollars will not go very far in any canadian city at least when one is satisfied with only the best that is obtainable  they have certainly helped she replied curtly  nevis recognized that she would not have admitted this had she not been disposed to treat him on a confidential footing and it was clear that the indignation she had displayed in her answer was directed against her husband and had not been occasioned by his presumption  then he suggested if you really wish to go theres a way in which it could be managed though its an act of selfsacrifice on my part to further such an object  florence swallowed the last suggestion and looked at him sharply  you mean  i could find you the moneyon the same terms as the last he added the explanation hastily lest her pride should take alarm  there was silence for a moment and during it florences resentment against her husband grew stronger she was anxious for the visit but had he been poor she would have given it up more or less willingly that however was not the case for as her companion had cunningly hinted he was at least rich enough to bestow his favors on men like winthrop the absconder and the pedler thorne now she blamed him for driving her into borrowing from the man at her side  i should be glad to have it on those conditions she said at length  she pulled up the horse presently while nevis took out a fountainpen and his pocketbook and when she drove on again she held a check of his in her hand twenty minutes later he looked around at her as the horse plodded more slowly up a slight rise  i think ill get out here he said its only half a mile to jordans place you can see the house from the top  there was not a great deal in the words but florence grasped their hidden significance they conveyed a delicate suggestion that it might not be desirable for her to be seen in his company and she was quite aware that to fall in with it would imply that there was already something in their relations that must be kept concealed from their neighbors gaze for a moment she felt inclined to insist on driving him up to the homestead door and then the feel of his check in her hand restrained her she stopped the horse and smiled when he got down  thank you again she said  thats a little superfluous returned the man its a business deal but if you can spare a few minutes when you are in toronto you might manage to write a line after all i can perhaps ask that much  i wont promise florence laughed still its possible that i may make the effort  she drove away and nevis climbed the rise feeling very well satisfied he had got a firmer hold on hunter now and he meant to break ground for the next attack by picking up winthrops trail in this also fortune favored him for when he drew up his hired rig outside farquhars house on the following evening he found that both he and his wife were out alison was in however and when she said that they would probably reach home shortly he got down and sat a while talking with her on the stoop which in the summer frequently serves the purpose of a drawingroom at a prairie homestead alison had met him once or twice before and was sensible of a slight dislike toward the man though she could not deny that he was an amusing companion by and by a girl drove along the trail two or three hundred yards away in a wagon and he gazed rather hard at her  she recognized you didnt she he questioned i cant quite fix her  lucy calvert alison informed him  its rather curious that i havent seen her before as i should certainly have remembered it though i had once or twice a deal with her father  alison was conscious of a slight irritation which indeed any reference to the girl in question usually aroused in her  then she said if lucy has any say in the matter you are scarcely likely to do any further business with the family  nevis raised his eyebrows  i wonder what you mean  only that its generally supposed miss calvert was to have married winthrop whether she still intends to do so is more than i know  she was puzzled by the sudden intentness of the mans face and for no particular cause half regretted the speech  its the first time ive heard of it he said thoughtfully then he smiled anyway she cant be very wise if shes anxious to marry him  alison who had watched him closely fancied that his smile was meant to cover his interest in the information she had given him she also noticed how quickly he changed the subject and they talked about other matters until at last as farquhar did not make his appearance he stood up  ill look in another time he told her its getting late and im due at the bluff tonight  soon after he had driven away farquhar turned up with his wife and thorne and alison noticed the frown on the latters face when she informed mrs farquhar of neviss visit  im astonished that you have him here at all he broke out  why shouldnt i his hostess asked  that question returned thorne strikes me as a little superfluous considering that hes an utterly unscrupulous scoundrelly vampire still i dare say you can forgive him a good deal for the sake of his appearance  mrs farquhar laughed  the last i suppose is after all his chief offense  alison saw that this shot had reached its mark by the way thorne drew down his brows the man as she had heard had a quick temper but she was not displeased that he should obviously resent the fact that nevis had spent half an hour in her company then remembering that winthrop was a friend of thornes she felt a little guilty and when later on they all sauntered out across the prairie she drew him aside  theres something i think i should mention she said i told nevis that miss calvert was to have married winthrop he seemed unusually interested  thorne started and looked hard at her  what on earth made you do that he asked sharply did he lead up to it  no replied alison with some reluctance i dont think he did so far as i can remember i volunteered the information  there was no doubt about the mans displeasure  he certainly would be interested and im very much afraid you have made trouble but you havent told me why you did it  i spoke on the spur of the momentwithout thinking  without thinking clearly thorne corrected for all that its possible you had a kind of subconscious motive you cant deny that you are prejudiced against winthrop  alison was sensible of a certain relief and she smiled at him the man had shown some insight but he had not gone quite far enough in his surmises for it was not winthrop but lucy calvert against whom she was prejudiced  what have i done she asked if its any harm im sorry  her companions face relaxed he never cherished his anger long  well he explained im afraid you have put nevis on winthrops trail though the things not certain after all its possible that theres another reason for his interest  and that is  hes a man with a weakness for pretty faces which will probably get him into trouble by and by though hes generally supposed to be a cleverphilanderer its not quite the thing to abuse any one you dont like when hes absent but in spite of that i cant help saying that hes absolutely unprincipled and should be avoided by every selfrespecting woman  again alison smiled he had spoken strongly though he had carefully picked his words and she had little difficulty in following the workings of his mind which on the whole were amusing he had meant the speech as a warning to her  i suppose miss calvert could be called goodlooking she suggested  that answered thorne with a trace of sharpness is not quite the point shes a girl who has a good deal to contend with and is making a very plucky fight whether shes wise in being as fond of winthrop as she seems to be is another matter one that doesnt concern us anyway she has difficulties enough without it its not easy for two women to make a living out of a farm of the kind theyre running when its burdened with a heavy debt  alison could forgive him a good deal for his chivalrous pity though the fact that it was lucy calvert who had excited it still somewhat irritated her it seemed however that he had a little more to say  in any case he added im glad you told me  then he turned back toward the others and she had no opportunity for further speech with him she noticed however that he seemed unusually thoughtful during the rest of the evening     chapter xiv  winthrops letter   after breakfast the next morning alison sat sewing in a thoughtful mood she now genuinely regretted having given nevis the information about lucy calvert and in addition to this thornes reserve on the previous evening somewhat troubled her he had not thought fit to tell her what he meant to do but she was convinced that he would do something and the most obvious course would be to warn lucy against any attempt which nevis might make to trace her lover it was possible that the man might cunningly entrap her into some admission that would be of assistance to him on the other hand alison realized that thornes task was not so simple as it appeared on the face of it though quickwitted he was she suspected by no means subtle and she supposed that he would find it difficult to put lucy on her guard without betraying the part that she had played in the matter she was quite sure that nothing would induce him to let this become apparent  it was however necessary that lucy should be warned as soon as possible and alison decided that as she was the one who had made the trouble it was she who should set it right this would be only an act of justice besides which it would give her an opportunity for forming a clearer opinion of lucy than she had as yet been able to do as the result of it all she obtained mrs farquhars permission to visit the calvert homestead which was not very far away during the afternoon  in the meanwhile nevis had been considering how he could best make use of the information she had supplied him and his mind was still occupied with the question when he drove across the prairie that afternoon it was a fiercely hot day and the wide grassland which had turned dusty white again was flooded with dazzling light the usual invigorating breeze was still and neviss horse had fallen to a walk pursued by a cloud of flies when he made out the mailcarrier plodding slowly down the rutmarked trail in front of him nevis was quite aware that a prairie mailcarrier is usually more or less acquainted with the affairs of every farmer in the district he visits and he pulled up when he overtook him  whats the matter with your horse he asked isnt it stipulated that you should keep one  thats so assented the man the trouble is that you cant get a horse that wont go lame on a round like this i had to leave him at strettons an hour ago  going far nevis asked  round by mrs calverts to the ravine  nevis decided that he was fortunate but he carefully concealed any sign of satisfaction  i can give you a lift as far as the first place if you like to get in  the man was glad to do so and nevis presently handed him a cigar  do you get letters for all the farms every round  no replied his companion im quite glad i dont guess id use up two horses if i did it saves me a league or two when i can cut out some of my visits  yes agreed nevis who had a purpose in pursuing the topic one can understand that its the people back from the trail who will give you most trouble it must be a mornings ride to boytons or walthews and mrs calverts is almost as much off your round do you have to go there often  the question was asked casually with no show of interest and the mailcarrier evidently suspected nothing  most every trip the last few weeks he replied  nevis felt that the scent was getting hot he made a sign of sympathy  thats rough on you anyway if you have to pack out any weight he said some of these people get a good many implement catalogues and circulars from winnipeg no doubt  in mrs calverts case its one blamed letter takes me most a league off the trail  nevis asked no more questions they did not seem necessary he had discovered that somebody wrote to mrs calvert or her daughter once a week and he had no trouble in deciding who it must be he also remembered that letters bore postmarks and he had a strong desire to ascertain where winthrop was then located  if you like ill hand that letter in he offered im calling on mrs calvert anyway and you can go straight to the next place if you give it to me  the man hesitated a moment and then shook his head  im sorry it cant be done he said its safer to stick to the regulations and then if you have any trouble nobody can turn round on you  nevis was too wise to urge the point though he meant if it could by any means be managed to get the letter into his hands  well he assented i guess youre right in that  they drove on to the calvert homestead which was rudely built of birch logs sawed in a neighboring bluff and nevis sprang down first when an elderly woman with a careworn face appeared in the doorway the mailcarrier who followed him more slowly stood still a moment fumbling in his bag until the woman spoke to him  got something today steve  ive got it all right was the answer letter for lucy the trouble is to find the thing  nevis standing nearer the house waited until the man took out an envelope then he stretched out his hand as though willing to save him the trouble of walking up to the door but the mailcarrier either did not notice the action or was too punctilious in the execution of his duty to deliver the letter to him  here it is mrs calvert he said thank you mr nevis  he strode away and nevis turned to the woman with a smile  may i come in he asked ill leave the horse here hell stand quietly  mrs calvert made no objections though he noticed that she laid the envelope on a table across the room when he sat down  its two or three years since i was in this house he began  three corrected the woman  i suppose it is acknowledged nevis who seemed to reflect i got on with your husband pleasantly and im sorry in several ways that our connection has been broken off i dont think the thing was any fault of mine  mrs calvert did not answer at once winthrop was not a great favorite of hers and although she had made no attempt to turn lucy against him she had on the other hand not altogether sympathized with the latters views concerning her present visitor she remembered that her husband had liked the man and there was no doubt that the goods he supplied were of excellent quality nevis was certainly not scrupulous and he had treated some of those who dealt with him with harshness but he at least never descended to any petty trickery over the sale of a machine for one thing he was too clever he recognized that it was not worth his while  well he added i dont like for old friends to leave me and i decided to look you up again will you want a new binder or a backset plow this fall  well want a binder answered his hostess who was a woman of somewhat yielding nature still i guess well get it from grantly  his things are good enough though he stands out for the top price responded nevis who was too wise to disparage openly a rivals goods just now however im rather loaded up and the orders arent coming along so im making a special cut ill knock an extra four dollars off the list figure for the binder and wait for the money until you have hauled in your wheat  nobody would have suspected that he did not care in the least whether he secured the order or not or that he had long ago decided that any business he was likely to do with the woman was not worth his attention she however appeared to consider the offer  its cheap and thats a fact she said its most a pity i cant buy the thing from you  i suppose that trouble over winthrop has turned miss calvert against me  you have got it was the answer lucys mad with you she runs this place and she deals with grantly  this was the lead nevis had been waiting for and he seized upon it  if shes about id like a talk with her i might reason her out of her prejudice against me  it wouldnt be easy she drove over to the bluff but she should be back at any time now  nevis had no particular desire to see miss calvert but he had made up his mind to wait for an opportunity to examine the postmark on the letter if it could be managed taking a catalogue out of his pocket he proceeded to talk about the machines and implements described in it until at length there was a rattle of wheels outside and somewhat to his astonishment alison walked in he rose when she greeted mrs calvert and noticed that there was something which suggested hostility in her eyes when for a moment she let them rest on him  farquhars hired man brought me hes going to bagshaws place she announced i came over to see lucy but she seems to be out  mrs calvert asked her to wait a little and when she was seated nevis sat down again alison however noticed that he had now moved to another chair which was nearer the table than the one he had previously occupied and she wondered whether he could have had any particular motive for changing his place then leaning one elbow on the table she looked around the room  there was only one window in it for even with double casements it is difficult enough to keep a small prairie homestead warm in winter and the place was somewhat shadowy the log walls were uncovered and she could see the chinking of moss and clay which had been driven into the crevices in them and there was as usual nothing on the very roughly boarded floor one bright ray of sunshine however streamed in and fell dazzlingly across the table upon which an apparently unopened letter lay the white envelope which caught the light seized her attention and she remembered that the mailcarrier visited the district that day as lucy calvert was not in it was reasonable to suppose that the letter was addressed to her which would explain why her mother had not opened it and this supposition carried her a little farther the most likely person to write to the girl was her lover and alison was almost sure that it was a man who had inscribed the address on the envelope by and by she saw nevis glance at the square of paper in what did not appear to be an altogether casual fashion and the halfformed idea in her mind grew into definite shape there was a reason why he should be interested in the letter and she decided to sit him out she opened a conversation with mrs calvert and some time had slipped away when a distant rattle of wheels rose out of the prairie nevis rising addressed his hostess  i guess thats miss calvert and as theres a point or two about our binder which i believe i forgot to mention id like to explain the thing before she turns up he said i want to get on again as soon as possible after ive had a word with her no doubt miss leigh will excuse us for a minute  he moved forward toward the table with what appeared to be a photograph of some harvesting machinery in his hand and as he did so alison who remembered that they had been laughing and speaking rather loudly during the last three or four minutes fancied she heard a footstep outside the open window she was however not quite sure of this and she watched the man with every sense strung up as he approached her hostess it struck her that his object was to get near enough to see the writing or the postmark on the envelope which would probably be impossible after lucy arrived  leaning forward a little she rested one arm farther on the table which was covered with a light cloth and drew the latter toward her with a slight movement of her elbow until a wider strip of it overhung the edge she could not warn her hostess in the hearing of the man when she had only suspicion to act on but she was determined that he should not discover winthrops whereabouts if she could help it neviss eyes as she noticed were fixed on the envelope but he was evidently still too far off to read the postmark and she waited another moment watching him with mingled disgust and anger at the means he used  in the meanwhile it was clear that mrs calvert had no suspicion of what was going forward for there was nothing to show that alisons heart was beating a good deal faster than it generally did or that the man was conscious of a vindictive satisfaction his approach had been ostensibly careless and there was only a faintly suggestive hardness in his eyes the girl sat very still and if her face was a little more intent than usual her hostess did not notice it  alison fancied that she heard a sound outside the window again but she paid no heed to it and as nevis was about to lay his hand on the table and lean over it she moved her elbow sharply the next moment the cloth slid down into a heap on the floor and the letter disappeared  nevis closed one hand viciously but he opened it again immediately as he turned to alison the man was quick and held himself well in hand and she felt a certain satisfaction in outwitting him for it was clear that he had not suspected her of having any motive for jerking the cloth off  am i accountable for the accident he asked  no replied alison it was my fault  the danger however was not quite over alison quietly felt with one little lightly shod foot beneath the cloth part of which had caught and rested on her dress her shoe touched something that seemed harder than the soft fabric and she contrived to draw it toward her  you knocked a letter off the table said nevis it must have fallen somewhere near permit me  he stooped to pick up the cloth and alison saw that mrs calvert was at last uneasy it was obvious that she did not wish nevis to lay his hands on the envelope he raised the cloth and after a glance beneath it moved a pace or two and shook it vigorously but nothing fell out and alison quietly pushed back her chair  its here beneath my skirt  she picked it up and handed it to mrs calvert who laid it on a shelf across the room after that there was a moments silence during which the two women looked at each other curiously while nevis whose face was expressionless looked at them both then the awkward stillness was broken by the entrance of thorne ignoring nevis completely he turned to mrs calvert with a smile  i dont know whether i need an excuse for this visit but it occurred to me that i could drive miss leigh home he explained i was hauling in logs for gillow when farquhars hired man came along and told me hed brought miss leigh over but wasnt sure when he could come back for her lucy will be here in a minute  he leaned on a chair talking about the wheat crop until the rattle of wheels which had been growing louder stopped when he moved toward the door saying that he would help lucy with the team it was some time before he reappeared with her and then the girl turned imperiously to nevis  you here she exclaimed what do you want  i was trying to sell your mother a binder nevis answered blandly  lucy standing very straight looked at him with a snap in her eyes  then i guess youre wasting time while there are implements to be had anywhere between here and winnipeg well buy none from you  nevis favored her with a single swift glance and then took up his hat  in that case i may as well get on again i dare say your mother and miss leigh will excuse me  he did not offer to shake hands with either of them which may have been due to the fact that mrs calverts face was now hard and suspicious and alison carefully looked away from him there was also a gleam of ironical amusement which probably had some effect in thornes eyes soon after he disappeared mrs calvert asked thorne to come out and look at a mower which she said the hired man had had some trouble with and when they left the room lucy leaned back in her chair with her eyes fixed on alison in a significant manner they were of a clear blue and alison admitted that with the somewhat unusual color in her cheeks and the light on her mass of gleaming hair the girl was aggressively pretty  im glad theyve gonei guess i have to thank you for what you did she said it was right smart and im not sure my mother caught on to the thing  how did you know alison asked in rather disturbed astonishment  lucy laughed  mavy saw you through the window the mailcarrier told him nevis was here and it was quite easy to figure what he was after thats why mavy hitched his team behind the willows and crept up quiet to see what was going on so he could spoil his game but he left it to you when he saw that you were on to it said he felt quite sure you could fix the man  alison remembered the footstep at the window but she was curious about another aspect of the matter  why did he tell you she asked  lucys manner changed and there was a hint of hardness in her expression  well she answered perhaps he wanted me to know what you had done and anyway he had to put me on my guard still though mavys quick theyre none of them very smart after all and there was a point that didnt seem to strike him he wasnt clear as to why nevis would try to pick up jakes trail through me  the last words were flung sharply at the listener and alison made a gesture of appeal  of course she returned he wouldnt tell you that  no declared lucy nothing would have got it out of him thats the kind of man he is she paused a moment what made you send nevis after me  it was done without thinking i couldnt foresee that it might make trouble i was sorry afterward i am sorry now  her companion looked at her with disconcerting steadiness  well let it go at that theres just this to sayyou havent any reason to be afraid of me i dont know a straighter man than mavy thornebut i dont want him jakes quite enough for me and theres trouble in front of him with nevis on his trail  it cost alison an effort to retain a befitting composure this plainspeaking girl had obviously taken a good deal for granted but alison was uneasily conscious that she had certainly arrived at the truth it was a relief to her when mrs calvert and thorne presently entered the room together     chapter xv  on the trail   nevis was not as a rule easily turned aside when he had taken a task in hand and his failure at the calvert homestead only made him more determined to run winthrop down besides he had not failed altogether for he had at least caught a glimpse of the stamp on the letter and he had no doubt that it was a canadian one there was an appreciable difference in the design and color of the american stamps this indicated that in all probability winthrop was still in canada in which case there would be no difficulty in arresting him once his whereabouts could be discovered the tracing of the latter promised to be less easy but nevis set about it and shortly afterward fortune once more favored him  his business was an extensive one he had money laid out here and there over a wide stretch of country and he had already discovered that it required a good deal of watching as a matter of fact the latter was advisable for some of the men to whom he lent it were addicted to disappearing without leaving any address or intimation as to what they had done with the movable portion of their hypothecated possessions it is true that they generally had repaid nevis a large part of his loan as well as an exorbitant interest for a considerable time but then had abandoned the struggle in despair from his point of view however neither fact had any particular bearing on the matter he expected a good deal more than the value of a hundred cents when he laid down a dollar  one night a week or two after he called on mrs calvert he strolled out on to the platform of a train that had been run on to a lonely sidetrack beside a galvanized iron shed and a big watertank he was leaning on the rails when the conductor came out of the vestibule behind him  were not scheduled to stop he commented  no sir replied the conductor guess the company had once a notion of making a station here but they cut it out its used as a sectiondepot and sidetrack and now and then a freight pulls up for water theres a soft spring here and you cant get good water right along the line any kind wont do in a locomotive boiler  the man was unusually loquacious for a western railroad hand and nevis who had been glancing out at the shadowy sweep of prairie amid which the straight track lost itself felt inclined to talk  but whats holding us up he asked  montreal express shes on the next section and its quite a long one they sidetrack everything to let her through  a thought took shape in neviss mind the point that suggested itself appeared at least worth attention and he asked a question  would a wire to anybody in the district be sent to the station ahead  the conductor said that it would and added that the man in charge of the place where they were then stopping was called up only in case of necessity to hold a train on the sidetrack he explained that although the instruments clicked out any message sent right along the circuit the operators as a rule listened only when they got their particular signal this had a certain significance to nevis  is there often a freighttrain waiting here when you come along he asked  thats so said his companion we take the section if the atlantic flyers late and they have to cut out the pickup freight if shes in front of us when she was standing yonder one night a little while back i saw what struck me as quite a curious thing just as we struck the tail switches a man dropped off a caboose coupled on behind the freightcars it was good clear moonlight and i watched him he kept the train between him and the shack behind you and started out over the prairie as fast as he could then we ran in behind the freightcars but as soon as we were clear the engineer pulled them out and as i looked back the man dropped into the grass like a stone bill who runs this place was standing outside his shack and that may have had something to do with it  it sounds strange commented nevis can you remember when it was  the conductor contrived to do so and nevis was not astonished when he heard the date he decided that it would be wise to compare his conclusion with any views his companion might have about the matter  its possible it was only one of the boys stealing a ride he suggested  in that case he neednt have been so scared of bill was the answer its most unlikely hed have got out on the prairie after him strikes me the man was mighty anxious nobody should see him anyway i thought no more about the thing and only remembered it tonight  just then the scream of a whistle came ringing up the track and the conductor pointed to a fanshaped blaze of brightness which swept up out of the prairie  the express ill have to get along well be off in two or three minutes now  nevis lighted a cigar as soon as he was left alone and by the time the great express had flashed by with a clash and clatter he felt convinced that corporal slaney had erred in assuming that winthrop had escaped across the frontier having arrived at this decision he strolled back into the lighted car as the train crept out across the switches on to the waste of prairie he had now something to act upon  in the meanwhile a weary man dressed in somewhat ragged duck sat one evening outside a tent pitched in the hollow of a prairie coulée with a letter in his hand his attitude was suggestive of dejection but he clenched the paper in hard brown fingers and there was an ominous look in his weatherdarkened face it was careworn though he was young and his general appearance and expression seemed to indicate that he was a simple man who had borne a burden too heavy for him until at last he had revolted in desperation against the intolerable load  a new branch line crept along the side of the shallow coulée which wound deviously across the great white sea of grass and the trestles of a halffinished bridge rose a gaunt skeleton of timber above the creek that flowed through the valley a cluster of tents and a galvanized iron shack with a funnel projecting above it crowned the crest of a neighboring ridge and a murmur of voices and laughter rose faintly from the groups of men who lay about them winthrop however had pitched his camp a little distance from the others so as to be nearer his work which consisted in removing the soil from the side of the coulée to make room for the roadbed he had obtained a team from a neighboring rancher and a satisfactory rate of payment from the railroad contractor indeed during the last few weeks he had almost fancied that he was at last leaving his troubles behind him and then that afternoon another blow had suddenly fallen the letter from lucy calvert contained the disturbing news that nevis who seemed to have discovered that he had not left canada was still in pursuit of him  presently two of his comrades from the camp strolled up to his tent and stretched themselves out on the harsh white grass in front of it they were attired as he was and they had toiled hard under a scorching sun all day handling heavy rails but one was a man of excellent education and the other had owned a wheat farm until the frost had reaped his crop and ruined him  youre looking blue tonight commented the latter  well acknowledged winthrop grimly theres a reason ive put quite a lot of work in on that roadbed the last few weeks but the trouble is i wont get a dollar unless i stay with it and keep up to specification until next payday  of course said the man who had spoken why should you want to quit  winthrop glanced at the letter  ive had a warning guess ill have to pull out again sudden one of these days  there was silence for a few moments after this the men had gone on well together and within certain limits the toilers in a trackgrading camp make friends rapidly but for all that there are unwritten rules of etiquette in such places and questions on some points are apt to be resented  still winthrops face was troubled and his expression hinted that it might be a consolation to take somebody into his confidence  creditors one of his companions ventured to suggest  youve hit it first time drakesford bondholder whos been bleeding me quite a few years now raked in what i made each harvestleft me not quite enough to live onuntil i began to see that id have to work a lifetime to get clear of him when i knocked a little off the debt one good year he piled up something else on me then i was short last payment and he shut down on my farm  drakesford turned to his companion  ever hear anything like that before watson  there was a trace of dryness in the other mans smile  i have he answered its not quite new on the prairie one or two of the boys i know have been through that mill  he turned toward winthrop  how did the blamed insect first get hold of you  id a notion of getting married and meant to raise a record crop went along to the bloodsucker who was quite willing to back me and took out a mortgage pledged him all the place and stock for what he let me have  probably a third of its value interposed drakesford  about that winthrop agreed a big crop might have cleared me then but we had frost that year and he commenced to play me made me insure stock and homestead in his companyand i guess he stuck me over that then i had to buy implements and any stores he sold from him at about twice the usual figure and one way or another the debt kept piling up  couldnt you have gone short in your payments before it got too big and let him sell the place suggested drakesford in that case anything over and above what he advanced would have had to be refunded to you still the man you dealt with would probably have provided for that difficulty  watson grinned  a sure thing he wouldnt shut down until it was a year when wheat was cheap and farms were bringing mighty little then hed sell him up and buy the place in through a dummy way down beneath its value after that hed rent it out until wheat went up and hed get twice what he gave for it from some sucker  it is possible that the farmer had arrived at something very near the truth but his companion who still seemed thoughtful looked at winthrop  when you got notice of foreclosure i suppose you cleared out and left him the place he said how does that give him a hold on you  i sold the team and stock first replied winthrop grimly he sent the police after me  the man made a sign of comprehension  naturally but havent you got some homestead exemption laws in this part of the country  they dont apply to mortgaged property watson broke in then he looked up sharply but i guess youve hit it the debt secured by mortgage wasnt a big one and the man piled up more on to it afterward the law would exempt from seizure on that  winthrop considered this moodily  well he answered at length suppose youre right whos going to take up my case and where am i to get the money to put up a fight the only lawyer in the district wouldnt act against the bondholder and i couldnt get at my mortgage deed anyway its in the mans hands and i havent a copy i got out with the price of a few beasts and left the rest to him he paused and clenched a big brown hand if hes wise hell be content with that and quit but you cant satisfy that man hes got my farm hes made my life bitter brought three years of trouble on the girl i meant to marry and now hes after me again seems to me ive laid down under it about long enough  he broke off and sat silent a while gazing out across the prairie toward where the red glow of sunset burned far off on the lonely grasslands rim iron shack and clustered tents stood out against it sharply now and the faint sound of voices that came up through the still clear air seemed to jar on the man  they can laugh he complained i could once  then watson changed the subject  butler had a notion hed try a shot or two tomorrow where the road goes through the rise and he sent some giantpowder along he wants you to clinch the detonators on the fuses and put them in  now dynamite is not often used in prairie railroading but winthrop had once handled it in another part of the country and had mentioned the fact to a foreman who was disposed to experiment with it  its no use in that loose stuff he pointed out  butler wants to try it answered watson theres no reason why you shouldnt let him i dumped the magazine he sent you in the coulée i didnt want to lie about smoking too near the detonators  he walked away a little distance and came back with a case out of which winthrop took what looked like several yellow wax candles then he cut off three or four pieces of fuse and carefully pinched down a big copper cap on the end of each of them these he inserted into different sticks of the semiplastic giantpowder in turn and his companions drew a little away from him as he did so it was getting dark now but they could still see his face and it was very hard and grim it impressed them unpleasantly as they watched him handle the yellow rolls which contained imprisoned within them such tremendous powers giantpowder is a somewhat unstable product as winthrop knew from experience and the other two had heard and in case of a premature explosion there was very little doubt as to what the fate of the party would be annihilation in its most literal sense was the only word that would describe it for there was force enough in those yellow sticks to transform material flesh and blood into unsubstantial gases the fulminate in the detonators he cautiously imbedded was even more terrible and sitting with his bent form outlined darkly against the shadowy waste of grass he looked curiously sinister he finished his task at last and handed one of them the magazine  shouldnt there be another stick watson asked have you left it in the grass  you can look said winthrop curtly as he moved aside  watson glanced round the place where he had been sitting  i cant see it anyway i dare say i couldnt have brought another one after all  he moved away with drakesford and looked at the latter when they were some distance from the tent  its curious about that stick he observed im not convinced yet that ive got as many as i brought with me  why should he want to keep one his companion asked  i dont know watson confessed but there was something in his face that didnt please me  yes agreed drakesford ive once or twice seen overdriven men look like that and so far as i can remember there was trouble afterward  they said nothing further and while they proceeded along the crest of the coulée winthrop still sitting beside his tent took a stick of giantpowder from his pocket     chapter xvi  corporal slaneys defeat   the sun had just dipped and there was a wonderful invigorating coolness in the dewchilled air winthrop sat in the cookshed which was built against the back of the iron storeshack outside as he could see through the doorway the prairie ran back a vast graywhite stretch to the horizon beneath as vast a sweep of green transparency the little shed however was growing shadowy and a red twinkle showed through the front of the stove in which the sinking fire was still burning  the cook was somewhere outside talking with the boys and winthrop who wished to beg a cotton flourbag from him to use in mending his clothes sat quietly smoking while he waited until he should come back he felt no inclination to join the others for he had grown anxious and morose since lucys warning had reached him a week or two earlier he was quite aware that there was some danger in remaining at his work but payday was approaching and he meant at least to wait until he could collect the money due him after that he would disappear again if anything transpired to render it necessary just then watson looked into the shed  i guess youd better come right out he said hurriedly there are two strangers riding into camp  winthrop was on his feet in a moment and the haste with which he rose betrayed his anxiety going out he ran forward until he could obtain an uninterrupted view of the plain the waste of grass was growing dim but two mounted figures showed up black on it watson indicated them with outstretched hand  notice anything interesting about them  yes winthrop answered grimly they ride like police troopers  thats just how it seemed to me exclaimed drakesford theyre coming from southward and if theyd left the trunk line soon after the vancouver train came in they would get here about now they could have borrowed horses from the rancher near the station  winthrop watched them steadily before he spoke  theyre troopers sure he said at length the short one looks like corporal slaney whos out after me and theyll be in before i could catch either of my horses i turned them out in the soft grass some way back in the coulée  you have got to do something declared watson and do it right now  winthrop glanced out across the great level plain and his face grew set  theyd sure search the coulée and except for that there isnt cover for a coyote for a league or two it wont be dark for half an hour yet and theyd ride me down in three or four minutes in the open  this was obvious and silence followed until winthrop spoke again  i havent a gun of any kind  thats fortunate said drakesford what do you want a gun for anyway plugging one of the troopers wouldnt help you  in the meanwhile the mounted figures were rapidly drawing nearer the three men stood tensely watching them until winthrop suddenly swung round toward his companions  you can tell them where my tent is and theyll waste some minutes going there thats all i want you to do  watson looked at him inquiringly but he made a sign of impatience  im going back to the cookshed you cant help any keep out of this trouble  moving away from them he disappeared into the shadowy interior of the shed and his companions waited until the rest of the men came running up as the police rode in the latter asked a few questions which watson answered truthfully and then they rode off toward winthrops tent presently one dismounted trooper reappeared and proceeded to search the other tents amid ironical banter and a few protests this took him some time and darkness was not far off when he reached the iron shack the door of which was unusually difficult to open though watson who had visited it in the meanwhile could have explained the cause of it then the other trooper came back and led both horses out upon the prairie leaving them there he joined his comrade who addressed the men  boys he said were holding a warrant for your partner and weve got to have him  nobodys stopping you one of them answered we havent a place to hide him in unless hes crawled down a gopherhole  as a gopher is smaller than an ordinary squirrel the point of this was evident and while a laugh went up the policemen conferred together in front of the iron shack then after looking in they walked around to the back of it they had no doubt already noticed the cookshed but as it was very small and the door stood partly open it appeared a most unpromising place for the fugitive to seek refuge now however they moved close to it and winthrop sitting back in the shadow became dimly visible  come out weve got you one trooper cried  the man did not move but he had something in his hand which was stretched out toward the stove one of the potholes in the top of the stove was open and a faint glow shone upon the object he held clenched in his fingers it bore as corporal slaney noticed no resemblance to a pistol  come out he repeated theres no use in making trouble  winthrop laughed in a jarring fashion  i guess ill stay a while right where i am  then he raised his voice  if youre wise youll wait outside corporal  slaney stood still just outside the door peering into the shed and the trooper behind him had his carbine ready  dont be foolish jake weve got you sure he called  he moved a pace nearer and winthrop leaned forward a little farther over the pothole  see what this is he inquired glancing down at the object in his hand  its not a gun anyway said the trooper to his superior  its a stick of giantpowder theres a detonator in it and an inch or two of fuse as soon as youre inside the door i drop it in the stove  slaney promptly recoiled a yard or two having had some experience in dealing with men driven to extremities he knew that winthrops warning was not empty bluff there was something in the mans voice that convinced him that he meant what he said for the next few moments he and the trooper stood irresolutely still wondering what they should do while the motionless figure quietly watched them through the doorway the corporal was by no means timid or overcautious and had winthrop held a pistol it is highly probable that he would have attempted to rush him except in the hands of a master of it the shortbarreled weapon is singularly unreliable and shots fired by a man disturbed by fear or anger as a rule go wide but the stick of dynamite meant certain death slaney had not the nerve to face that and besides as he rightfully reflected it would serve no purpose except to nip in the bud the career of a promising police officer then winthrop spoke again  youll have to haul off this time corporal letting this thing drop is quicker than shooting even if you had me covered  we could plug you from a distance through the shack slaney pointed out  thats so winthrop assented calmly i guess you could but im not sure your bosses would thank you for doing it  there was as the corporal recognized some truth in this the police would be held blameless for shooting down a fugitive who refused to surrender but after all the exploit would not count to their credit unless the man were a desperado guilty of some particularly serious offense it was their business to capture the person for whom they had a warrant  drawing back a little farther the corporal conferred with the trooper who suggested several ways of getting over the difficulty none of which however appeared altogether practicable for one thing he said they could wait sleeping in turn until from utter weariness winthrops vigilance relaxed but that it was evident would most likely take more time than they could spare they could also seek the assistance of the trackgraders and arrange with them to make a diversion while they crept up unobserved against this there was however as the corporal pointed out the probability that the men were more or less in sympathy with the fugitive and that as a result any assistance they might be commanded to render could not be depended on he added that he would rather wait for daylight and then if it should be absolutely necessary fire into the shed  in the meantime watson was discussing the affair with drakesford  that man has some kind of plan in his mind though i cant tell you what it is he declared anyway it would be better that the troopers hadnt their horses handy in case he gets out in the dark and makes a break for the prairie  theyre back behind the tents observed drakesford pointedly  picketed grinned watson they should have kneehobbled them a horse will now and then pull a picket out when the soils light  it was too dark to see his companions face clearly but drakesford appeared to smile in a manner that suggested comprehension and they strolled a little nearer the corporal who had just sent for the cook the corporal explained that he had ridden a long way since his dinner and asked for a can of coffee and some eatables and the cook proceeded dubiously toward the shed he came back emptyhanded in a minute or two  i cant get you anything he said the man youre after wont let me in  the corporal expressed his feelings somewhat freely but the cook grinned  you want to be reasonable he protested how do you expect me to get in when hes holding off the two of you and youve got arms  watson touched his companions shoulder  its my opinion that our friend would better get out tonight he whispered the boys are holding off in the meanwhile but if they cant get their breakfast therell probably be trouble  drakesford agreed with this and shortly afterward he proceeded circuitously toward the troopers horses  in the meanwhile slaney and his subordinate sat down on the grass well apart from each other and about sixty yards from the cookshed and rolling their blankets about them prepared to spend the night as comfortably as possible it was not very dark though there was no moon and a slight haze which promised an increased obscurity was now creeping across the sky they could see the black shape of the shed and it was evident that nobody could slip out from it without their observation and they had their carbines handy slaney would have crept up a little nearer only that he felt it desirable to keep outside the striking range of the giantpowder in case winthrop happened to get drowsy and drop it in the stove  after a while the trackgraders who had sat among the grass smoking and watching the troopers began to drift away to their sleepingquarters the drama was interesting but they had no part in it and they would certainly have to rise soon after sunup to a long days arduous toil in the meanwhile their attitude could best be described as reluctantly neutral there were a few toughs among them who had no doubt sufficient reason for not loving a policeman of any kind but the rest recognized the inadvisability of any interference with constituted authority on the other hand though they did not know the rights or wrongs of the matter the desperate coldblooded courage of the hardpressed man appealed to them and they decided that corporal slaney need not look for any effective assistance which it might be in their power to render most of them were simple men who lived and toiled in the open and as is usual with their kind their sympathies were with the weaker party  in an hour or two the last of them had vanished and if a few still watched outside their tents there was at least nothing that suggested their presence to corporal slaney he lay resting on one elbow with his eyes fixed on the shed while a little chilly breeze set the dry grasses rustling about him it was now slightly darker than it usually is on the prairie in summertime for the haze had gradually spread across most of the sky the tents had faded almost out of sight though the black shape of the shack remained and now and then when the breeze sank away the silence grew almost oppressive once the corporal started as he heard a sound in the shed but he sank down again when he recognized the clatter and rattle that succeeded it winthrop who evidently did not mean to neglect any precaution was he decided putting more fuel into the stove after that the howl of a coyote came faintly up the breeze which grew stronger and the low murmur of the grasses began once more  a pearly light was growing clearer on the eastern rim of the prairie when at length slaney damp with the dew rose to his feet with a shiver and softly called the trooper who announced that he had heard nothing suspicious during the night after a brief parley they crept up cautiously a little nearer the shed but there was so far as they could make out no sign of life within indeed the stillness was becoming suspicious moving nearer still they could look into part of the shed through the open door and for the light was getting clearer it became evident that winthrop was no longer sitting beside the stove this was encouraging because it looked as if he had fallen asleep  making a short detour so as to keep to one side of the entrance they crept up closer with faces set and hearts beating a good deal faster than usual but there was no sound except a faint crackle apparently from the stove then slaney lay down in the grass and crawled up to the doorway where he rose and suddenly sprang into the shed the next moment his voice rang out hoarse with anger for the place was empty he waited until the trooper joined him and then pointed to a little door in the back of the larger building  that explains the thing he exclaimed you looked round the shack  i did the trooper admitted and added somewhat tactlessly so did you  slaney frowned at this reminder but it was evident that a discussion as to whose fault it was that winthrop had got away would in no way assist them in his capture and they proceeded into the larger building where they had no trouble in finding an explanation of his escape  men working on the prairie or in the bush of canada are usually boarded by their employers at a weekly charge and there were a good many of them engaged on the track as a result of it the iron shack was partly filled with provisions and when slaney and the trooper entered by the front they had seen a pile of cases and flourbags apparently built up against one wall it was however growing dark then and neither of them had noticed that there was a narrow space behind the provisions which had been left to facilitate the entrance of the cook winthrop it was clear had slipped out through it in the darkness and the shack had prevented either of the watchers from seeing him crawl away across the prairie it occurred to slaney that from the position of the tents it was scarcely likely he had got away quite unnoticed but he had reasons for believing that it would be difficult to elicit any reliable information on that point from the mans comrades  there was only one thing to be done and that was to mount as soon as possible and endeavor to pick up the fugitives trail but when they reached the spot where they had left their horses there was no sign of them and it was half an hour before the trooper came upon them some distance up the coulée slaney was quite convinced that neither of the beasts had succeeded in dragging the picket out of the ground unassisted but this was a thing he could not prove and when the cook had supplied them with a hastily prepared breakfast he and the trooper rode away across the prairie     chapter xvii  a compromise   thorne was driving alison home from grahams bluff one afternoon about a week after winthrops escape when a couple of horsemen became visible on the crest of a low rise the girl glanced at them from under her white parasol which shone dazzlingly in the fierce sunlight and then fixed her eyes on her companion  theyre coming this way arent they she asked  they seem to be replied thorne one of them looks like the corporal and i shouldnt wonder if he wanted a word with me  he saw the girls slight start but was not greatly flattered as he could not be sure whether it resulted from concern on his behalf or mere annoyance he knew what she thought of winthrop  theres no cause for alarm he added with a laugh i havent done anything particularly unlawful for some time  he had half expected alison to explain that she was not alarmed at all but she disappointed him and he wondered whether there was any significance in this he had already discovered that she did not invariably reveal exactly what she felt  what can he want she asked  it probably concerns winthrop i dont think i told you that they almost caught him a little while ago though he got away again  you didnt was that because you were afraid you could not trust me  a tinge of deeper color crept into her companions face and she decided rightly that this was due to displeasure in the encounters which were not altogether infrequent between them she now and then delivered a galling thrust but this he thought was striking below the guard  what a question miss leigh  it wouldnt have been unnatural if you had considered it wiser to be reticent what happened on the last occasion would have justified it  if you are referring to neviss visit to mrs calvert i should be quite willing to leave you to outwit him again the way you secured the letter was masterly still in view of the opinions you expressed about winthrop i dont understand why you did it and so far as i can remember you havent explained the thing  i meant his visit to the farquhar homestead when i told him about lucy but ill try to answer you for one reason i wanted to make amends for my previousrashness  alison paused at the word as she remembered that lucy had suggested that what she now termed rashness was jealousy  well laughed thorne you were certainly rash but i feel inclined to wonder whether you were anything else your hesitation just now wassignificant  alison recognized that she had a quickwitted antagonist  i believe i have already admitted that i was prejudiced against winthrop  that returned thorne is perhaps from your point of view no more than natural in fact im not sure i could say he was right in everything he has done he paused a moment but i shouldnt like to think that your prejudice extends to lucy  alison had not expected this and she wondered with some resentment exactly what he meant to imply  of course he added some of her ideas and some of the things she says might jar on you but that doesnt count for very much after all the girls staunch all through and the way she has stuck to winthrop in his trouble and the way she has run the farm would compel the respect of any one who understood what she has had to put up with  alison wondered whether he wished to reassure her concerning lucys devotion to her lover which as she remembered the girl herself had already done but she scarcely fancied that he would adopt such a course as this it would at least be very much out of harmony with his usual conduct  i venture to believe that lucy and i will be good friends in the future she said  slaney and the trooper were now rapidly approaching and a minute or two later thorne pulled up and turned to the corporal who reined in his horse close beside the wagon  you have something to say to me he asked  yes replied slaney its this do you know where jake winthrop is  no answered thorne on the whole im glad i dont whats more i havent the least suspicion  they looked at each other steadily and it struck alison that the little gesture slaney made was a striking testimonial to her companions character it indicated that the corporal had no hesitation in taking the word of the man with whom he was at variance though she and thorne occupied the same seat they were far enough apart for her to see his face and as he sat with his broad hat tilted back smiling down at slaney she recognized that in spite of the old blue duck he wore there was a virile grace in every line of his figure in addition to this by contrast with the smartly uniformed corporal he looked as she felt it could most fittingly be described thoroughbred and there was something in his halfwhimsical manner that curiously pleased her  i guess you heard what happened up the track slaney next inquired  i did rather amusing in some respects wasnt it i understand that you and the trooper sat out most of the night watching an empty shack  well asserted slaney grimly there was nothing very amusing about the giantpowder i tell you the man meant to drop it into the fire  from what i know of winthrop im inclined to believe he did in fact in my opinion it would be considerably wiser of nevis if he left that man alone im not sure he has a very good case against him anyway though of course thats no concern of yours or mine you cant pick up his trail  thats a cold fact declared the corporal i guess you wouldnt mind getting down and walking along a few yards with me  its not worth while ive no objections to miss leighs hearing what you have to say and im afraid volador wouldnt stand unless i kept the reins the flies are bothering him and he doesnt seem quite easy when youre in the neighborhood thorne paused and laughed in a way thats not astonishing  slaney disregarded the last observation  then he said im not the man to make useless troubleanyway unless its going to give me a shove up toward promotionbut youre worrying me the fact is wherever i pick up winthrops trail i strike yours too now there was a night some while back when we ran one of you down close to the frontier  thorne saw alison glance sharply at the corporal and he smiled  why should i ride for the frontier with the police after me  thats what i dont exactly know but i have my views i want to say that we picked up a black plug hat when we were coming back along the trail the point is that the thing was new then we found a brown duck jacket with a tear in it but i figured the tear had been made quite lately  i dont think you could prove very much from that  well said slaney i could try it would look bad if i put the other matter of the horse winthrop found near your homestead alongside it now ill ask you right outare you going to mix yourself up with jakes affairs any more  in return id like to hear whether you have any notion of carrying your investigations further thorne parried  they looked rather hard at each other and then slaney smiled  i guess it will depend a good deal on your answer that is unless nevis gets hold of the thing  then its my intention to drop jake winthrop now theres very little probability of his wanting any further assistance that i could render him  well let it go at that replied slaney simply i guess it will save you trouble goodday to you  he rode away and alison turned to her companion when they drove on again  one could have imagined that you and the corporal were making a bargain she suggested  thorne laughed  well he admitted im afraid it was quite illegal but it amounted to something very much like that the bargain however is only a provisional one if nevis chances on the truth he may upset it by forcing slaneys hand  but after all you gave each other only a vague hint it would be difficult even to reproach the corporal if as you say he went back on it  oh yes assented thorne dryly still i havent the least reason for believing that probable  alison made no comment though the attitude of both men appealed to her they were enemies in some respects and yet once the indefinite understanding had been arrived at neither seemed to have the slightest fear that the other would violate it they were she remembered men who lived in the open who broke and rode wild horses and who faced exposure and strenuous toil why this should be conducive to reliability of character was not very clear but it apparently had that result then she remembered what the corporal had mentioned  you have been doing something to help winthrop to escape since the night you let him have the horse  thorne admitted it and when she pressed him for the story he told it whimsically but this time alison felt no anger a few plain words spoken by lucy calvert had obviated that for it was now quite clear that the man had been prompted by mere chivalrous pity and lust of excitement and had no desire to win the girls favor  that was splendid she exclaimed  thorne smiled though he looked at her in a somewhat curious fashion then at her request he related how winthrop had held off the police as it happened he could tell a story with dramatic force and both the brief narratives had their effect on alison she had imagination and could picture the man who now sat beside her smashing furiously through the tangled bluff in the blackness of the night and the other sitting grimly resolute beside the stove with the stick of giantpowder in his hand after all they were she realized the doings of primitive men but charity that did not stop to count the cost and steadfast unflinching valor were rudimentary too and all the progress of a complex civilization had evolved nothing finer man could add nothing to them they were perfect gifts to him though there was reason for believing that they were not distributed broadcast  then they chatted about other matters and alison was almost sorry when the farquhar homestead and its barns and stables rose girt about with a sweep of tall green wheat out of the prairie thorne stayed for supper and he was standing beside his team with farquhar an hour afterward when the latter suddenly made an excuse and moved away as his wife came out of the doorway thorne grinned at this and there was still a gleam of amusement in his eyes when his hostess stopped beside him he indicated the retreating farquhar with a wave of his hand  harry remembered that hed want the wagon tomorrow and theres a bolt loose he explained it didnt seem to occur to him until he noticed you i suppose one could call it a coincidence  have you any different ideas on the subject mrs farquhar inquired  since you ask the question it looks rather like collusion  well laughed mrs farquhar i certainly wanted a little talk with you to begin with i should like to point out that we have had a good deal of your company lately  thats a fact perhaps id better say that quite apart from the pleasure of spending an evening with you and harry theres another reason  the thing has been perfectly obvious for some time indeed it has had my serious consideration you see i hold myself responsible for alison to some extent  you feel that you stand in loco parentisi believe thats the correct phrasebut in one way it doesnt seem to apply nobody would believe you were old enough to be her mother  mrs farquhar glanced at him in halfamused impatience but his manner swiftly changed  its my intention to marry alison as soon as things permit he added anyway that is what i should like to do but whether ill ever get any farther is of course another matter its one on which id be glad to have your opinion and that suggests a question can my views have been perfectly obvious to alison  his companion looked thoughtful  thats a little difficult to answer though i feel inclined to say that they certainly ought to have been on the other hand its possible that she may believe you merely saw in her what well call an intellectual equalsomebody you would have more in common with than you would for example with lucy this seems the more likely because i dont think that marriage in itself has any great attraction for her indeed im inclined to fancy that it was rather a shock to her to discover how it is regarded by some people in this country its unfortunate that she fell in with one hasty suitor who was anxious to marry her offhand immediately on her arrival that being the case it strikes me that you had better proceed cautiously and avoid anything that may suggest a too materialistic point of view  thorne made a gesture of comprehensive repudiation  im thankful that nobody could call me smugly practical but it must be admitted that as she is situated marriage seems to be her only vocation in this country  if you let her see that you think that you may as well give up your project mrs farquhar hesitated a moment have you ever tried to formulate what you expect from alison  thornes smile made it evident that he guessed what was in her mind  i can at least tell you what i dont expect ive no hankering for a house and domestic comfortsin my experience theyre singularly apt to pall on one i dont want a woman to mend my clothes and prepare me tempting mealsthat way of looking at the thing strikes one as almost unthinkable and there never was a banquet where the fare was half as good as what you turn out of the blackened spider in the birch bluff i want alison with her english graces and english prejudices her only and nothing else  that is a sentiment which would no doubt appeal to her but one has to be practical and you would in any case have to do a good deal before you got her she couldnt for instance dress in flourbags and live in the wagon nor do i think that bishop would feel equal to entertaining a married couple during the winter  the point of all this is that you want to be satisfied that i can give up my vagabond habits suggested thorne well i must try to convince you though i want to say that it was a willing sacrifice havent i gone into harnessyoked myself down to a house and land with a mortgage on both of them havent i slept for several months now under at least a partly shingled roof if any more proof is wanted havent i come to terms with corporal slaney and given up the excitement of bluffing the police and havent i decided as far as its possible for me to leave nevis unmolested arent all these things foreign to my nature  mrs farquhar laughed  mavy she asked do you find living in some degree of comfort and devoting your intelligence to a task that will probably pay you so very intolerable  thorne smiled and made a little confidential gesture  i must confess that i dont find it quite as unpleasant as i had expected but you havent given me your opinion on the point that concerns me most  then said mrs farquhar with an air of reflection while alison has naturally not said anything to me on the subject i dont think you need consider your case as altogether desperate  she smiled at thorne who swung himself up into his wagon and drove away     chapter xviii  neviss visitor   florence hunter had lately returned from toronto and was sitting on the veranda toward the middle of the afternoon in an unusually thoughtful mood among other reasons for this there was the fact that she had spent a good deal of money while she was away and she was far from sure that she had received its full value most of the people she had met in toronto appeared to be endued with irritatingly respectable oldfashioned views and as a result of it they could not be induced to forget that she was a married woman separated for a few weeks from a selfsacrificing husband indeed one or two of them went so far as to condole with her for his absence and their general attitude imposed on her an unwelcome restraint there was certainly one exception but this man had no tact and the lady who stood sponsor for her openly frowned at his too marked devotion while some of the others laughed florence at length got rid of him summarily and then half regretted it when nobody else aspired to fill his place  it had further occurred to her in elcots absence that he had a number of strong points after all he was quiet and steadfast not to be moved from his purpose by anger or cajolery and though this was sometimes troublesome there was no doubt that he was a man who could be relied upon she had nothing to fear except perhaps her own imprudence while she was in his care then although she would hardly have expected it before she went away she found the spacious wooden house pleasantly cool and quiet after the stir and rush of life in the hot city and elcots unobtrusive regard for her comfort soothing he never fussed but when she wanted anything done he was almost invariably at hand she determined to be more gracious to him in the future for she was troubled with a slightly uncomfortable feeling that he might have had something to complain of in this respect in the past  on the whole her thoughts were far from pleasant and in addition to this the temperature which was a good deal higher than usual had a depressing effect on her there was no breeze that afternoon and the air was still and heavy the white prairie flung back a trying light even on to the shaded veranda and she felt restless captious and irritable at length however she took up a book and endeavored to become engrossed in it she so far succeeded that she did not hear a buggy drive up and it was with a start that she straightened herself in her chair as nevis walked quietly on to the veranda  i never expected you she exclaimed  the man smiled in a deprecatory fashion  i heard at the station that you arrived yesterday  florence frowned at this the inference was too obvious he evidently wished to imply that it would have been unnatural had he delayed his visit  well she said you startled me do you generally walk into places that waylike a pickpocket  nevis laughed and when he sat down rather close to her uninvited she favored him with a gaze of careful and undisguised scrutiny florence could be openly rude upon occasion and though his visits hitherto had afforded her some satisfaction she now felt that she would have been better pleased had he stayed away he was as usual tastefully dressed there was no doubt that his clothes became him but somehow it struck her that although she had not realized this earlier the man looked cheap which on consideration seemed the best word for it  i suppose you enjoyed yourself while you were away he began  no replied florence on the whole i dont think i did  she broke off and added irritably  why do you always come at this time if you drove over in the evening you would find elcot at home  she was genuinely provoked by her companions smile it so tactlessly implied that she did not mean what she had said his signal lack of delicacy jarred on her now though she remembered with faint wonder that she had on previous occasions found a relish in his conversation  well he answered for one reason i generally call here when im going to the bluff its convenient to get there for supper  florence was annoyed at the opening words the hint that there was a stronger reason which he had not mentioned was so crude that it savored of mere impertinence somehow she felt disappointed in the man she had as she realized at length expected clever compliments from him firmly finished subtle boldness that would be just sufficiently apparent to convey a pleasurable thrill and with the latter exception a wholly respectful homage as to what he had expected she was far from clear but that was a point of much less account the polish however seemed suddenly to have been rubbed off him and there was nothing into which she cared to look beneath even elcot would have been capable of something more skilful than his too familiar inanities what had brought about this change in the way she regarded him she did not know but there was no doubt that she felt all at once disillusioned she was in her caprices essentially variable  your supper is evidently a matter of importance to you she said  nevis looked at her sharply  not more than it is to most other men in return i wonder if i might point out that you dont seem quite as amiable as usual today  florence laughed  as a matter of fact im not nobody could feel very pleasant at this temperature and im disappointedwith several things she leaned back languidly in her chair with an air of weariness when that happens its a relief to be disagreeable to anybody who comes along besides youre not in the least entertaining this afternoon  there was something in her manner that stung the man and he ventured upon an impertinence  i suppose that means that elcot hasnt proved amenable as usual but its a little rough on me that i should have to meet the bill after a long and scorching drive  florence laughed again scornfully  elcot she retorted is accustomed to carrying his own load and on occasion other peoples too which is a weakness with which id never credit you besides if hed traveled for a week to see me he wouldnt think of reminding me of it  you seem inclined to drag his virtues out and parade them today  there was no doubt that the man was going too far and that led florence to wonder whether he could be driven into going any farther  that she replied would be quite unnecessary in elcots case in fact his virtues have an almost exasperating habit of meeting you in the face which is no doubt why its rather pleasant to get away from themoccasionally  you prefer something different on the offdays  yes florence answered reflectively i like a change but it must be admitted that i invariably feel an increased respect for elcot after it  nevis winced at this she had made it clear that it was his part to amuse her at irregular intervals and enhance her husbands finer qualities by the contrast it was not however one that appealed to him and he had a vindictive temper as it happened she presently gave him an opportunity for indulging it  i wish id never gone to toronto she said petulantly  considering everything thats quite a pity nevis pointed out the visit probably cost you a good deal of money andhe added this with a grim suggestivenesswheat is steadily going down  florence gazed at him with a hardening face he evidently meant it as a reminder that she owed him money the man was becoming intolerable  is it she asked indifferently in any case i shall no doubt manage to meet my debts when they fall due  nevis had reasons for believing that it would be more difficult than she seemed to anticipate but he talked about something else and then finding that his companion did not favor him with very much attention he took his leave when he was getting into his buggy hunter came up and stopped him  im rather busy but i can spare you a few minutes if its necessary he said  nevis looked at him with a provocative smile  it isnt he answered it was your wife i came to see she entrusted me with the arranging of a little matter  he gathered up the reins and added as though to explain his departure  there are several things i want to get through with at the bluff this evening  then i wont try to keep you  hunter walked up on the veranda and leaning on the balustrade looked at his wife  you have had a deal of some kind with that man  a flush of anger swept into florences cheek  he told you that she exclaimed and then added with a harsh laugh as it happens he was quite correct  hunter stood still with an expressionless face for a moment or two apparently waiting in case she had anything else to say and then with a gesture which might have meant anything he moved away along the veranda florences conscience accused her when he disappeared into the house but she was most clearly sensible that she was now a little afraid of nevis and disposed to hate him however she lay quietly in her basketchair until word was brought her that supper was ready  two or three days later nevis sat late one night in his office at the railroad settlement it was situated at the back of his implement store on the ground floor of a very ugly wooden building which had a false front that rose a little beyond the ridge of roof one door opened directly on to the prairie the other led into the store from which there exuded a pungent smell of paint and varnish a nickeled lamp hung over neviss head and the little room was unpleasantly hot so hot indeed that he sat in his shirtsleeves before a table littered with papers not far away a small safe stood open this contained further papers tied up in several bundles and neatly endorsed there was nothing else in the room except a few shelves filled with account books and there was no covering on the floor nevis like most commercial men in the small western towns wasted very little money on superfluous accessories he found that he could employ it much more profitably  he had as it happened a troublesome matter to decide on and seeing no way out of the difficulties which complicated it he rose at length and lighting a cigar opened the outer door and stood leaning against it it was cooler there and he noticed that the night was unusually dark the stream of light that flowed out past him forcing up his figure in a sharp black silhouette only intensified the thick obscurity in which it was almost immediately lost it was also very still and he could hear his white shirt crackle at each slight movement of the hand that held the cigar everybody in the little wooden town was he surmised already asleep though he knew that a westbound train would stop there in half an hour or so  he did not know how long he remained in the doorway but by degrees the stillness became oppressive and at last he started as a sound rose suddenly out of the darkness it was a faint metallic rattle and he leaned forward a little listening in strained attention the noise was so unexpected that it jarred on him  then he recollected that some of his neighbors were addicted to dumping empty provision cans and similar refuse into a clump of willows which straggled close up to the back of the town not far away and he decided that one of them had fallen down or rolled over after that he went back to his table leaving the door open for the sake of coolness and he was once more occupied with his papers when he heard a sharp knocking at the front of the store pushing his chair back he took out his watch somebody who was going west by the train that was almost due apparently desired to see him though it seemed a curious thing that the man had not called earlier he rose and entered the store where he fell against the projecting handle of a plow in the darkness this ruffled his temper and he spent some time impatiently fumbling for and undoing the fastenings of the outer door then he flung it open somewhat violently and strode out into the darkness there was so far as he could see nobody in the vicinity and when moving forward a few paces he called out he got no answer  feeling slightly uneasy as well as astonished he stood still for perhaps a minute gazing about him he could dimly see the houses across the street with the tall false fronts of one or two cutting black against the sky but there was not a light in any of them and there was certainly no sound of footsteps he was neither a nervous nor a fanciful man and it scarcely seemed possible that his ears had deceived him swinging around suddenly he went back into the store and fastened the outer door before he reentered his office the door at the back of the office and the safe stood open just as he had left them crossing the room he looked into the safe  as a rule a mans possessions are as secure in a small prairie town as they would be in for example london or montreal but nevis seldom kept much money in his safe he usually made his collections after harvest and remitted the proceeds to a bank in winnipeg a small iron cashbox however occupied one shelf and it was at once evident that this had not been touched which seemed to prove that nobody with dishonest intentions had entered the place in his absence this was satisfactory but a few moments later it struck him that one of the bundles of docketed papers was not lying exactly where he had last placed it he could not be quite sure of this though he was methodical in his habits and he took the bundle up and examined it the tape around it was securely tied and the papers did not seem to have been disturbed besides this they were in no sense marketable securities  he laid them down again and closed the safe then locking the outer door behind him he proceeded through the silent town toward the track as he did so the clanging of a locomotive bell broke through a slackening clatter of wheels and when after a smart run he reached the station hot and somewhat breathless the lights of the long train were just sliding out of it he strode up to the agent who stood in the doorway of his office shack with a lantern in his hand  did anybody get on board he asked  no replied the agent nobody got off either did you expect to catch up any one  i fancied somebody called at the store a few minutes ago it occurred to me that the man might want to leave some message and had forgotten it until he was going to catch the train  i guess it must have been a delusion remarked the agent  nevis had almost arrived at the same conclusion he waited a few minutes and then they walked back together through the settlement the agent left him outside the store above which he had a room and dismissing the matter from his mind he went tranquilly to sleep half an hour later     chapter xix  the mortgage deed   alison was sitting alone in the general livingroom of the farquhar homestead about an hour after breakfast when she laid down her sewing with a start as a man whom she had not heard approaching suddenly appeared in the doorway he stood there looking at her with what she felt was a very suspicious curiosity and there was no doubt that his appearance was decidedly against him his clothing which had been rudely patched with cotton flourbags was old and stained with soil his face was hard and grim and she grew apprehensive under his fixed scrutiny  wheres the rest of you he asked after an unpleasant silence of a few moments  alison felt that it would be singularly injudicious to inform him and while she hesitated wondering what to answer he strode into the room and fell heavily into the nearest chair  youll excuse me he apologized im played out  the signs of weariness were plain on him and alison became a little reassured after all she remembered there was nothing of very much value in the homestead and she had never as yet had any reason to fear the men she had come across upon the prairie in fact though one had wanted to marry her offhand their general conduct compared very favorably with that of one or two whom she had met in english cities  have you come far she asked  from the railroadon my feet answered the man i left it about midnight two nights ago and since then ive only had a morsel of food then he smiled at her you havent told me yet where harry farquhar and his wife have gone  it was clear that he had already satisfied himself that they were out and alison reluctantly admitted it  mrs farquhar has driven over to the bluff she said she took her husband with her but she was to drop him at the ravine where the birches are he wanted to cut some poles  the look of annoyance in the mans face further reassured her as it implied that he regretted farquhars absence almost as much as she had done a few moments earlier  its a sure thing i cant wait till they come back and the trouble is i cant make mrs calverts place without a rest either  he paused and gazed searchingly at alison  youre miss leigh arent you i guess you could be trusted ive heard of you  alisons astonishment was evident and he smiled  its quite likely he added dryly that youve heard of me my names jake winthrop  alison sat very still and it was a moment or two before she spoke  what do you want she asked  breakfast if it wouldnt be too much trouble then as farquhars out theres a piece of paper id like to give you guess it would be safer out of my hands the police troopers are after me  alison set the kettle and fryingpan on the stove she was compassionate by nature and the man looked very jaded and weary when she sat down again he handed her a rather bulky folded paper which appeared to be some kind of legal document  what am i to do with this she asked  you can give it to farquhar or keep it and hide it said the man i guess the last would be wisest nobody would figure you had the thing and i cant give it to lucy because nevis would sure get after her  is it very important  it might be i cant go and ask a lawyer now guess the man would feel it was his duty to put slaney on my trail and i couldnt go near the settlement in daylight without doing the same anyway its my mortgage deed and i have a notion that it might give me a pull on nevis if the troopers get me if im right hell be mighty anxious to get it back again  i dont understand returned alison if he was afraid of your using it against him he wouldnt have given it to you at all  winthrop grinned  he didnt i got him out of his office late at night and crept in for it i knew where he kept the thing because id seen him put it in his safe  alison was far from pleased with this confession but while she considered it another point occurred to her  but dont people generally get a duplicate of a paper of this kind she asked  i had one but nevis wanted me to do something that didnt seem quite what we had agreed on and i went over with the deed to show him he was wrong he said id better leave it and somehow or other i could never get it out of his hands again  ah said alison softly i think i wouldnt mind helping you against that man but you must tell me exactly what you mean to do  im going across to see lucyand out west somewhere after that if i can get away and strike anything that will pay me its quite likely that ill leave nevis alone if i cant or theres a reason for it later ill write you and farquhar or thorne could take the deed to a lawyer and see if he could get at nevis with it in the meanwhile it would be wiser if you just hid the thing away if farquhar knows nothing about it i guess it would save him trouble  alison did not answer for a moment or two she felt that she was acting imprudently in allowing herself to be drawn into the affair but she was sorry for the man he was a friend of thornes and that counted for a good deal in his favor in addition to this the idea of playing a part and possibly a leading part in something of the nature of a complicated drama appealed to her and there was half formulated at the back of her mind the desire to prove to thorne just what she was capable of  well she said at length you may leave it with me  then she set about getting him a meal and a little while later he limped wearily away he left her with the impression that it would be wise of nevis to abandon his pursuit of him for there was something in the mans manner which indicated that he might prove dangerous if pressed too hard the morning had slipped away before she could get the thought of him out of her mind  in the meanwhile he was plodding across the white wilderness under a scorching sun the atmosphere was crystallinely clear and an almost intolerable brightness flooded the wide levels a birch bluff miles away was etched in cleancut tracery upon the horizon but though the weary man kept his eyes sharply open he felt reasonably safe from observation which it seemed desirable to avoid he did not believe that any of the scattered farmers would betray him even if some pressure should be put upon them with the view of extracting information but it was clear that they would be better able to evade any attempts nevis or slaney might make to entrap them into some incautious admission if they had none to impart winthrop based this decision on the fact that a man certainly cannot tell what he does not know  it was consoling to remember that the wide open prairie is by no means a bad place to hide in a mounted figure or a team and wagon shows up for a vast distance against the skyline while a few grass tussocks less than a foot in height will effectually conceal a man who lies down among them with the outline of his body broken by the blades from anybody passing within two or three hundred yards of him winthrop was aware however that it would be different if he attempted to run away and once he dropped like a stone when a buggy rose unexpectedly out of a ravine the man who drove it was an acquaintance of his but he seemed to gaze right at the spot where winthrop was stretched out without seeing him the latter was not disturbed again but he cast rather dubious glances round him as he resumed his march there was another long journey in front of him that night and he did not like the signs of the weather it struck him as ominously clear  he was as it happened not the only person who noticed this for other people who had at different times suffered severely in pocket from the vagaries of the climate had arrived at much the same opinion that afternoon with more or less uneasiness according to their temperament the wheat was everywhere standing tall and green and the season had been on the whole so propitious that from bitter experience they almost expected a change as the small cultivator has discovered the simile of a beneficent nature is a singularly misleading one for the stern truth was proclaimed in ages long ago that man must toil with painful effort for the bread he eats and must subdue the earth before he can render it fruitful in the new west he has made himself many big machines including the great gangplows that rip their multiple furrows through the prairie soil but he still lies defenseless against the fickle elements  elcot hunter at least was anxious that night as he sat in the general livingroom of his homestead opposite his wife she was not greatly interested in the book she held and she glanced at him now and then as he sat poring over a newspaper which was noted for its crop and market reports they afforded hunter very little satisfaction for they made it clear that the west would produce enough wheat that season to flood an already lifeless market  the windows of the room were open wide and the smell of sunbaked soil damped by the heavy dew came in with the sound made by the movements of a restless horse or two the fall of hoofs appeared unusually distinct the wooden house which had lain baking under a scorching sun all day was still very hot but the faint puffs of air which flowed in were delightfully cool and at length florence who was very lightly clad shivered as one that was stronger than the rest lifted a sheet of hunters paper  it is positively getting cold she remarked  cold returned hunter i wouldnt call it that  he resumed his reading and three or four minutes had slipped by when florence turned to him with irritation in her manner  havent you anything to say elcot she broke out are those crop statistics so very fascinating  hunter looked up at her with a rather grim smile she lay in a low cane chair beneath the lamp with her figure falling into long sweeping lines attired in costly fripperies lately purchased in the east but there was not the least doubt that they became her indeed with the satiny whiteness of her neck and arms half revealed beneath the gauzy draperies and her hair gleaming lustrously about a face that had been carefully shielded from the ravages of the weather she seemed strangely out of place in the primitively furnished room of a western homestead the man noticed it as he had done on other occasions with a pang of regret there had been a time when he had expected her to rejoice in his successes and console him in his defeats and it had hurt when she had made it clear that any reference to his occupation only irritated her he had got over that as he had borne other troubles with an uncomplaining quietness and though she had never suspected this he had often felt sorry for her still he was a man of somewhat unyielding character and there was occasionally friction when he did what he considered most fitting in spite of her protests  well he said in answer to her question they have anyway some interest to a farmer who has a good deal at stake he threw the paper down things in general arent very promising and i may be rather tightly fixed after the harvest i seem to have been spending a great deal of money lately  florence felt guilty after all as she was the principal cause of his expenses it was generous of him to put it as he had done indeed she decided to make a confession about the loan from nevis sometime when he appeared to be in an unusually favorable mood  you have a splendid crop havent you she asked  the trouble is that i may not get much for it and a wheat crop is never quite safe until its thrashed out im uncertain about the weather  the aneroid has gone up i looked at it  its gone up too much and too suddenly said hunter that sometimes means a bad outbreak from the north  florence was moved by a sudden impulse the man was bronzed and toughened by labor but there was as she had noticed since she came home a jaded look in his face  elcot she asked do you think i oughtnt to have gone away  the man seemed to consider this  no he answered i dont think that so long as you were able to manage it with the little help i could give you he paused a moment and looked puzzled for there was a suspicion of heightened color in florences face on the whole im glad you went if you enjoyed the visit  you dont seem very sure wasnt it rather dull for you here  it was so far as he could remember the first time she had displayed any interest on this point and he smiled  oh i had the place to look after as usual its fortunate that it occupies a good deal of my attention  florence leaned forward suddenly  elcot wont you tell me exactly how much you mean by that  it was a moment or two before hunter answered  well he said gravely since you have suggested it perhaps i better had though it means the dragging in of questions weve talked over quite often already i took up farming because i couldnt stand the cities and it seemed the thing i was most fitted for on that point i havent changed my opinions where i did wrong was in marrying you he checked her with a lifted hand as she was about to speak if you had never met me you would probably have taken the next man with means who came along  yes admitted florence meeting his gaze i think thats true having gone so far hadnt you better proceed  im trying to look at it from your standpoint ive never been sorry on my own account  florence laughed in a strained fashion  thats a little difficult to believe still one must do you the justice to own that you have at least never mentioned your regrets  i dont think ive often mentioned my expectations either thats one reason im speaking now you seemapproachabletonight  i suppose they were not fulfilled  if they were not it was my own fault i took you out of the environment you were suited to and content with  i wasnt florence declared sharply things were horribly unpleasant to me then i was struggling desperately to earn a living and had to put up with a good deal from most disagreeable people  again a faint grim smile crept into her husbands eyes  after all perfect candor is a little painful now and then but let me go on at least i brought you into an environment with which you were not content the kind of life i led was irksome to you you could not help me in it even to hear me talk of what i did each day was burdensome to you i couldnt speak of my plans for the future or the difficulties that must be met and faced continually for a while i felt it badly  yes florence acknowledged it must have been hard on you elcot  it could be borne but there was another side of the matter it was clear that you were longing for company stir gaietyand i could not give them to you as ive often said im not rich enough to make a mark in any of the cities unless i went into business for which ive neither the training nor inclination and most of my money is sunk in the land here its difficult to sell a farm of this size for anything like its value unless wheat is dear besides the friends you would wish to make wouldnt take to me that is certain i lived among people of their description before i met you i couldnt in any way have helped you to make yourself a leading place in the only kind of society that would satisfy you all this has stood between usno doubt it was unavoidablebut it made the troubles i could share with no one a little worse to bear and my few successes of less account to me after all since i could at least send you to the cities now and then it was fortunate that i had my farm he stopped a moment and added deprecatingly whether you will be able to get away next winter is more than i know as i said the outlook is far from promising in the meanwhile  florence did not answer immediately at last she could clearly grasp the mans point of view indeed she realized that during the few years they had lived together she had taken all he had to offer and had given practically nothing in return she felt almost impelled to tell him that her last visit to the cities had brought her very little pleasure and that she would be willing to spend the next winter with him at the lonely homestead but she could not do so a surrender of any kind was difficult to her and she had by degrees built up a barrier of reserve between them that could not immediately be thrown down besides there was in the background the memory of neviss loan  things may look better by and by she said lamely  neither of them spoke for a few minutes and it seemed to florence that the room grew perceptibly colder while once or twice a little puff of air struck with a sudden chill upon her face then there was a sharp drumming which ceased again abruptly upon the shingled roof and she followed hunter when he strode out on the veranda an impenetrable darkness now overhung most of the sky and there was a wild beat of hoofs as three or four invisible horses dashed across the paddock florence knew that the beasts were young and understood that they were valuable her husband moved toward the steps  ill put them into the stable or if i cant manage that turn them out on the prairie he said im afraid of the new fence theyre not accustomed to it yet and there are two barbed strands in it  take one of the hired men with you florence called after him but he made no answer and the next moment a mad beat of hoofs once more broke out as the uneasy horses galloped furiously back across the fencedin space     chapter xx  hail   the air had grown very still again when florence leaned on the veranda balustrade gazing into the darkness which was now intense the brief shower of heavy rain had wet the grass and waves of warm moisture charged with an odor like that of a hothouse seemed to flow about her and recede again leaving her almost shivering in her gauzy dress for between whiles it was by contrast strangely cold she could hear hunter calling to the horses which apparently broke away from him now and then in short savage rushes but she could see nothing of him or them presently the sharp cries of one of the hired men broke in and florence who felt her nerves tingling became conscious of an unpleasant tension  then for a second or part of it the figures of moving men and beasts became visible etched hard and black against an overwhelming brightness as a blaze of lightning smote the prairie the glare of it was dazzling and when it vanished florence was left gripping the balustrade bewildered and wrapped in an intolerable darkness after that a drumming of hoofs and a hoarse cry broke upon her ears but both were drowned and lost in a deafening crash of thunder it rolled far back into the distance in great reverberations and while her light skirt fluttered about her in an icy draught another sound emerged from them as they died away  it grew nearer and louder in a persistent portentous crescendo for at first it suggested the galloping of a squadron of horse then a regiment and at length the furious approach of a division of cavalry holding fast to the balustrade she could even imagine that there were mingled with it the crash of jolting wheels and a clamor of wild voices as of a host behind pressing onward to the onslaught the din was scarcely drowned by a tremendous rumbling that twice filled the air and there was forced upon her a vague perception of the fact that it was a very real attack upon the things that enabled her to have the ease she loved wheat and cattle stables and homestead must it almost seemed go down and there were as sole and pitiful defense two men somewhere out in the darkness exposed to the outbreak of elemental fury there was now no sign of her husband or his companion it was quite impossible to hear any sound they made and she stood quivering until loosing her hold of the balustrade with an effort she ran down the steps  elcot she cried  no answer reached her she knew it was useless to call but an overmastering fear came upon her as she remembered the mad flight of the terrified horses and she ran on a few paces over the wet grass crying out again then she was beaten back gasping with her hands raised in a futile attempt to shield her face and her dress driven flat against her as a merciless shower of ice broke out of the darkness it swept the veranda like the storm of lead from a volley only it did not cease crashing upon the balustrade and lashing the front of the house while the very building seemed to rock in the savage blast she staggered back before it too dazed and bewildered to notice where she was going until she struck the wall and cowered against the boards there was a narrow roof above her but it did not keep off much of the winddriven hail and she could not be sure that the whole of it was now standing the veranda was wrapped in darkness for the lamp had blown out  she never remembered how long she stood there for a time every sense was concentrated on an effort to shelter her face from the hail which fell upon her thinly covered arms and shoulders like a scourge of knotted wire then faint and breathless she crept forward toward where she supposed the door must be and staggered into the unlighted room she struck a chair and sank into it to sit shivering and listening appalled to the cataclysm of sound  then a terror which had been driven out of her mind for the last few minutes crept back elcot was out amid the rush of hurtling ice and she knew him well enough to feel certain that he would stay in the paddock until the horses were secured she could picture him trying to guide the maddened beasts out between the sliprails heading them off from the perilous fence they rushed down upon at a terrorstricken gallop or perhaps lying upon the hailswept grass with a broken limb it was horrible to contemplate and she became conscious of a torturing anxiety concerning the safety of the man for whose comfort she had scarcely spared a thought since she married him  though it was difficult she contrived to shut the door and window and to relight the lamp and then she glanced round the room elcots paper had fallen to pieces and had been scattered here and there while a long pile of hail lay melting on the floor she could understand now why she felt bruised all over except where the fullness of her dress had protected her for she had never seen hail like this in england the jagged lumps were of all shapes and most of them seemed the size of hazelnuts then she became conscious that her hair was streaming about her face and that her dress clung saturated to her limbs this however appeared of no moment for her anxiety about her husband was becoming intolerable  nerving herself for an effort she moved toward the door it was flung back upon her when she lifted the latch and she staggered beneath the blow then panting hard she forced it to again and went back limply to her chair it was utterly impossible for her to face that hail she had the will to do so and she was no coward but the flesh she had pampered and shielded failed her which was in no way astonishing wheatgrowers herders police troopers and unfortunately patient women learn that the body must be sternly brought into subjection to the mind by long repression before one can face winddriven ice snowladen blizzard or the awful cold which now and then descends upon the vast spaces of western canada  in a few more minutes the uproar subsided the drumming on the walls and roof suddenly ceased and the wind no longer buffeted the house the tumult receded in gradations of sinking sound until at last there was silence except for the drip from the veranda eaves it was shortly broken by quick footsteps and florence turned toward the door as hunter came in  his face showed where the hail had beaten it for his hat had gone the water ran from him and one hand was bleeding he looked limp and exhausted but what struck her most was the sternness of his expression  are you hurt she asked  hunter glanced down at his reddened hand  nothing to speak of i got a rip from the fence somehow and one legs a little stiff one of the horses must have kicked me guess ill know more about it tomorrow  and the horses  we managed to get them out but what were you doing outside your dress is dripping  florence hesitated it seemed extraordinary that while she had seldom felt the least diffidence in dealing as appeared expedient with any of the men she had known she was unable to inform her husband that she had been driven into the storm by anxiety for his safety but somehow she could not get the words out she recognized that it had never occurred to him that she could have been actuated by any motive of this kind though she was forced to own that considering everything this was no more than natural the thought brought a halfbitter smile into her eyes  i was on the steps when the hail began and i could scarcely get back into the house she said can it have done very much harm  hunter made a gesture of dejection  thats a point im most afraid to investigate and it cant be done tonight in the meanwhile hadnt you better get those wet things off  his preoccupied manner indicated that he was in no mood for conversation and florence left him standing moodily still it was some minutes before he felt chilly and went upstairs to change his clothes but he came back almost immediately and took some papers and a couple of account books from a bureau after this he lighted his pipe and sat down to make copious extracts with a view to discovering how he stood he had no great trouble in ascertaining his liabilities for he was a methodical man but it was different when he came to consider what he had to set off against them he had counted on his wheat crop to leave him a certain surplus but it now seemed unfortunately probable that there would be no harvest at all that year admitting this he busied himself with figures in an attempt to discover how far it might be possible to convert what promised to be a crushing disaster into a temporary defeat and several hours slipped by before any means of doing so occurred to him his expenses had been unusually heavy there were many points to consider and balance against each other and a gray light was breaking low down on the rim of the prairie when at length he rose and thrust the books back into the bureau the nights labor had at least convinced him that if he were to hold his own during the next twelve months it could be only by persistent effort and stern economy and he had misgivings as to how his wife would regard the prospect of the latter  on going out on to the veranda a few minutes later he was astonished to hear footsteps behind him and when he turned and waited florence came out of the doorway  i heard you moving and i came down she said are you going to look at the wheat  yes replied hunter im afraid there wont be very much of it to see  the light was growing a little clearer and florence noticed the weariness of his face he seemed to hold himself slackly and she had never seen him fall into that dejected attitude the man was however physically jaded for a day of severe labor had preceded the struggle in the paddock and the hours he had spent in anxious thought and he had as he was quite aware a heavy blow to face  may i go with you she asked hesitatingly  why  the question was not encouraging nor was his manner and florence felt reluctant to explain that her request had been prompted by a desire to share his troubles she was conscious that a statement to this effect would probably appear somewhat astonishing as she had never offered to do anything of the kind hitherto  if you must have a reason im as anxious to see what damage the hail has done as you are it cant very well affect you without affecting me  yes agreed hunter thats undoubtedly the case im afraid youll have to put up with me and the homestead for the next twelve months its quite likely that therell be very few new dresses either  florence endeavored to keep her patience it was not often that she felt in a penitent mood and he did not seem disposed to make it any easier for her  do you suppose new dresses are a matter of vital importance to me she asked  well answered hunter since you put the question several things almost lead me to believe it  he turned abruptly toward the steps  if you are coming with me we may as well go along  they crossed the wet paddock together and now and then florence glanced covertly at her husbands face it was set and anxious but there was no sign of surrender in it she had however not expected to see the latter for she knew that elcot was one who could when occasion demanded it make a very stubborn fight  at length they stopped and stood looking out across what at sunset had been a vast sea of tall green wheat now it had gone down parts of it as before the knife of a reaper while the rest lay crushed and flung this way and that as though an army had marched through it lush blades and halfformed ears were smashed into the mire and the odd clusters of battered stalks that stood leaning above the tangled chaos only served to heighten the suggestion of widespread ruin  florence watched her husband but she did not care to speak for there are times when expressions of sympathy are superfluous when he walked slowly forward along the edge of the grain she followed him without noticing that her thin shoes were saturated and her light skirt was trailing in the harsh wet grass the ground rose slightly and stopping when they reached the highest point he answered her inquiring glance  it looks pretty bad he said some of ita very littlemay fill out and ripen and we might get the binders through it but the things going to be difficult  will this hit you very hard elcot  hunter turned and looked at her with gravely searching eyes and she shrank from his gaze while a warmth crept into her face  oh she broke out indignantly im not thinkingnowof what i might have to do without still i suppose it was only natural that you should suspect it  the mans gesture seemed to imply that this was after all a matter of minor importance and it jarred on her  well he answered i guess i can weather the trouble though it will mean a long stiff pull and a general whittling down of expenses i spent most of last night figuring on the latter and ive got my plans worked out though it was troublesome to see where i was to begin  florences heart smote her her allowance was a liberal one but she knew it would only be when every other expedient had failed that he would think of touching that it would have been a relief to tell him he could begin with it but she remembered neviss loan the thought of that loan was becoming a burden and she felt that it must be wiped off somehow at any cost  yes she sympathized it must have been difficult you dont spend much money unnecessarily elcot  he did not answer and she glanced at his hands which were hard and roughened like those of a workman there was an untended red gash which the fence had made across the back of one another glance at his clothing carried her a little farther along the same line of thought for his garments were old and shabby and faded by the weather  anyway he said apparently without having heeded her last observation im thankful i have no debts just now  it was an unconscious thrust but florence winced for it wounded her and she began to see how nevis had with deliberate purpose strengthened the barrier between her and her husband what was more she determined that the man should regret it why she had ever encouraged him she did not know but there was no doubt that she was anxious to get rid of him now she would have made an open confession about the loan then and there but the time was singularly inopportune it was out of the question that she should add to her husbands anxiety  after all it doesnt often hail she encouraged him another good year will set you straight again  the man seemed lost in thought but he looked up when she spoke  we can make a bid for it he replied i must have bigger and newer machines like most of the rest ive been too afraid of launching out and have clung to oldfashioned means there will have to be a change and a clearance before next season  it was very matteroffact but florence knew him well enough to realize what it implied defeat could not crush him it only nerved him to a more resolute fight for which he meant to equip himself at any sacrifice with more efficient weapons again she was conscious of a growing respect for him  im afraid i have been a drag on you elcot but in this case you can count upon my doingwhat i can  he scarcely seemed to hear her and she realized with a trace of bitter amusement that her assurance did not appear of any particular consequence to him  i have teams enough he continued picking up the course of thought where he had broken off anyway one should get something for the old machines  florence set her lips as they turned back toward the house this was a matter in which she evidently did not count but there was no doubt that in the light of past events the mans attitude was justified it would be necessary to prove that he was wrong and with neviss loan still to be met that promised to be difficult  elcot she said i dont think ive told you yet how sorry i am  he looked at her in a manner which implied that his mind was still busy with his plans  yesof course he replied     chapter xxi  a point of honor   florence hunter sat in her wagon in front of the grocery store at grahams bluff waiting until the man who kept it should bring out various goods she had ordered though a fresh breeze swept the surrounding prairie the little town was very hot and it looked singularly unattractive with the dust blowing through its one unpaved street in one place a gaily striped shade which flapped and fluttered in the wind had been stretched above the window of an ambitious store but with this exception the unlovely wooden buildings boldly fronted the weather with the sunglare on their thin rent boarding and the roofing shingles crackling overhead as they had done when they had borne the scourge of snowladen gales and the almost arctic frost they were square and squat as destitute most of them of paint as they were of any attempt at adornment and in hot weather the newer ones were permeated with a pungent resinous smell  where florence sat however the odors that flowed out of the store were more diffuse for the fragrance of perspiring cheese was mingled with that of pork which had gained flavor and lost its stiffness in the heat and the aroma of what was sold as coffee at grahams bluff florence indeed had been glad to escape from the store which resembled an oven with savory cooking going on though after all it was not a great deal better in the wagon the dust was beginning to gather in the folds of her dainty dress the wind plucked at her veil and the fierce sun smote her face  on the whole she was displeased with things in general and inclined to regret that she had driven into the settlement which she had done in a fit of compunction hitherto she had contented herself with sending the storekeeper an order for goods to be supplied without any attempt to investigate his charges but now with elcots harvest ruined it had appeared her duty to consider carefully the subject of housekeeping accounts she rather resented the fact that her first experiment had proved unpleasant for she had shrunk from the sight of the slabs of halfmelted pork flung down for her inspection and having hitherto shopped only in england and eastern canada she had found the naïve abruptness of the western storekeeper somewhat hard on her temper retail dealers in the prairie settlements seldom defer to their customers if the latter do not like their goods or charges they are generally favored with a hint that they would better go somewhere else and there is an end of the matter it really did not look as if much encouragement was held out to those who aspired to cultivate the domestic virtues at length the storekeeper appeared with several large packages  you want to cover this one up its the butter he cautioned guess youre going to have some trouble in keeping it in the wagon if the sun gets on to it better bring a big can next time same as your hired man does  the warning was justified because when the inexperienced customer brings nothing to put it in butter is usually retailed in light baskets made of wood in spite of the fact that it is addicted to running out of them in the heat of the day the man next deposited a heavy cotton bag in the wagon and while a thin cloud of flour which followed its fall descended upon florence he laid his hands on the wheel and looked at her confidentially  i guess if your husband meant to let up on that creamery scheme you would have heard of it he suggested  yes replied florence i dont think he has any intention of doing so  the man made a sign of assent  thats just what i was telling the boys last night there were two or three of them from traverse staying at the hotel and when we got to talking about the hail they allowed that hed have to cut the creamery plan out i said that when elcot hunter took a thing up he stayed with it until he put it through  his words had their effect on florence this it seemed was what the men who dealt with elcot thought of him after a few more general observations about the creamery her companion went back into his store and as he did so nevis came out of a house near by he stopped beside her team  i didnt know you were in the settlement he said and his manner implied that had he been acquainted with the fact he would have sought her out  florence glanced at him sharply as she gathered up the reins the man seemed disposed to be more amiable than he had shown himself on the last occasion but she now cherished two strong grievances against him he had cunningly saddled her with a debt which was becoming horribly embarrassing and he had given her husband a hint that she had dealings of some kind with him as the latter course was on the face of it clearly not calculated to earn her gratitude she surmised that he must have had some ulterior object in adopting it  ive been buying stores she answered indifferently  thats a new departure isnt it nevis suggested you generally contented yourself with sending in for them  florence did not like his tone and he seemed suspiciously well informed about her habits this indicated that he had been making inquiries about her and she naturally resented it she disregarded the speech however  i suppose youre here on business  yes answered nevis and there was something significant in his manner i thought it wiser to look up my clients after the hail we had two nights ago its going to make things very tight for many of the prairie farmers  and a disaster naturally brings you on the field rather like the vultures isnt it  she was about to drive on but nevis suddenly laid his hand on the rein  i think you ought to give me a minute or two if only to answer that he said with a laugh you compared me to a pickpocket not long ago and im not prepared to own that you have chosen a very fortunate simile now  no after the fact you mentioned it struck me as rather apposite but i may have been wrong the points hardly worth discussing and im going on to the hotel  she had expected him to take the hint and drop the rein but he showed no intention of doing so and it suddenly dawned on her that he meant to keep her talking as long as possible everybody in the settlement who cared to look out could see them and she had no doubt that the women in the place were keenly observant it almost seemed as if he wished the fact that they had a good deal to say to each other to attract attention with the idea that this might serve to give him a further hold on her it was an opposite policy to the one he had pursued when she had driven him across the prairie some time ago but the man had become bolder and more aggressive since then  will you let that rein go she asked directly  nevis did not comply and though he made a gesture of deprecation the look in his eyes warned her that he meant to let her feel his power  wont you give me an opportunity for convincing you that im not like the vultures first you see they gather round the carrion and i dont suppose you would care to apply that term to the farmers in our vicinity most of them arent more than moribund yet  it struck florence that he was indifferent as to whether she took offense at this or not and he was undoubtedly determined to stick fast to the rein there were already one or two loungers watching them and if he persisted she could not start the team without some highly undesirable display of force the man she fancied realized this and an angry warmth crept into her face then somewhat to her relief she saw thorne strolling down the street behind her companion he wore a battered wide gray hat a blue shirt which hung open at the neck duck trousers and long boots and though he was freely sprinkled with dust he looked distinctly picturesque what was more to the purpose he seemed to be regarding nevis with suspicion and she knew that he was a man of quick resource in any case the situation was becoming intolerable and she flashed a quick glance at him she fancied that he would understand it as an intimation that he was wanted and the expectation was justified for although she had never been gracious to him he approached a little faster in the meanwhile nevis who had seen nothing of all this talked on  there are of course he added people who are prejudiced against me but on the other hand i have set a good many of the small farmers on their feet again  presumably you made them pay for it  the man had no opportunity for answering this for just then thornes hand fell heavily upon his shoulder  you here nevis he cried  nevis dropped the rein as he swung around and florence wasted no time in starting her team as the wagon jolted away down the rutted street nevis standing still somewhat flushed in face gazed at thorne  well he demanded what do you want  thorne leaned against the front of the store with sardonic amusement in his eyes  oh he replied it merely occurred to me that mrs hunter wished to drive on i thought id better point it out to you  nevis glanced at him savagely and then strode away which was indeed all that he could do an altercation would serve no useful purpose and his antagonist was notoriously quick at repartee  thorne proceeded toward the wooden hotel and crossing the veranda he entered a long roughly boarded room where he found alison and mrs farquhar as well as florence hunter waiting for supper mrs farquhar told him that supper would be served to them before the regular customers came in for theirs they chatted a while and then a young lad appeared in the doorway and stopped hesitatingly  im sorry if im intruding he apologized i meant to have supper with the boys and symonds didnt tell me there was anybody in the room  thorne turned to mrs farquhar and she smiled  then unless you would prefer to take it with the boys dave theres no reason why you should run away he said  he led the lad toward alison when mrs farquhar had spoken to him  i think you will remember him miss leigh hes the young man who boiled the fowls whole at the raising  alison laughed and shook hands with him but after a word or two with her he looked at thorne significantly and moved a few paces toward the door  did you know that winthrop was in the neighborhood he whispered  alison still stood near them and thorne fancied that she started slightly which implied that she had overheard though why the news should cause her concern was far from clear to him  i didnt he said sharply its a little difficult to believe it now youre quite sure  i saw him the lad persisted i was riding here along the trail and id come to the ravine its quite likely the birches had hidden me for when i came out of them he was sitting on the edge of the sloo on the south side near enough for me to recognize him eating something the next moment he rolled over into the grass and vanished  then you didnt speak to him  he was too quick it looked as if he didnt want me to see him and i rode on i had to call at forresters and i found corporal slaney there one or two things he said made it clear that he hadnt the faintest notion that winthrop was within a mile or two of him  he was apparently about to add something further when thorne looked at him warningly they were standing near the entrance the approach to which led through the veranda and the next moment nevis walked into the room  have you been picking up interesting news he asked i believe i caught winthrops name  it was spoken sharply in the expectation thorne fancied that his companion taken off his guard would blurt out some fresh information but the lad turned toward nevis with an air of cold resentment  i was talking to mr thorne he replied  nevis laughed though thorne noticed that he did not do it easily  well he said im sorry if i interrupted you  then he turned toward the others as if he had just noticed them  i didnt know that symonds had placed the room at your disposal ive no doubt that will excuse me  nobody invited him to remain but he withdrew gracefully and when he had gone thorne led the lad out on to the veranda it was unoccupied but as it stood some little height above the ground he walked to the edge of it and looked over before he spoke  now dave i want you to tell me one or two things as clearly as you can  the lad answered his questions and in a minute or two thorne nodded as if satisfied then he pointed to the room  go in and talk to mrs farquhar keep clear of nevis and ride home as soon as you can after supper if you feel compelled to mention the thing theres no reason why you shouldnt tomorrow it wont do much harm then  he went down the steps and along the street and when he came back some time later he found alison waiting for him on the veranda  so you heard what dave told me i thought you did he said  yes assented alison the question is whether nevis heard him too  he certainly heard part but there are one or two things he cant very well know for instance it was slaneys intention to ride in to the railroad as soon as hed had supper  forresters place must be at least two leagues from here commented alison  about that thorne agreed with a smile its far enough to make it exceedingly probable that anybody who started from this settlement when hed had his supper would only get there after winthrop had gone  but nevis might send a messenger immediately  thorne shook his head  it strikes me as very unlikely that hed get any one to go there are only one or two horses in the place and ive been round to see the men to whom they belong  alisons eyes sparkled approvingly  but suppose he goes himself  he wont until after supper nevis is not the man to deny himself unless it seems absolutely necessary and hell naturally assume that slaney is spending the night with forrester but theres a certain probability of his setting out immediately after the meal  and what are you going to do about it  thornes expression became regretful  im very much afraid i cant do anything you see thearrangementwith corporal slaney stands in the way  you never thought that winthrop would come back here when you made it alison suggested  no acknowledged thorne the point is that the corporal didnt either  alison appeared to reflect and he watched her with quiet amusement  ive changed my mind about winthrop she told him at length i want him to get away  thorne made no answer and she continued  lucy calvert is no doubt a good deal more anxious than i am that he should escape and it would be only natural if you wished to earn her thanks i think she could be very nice and her eyes are wonderfully blue  thorne met her inquiring gaze with one of contemplative scrutiny  yours he said are usually delightfully still and graylike a pool on a moorland stream at home under a faintly clouded sky but now and then they gleam with a golden light as the water does when the sun comes through  his companion hastily abandoned that line of attack his defense was too vigorous for her to follow it up  you feel that your hands are absolutely tied by the hint you gave slaney that afternoon she asked  thats how it strikes me thorne declared in this case im afraid ill have to stand aside and content myself with looking on  but havent you already made it difficult for nevis to get a messenger  ive certainly given a couple of men a hint that id rather they didnt do any errand of his tonight that may have been going too fari cant tell he paused and laughed softly except when its a case of selling patent medicines im not a casuist  alison realized his point of view and in several ways it appealed to her he had treated the matter humorously but though so little had been said by either of the men it was clear that he felt he had pledged himself to slaney and was not to be moved  well she urged somebody must stop nevis from driving over to forresters  it would be very desirable thorne admitted dryly the most annoying thing is that it could have been managed with very little trouble  how alison asked with assumed indifference  thorne suspecting nothing fell into the trap  neviss hired buggy is a rather rickety affair it wouldnt astonish anybody if when he wished to start there was a bolt short  a look of satisfaction flashed into alisons eyes  then he will certainly have to put up with any trouble the absence of that bolt is capable of causing as there doesnt seem to be any other way ill pull it out myself your scruples wont compel you to forbid me  the man expostulated but she was quietly determined  if you wont tell me what to do ill get dave she laughed ive no doubt hed be willing to help me  thorne thought it highly undesirable that they should take a third person into their confidence and he reluctantly yielded  then he advised it would be wiser to set about it while the boys are getting supper therell be nobody about the back of the hotel then in the meanwhile wed better go in again and talk to the others     chapter xxii  alison spoils her gloves   mrs farquhar and her friends had finished supper and the men who got their meals there were trooping into the hotel when alison found thorne waiting on the veranda  youre ready i suppose  ive no intention of keeping you waiting anyway thorne replied  alison looked at him with a hint of sharpness  if you would very much rather stay here why should you come at all now that you have told me what to do it really isnt necessary  thorne smiled  well he said on the whole it strikes me as advisable  he walked down the steps with her and sauntering a few yards along the street they turned down an opening between the houses and stopped at the back of the hotel there were only two windows in that part of the building and the rude wooden stable would shield anybody standing close beneath one side of it from observation several gigs stood there to wait until their owners were ready to drive back to their outlying farms and behind them the graywhite prairie ran back into the distance empty and unbroken except for the riband of rutted trail there was no sound from the hotel for the average westerner eats in silent strenuous haste and the two could hear only the movements of a restless horse in the stable  alison walked up to a somewhat dilapidated buggy and inspected it dubiously  this must be the one and i suppose thats the bolt she said there seems to be a big nut beneath it and i dont quite see how im to get it off would your scruples prevent your making any suggestion  thorne appeared to consider though there was a twinkle in his eyes  i might go so far as to point out that if you went into the stable you would find a spanner on the ledge behind the door its an instrument thats made for screwing off nuts with  alison disappeared into the stable and came back with the spanner in her hand thorne noticed that she had put on a pair of rather shabby light gloves with the object he supposed of protecting her fingers stooping down behind the buggy she stretched out an arm beneath the seat and became desperately busy to judge from the tapping and clinking she made then she straightened herself and looked up at him hot and a trifle flushed  it wont go on to the nut she complained is it quite out of the question that you should help me  she saw the constraint in his face and was pleased with it she did not wish the man to break his pledge and it is probable that she would have refused his assistance but she was on the other hand very human in most respects and she greatly desired to ascertain how strong the temptation to help her was  in the first place you might try turning the screw on the spanner a little he advised it will make the opening wider  she did so and had no more difficulty on that point but the bolt was rusty and the nut very stiff while she struggled with it there was a sound of footsteps and thorne moving suddenly forward snatched the tool from her  stay there until i make it possible for you to slip away he whispered sharply then he stepped swiftly back a few paces and leaned against a wagon with the spanner in his hand  he had scarcely done so when a man came out of the opening between the houses and alison felt her heart throb unpleasantly fast if the newcomer should look around toward the stables it seemed impossible that he should fail to notice thorne the latter however stood quietly still with his shoulders resting against the wagon wheel and the spanner in full view in front of him the other man drew abreast of them but he did not look around and alison gasped with relief when he vanished behind one of the neighboring buildings  then she turned impulsively to her companion  oh she cried you meant him to see you  thorne raised his hand in expostulation  hadnt you better get the thing out before somebody else comes along  there was no doubt that he was right in this and alison attacked the nut again in two or three more minutes she moved away from the buggy with the bolt in her hand  what had i better do with it she asked  i might suggest dropping it into a thick clump of grass if you dont mind well stroll out a little way on the prairie theres too much dust to be pleasant blowing down the street  they had left the wooden buildings some distance behind when alison next spoke to him  that was a generous thing you did just now  thorne looked confused but he made no attempt to evade an answer  it was necessary  if the man had seen you with the spanner corporal slaney would no doubt have heard of it afterward that would have hurt you  it certainly wouldnt have pleased me  then why did you do what you did  i think i have just told you  you said it was necessary replied alison looking at him with eyes which just then had what he thought a very wonderful light in them you havent convinced me that it wasntrather fine of you  thorne was manifestly more embarrassed and embarrassment of any kind was somewhat unusual with him  then he said you compel me to try if we had remained standing as we did when the man first came out from behind the houses and he had noticed you its exceedingly probable that he would have noticed me even if he hadnt its almost certain that several people must have seen you leave the hotel in my company they wouldnt have had much trouble in figuring out the thing  of course exclaimed alison a little astonished that this had not occurred to her earlier then her face grew suddenly warm you mean they would have recognized that i was actingon your instructions  thorne looked at her with a disconcerting steadiness  you havent quite grasped the most important fact yet they would have wondered how i was able to get you to do itin other words what gave me such a hold on you the trouble is that theres an explanation that would naturally suggest itself  yes murmured alison with her eyes turned away from him that would have been unpleasantfor both of us  thorne did not quite know what to make of the pause though he had a shadowy idea that it somehow rendered her assertion less positive and left the point open to doubt in any case it set his heart beating fast and he had some trouble in holding himself in hand outwardly however he was graver than usual  well he added i didnt think it desirable in several ways you see a pedler is after all a person of no account in this part of canada he has no particular interest in the fortune of the country he doesnt help its progress his calling benefits nobody  but you are a farmer now protested alison glancing at him covertly  strictly on probation in fact theres very little doubt that my new venture is generally regarded as a harmless eccentricity it will be some time before my neighbors realize that im capable of anything thats not connected with an amusing frolic he stopped a moment and smiled at her on the whole i cant reasonably blame them my situations a very precarious one a frozen crop would break me  alison wondered what the drift of these observations could be for she imagined that he must have had some particular purpose in saying so much it was so far as her experience went a very unusual thing for a man to confess that he was an object of amusement to his neighbors or that there was a probability of his failing to make his mark in his profession  i suppose she suggested to help him out youre not content with such a state of things  that is just the point its my intention to alter it as soon as possible and a bonanza harvest this year would go a long way toward setting me on my feet in the meanwhile it seems only fitting that i should put up with popular opinion and try to bear in mind my disabilities  he was far from explicit but explicitness was after all not what alison desired and she fancied she understood him it had not been without a sufficient reason that he had to his friends astonishment turned farmer and now he meant to wait until he had made a success of it and had shown that he could hold his own with the best of them before going any farther this naturally suggested the question as to what he meant to do then and she fancied that she could supply the answer she had already confessed to herself that she liked the man and this was sufficient for the time being  i heard that your wheat escaped as farquhars did  thorne glancing at her surmised that this was a lead and that he was not expected to pursue the previous subject  yes he replied im thankful to say it did most of the grain a few miles to the west of us was blotted out including huntersim sorry for him the storm seems to have traveled straight down into dakota destroying everything in its path my place lay just outside it and at present everything promises a record crop he broke off and glanced down at her hands have you noticed your glove  alison held it up and displayed a large rusty stain across the palm and part of the back of it  yes she answered i did that getting the bolt out and im rather vexed about it mrs farquhar will no doubt notice the stain and i dont feel anxious to explain how it was done  then youll have to take the glove off advised thorne  alison smiled  im not sure that simple expedient would get over the difficulty of course i might leave them behind altogether then she shook her head no the person who found them would see the stain and guess whose they were i dont think that would do either  it wouldnt thorne agreed  then they began to talk of something else and presently they turned back together toward the hotel when they reached it florence hunter and mrs farquhar were sitting on the veranda while two or three men occupied the lower steps and another group lounged about near them pipe in hand a few minutes later nevis appeared striding down the street with his lips set and some signs of temper he stopped in front of the hotel and alison glanced at thorne significantly when he turned to the lounging men  you folks seem mighty prosperous in spite of the hail he sneered i cant find a man in this town whos open to earn a couple of dollars  some of them grinned but none made any answer his tone was offensive in the first place and while nobody is overburdened with riches on the prairie the average westerner has his own ideas as to what is becoming  nevis signed to one of them  get my buggy bill  the man hesitated and though he strolled off toward the stables neviss sharpness cost him several minutes unnecessary delay eventually the buggy was brought out and nobody said anything when nevis got in and flicked the horse smartly with a whip though the tilt of the seat must have been evident to most of the lookerson alison touched thornes arm  hadnt you better call to him she suggested  the next moment the warning was rendered unnecessary for there was a crash and the seat of the buggy collapsed nevis lurched violently forward but he managed to recover his balance and pull up the horse then he swung himself down and after crawling under the vehicle stood up with a frowning face while the loungers began to gather about him  theres a bolt out i didnt notice it when i drove up he grumbled its threeeighths by the hole i think ask bill if hes got anything of the kind in the stable  bill who had been standing near sauntered away and it was at least five minutes before he came back emptyhanded  ive nothing that will fit he announced  then go in and see if theyve got one at the hardware store ordered nevis i ought to have thought of that earlier  bill was away a long while this time and when he returned he held up an unusually long bolt for inspection  guess it wont be any use he said thread doesnt go far enough to let the nut to the plate  then what in thunder did you bring it for nevis asked with rising anger  alison looked at thorne and laughed  have you been giving that man a hint she inquired  no answered thorne smiling it would have been wasted in any case nevis has succeeded in riling him he couldnt have managed the thing better if i had prompted him  in the meanwhile bill languidly affected to consider neviss question  i guess i wanted to be quite sure it wouldnt fit he replied at length if it doesnt i could see if he has got a shorter one in another package  nevis flung out his arms in savage expostulation  well he cried ive never yet struck anybody quite as thick as you couldnt you have brought the shorter one along  those bolts bill answered solemnly dont run many to the dollar and id a kind of notion i might find a big nut or some washers i could fill up with in the stables  no snapped nevis you have wasted time enough if it wont do take the thing back into the store and ask bevan to cut the thread farther along it  bill strolled away at a particularly leisurely gait and thorne took out his watch  its highly probable that slaney will have left forresters before our friend gets off he said in that case it will no doubt be noon tomorrow before the police make their first attempt to get on winthrops trail i wonder whether anybody except dave can have seen him  i did alison told him the morning before the hail  thorne turned toward her with a start  where  at the homestead farquhar and his wife were out  what brought winthrop there  that smiled alison i may tell you some day but not just now i wonder what has kept him in the neighborhood  its easily figured out hed head for mrs calverts and probably stay an hour or two there then hed go on to braytons placetheyre friendsat night jardines would be his next call and hed be striking west away from the larger settlements when dave came across him  this struck alison as probable but just then bill came out of the store again  beavan hasnt anything shorter and hes doing up his accounts he cant cut threads on bolts anyway he announced its pete who does that kind of thing for him  judging from his face it cost nevis a determined effort to check an outbreak of fury  then where in thunder is pete he shouted  it appeared that the man had gone home to supper and a quarter of an hour passed before he came upon the scene then it took him quite as long to operate on the bolt and fit it in the buggy and neviss face was very hot and red when he flung himself into the vehicle he used the whip savagely and there was some derisive applause and laughter when the horse went down the street at a gallop with the buggy jolting dangerously in the ruts behind it  thorne descended the steps and disappeared when he came back mrs farquhars wagon was being brought out and he walked up to alison with a parcel in his hand  i think he said thats the best way of hiding the stain  alison opened the parcel and was conscious of a curious thrill in which pleasure and embarrassment were mingled when she found a pair of gloves inside it was the first gift he had made her  thank you she murmured they fit me too how did you guess the size  oh laughed thorne it was very simple i just asked for the smallest pair they had in the store  then mrs farquhar came up and he helped her and alison into the wagon     chapter xxiii  an unexpected disaster   several weeks had slipped away since the evening nevis drove out of grahams bluff in search of corporal slaney and there had been no news of winthrop when thorne plodded across the prairie beside his team hauling in a load of dressed lumber for the new creamery hunter had contracted with him to convey the necessary material from the railroad and in the interval between sowing and reaping thorne had found the arrangement a profitable one he had a use for every dollar he could raise and all through the heat of the summer he had worked double tides  it was blazing hot that afternoon and the wide plain lay scorching under a pitiless glare thorne was not sorry when the farquhar homestead with its encircling sea of wheat took shape ahead the trail led past it and though time was precious to him then he felt that he could put up with an hour or twos delay in case mrs farquhar invited him to wait for supper it was now a fortnight since he had seen alison  the wooden buildings rose very slowly though he several times urged the jaded horses they had made a long haul that day and the man who had trudged at their head since early morning was almost as weary on the odd days that they had spent in the stable he had toiled arduously on his house and halffinished barn beginning with the dawn and ceasing at dark now he was grimed with dust and dripping with perspiration and a tantalizing cloud of flies hovered over him all this was a decided change from driving a few hours daily in a lightly loaded wagon but what at first had appeared an almost unexplainable liking for the constant effort had grown upon him he would not have abandoned it now had that course been open to him  by degrees the sea of grain grew nearer its edge rising in a cleancut ridge above the flat white sweep of dazzling plain it had changed from green to pale yellow in the past few weeks but there were here and there vivid coppery gleams in it it promised a bounteous yield when thrashing was over and he thought of his own splendid crop with the clean pride of accomplishment then he noticed that a buggy was approaching from the opposite direction and when he reached the homestead a man in white shirt and store clothes had just pulled up his horse he shook hands with thorne who had already recognized him as a dealer in implements and general farming supplies from the railroad settlement  glad i met you it will save my going on to your place he said  thorne noticed that the man who was usually optimistic and cheerful looked depressed  did you want to see me about something grantly he asked  yes to cut it short im going out of business  the full significance of this announcement did not immediately dawn upon thorne  i expect most of the boys will regret it as much as i do he said one could rely on anything sent out from your store and theres no doubt that you have always treated us liberally  thats just the trouble ive been too blamed easy with some of you if id kept a tighter hand on the folks who owed me money its quite likely id have been able to meet my bills  is it as bad as that thorne inquired with genuine sympathy  grantly turned to farquhar who had joined them in the meanwhile  the fact is things have been going against me the last three years nevis has been steadily cutting into my trade but i held on somehow expecting that a record harvest or a high market would put me straight id have been able to get some of my money in again then in the meanwhile i was getting behind with the makers who supplied me and now one or two of them have pulled me up i guess it was the hail that decided them its a private compromise but the point is that nevis takes over my liabilities  thornes face suddenly hardened and farquhar looked grave  its bad news said the latter is he paying cash  part grantly answered the rest in bills he has brand of winnipeg behind him and hes good enough in fact i believe the man has been backing nevis right along he turned to thorne anyway ive got to give the store up and youll have nevis for a creditor instead of me thats really what brought me over the note you gave me calls for a good many dollars and its due very soon  thorne endeavored to brace himself after the blow which had been as unexpected as it was heavy he had obtained all his implements and most of the materials he required for his housebuilding from grantly giving him a claim upon his possessions as security in addition to a promise to pay at a date by which harvest was usually over but owing to an exceptionally cold spring harvest was late that year  it was understood that you wouldnt press me if i should be a few weeks behind he reminded him  thats quite right grantly assented the trouble is that it was only a verbal promise and it wont count for much with nevis hes been after you for some time and i guess hell stick to the date on the note if youre not ready with the money hell break you  farquhar made a sign of concurrence  im afraid its very probable what are you going to do about it mavy  thorne stood silent for almost a minute and the bronze faded a little in his face which was very grim  that note will have to be met you told grantly i was to be relied upon and im not going back on you its not my intention to let nevis do what he likes with me either in a general way id have gone to hunter and ive no doubt that he would have financed me but thats quite out of the question now he has all the trouble hes fit to stand on his hands already  a sure thing farquhar agreed  well thorne added the oats are about ripe and though id rather they had stood another week or so ill put the binder into them at sunup tomorrow the wheat should be nearly ready by the time im through and ill hire the help i could have borrowed if i had been able to wait a while ill have to let up on the haulage contract and work right on almost without stopping until i can get the thrashers in but ill put the crop on the market before the note is due  you couldnt do it mavy if you worked all night  thorne laughed in a harsh fashion  just wait and see it has to be done in the meanwhile please make my excuses to mrs farquhar for not calling i must be getting on  you cant do anything tonight farquhar objected  i can ride over to halls and get back to my place by sunup with his team  he called to his horses and with a creaking of suddenly tightened harness the wagon jolted on but as he passed the door of the homestead alison came out thorne stopped while the team slowly plodded forward and it seemed to her that there was a striking change in the man nothing in his manner suggested that he had ever regarded life as a frolic and taken his part in it with careless gaiety his eyes were very grave and there was a look she had never seen in them before while his face seemed to have set in sharper lines he looked strangely determined and forceful almost as she thought of it dominant  what is the matter you are in some trouble she exclaimed  yes said thorne simply farquhar will no doubt explain the thing theres a very tough fight in front of me i dont think i could have undertaken it six months ago he spread out his hands its unthinkable that i should be beaten  alison felt strangely stirred by something in his voice  then she urged you will have to win you must i want you to  thorne looked at her with a gleam in his eyes that set her heart throbbing painfully fast  now he laughed the thing seems almost easy  he turned away after his wagon and alison waited until farquhar came up with grantly  what has thorne undertaken she asked  farquhar smiled  ill try to tell you after supper in the meanwhile i can only say that he seems determined on breaking himself up by attempting a task that in my opinion is beyond the power of any man on the prairie  he went into the house with grantly and it was an hour or two later before alison was able to form a fairly accurate idea of the situation then her heart grew very soft toward thorne and she thought of him with a sense of pride it was for her sake he had braced himself for this most unequal fight and she knew that he meant to win  in the meanwhile thorne was urging on his team and dusk was closing in when he flung down the lumber from his wagon after that he drove through the soft darkness for two or three hours and finally roused an outlying neighbor from his wellearned slumber the man descending roundly abused him but became a little mollified when he heard his story  the thing surely cant be done and just now you cant count on much help either the ontario boys are only just starting west and the first of them will be snapped up before they get to brandon anyway ill come along with you and do what i can he moved toward a cupboard if you left farquhars when you said you couldnt have got your supper  now that you mention it laughed thorne i dont think i did  his friend set food before him and an hour later they drove off in the darkness leaving thornes jaded team behind them eventually they reached his homestead in the early dawn and thorne who had been on foot most of the time since sunrise on the previous morning sat down wearily on the stoop and took out his pipe while he looked about him eager as he was to get to work he could not begin just yet for the night had been clear and cold and the grain was dripping with the heavy dew  he had his back to the house which was at last almost ready for habitation but the halffinished barn and the rude sod stable rose before him blackly against the growing light beyond these the sweep of grain stretched back a darker patch on the shadowy prairie with another dusky oblong just discernible on the short grass some distance away determined as he was his heart sank as he gazed at them he had undertaken a task that looked utterly beyond his powers  had he been content to begin on his hundredandsixtyacre holding on the scale usual in the case of men with scanty means he would probably have had no great trouble in harvesting all the crop he could have raised but he had seen enough during his journeyings up and down the prairie to convince him that there was remarkably little to be made in this fashion as a result he had staked boldly breaking practically all his land with hired assistance and the most modern implements that could be purchased though this necessitated the borrowing of money he had in addition secured the use of a neighboring holding part of which had been under grain before from a man who had worked it long enough to secure his patent and had then discovered that he could earn considerably more as a subcontractor on a new branch railroad  in consequence of this thorne had a large crop to garner and very little time in which to do it for he was convinced that nevis would press for payment immediately the note was due it could not be met until the grain was thrashed and sold and he realized that any delay would place him in the power of a man who would not fail to make the utmost use of the opportunity besides this it would render it impossible for him to obtain any further loans and he scarcely expected to finance his operations unassisted for some time yet it was only hunters guarantee that had made the venture possible and there was no doubt in his mind that unless he could satisfy neviss claim his career as a farmer would terminate abruptly before the next month was over  then he recalled the months of determined labor he had expended upon the house and holding the noonday heat in which he had toiled and the chilly dawns when he had gone out aching all over after a very insufficient sleep to begin his task again sixteen and often eighteen hours comprised his working day and out of them he had spared very few minutes for cookery his clothes had gone unmended and it must be confessed that he had not infrequently slept in them when he was too weary to take them off and that they were by no means regularly washed in fact once or twice when he was about to drive over to the farquhar homestead he remembered with a slight shock that it was several days since he had made any attempt worth mentioning at a toilet in the meanwhile he had grown leaner and harder and browner while there had by degrees crept into his face that curious look which one may see now and then in the faces of monks highly trained athletes and even of those who unconsciously practise asceticism from love of a calling that makes stern demands on them a look which though it does not always suggest the final triumph of the mind over the body is never a characteristic of fullfed easeloving men his eyes were strikingly clear and unwavering his weatherdarkened skin was singularly clean and his whole face had grown as it were refined though the man was as quickly moved to anger impatience or laughter as he had always been it would seem that a good many purely human impulses usually survive the partial subjugation of the flesh which is after all no doubt fortunate  he rose stiffly damp with the dew when he had smoked one pipe out and gazed toward where the sun was rising fiery red above the rim of the prairie his expression was very resolute  a low dawn hall well have all the heat we want by noon he commented the oats will be drying by the time were ready with the team if youll look after them ill oil the binder  his companion grinned  it strikes me the first thing is to set the stove going guess if im going to get on a record hustle i want my breakfast  thorne frowned impatiently but he carried an armful of birch billets into the house and when half an hour later he called in his companion the latter glanced with undisguised disgust at the provisions on the table and the contents of the fryingpan  well he ejaculated if you can raise steam on that kind of truck i most certainly cant the first of the boys who drives by to the settlement is going to bring us out something fit to eat if i have to pay for it  whats the matter with this thorne asked indifferently  hall raised a fragment of halfraw pork upon his fork  it would be wasting time to tell you if you cant smell it he retorted  then he took up a block of bread and banged it down on the table  not a crack in it you want to bake some more and sell it to the railroad for locomotive brakes  thorne laughed  send for anything you like hunters hired man will probably be going in     chapter xxiv  lucy goes to the rescue   about four oclock in the afternoon of the day following the beginning of his harvest thorne sat heavyeyed in the saddle of a binder which three horses hauled along the edge of the grain he had been at work since sunrise except for a brief rest at midday and he was wondering whether the team could hold out until nightfall the binder had not quite reached its present efficiency then and the traction was heavy it was fiercely hot and there was only the faintest breeze while a thin cloud of dust that made his eyes smart and crept into his nostrils eddied about him the whirling wooden arms of the machine flashed in the midst of it as they flung out the sheaves and there was a sharp clash and tinkle as the knife rasped through the tall oat stalks  as he neared a corner driving wearily he turned and glanced back along the rows of piledup sheaves which stood blazing with light down the belt of gleaming stubble the latter was narrow for although it was the result of two days determined labor he had somehow accomplished less than he had anticipated half the time he had spent turn about with hall in the saddle and the rest gathering up the tossedout sheaves in the wake of the machine it was desirable to keep pace with the binder though the task is one that is beyond the strength of a single man in a heavy crop and it was only by toiling with a savage persistency that he and his companion had partially accomplished it now however his heart sank as he looked round at the sea of grain  it rose in a great oblong glowing with tints of ochre silvery gray and cadmium relieved here and there by coppery flashes and delicate pencilings of warm sienna and over it there hung a cloudless vault of blue it looked very large and there was another oblong yet unbroken some distance away thornes head ached and his eyes ached and his back hurt him at each jolt of the machine he had been almost wornout when he began the task and since then he had lain down for only a few hours and then had not been able to sleep  beyond the grain the prairie stretched away intolerably white in the sunglare to the horizon thorne fancied that he had seen a moving object upon it some time earlier the machine had however engrossed most of his attention and he was not sure he reached the turning and was proceeding away from the house when a voice hailed him and as he pulled up the team lucy calvert appeared  what brought you over he asked in dull astonishment  lucy smiled coquettishly  its generally allowed that you and i are friends anyway if youd rather i can go home again  thorne looked at her with drawndown brows he was wornout his brain was heavy and he did not feel equal to any attempt at repartee  you had better stop for supper first he suggested  i guess im going to lucy laughed still you wont want it for two hours yet and it looks as if theres something to be done in the meanwhile i didnt come over for supper or to talk to you i met farquhar on the prairie and he told me all about the thing  she turned and pointed to a row of sheaves which were still lying prone  why havent you got those on end wheres hall  gone over to his place for my team  then said lucy you can get off that machine right now and set the sheaves up while i drive ill stay on until its too dark to see and come round again first thing in the morning we dont expect to get our binders in for a week yet  thorne was touched and his face made it plain he needed assistance badly and did not know where to obtain it for his friends whose crops the hail had spared were either beginning their own harvest or preparing for it besides there was not the slightest doubt that lucy was capable  get down right away she ordered laughingly i dont want thanks fromyou  thorne was never sure afterward whether he attempted to offer her any but he set to work among the sheaves when she took her place in the saddle and the binder went clinking and clashing on again in spite of his efforts it drew farther and farther away though he toiled in halfbreathless haste and the perspiration dripped from him as he was facing then the sun beat upon his back and shoulders intolerably hot at length when the shadows of the stooked sheaves had lengthened across the crackling stubble in which he floundered lucy stopped her team a moment and looked back at him  ill unyoke them at the corner and get supper she said you get into the shade there and lie down and smoke if i see you move before i call you ill go home again  she drove away before he could protest but it was after all a relief to obey her and flinging himself down with his back to a cluster of the sheaves he took out his pipe it was a little cooler there and his eyes were closing when a summons reached him across the grain getting up with an effort he walked toward the house and was hazily astonished when he entered it exactly what lucy had done he could not tell but the place looked different for the first time it seemed comfortably habitable there was a cloth which was a thing he did not possess on the table and his simple crockery which shone absolutely white and his indurated ware made a neat display the provisions laid out on it looked tempting too in fact he did not think that hall could have found any fault with them and it presently struck him that they included articles which he did not remember purchasing  he sat down when lucy told him to and it was pleasant to find what he required ready at hand instead of having to walk backward and forward between the table and the stove he did not remember what she said but they both laughed every now and then and after the meal was over he was content to sit still a while when she bade him the presence of the girl somehow changed the whole aspect of the room but he was conscious of a regret that it was she and not another who occupied the place opposite him across his table it was not lucy calvert he had often pictured sitting there at length he pointed through the doorway to the grain  lucy he said that crop doesnt look by any means as hard to reap as it did an hour ago  i guess its the supper lucy suggested cheerfully  i dont think its that exactly though theres no doubt its the best meal ive had for a considerable time  lucy leaned back in her chair  well she observed its company you want and its quite nice being here you and i kind of hit it dont we mavy  of course we always did thorne assented though there was a hint of astonishment in his tone  then if youll get rid of hallsend him off again for somethingill get supper for you the next two or three evenings  i dont see why he should be done out of his share protested thorne cautiously he felt that lucy was more gracious than there was any occasion for  dont you mavy she asked with lifted brows now ive a notion that anybody else would kind of spoil things  until lately thorne had seldom shrunk from any harmless gallantry but he did not respond just then with the readiness which the girl seemed to expect  its a relief to hear you say it he declared im afraid im a dull companion tonight  lucy nodded sympathetically  well she replied i have seen you brighter but youre anxious and played out sit nice and still for half an hour while i talk to you  i ought to be stooking those sheaves thorne answered dubiously  you can do it by and by lucy urged it wont be dark for quite a while yet  she adroitly led him on to talk and presently bade him light his pipe he had always hated any unnecessary reserve and ceremony and by degrees his natural gaiety once more asserted itself at length when they were both laughing over a narrative of his he stretched his arm out across the table and it happened by merest accident that their hands met lucy did not draw hers away she looked up at him with a smile  mavy she teased i wonder what miss leigh would say if she could see you  thorne straightened himself somewhat hastily in his chair nothing in the shape of a tactful answer occurred to him and he grew uneasy under his companions smile  would you like to see her walk right in just now she persisted  there was no doubt that this would not have afforded the man the slightest pleasure but he could not admit it  its scarcely likely to happen he evaded awkwardly  then to his relief lucy laughed  mavy ive sure got you fixed the curious thing is they allow at the settlement that you could most talk the head off any of the boys  i really dont see what satisfaction you expected it to afford you thorne rejoined  i guessed it would help to put nevis out of your mind id an idea you wanted cheering upand i felt a little like that myself  the girls manner changed abruptly as she rose and there was only concern in her eyes  i wonder she added softly where jake is and what he is doing now  thorne felt that he had been favored with a hint  you havent heard from him  he hasnt sent a line it wouldnt have been safe its kind of wearing mavy  im sorry sympathized thorne but its most unlikely that the troopers will get him  lucy without answering this went out and when they reached the binder thorne turned to her with a smile  lucy he said i dont quite understand yet what possessed you a little while ago  did you never feel so worried that it was kind of soothing to do something mad  im afraid i have once or twice thorne confessed on the other hand my experience wouldnt justify me in advising other people to indulge in outbreaks of the kind suppose id beenwell say equal to the occasion  lucy laughed but there was a snap in her eyes  then she retorted its a sure thing you would never have tried to be equal to it again anyway i didnt feel anxious about you you looked real amusing mavy  perhaps i did still i dont quite think you need have pointed it out  they set to work after this lucy guiding the team along the edge of the grain and thorne stooping among the sheaves in the wake of the machine they were thus engaged oblivious to everything but their task when mrs farquhar reined in her team close beside them and alison gazed with somewhat confused sensations at the pair  lucy had obviously made her dress herself of the cheapest kind of print but it was light in hue as was her big hat and in addition to falling in with the flood of vivid color through which she moved it flowed about her in becoming lines and when she pulled up her horses and turned partly toward the wagon her pose was expressive of a curious virile grace behind her straightcut along its paler upper edge where the feathery tassels of the oats shone with a silvery luster against the cold blue of the sky the yellow grain glowed in the warm evening light the glaring vermilion paint on the binder added to the general effect and it occurred to alison that the girl with her brown face and hands and the signs of a splendid vitality plain upon her was very much in harmony with her surroundings the lean figure of the man stooping among the sheaves lightly clad in blue that had lost its harshness by long exposure to the weather formed a fit and necessary complement of the picture  they were alison recognized engaged upon humanitys most natural and beneficent task and as she remembered how she had seen that soil lying waste covered only with the harsh wild grasses in the early spring it was borne in upon her that there could be no greater reward than the bounteous harvest for mans arduous toil then she became troubled by a vague perception of the fact that this breaking of the wilderness and rendering the good soil fruitful was one of the sternest and most real tests of mans efficiency meretricious graces paltry accomplishments and the pretenses of civilization availed one nothing here the only things that counted were the elemental qualities slow endurance faith that held fast through all the vagaries of the weather and the power of toughened muscle that might ache but must in spite of that yield due obedience to the will alison regarded lucy who could play her part in the reaping with a troubled feeling that was not far from envy  then thorne looked up partly dazzled with the level sunrays in his eyes and walked toward the wagon when he stopped beside it mrs farquhar greeted him  we have been across to shafters place she explained harry asked me to drive round and see how you were getting on hell try to send you over his hired man in a day or two  thorne pointed to the rows of stooked sheaves  thanks i havent done as much as i should have liked hall has gone back for my other team and if it hadnt been for lucy id have been a good deal farther behind  how much has she cut mrs farquhar asked  thorne was quite aware that an answer would fix the time the girl had spent with him before he could speak however lucy had approached the wagon and she broke in  i guess mrs shafter would give you supper  mrs farquhar said that she had done so and lucy smiled  thats going to save some trouble mavy and i had ours together most an hour ago and the stoves out by now  thorne imagined that this intimation which struck him as a trifle superfluous was made with a deliberate purpose but one of the binder horses tormented by the flies began to kick just then and he turned away to quiet it while lucy who stood beside the wagon smiled provocatively at alison  youll have to excuse mavyhes been hustling round since sunup and hes played out she said still you neednt get anxious ill look after him  mrs farquhar laughed while alisons attitude grew distinctly prim she considered that in taking her anxiety for granted and alluding to it openly lucy had gone too far she also felt inclined to resent the girls last consolatory assurance  can i drive you home mrs farquhar inquired i suppose you will be going soon and it wont make a very big round  no replied lucy decisively you neednt trouble ive a horse here and i guess mavys not going to make love to me for one thing hes too busy besides i want to cut round that other side before i go  then i suppose we had better not keep you said mrs farquhar  she waved her hand to thorne and drove away and when they had left the oats behind she turned to alison  lucy she observed is now and then a little outspoken but im curious as to what she meant when she said that thorne was not likely to make love to her of course the things improbable anyway but she spoke as if he had been offered an opportunity  alisons face flushed with anger  leaving the fact that shes to marry winthrop out of the question the girl must have some selfrespect she would surely never go so far as you suggest  well smiled her companion she might go far enough to place thorne in an embarrassing position purely for the sake of the amusement she might derive from it in fact when i remember how she laughed im far from sure that she didnt do something of the kind  alison sat silent for a minute or two there was no doubt that she was very angry with lucy but she was also troubled by other sensations among which was a certain envy of the girls capacity for work that was held of high account in that country thornes attitude and his weary face as he toiled among the sheaves had been very suggestive he was she knew hardpressed engaged in a desperate grapple with a task that was generally admitted to be beyond his strength and she could only stand aside and watch his efforts with wholly ineffective sympathy  then she became conscious that mrs farquhar was glancing at her curiously  i feel humiliated tonight she broke out theres so little that seems of the least use to anybody here that i can do and my abilities scarcely got me food and shelter in england isnt it almost a crime that they teach so many of us only fripperies were we only made to be taken care of and petted  her companion smiled  if its any consolation i may point out that we havent found you useless at the farquhar homestead and i cant see why you shouldnt be just as useful presiding over a place of your own after all since you raise the question what you were made for that seems to be the usual destiny and i havent found it an unpleasant or ignoble one  she broke off and for a minute or two the jolting of the wagon rendered further conversation out of the question  theres another point she added presently its my opinion that an encouraging word from you would do more to brace mavy for the work in front of him than the offer of half a dozen binders and teams  alison made no answer and they drove on in silence across the waste which was beginning to grow dim and shadowy     chapter xxv  the only means   alison sat one afternoon in the shadow of a pile of sheaves in farquhars harvest field she had a little leisure and it was unpleasantly hot in the wooden house there was some sewing in her hand but even in the shade the light was trying and she leaned back languidly among the warm straw with halfclosed eyes two men were talking some distance behind her as they pitched up the rustling sheaves and the tramp of horses feet among the stubble and the rattle of a binder which she knew farquhar was driving drew steadily nearer presently another beat of hoofs broke in and a minute or two later hall rode past looking very hot apparently without seeing her then the rattle of the binder ceased and she heard the newcomer greet farquhar  if youve got one of those bentendspanners you could let me have id be glad he said ive mislaid mine somehow and theres a loose nut i cant get at making trouble on my binder  farquhar sent his hired man for one and hall referred to the grain  so you have made a start looks quite a heavy crop good and ripe too isnt it  we put the binder in yesterday answered farquhar id have done it earlier only that i sent pete over to thornes place for a few days after you left him  i was kind of sorry i had to leave hes surely going to be beaten i looked in on him yesterday  alison became suddenly intent she drew her light skirt closer about her for she did not wish it to catch the mens eyes and betray her as she thought it probable that they would speak to each other unreservedly and she would hear the actual truth about thorne when she had questioned farquhar he had answered her in general terms avoiding any very definite particulars and she now strained her ears to catch his reply to hall  i was afraid of it after what pete told me he said i would have helped him more if i could have managed it but i cant let a big crop like this stand over when ive bills to meet  that declared hall is just how im fixed though i stayed with him as long as i could the trouble is that he hasnt been able to hire a man since i left him there seem to be mighty few of the ontario boys coming in this season and so far theyve been snapped up farther back along the line  has he tried any of the men who had their crops hailed out west of the creek  they cleared as soon as they saw they had no harvest left most of them are out trackgrading on the branch line and i heard the rest went east mavys surely up against it he was figuring last evening that even if the weather held hed be most a month behind  then im afraid hell have to give the place up nevis will come down on him the day that payments due  couldnt he raise the money somehow for a month hall inquired  its scarcely likely i cant lend him any with wheat at present figure and hunter who has already guaranteed him a thousand dollars is very tightly fixed besides mavy couldnt expect anything more from him it wouldnt be much use going to a bank either with the bottom dropping out of the market theyre getting scared of wheat and he has nothing to offer them but a crop that isnt reaped with grantlys note calling for most of it  then i guess he has just got to quit hunter would no doubt have lent him a binder and a couple of hired men but he has them busy trying to straighten up his hailed crop and cut patches of it  its a pity farquhar assented in a regretful voice it will hurt mavy to give the place up  the man arrived with the spanner and alison heard hall ride away when the clash and rattle of the binder began again she lay still for a long time beneath the sheaves the mens conversation had made it clear that thorne would shortly be involved in disaster and that alone was painful news though by comparison with another aspect of the matter it was of minor importance the man loved her and it was for that reason he had undertaken this most unfortunate farming venture everybody seemed to know it though he had never told her what was in his mind and she had been content to wait now however she had no doubt that she loved him and he would it seemed shortly go away and vanish altogether beyond her reachat least unless something should very promptly be done she knew he would not claim her while he was an outcast and a ruined man  she closed one hand tight and a flush crept into her face as she made up her mind on one point and she was thankful while she did so that she was on the canadian prairie where the thing seemed easier than it would have done in england in that new land timehonored prejudices and hampering traditions did not seem to count men and women outgrew them there and obeyed the impulses of human nature which were after all elemental and existent long before the invention of what were perhaps in the more complex society of other lands necessary fetters thorne the pedler farmer railroad hand or whatever he might become should at least know that she loved him and decide with that knowledge before him whether he would go away  then growing a little more collected she considered the second point though hall and farquhar had cast considerable doubt upon his ability to help there was just a possibility that hunter might hold out a hand and she would stoop to beg for any favor that might be shown her lover this latter decision however she prudently determined to keep from thorne in the meanwhile  by and by she walked quietly back to the house and busied herself as usual though late in the afternoon she asked mrs farquhar for a horse and the buggy her employer did not trouble her with any questions as to why she wanted them though she favored her with a glance of unobtrusive but very keen scrutiny and soon after supper the hired man brought the buggy to the door then alison came out from her room where she had spent some time carefully comparing the two or three dresses she had clung to when she had parted with the rest in winnipeg one after another she had attired herself in the one that became her best for she felt that there must be nothing wanting in the gift she meant to offer her lover she recognized that this was what her intention amounted to what other women did with more reserve veiling their advances in disguises which were after all so flimsy that nobody except those who wished could be deceived she would do with imperious openness  the days were now rapidly growing shorter and when she reached thornes homestead the sun hung low above the verge of the great white plain the man was not in sight which struck her as strange as there would be light enough to work for some time yet but she was not astonished that he had evidently not heard her approach because she had driven slowly for the last mile almost repenting of her rashness and wondering whether she should not turn and go back again once she had set about it the thing she had undertaken appeared increasingly difficult indeed she knew that had the man been less severely pressed nothing would have driven her into the action she contemplated it was only the fact that he was face to face with disaster beaten down desperate that warranted the sacrifice of her reserve and pride  getting down at length she left the horse which was a quiet one and walked toward the house the door stood open when she reached it and looking in she saw the man sitting at a table on which there lay a strip of paper covered with figures his face was worn and set and every line of his slack pose was expressive of dejection he did not immediately see her and a deep pity overwhelmed her and helped to sweep away her doubts and hesitation as she glanced round the room it was growing shadowy but it looked horribly comfortless and the few dishes that were still scattered about the table bore the remnants of a singularly uninviting meal there was a portion of a loaf blackened outside sad and damp within butter that had liquefied and partly congealed again in discolored streaks a morsel of halfcooked pork reposing in solid fat and a can of flavored syrup black with flies she wondered how any one coming back oppressed with anxiety from a day of exhausting toil could eat such fare then she noticed a small heap of tattered garments which he evidently had no leisure to mend lying on the floor and while it brought her no sense of repulsion the sight of them further troubled her these were things which jarred on the beneficent homemaking instincts which suddenly awoke within her nature and they moved her to a compassionate longing to care for and shelter the lonely man  then he looked up and saw her and she flushed at the swift elation in his face which however almost immediately grew hard again it was as though he had yielded for a moment to some pleasurable impulse and had then with an effort repressed it and resumed his selfcontrol  come in he invited rising with outstretched hand and she suddenly recalled how she had last crossed that threshold in his company there had been careless laughter in his eyes then he had moved and spoken with a joyous optimism and now there was plain upon him the stamp of defeat even physically the man looked different  she sat down when he drew her out a chair but he remained standing leaning with one hand on the table  is mrs farquhar outside  no i drove across alone  he looked at her with a hint of astonishment and something that suggested a natural curiosity as to the cause for the visit which she now found it insuperably difficult to explain  you havent been at work this evening she asked  no replied thorne i rode in to the railroad early yesterday and ive just got back after calling at two or three farms west of the creek it seemed possible that i might be able to hire a couple of men id wired for back along the line but i found that somebody else had got hold of them at another station as a matter of fact i had expected it  then you must have made the journey almost without a rest  voladors dead played out answered thorne i had to do something though it seemed pretty useless in any case  ah alison exclaimed softly then you mean to go on  until im turned out which will no doubt happen very shortly  i suppose that will hurt you  he looked at her for a moment with his face awry and signs of a sternly repressed longing in his eyes  yes he answered it will hurt me more than anything i could have had to face in fact the thought of it has been almost unbearable but its now clear that i shall have to go through with it  this was satisfactory to alison in some respects and she was quick to sympathize  it must be very hard to give up the farm on which you have spent so much earnest work  yes assented thorne with something in his tone that suggested halfcontemptuous indifference to the sacrifice it wont be easy to give up even the farm  then for the first time it occurred to him that there was an unusual hint of strain in her manner and that he had never seen her dressed in the same fashion before she did not look daintier for daintiness was not quite the quality he would have ascribed to her but more highly cultivated farther beyond the reach of a ruined farmer though there was a strange softnessit almost seemed tendernessshining in her eyes he gripped the table hard and his face grew stern as he gazed at her he felt that it was almost impossible that he would ever have the strength to let her go  what will you do then she asked with what seemed a merciless persistency  go away declared thorne strike west and vanish out of sight ive no doubt somebody will hire me to load up railroad ballast or herd cattle he smiled at her harshly after all it will be a relief to my few friends they may be a little sorrybut my absence will save their making excuses for me  alison looked up at him steadily though there was a flush of color in her cheeks  you must be just to them she said why should they invent excuseswhen you have made such a fight with so much against you besides you are wrong when you say they might bea little sorry can you believe that it would be easy to let you go away  thorne frowned as he met her gaze he did not know what to make of this but there was a suggestiveness in her voice that was almost too much for him  is there any one who would have much difficulty in doing that he asked with a quietness that cost him a determined effort  yes murmured alison with suddenly lowered eyes there is at least one person who would feel it dreadfully  he gazed at her straining to cling to the resolution that had almost deserted him though his face was firmly set  it is quite true she added with flaming cheeks i must say it i mean myself  he drew back a pace and stood very still as though afraid to trust himself  dont make it all unbearable he cried at length theres only one course open to me its hard enough already  alison faced him with a new steadiness  oh she exclaimed you can only look at it from your point of viewcant you understand yet that there is another if you had meant to go away you should have gonesome time ago  thorne closed his hands firmly  im afraid you are right but i believed that i might make a success of this farming venture  the girl laughed with open scorn  dare you believe that would have mattered so very much to me do you think i didnt know why you turned farmer and why you have since then done things that none of your neighbors would have been capable of  it seemed necessary explained thorne still with the same expressive quietness i did so because i wanted you and that is exactly what makes defeat so bitter now  and you imagined that you had hidden your motive can you believe that a man could change his whole mode of life and take up a burden he had carefully avoided as you have done without having the woman on whose account he did it understand why are we so blind or utterly foolish dont you know that our perceptions and intuitions are twice as keen as yours  then you understood what my object was all alongand it didnt strike you as absurd and impossible  alison smiled at him  why should it seem absurd that i should love you mavy  he came no nearer but stood still looking at her with elation and trouble curiously mingled in his face and she realized that the fight was but half won he had of late sloughed off his wayward carelessness and she knew that there had always been a depth of resolute character beneath it he was a man who would do what he felt was the fitting thing even though it hurt him  well he said speaking slowly in a tense voice ever since i first saw you i longed that this should come about it was what i worked for and nothing would have been too hard that brought me nearer you but its almost a cruelty that i should have succeedednow  why asked alison bracing herself for another effort for the strain was beginning to tell is what you have won of no value to you  thorne spread out his hands as if in desperation  it is because it is so precious that i shrink from involving you in the disaster that is hanging over me i am a ruined discredited man and in a few more weeks i will be driven out of my homestead without a dollar it will be three or four years at least before i can struggle to my feet again  is that so very dreadful mavy alison smiled i almost think that in the things that count the most many of you are after all more bound by traditions than we are your wildest flight was the driving about the prairie with a load of patent medicines and now your imagination is bounded by a homestead and household comforts you could teach a woman to love you and then go away driven by some fantastic point of honor because you could not realize that her views might be wider than yours  i could hardly suppose that you would care to live in a wagon  i did it onceand it was not so very dreadful i really think if it were needful i could do it again  she leaned forward toward him  it would be very much worse mavy if you went away and left me behind  at length he came toward her and seized both her hands  dear he cried i have tried to do what i felt i oughtand now im not sorry that i find im not strong enough i cant tell you how i want youbut im afraid you could not face what you would have to bear with me  try said alison simply  he drew her to him with an exultant laugh  ive done what i could and it seems ive failed now let nevis turn me out and ill almost thank him after all there are many worse places than a camp beside the wagon in the birch bluff  alison was not at all convinced that it would end in that and indeed she did not mean it to if she could help it but in another moment she felt his arms about her and his lips hot upon her face and it was half an hour later when they left the homestead together the sun had dipped and the vast dim plain stretched away before them under a vault of fading blue but she drove very slowly while thorne walked beside the buggy for almost a league  as a result of this it was very late when she reached the homestead and she was relieved when mrs farquhar came out alone as she got down the light fell upon the girls face as she approached the doorway and her companion flashed a smiling glance at her  i suppose you have been to thornes place  yes answered alison quietly i am going to marry him  mrs farquhar kissed her  its very good news still from what i know of mavy and how hes situated im a little astonished that you were able to arrange it  why do you put it that way alison asked with a start  her companion laughed  my dear im only glad that you had sense enough not to let him go that man would be afraid of even a cold air blowing on you anyway you have got the one husband i would most gladly have given you to  then she drew alison into the house and called to farquhar  harry take the horse in and it isnt necessary for you to hurry back  she drew alison out a chair and sat down close beside her  the first thing you have to do is to drive over and see florence hunter her husbands the only person who can pull mavy out of this trouble  i had thought of that  i believe its necessary we cant let mavy be turned out now and if he wont ask a favor of a man who would grant it willingly if he could somebody must do it for him  then she laid her hand caressingly on the girls shoulder  i havent been so pleased for a very long while keep a good courage well find some means of outwitting nevis     chapter xxvi  open confession   it was about the middle of the afternoon when alison reached the hunter homestead and she was slightly astonished when on inquiring for florence a maid informed her that the latter was busy and could not be with her for some minutes alison had imagined from what she had seen on previous visits that in the warm weather florence invariably spent her afternoons reclining in a canvas chair on the veranda a couple of chairs stood on it when she arrived and after the maid had gone she drew one back into the shadow and sitting down looked out across the great stretch of grain in front of the house  all round the edge of it there were scattered men and teams but they were moving very slowly and almost every minute the clatter of one or another of the binders ceased and she saw stooping figures busy in front of the machine though she could not make out exactly what they were doing the state of the harvestfield seemed to explain why the delays were unavoidable great patches of the wheat lay prone the part that stood upright looked tangled and torn and there were wide stretches from which it had partially disappeared leaving only ragged stubble mixed with crumpled straw alison had however seen other crops that had been wholly wiped out by the scourging hail she waited about a quarter of an hour before florence appeared looking rather hot and dressed with unusual plainness  youll have to excuse me for keeping you but im glad you came she said ive been busy since seven oclock this morning and now that ive a little leisure its a relief to sit down  a gleam of amusement crept into alisons eyes and her companion evidently noticed it  it is rather a novelty in my case she laughed on the other hand theres no doubt that the exertion is necessary the waste that has been going on in this homestead is positively alarming  it cost alison an effort to preserve a becoming gravity florence who had presided over the place for several years spoke as if the fact she mentioned which had been patent to those who visited her for a considerable time had only dawned upon her very recently  you are trying to set things straight she suggested  it threatens to prove a difficult task but im making the attempt while i feel equal to it and theres a certain interest even in looking into household accounts for instance i had an idea this morning that promised to save me three or four dollars a month but when i mentioned it to elcot he only grinned there are one or two respects in which im afraid hes a little extravagant  alison laughed outright the idea that florence who had hitherto squandered money with both hands should trouble herself about the saving of three dollars and complain of her selfdenying husbands extravagance was irresistibly amusing  when did the desire to investigate affairs first get hold of you she asked  i believe that it was when i came back from toronto answered florence thoughtfully afterward we had the hail and it became clear at once that there would have to be some cutting down of our expenses her face grew suddenly anxious as she glanced toward the grain that she added ought to explain why the subjects an interesting one to me  alison was somewhat puzzled there were signs of a change in her companion who hitherto had so far at least as she had noticed taken only a very casual interest in her husbands affairs  yes she replied it does i was very sorry when i heard about it  florence made a little abrupt gesture as though in dismissal of the topic  what brought you over you havent been very often  it was difficult to answer offhand and alison proceeded circuitously  you and i were pretty good friends in england werent we  of course assented florence you stood by me when your mother turned against me and ive always had an idea that you suffered for it well admit the fact what comes next  her manner was abrupt but that was not infrequently the case and alison who was fighting for her lover was not readily daunted  well she said i have never troubled you for any favors in return  florence regarded her in a rather curious fashion  no she admitted you havent you made no claim on me as perhaps you were entitled to do when you first came out here in fact i have once or twice felt slightly vexed with you because you went to mrs farquhar  alison smiled as she remembered that her companion had not shown the least desire to prevent her doing the thing she now resented  then theres a favor that i must ask at last but first of all id better tell you that im going to marry leslie thorne  mavy thorne florence gazed at her in open wonder i heard a whisper or two that seemed to point to the possibility of your doing something of the kind but i resolutely refused to believe it  why  florence laughed  oh in half a dozen ways its ludicrous if you really mean it you are as absurd as he is  alison rose with an air of quiet dignity  if you are quite convinced of that there is nothing more to be said you couldnt expect me to appreciate your attitude  her companion laid a restraining hand on her arm as she was about to move away  sit down if i vexed you im sorry but you really shouldnt be so quick in temper besides you shouldnt have flung the news at me in that startling fashion after all ive no doubt he has something to recommend him most of them have a few good qualities which now and then become evident when you dont expect them  she paused and looked up at alison with a smile in which there was a hint of tenderness  for instance it has been dawning on me of late that theres a good deal thats rather nice in elcot now try to be reasonable and tell me what the trouble is  alisons indignation dissipated it was after all difficult to be angry with florence and she supplied her with a brief account of how thorne was situated her companion listened with more interest than she had fancied her capable of displaying and when alison stopped she made a sign of comprehension  you want me to ask elcot to send him over some of our men i wish i couldi almost feel i owe you thatbut its difficult elcots trying desperately to save the remnant of his crop he has been very badly hit  alison sat silent in tense anxiety she could not urge florence to do anything that would clearly be to her husbands detriment and she did not see how hunter could help thorne without neglecting his own harvest then her companion turned to her again  i quite realize that thorne will be turned out unless he clears off the loan but you havent mentioned the name of the creditor who wishes to ruin him  its nevis  an ominous sparkle crept into florences eyes and her face grew hard  then ill try to explain it all to elcot tonight and if he can drive off nevis by any means that wont cost him too great a sacrifice i think you can count on its being done  alison felt inclined to wonder why the mention of neviss part in the affair had had such an effect on her companion but that after all did not seem a very important point and when she drove away half an hour later she was in an exultant mood when she had gone florence supervised the preparations for the mens supper and after the meal was over she stopped hunter as he was going out again through the veranda  if you can wait for a few minutes i have something to tell you she said to begin with alison leigh is going to marry thorne  hunter did not look much astonished  i think mavy has made a wise choice but im very much afraid theres trouble in front of them he said  that returned florence is exactly what i meant to speak about alison was here this afternoon and she mentioned it to me i want to save them as much as i can  hunters face remained expressionless it was the first time so far as he could remember that florence had concerned herself about any other persons difficulties  well he asked gravely how do you propose to set about it  in the first place i thought id mention it to you  a dry smile crept into hunters eyes  then youd better give me all the particulars in your possession i have some idea as to the cause of the trouble but i havent been over to mavys place for some time and he has sent no word to me  florence told him what she knew and when she had finished he gazed at her reflectively  you want me to send him all the men and binders i can spare thats the only useful course  florence hesitated and when she spoke her manner was unusually diffident  i feel its rather shabby to promise a favor and then hand on the work to you but in this case im helpless i should like you to get thorne out of his trouble if its only on alisons account but on the other hand i dont want you to increase your own difficulties by sending men away you stand first with me  hunter made no allusion to the last assurance  it seems very likely that what the boys are now doing will in the end come to much the same thing as changing a dollar and getting about ninety cents back for it which naturally prevents me from feeling that i would be making very much of a sacrifice in discontinuing the operation  i dont quite understand how that could be even if the hail has almost spoiled the crop you have the men and it wont cost you any more if you keep them busy saving as much of it as is possible  that explained hunter is partly why im doing so and the other reason is that i must have something that will keep me occupied just now on the other hand before i can get anything for the wheat it must be thrashed and hauled in to the elevators now thrashing is usually done by contractat so much the bushelin this country and ive reason to believe that the thrasher boys will charge me considerably more than the average rate considering the state of the crop theyll have to do a great deal of work for a very little wheat besides that littles damaged and would bring less than the market price which is a particularly low one this year then theres the cost of haulage which is an item because it would entail keeping the hired men on and ive the option of paying them off as soon as harvests over  in short said florence in a troubled voice it would probably be more profitable to let the whole crop rot as it stands  im afraid thats the case hunter agreed  florence sat silent for almost a minute watching him covertly it once more struck her that he looked very jaded and she was touched by the weariness in his face then though the occasion seemed most inopportune she was carried away by a sudden impulse which compelled her to mention neviss loan  elcot she blurted out i have made things worse for you all alongand now theres another trouble i have brought upon you  for a minute or two she poured out disjointed sentences and though the man listened gravely almost unmoved in face she found the making of that confession about the most difficult thing she had ever done  how much did you borrow he inquired  she told him and raising himself a little from his leaning posture he looked down upon her with an embarrassing quietness  i was half afraid there might be something of that kind in the background he said at length theres one point i must raise presumably you wouldnt allow a man who was to all intents and purposes a stranger to lend you money  he spoke as if the matter were open to doubt and florence found the situation rapidly becoming intolerable but it was to her credit that she recognized that halfmeasures would be useless then  no she acknowledged  then i must ask exactly what kind of interest you took in the man and how far your acquaintance with him went  florences face burned but she roused herself to answer him  he was amusing she said slowly picking her words he came here once or twice when you were out and on a few occasions i met him by accident on the prairie and at the settlement i suppose i waspleasantto him but nobody could have called it more than that then there was a change in his attitude  it was to be expected hunter interposed dryly do you wish me to understand that you were astonished  florence rose and turned on him with hot anger in her eyes  yes she exclaimed i was astonished andyou must believe ithorribly mortified he tried to make me feel that i was in his power  she paused and clenched one hand tight before she cried  what can i do to convince you i hate the man i want you to crush and humble him  hunter greeted this outbreak with a smile but he made no answer and growing calmer in a few moments she looked at him again  what are you going to do about it elcot she asked  in the first place those two notes of yours must be paid when they fall due after that i shall actas appears advisable  florence sat down with relief in her face  raising the money will be another difficulty she said i will give up my allowance until it is paid off  that replied hunter with undiminished dryness will no doubt have to be done  he turned away from her and leaned heavily on the balustrade for a minute or two apparently watching the hired men toiling among his ruined wheat then he slowly looked around again  well he observed im glad you have told me about the thing but im somewhat surprised that you didnt realize that you could have disarmed nevisand freed yourselfby mentioning it earlier  i was ashamedthough there was in one sense no reason why i should be it would have lookedso suggestive  hunter interrupted her with a little bitter laugh  no when i asked you what interest you took in nevis it wasnt quite what i meant i merely thought your answer might throw some light on his views which i wanted to be sure of you are too dispassionate and too much alive to your own benefit to make much of a sacrifice for the sake of any man  florence winced at this but she rose and laid her hand on his arm  try me elcot she begged i know im fond of ease and luxuryperhaps its because i had so little of them before i married you but now you must give me nothing for the next twelve months cut the household expenses down by half and send everybody but one maid away  im afraid youll have to be prepared for something of the kind replied hunter quietly in the meanwhile ill take the boys and the binders over to thornes place in the morning  he moved away toward his ruined crop without another word but florence did not resent the attitude he had adopted indeed his uncompromising directness had appealed to her in his favor when soon after their marriage she had by various means made it plain that he was expected to keep his distance and leave her largely to her own devices it had been a relief that he had fallen in with her views without protest though it had been evident that it had grievously hurt him then his forbearance and apparent content with the situation had by degrees grown galling and now when at last he seemed inclined to assert himself she was not displeased it had as she had admitted to alison begun to dawn on her that she had somehow never recognized her husbands good qualities and that there were unexpected possibilities in the simple farmer besides this she was seized with a fit of wholly genuine penitence  in the meanwhile hunter climbed into the seat of a binder which he drove slowly through the tangled grain and florence still lingering on the veranda noticed the carefulness with which he and his men stooked the sheaves of wheat which might never be sold the rows of black shadows behind them lengthened rapidly until at last they coalesced and the stubble lay dim while the western face of the grain along which the binders crept alone glowed with a coppery radiance as the red sun dipped then a wonderful exhilarating coolness crept into the air and there was a stillness not apparent earlier through which the clash and clatter of the machines rang harshly distinct they moved on with the bent figures which grew dimmer toiling behind them for another halfhour and then while the others trooped off to the stables hunter walked slowly toward the house florence noticed the suggestive slackness of his bearing and her heart smote her for she knew it was not mere physical weariness which had crushed the vigor out of the man when he came up the steps she turned to him  is the wheat looking no better  no answered hunter simply its looking worse im going in to write a letterto the bank  he strode on and disappeared into the house but florence who presently saw a light stream out from one of the windows sat still though the dew was getting heavy and it was chilly now     chapter xxvii  a helping hand   lucy calvert came over as often as she was able but at length she was compelled to discontinue her visits to thorne soon after she had done so there was a welcome change in the almost torrid weather and grass and grain lay still under a faintly clouded sky when he toiled among the sheaves one clear cool afternoon the binder which flung them out moved along the edge of the oats in front of him and another man was busy among the crackling stubble a pace or two behind for a neighbor had driven across to help him on the previous evening and the stationagent had at last sent him out a man from the railroad settlement they had been at work since early morning but each time thorne glanced at the oblong of standing grain he realized more clearly the futility of what he was doing  the belt of kneehigh stubble which shone a sweep of warm ochre tinting against the white and gray of the parched grass beyond it was widening steadily as the crop went down before the binder but he had a good deal yet to cut and there was another oblong of untouched grain running back from a deserted wooden shack some distance away thorne had followed the custom of the country sowing oats on the newly broken land and wheat on that which had been worked before though in the latter case he had agreed to pay a share of the proceeds to the owner of the soil he had secured an option of purchasing this second holding but it was quite out of the question that he should exercise it now and a very simple calculation convinced him that at his present rate of progress less than half the crop would be ready when grantlys note fell due  there was no doubt that his activity was illogical as it was obvious that the result of every hours strenuous labor would only be to put so much more money into neviss pocket but he could not force himself to give up the fight until the last moment he still clung to a faint expectation that something might transpire to lessen the odds against him he admitted that there was nothing to warrant this view but in spite of it he toiled on savagely and the stooked sheaves rose before him in lengthening golden ranks as he floundered with bowed shoulders and busy arms through the crackling stubble the soil beneath the straw was dry and parched and the dust which rose from it crept into his eyes and nostrils now and then he gasped but he worked on with no slackening of effort for that part of the crop was heavy and the sheaves were falling thick and fast in the wake of the machine at length however it stopped at a corner and thorne straightened his aching back when the man who drove it got down  she wants a drop of oil he explained and looking round him pointed out across the prairie seems as if shafter was through with his harvest and i guess he has to sell some of the storekeepers have been putting the screw on him  thorne gazed toward the spot he indicated and saw two or three teams and wagons etched upon the horizon where a low rise ran up to meet the sky they were so far off that they appeared stationary and it was only when one of the binders arms hid the first of them a moment or two later that he could see they moved then as he watched the others a hot fit of resentment and envy came upon him it was clear that shafter who had plowed unusually early had cut and thrashed his grain for stacking is seldom attempted in that country where very few farmers have any money in hand and storekeepers generally look for payment once the crop is in in the latter case it is put on the market as soon as possible though now and then the last of it is hauled in on the bobsleds across the snow shafter at least could clear off his liabilities and though thorne did not grudge the man this satisfaction the sight of his loaded wagons crawling slowly to the elevators was bitter to him he could have done what shafter was doing and so escaped from neviss clutches had he only been allowed a little longer time  when youre through with that oiling well get on he said harshly  his companion made no answer but climbed into the saddle and the binder moved steadily along the edge of the grain until they came to the second corner turning it the driver looked out across a stretch of prairie which a birch bluff on one hand of them had previously hidden then he pulled up his team excitedly  mavy he cried theres quite a lot of teams back yonder to the eastward beyond the creek  thorne sprang up on the binder for where he had been standing a cluster of sheaves obscured his view he saw that there undoubtedly were horses on the sweep of grass in the distance what was more they were moving in his direction  theres one wagon declared his second companion i cant quite make out the other things if there was hay in the sloos still id say they were mowers  thornes heart seemed suddenly to leap and the man in the saddle of the machine burst into a hoarse laugh  well he said nobody would figure youd been farming unless you use the scythe down in ontario theyre sure binders  he turned and smote thorne encouragingly upon the shoulder  mavy its the hunter crowd guess youre going to have no trouble getting your crop in now  thorne got down and leaned against the wheel of the binder his face had grown paler than usual and he felt almost limp with the relief which was too great for him to express it was several moments before he broke the silence  they cant be here for a while i think ill have a smoke  his companion nodded sympathetically  thats what you want mavy then youll be fresh for a hustle and well have to move quite lively to keep ahead of the hunter boys hunters no use for slouches and he knows how to speed up the crowd he hires  he called to his horses and the other man fell to work behind him when the machine clattered on but thorne sat down among the sheaves he could now allow himself a brief relaxation and for once his grip was nerveless for his heart was overfull his cares had suddenly vanished and there was he almost thought victory in front of him he had some trouble in shredding the tobacco to fill his pipe and when the operation was accomplished he lay resting on one elbow watching the teams draw nearer with a satisfaction which came near to overwhelming him by the time he had smoked the pipe out however he had grown a little calmer and rousing himself he stood up and walked out upon the prairie to meet the newcomers hunter was driving a wagon in front of them and he stopped his team when he was a few yards away  well soon clean that crop up he declared cheerily when thorne had clambered to the seat beside him ive brought the smartest of the boys and the newest machines along  thanks thorne replied simply just now i cant say anything more except that in one way im sorry you were able to come  hunters face grew suddenly grave  i can believe it mavy had things been different its quite likely id have had to keep the boys at home i was only sure that i was throwing my time away yesterday anyway im thankful that one hailed crop wont clean me out  he dismissed the subject with a wave of his hand  as a matter of fact he added though id probably come in any case it was really mrs hunter who sent me along  mrs hunter ejaculated thorne in what afterward occurred to him was very tactless astonishment  sure laughed his companion she had a visitor shortly before she spoke to me about it which may have had something to do with the thing but the possibility of the notions having struck miss leigh first wasnt any reason why i shouldnt come across mavy its my opinion that youre a very lucky man  its mine too thorne answered with a light in his eyes still i almost felt ashamed to admit it half an hour ago the outlook seemed very black to me just then  hunter made a sign of comprehension  well he said from what ive seen of her i dont think miss leigh would have fallen in with your point of view though it was a very natural one it strikes me theres a good deal of courage and a capacity for making the most of things in that girl anyway there ought to be considerably fewer difficulties in front of both of you when we get this crop in and that brings up another matter the thrashers are leaving shafters for tom jordans place tomorrow hadnt you better write to them right away and arrange for them to come along as soon as were ready  thorne recognized that this would be judicious particularly as he expected that a neighbor who had spoken to him that morning would pass close by in the next hour or two the man who lived near jordan would he felt confident undertake to hand on the letter a few minutes later he got down and entered his dwelling while hunter drove on toward the grain he found however that his ink had almost dried up and when he sat down to write it was difficult to fix his thoughts on what he had to say the relief he had experienced a little while ago had been great enough partly to bewilder him and some time had passed before he produced a fairly intelligible letter putting it into his pocket he went out again and stopped a moment or two just outside the threshold with a sense of exultation that sent an almost painful thrill through him as he saw that hunter had already got to work  plodding teams and machines marshaled in careful order were advancing in echelon through the grain which melted away before them behind each bowed barearmed figures set up the flungout sheaves which rose in ranks that now lengthened reassuringly fast the still air was filled with the sounds of a strenuous activity the crackle of the stubble the rasp and tinkle of the knives and the rustle of falling grain already there was a wide gap which extended while he gazed at it bitten out of one corner of the golden oblong along its indented edges the arms of the binders whirled and gleamed halfburied in yellow straw through which as most of them were new he caught odd glimpses of streaks of flaring vermilion and harshest green while the dull blue garments and bronzed skin of the men who moved on stooping showed against the sweep of ochre and coppery hues it was a medley of vivid color and a blending of stirring sound and the jaded man forgot his aches and weariness as he gazed the crop he had despaired of reaping was falling fast before his eyes  then he saw that his own team was leading and there was only one figure struggling with the sheaves behind it in another moment it became apparent that the man in the saddle was waving to him and he set off at a run when he reached the grain one of his companions glanced at him reproachfully  see where that binders got he grumbled we went in first but though ive most pulled my arms off theyre crowding right on top of us with the next hunter team do you want the boys to put it on us that we cant keep ahead of them  thorne saw that the team of the following binder was very close behind and that a wide strip of stubble strewed with fallen sheaves which had accumulated in his absence divided him and his companion from the machine that belonged to him  well he said with a cheerful laugh theres a good deal to pull up but it has to be done  they set about it vigorously and drew away foot by foot from the men behind thorne had toiled hard before but now he felt that he could do half as much again after all the grim courage of the forlorn hope provides a feebler animus than the thrill of victory at length however his companion turned to him with a gasping expostulation  i guess you have me beat he exclaimed well hook jim off the binder and put you on instead ill own up id rather have him along with me just now  they made the change and thorne contrived to drive a little faster than the other man had done hunters men could not let him draw too far ahead and everywhere the effort grew tenser still nobody objected when as the supper hour drew near hunter said that since the days were shortening fast they would go on until dark fell before they made the meal instead of working afterward still as the time slipped by a man here and there drew his belt tighter or stopped a moment to straighten his aching back and by degrees the horses moved more and more slowly amid the falling grain the clatter of the binders grew less insistent there were halts to oil or tighten something now and then and at last when all the great plain was growing dim it was with relief that the men desisted when hunter called to them he and thorne loosed their teams and the latter looked uneasy when they walked toward the house together  theres a thing that only struck me a few minutes ago and im rather troubled about it he confessed the boys have worked hard enough already without being set to making flapjacks and cooking their supper while i really dont know how im to tide over breakfast tomorrow  hunter laughed  thats not going to prove much of a difficulty particularly as its one mrs hunter has provided for as it happens hall looked in on us last night and i gathered that he hadnt a very high opinion of your cookery and catering  a minute or two later they came out from behind the barn into view of the house and thorne saw that a bountiful meal was already spread out on the grass in front of it a man whose absence he had not noticed was carrying a kettle and a fryingpan out of the doorway it was the climax of a day of unexpected happenings and vanishing troubles and when he looked at hunter he found it difficult to speak the latter however laughed  mavy he said you sit right down yonder suppers ready and the boys are waiting  thorne took his place among the others who ate in such determined fashion that in a very few minutes there was nothing left of the meal then two or three of them gathered up the plates and the others lying down on the grass took out their pipes in the meanwhile it had grown almost dark though a few pale streaks of saffron and green lingered low upon the prairies western verge the long rows of sheaves stood out dimly upon the stubble but the standing crop had faded into a blurred and shadowy mass one edge of which alone showed with a certain distinctness above the sweep of the darkening plain near the house however a little fire which somebody had lightedprobably because there was not room for all the cooking utensils on thornes stoveburned redly between the two birch logs and its flickering glow wavered across the recumbent figures of the men  some of them lay propped up on one elbow some had stretched themselves out fulllength among the grass and now and then a brown face or uncovered bronzed arm stood out in the uncertain radiance and vanished again the men spoke in low voices lazily wearied with the days toil though at irregular intervals a hoarse laugh broke out and once or twice the howl of a coyote came up faint and hollow out of the waste of prairie a little apart from the others thorne and hunter sat with their shoulders against the front of the house talking quietly  ill see you through with the hauling in hunter promised well start right away as soon as the thrashers can give us a load and in my opinion you should have a reasonable surplus after clearing off neviss claim  yes assented thorne with deep but languid content it looks almost as if another moderately good harvest would wipe out my last obligation and set me solidly on my feet once im free of nevis i dont anticipate any trouble with the other men so long as they get their interest theyll hold me up for their own sakes  thats how it strikes me hunter agreed they dont run their business on neviss lines which reminds me that i picked up a little information that suggested that he might have to make a change when i was over at brandon a week or two ago i may say that as i had reasons for believing that the man hadnt a great deal of money of his own ive been rather astonished at the way he has gone on from one thing to another during the last few years until farquhar told me something which seemed to supply the explanation he got it from grantly who declares that brand of winnipeg has been backing nevis all along well i spent an evening with one of the big milling people in brandon and he told me it was generally believed that brand has been severely hit by the fall in wheat it turns out that he and a few others were at the bottom of the late rally which however only made things worse for them the point is that if brand is getting shaky hell probably call in any money he has supplied to nevis  nobody would be sorry if he pulled him down altogether  its almost too much to expect replied hunter dismissing the subject with a wave of his hand by the way i had a look round your house after supper and its my opinion that you only want a wagonload of dressed lumber and a couple of carpenters for two or three days to make the place quite comfortable a few simple furnishings wont cost you much and you can of course add to them as you go on  thorne realized that this statement covered a question and he smiled in a manner that indicated unalloyed satisfaction  i intend to consult with alison about ordering them as soon as the thrashings over  his companion rose and stretched himself  well he yawned if were to start at sunup we had better get off to rest  he turned to the others  youll find your blankets in the wagon boys and you can camp in the house if youre particular about a soft bed theres hay in the barn     chapter xxviii  the reckoning   thornes last load of wheat had been hauled in and he had duly met his obligations when he drove into grahams bluff early one evening the days were rapidly getting shorter and though it was not yet dark there was a chill in the air and here and there a light blinked in the window of a store odd groups of loiterers stood about the sidewalk or strolled along the rutted street for it was saturday evening and now that harvest was generally over the outlying farmers had driven in to purchase provisions or to gather any news that might be had in accordance with their usual custom it was about their only relaxation and of late a supplementary mail arrived on saturdays which was another excuse for the visit  thorne was in an unusually optimistic mood he had left his troubles behind him there was an alluring prospect opening out ahead and he expected to meet alison and mrs farquhar at the hotel besides he had driven fast and the swift motion had stirred his blood he answered with a cheerful laugh when some of the loungers called to him as he drove by one corner corporal slaney raised a greeting hand and thorne wondering what he was doing there waved his whip it was as a rule only when he had some particular business on hand that the corporal was seen at grahams bluff supper had been over some time when thorne stopped his team at the back of the hotel and getting down handed it over to a man who came out from the stable  has the mailcarrier got in yet bill he asked  no hes most an hour behind his usual time guess youre late too theyve cleared the tables quite a while ago  i got supper with forrester as i came along i suppose you havent any idea as to what has brought slaney over  bill grinned  it is my opinion thats about the one thing slaneys not going to explain though he was in the stable talking and i saw him looking kind of curious at lucy calvert shes in town and so is mrs hunter she came in alone but somebody told me that hunter had ridden round by halls place and would be along by and by  are there any of my other friends about  i dont know if youd call nevis one but hes in the hotel when i last saw him he looked powerful mad mrs hunter had pulled up before the drygoods store when he walked up and started to talk to her i dont know what she said to him but it kind of struck me shed have liked to lay into him with the whip and nevis came back across the road mighty quick after that mrs farquhar drove in with miss leigh and left word that you were to wait at the hotel  bill paused a moment and grinned at thorne mischievously  guess they didnt want you trailing round after them in the drygoods store looks as if theyd been buying quite a lot for its most half an hour since they went in the lawyer man who came to see miss leigh has gone off up the street  the lawyer man exclaimed thorne in some astonishment for though he could guess what alison was buying the last piece of news roused his interest  parsonsfrom somewhere down the line he has been in the settlement once or twice lately wanted to know where miss leigh was and when shed be back again  thorne without asking any more questions walked round to the front of the hotel where he found nevis talking to several farmers on the veranda he was inclined to think the man had not noticed his arrival and sitting down he took out his pipe without greeting him he had treated nevis to a somewhat forcible expression of opinion when he had met grantlys note a few days earlier and they had by no means parted on friendly terms soon after he sat down symonds the hotelkeeper came out on the veranda  are you going to stay here tonight mr nevis he inquired  yes said nevis i didnt intend to when i drove in but i think ill stop over until monday morning ill drive on to hunters place after breakfast then  thorne remembering what bill had told him wondered how far neviss meeting with mrs hunter might explain his change of mind he could think of no very definite reason that would warrant the conjecture but a stream of light from the room behind the veranda fell on the mans face and its expression suggested vindictive malice just then two or three newcomers strolled on to the veranda and a teamster who had been sitting at the farther side of it moved toward nevis  what do you want to go to hunters for he asked bluntly you and he havent had any dealings since he beat you out of the creamery  thorne watched nevis closely and imagined that the ominous look in his face grew plainer still  well he said with a jarring laugh mrs hunter is a customer of mine  there was a murmur of astonishment and the men gathered round the speaker evidently in the expectation of hearing something more  is that a cold fact one of them inquired  certainly answered nevis and thorne joined the group  even if it is this isnt the place to discuss it he broke in perhaps id better mention that if hunter isnt in town already he will be very soon  nevis looked around at him and thorne fancied that the man who was evidently filled with savage resentment intended with some vindictive purpose to take the gathering group of bystanders into his confidence several more men were ascending the steps  have you any reason to doubt what im saying he asked  well drawled thorne theres your general character for one thing  some of the others laughed but it occurred to thorne that his interference had not been particularly tactful when one of them asked a question  are you telling us that hunter who has plenty of money lets his wife go borrowing from people like you  i cant say that he lets her nevis retorted meaningly ive the best of reasons however for being certain that she does so  there was an awkward silence which indicated that all who had heard it grasped the full significance of the last statement nevis smiled as he glanced round at them  you mean he doesnt know anything about it somebody exclaimed  if you insist thats about the size of it nevis answered since her husband cuts down her allowance to the last dollar its not an altogether unnatural thing that mrs hunter should borrow from her friends without mentioning it to him  the speech was offensive on the face of it but there was in addition something in the mans manner which endued it with a gross suggestiveness it implied that he could furnish a reason why the woman should have no hesitation in borrowing from him thorne stood still fuming he recognized that an altercation with nevis would in all probability only provide the latter with an opportunity for making further undesirable insinuations  just then however the group suddenly fell apart and another man strode across the veranda he carried a ridingquirt and his face showed white and set in the stream of light  its a malicious lie  he raised the plaited quirt and the hotelkeeper flung himself in front of nevis  stop there he cried hold on hunter  thorne springing forward grasped his friends arm he felt it his duty to restrain him though it was one that he undertook most reluctantly  thrashing him wouldnt be an answer he insisted after what he has just said it would be very much better if you gave us your account of the thing  there was a murmur of approval from the assembly the men had heard the accusation cunningly conveyed and although the prospect of a sensational climax in which the ridingquirt should figure appealed to them they felt it only fitting that they should also hear it proved or withdrawn  ill do thatfirst consented hunter very grimly i have just this to say im perfectly aware that mrs hunter borrowed from this man on two occasions and to bear it out ill state the fact that the loans fall due on tuesday  nevis made no attempt to deny it and one of the bystanders spoke  we can let it go at that boys nevis said he was going over to hunters place on monday  in that case continued hunter he will have the notes my wife gave him in his pocket ill mention what the amounts are and afterward ask nevis to produce the papers and symonds will tell you if im correct  then if he doesnt want us to strip him he had better trot them out cried another man  nevis who saw no help for it produced two papers which the hotelkeeper seized the latter made a sign of agreement when hunter spoke again  yes he confirmed you have given the figures right  hunter once more turned to the waiting men  i think ive made out my case are you convinced that hes a dangerous liar boys  there were cries of assent  lay into the hog with the quirt somebody added  thorne chuckled at the sight of neviss face it was suffused with blood and dark with baffled malevolence the man evidently recognized that he was discredited and would get no further hearing now it occurred to thorne however that his friend had succeeded better than he could reasonably have expected for after all he had not disproved the fact that his wife had in the first place at least borrowed the money without his knowledge the others he thought had not noticed that point  then hunter raised his hand for silence  ill ask symonds and thorne to come into the room with nevis and me he said i want a table to write at for one thing  it did not look as if nevis were particularly anxious to accompany them but symonds who was a powerful man hustled him forward and thorne took his place with his back to the door to keep out the others who seemed desirous of following them hunter sitting down at a table wrote out a check and pocketed the papers nevis gave him in exchange for it then he rose and took up the strongly plaited quirt  now he said addressing nevis ill ask you to walk out on to the veranda and inform our friends outside that you wish to express your regret for the malicious statements you have lately made and that you declare they were completely unjustified  ill see you damned first muttered nevis with a dangerous glitter in his eyes  the events of the next few moments were sudden and confusing and thorne was never able to arrange them clearly in his mind it speedily became evident however that the equity of his cause does not necessarily render a man either invincible or invulnerable nevis although a person of somewhat lethargic physical habits appeared when forced to action sufficiently vigorous and hunter was hampered by the quirt to which he persistently clung though he managed to use it once or twice it was a serious handicap when they came to grips in the meanwhile the dust flew up from the uncovered floor and obscured the view of the men on the veranda who crowded about the window and clamored furiously to get in then in the midst of the turmoil the lamp went out and thorne felt a hand on his shoulder  let them out the hotelkeeper cried  as thorne was forcibly driven away from the door it swung open and a man sprang out on to the veranda with another close behind while confused cries went up  head him off from the stairway  leave them to it  get a light  in a few moments bill pushed through the crowd with a lantern in his hand but before he crossed the veranda another light sprang up again in the room and streamed out through the door and window it fell upon the waiting men and the two dominant figures in the narrow clear space in front of themnevis standing still looking about him savagely with a darkly suffused face and hunter gripping his quirt very quiet and very grim he was however breathing heavily and signs of the conflict were plain on both of them  there was an impressive silence and everybody stood tensely expectant until it was suddenly broken by a murmur and a movement of those nearest the steps they drew back and mrs farquhar and mrs hunter with alison and lucy calvert came up on the veranda moving forward a few paces they stopped in very natural surprise and the stillness grew deeper when hunter suddenly flung down his quirt this was a change in the situation which nobody had anticipated  then a cry rose sharply from somewhere below  miss leigh get back there let me up  it was followed by a shout from the crowd  winthrop  the next moment a man came scrambling up the steps he was hot and dusty and apparently in desperate haste but to thornes astonishment he ran toward alison as he did so nevis sprang toward the veranda rails  slaney he shouted  he was still almost breathless from the struggle and it scarcely seemed possible that his hoarse voice would carry far but winthrop turning suddenly grabbed up a shotgun that lay on a chair one of the outlying farmers had brought it with him for there were duck about just then  call out again and ill plug you sure he threatened and the look in his face suggested that he fully meant it youve hounded me from place to place up and down the prairie youve got my money more than you lent and that wouldnt satisfy you two weeks ago i was working quietly when you put the blamed police on my trail again now i guess ive got you and were going to straighten things  he broke off as lucy stepped forward and laid her hand on the gun and thorne noticed that she placed it with deliberate purpose over the muzzle  let me have it jake the boys will see that he doesnt call out  there was a murmur of assent from the crowd and thorne seized winthrops arm  what do you want miss leigh for anyway lucy asked winthrop  the instinct which had prompted the question seemed so natural to thorne that strung up and intent as he was he smiled but just then winthrop lowered the gun and turned to alison  have you got that mortgage deed and shown it to the lawyer man he asked  its here said alison mr parsons is in the settlement i expect to see him in the next few minutes  it struck thorne that nevis started but before any of those most concerned could speak there was a rapid thud of horsehoofs approaching down the street then a man on the steps cried out  heres slaney and a trooper youve got to quit jake  winthrop plunged into the lighted room and the door closed behind him with a crash a moment or two later another door banged somewhere below and the men poured tumultuously down the steps lucy followed them and almost immediately the veranda was deserted except for thorne and alison and hunter who remained there with his wife though he did not speak to her mrs farquhar had apparently been hustled down the steps by the others in their haste and nevis had also vanished nobody had noticed what became of him in the confusion that succeeded winthrops flight  the thud of hoofs which had ceased for a moment almost immediately began again once the corporals voice rose sharply and then there were disconnected cries a sound of running feet and a clamor that rapidly receded down the street when it grew very faint thorne turned to alison  havent you got something to explain he asked  its very simple said alison winthrop gave me his mortgage deed some time ago he said it would be wiser not to hand it to lucy nevis had got it from him by an excuse but he crept into his office for it late one night i understand it proves that nevis hadnt an indisputable claim to the cattle he sold about a fortnight ago winthrop wrote to me that the police were on his trail again and i was to show the deed to a lawyer and see if it would clear him i dont know why he came here unless it was because the troopers had cut off any other means of escape and he fancied some of his friends would hide him and its also possible that he took the risk of being arrested because of his anxiety to find out what the lawyer thought  thorne nodded  that probably accounts for it though there are still one or two points which are far from clear  a few minutes later a distant clamor broke out again and by degrees confused voices and a sound of footsteps drew nearer then while thorne and alison leaned over the balustrade a crowd poured past in front of the hotel with a mounted figure showing above the shoulders of those about it thorne looked round at the girl  theyve got him at last he said  hunter crossed the veranda and drew him into the adjoining room and alison was left alone with mrs hunter the latter said nothing to her and she sat silent for some time until the lawyer walked up the steps  i was told that i should find miss leigh here  alison said that was her name and the man drawing a chair forward sat down opposite her  i understand that you have winthrops mortgage deed in your possession he now desires you to hand it to me  i shall be very glad to get rid of it declared alison taking the document out of a pocket in her light jacket will you be able to get him off with it  thats a matter on which i cant very well express an opinion until i have read the deed and had a talk with winthrop ive no doubt you have heard that he has just been arrested while endeavoring to escape but i contrived to get a word or two with him and corporal slaney the latter considers it advisable to get his prisoner out of the settlement as soon as possible and i understand he means to spend the night at a homestead a few miles away he has promised me an opportunity for speaking to winthrop when he gets there  i should very much like to hear what you decide alison informed him  the lawyer rose  its probable that i may find it necessary to make a few inquiries in connection with the affair and i have another piece of business which will keep me a day or two in the neighborhood if winthrop has no objections i could no doubt call on you at the farquhar homestead on monday  alison thanked him and soon after he withdrew hunter came out of the hotel with thorne alison accompanied thorne down to the street in search of mrs farquhar then hunter turned toward his wife  if you have nothing more to do here we may as well be getting home he said     chapter xxix  the new outlook   it was unusually dark when florence hunter drove out of the settlement with her husband riding beside the wagon and the roughness of the trail made conversation difficult florence was on the whole glad of this because although she felt that there was a good deal to be said she could not express herself befittingly while her attention was concentrated on the team besides she wanted to see the man and watch his face when she spoke to him  she was accordingly content that he should ride in silence except for an occasional disconnected observation about the horses or the trail to which she merely made a casual answer it was late when they reached the homestead and though a light or two was burning nobody seemed to be about which was however only what she had expected hunter led the horses away toward the stables and entering the house she sat down to wait for him somewhat anxiously though she realized that the possibility of his being angry would not have troubled her a little while ago  he came in at length and stood looking down at her now that the light was better than it had been on the veranda of the hotel she noticed that his lips were cut and that there was a bruise above one cheekbone his jacket was also torn and there was no doubt that taking it all round his appearance was far from reputable that however did not trouble her for she had seen enough at the hotel to realize that the man had been injured while fighting in her cause still she was wise enough not to begin by pitying him  elcot she said i want you to tell me exactly what happened at the settlement  i hadnt arrived at the beginning of it the man replied i had a talk with thorne afterward however and he confirmed my conclusion that nevis had been informing anybody who cared to hear that you were in the habit of borrowing money from him this was objectionable in itself but he added in my hearing that i knew nothing about your action and the way in which he said it was insufferable  florences face flushed  what did you do about it  first of all i denied the most damaging statementthat i knew nothing about the thing it seemed necessary to prove the contrary which i did though i had to admit the borrowing  and then  i paid off the loans  hunter paused and taking out two strips of paper threw them on the table  here are your notes i feel compelled to say that unless you get my consent beforehand you must never incur a liability of the kind again  i shall never wish to florence answered penitently well talk about that afterward i want you to go on you havent told me the whole of it yet  what do you expect to hear  florences eyes flashed  i should like to hear that you had thrashed the man until he could scarcely stand  her husbands face relaxed into a grim smile  well im afraid i didnt go as far as that though it wasnt because the desire to do so failed me as it happens theres a good deal more courage in the fellow than i ever gave him credit for and its unfortunate that virtuous indignation doesnt make up for an inequality in muscular weight he stopped a moment and laughed outright still i believe i got in once or twice with the quirt which is consoling to remember and i dare say i should have left another mark or two on him if the lamp hadnt suddenly been put out on taxing symonds with it afterward he admitted that he was afraid his wife would make trouble if the room should be wrecked  would it please you elcot if i were to say that im very proud of that cut on your lipthough im horribly ashamed of being the cause of it in any case its the simple truth  well take it for granted replied hunter looking at her searchingly the trouble is that this matter has forced on a crisis its evident that our relations cant remain as they are just now  you dont find them satisfactory  no hunter broke into a harsh laugh i dont know how i have borne with them as long as i have though ive resolutely tried to fall in with your point of view anyway i cant go on living with and at the same time utterly apart from you it might have been possible if i had never been fond of you  nobody could have blamed you if you had grown out of that regard for me florence suggested  the difficulty is that i havent done so hunter declared more quietly though there was still a trace of harshness in his tone as you imply its perhaps unreasonable of me but there the fact is the question is what am i going to do  florence stretched out her hands and her voice was very soft  elcot she murmured i really must have tried your patience very hard now and then but just now im glad you find this state of things unbearable would it be very difficult to go back a few years and begin againdifferently  the man moved nearer her and then stopped hesitating  im afraid he answered slowly there are respects in which i cant change to begin with i dont see how i am to provide for you as i should like if i abandon the life you chafe at and give up the farm i have told you this often but even if it stands between us its a truth that must still be faced  florence rose and laid her hands in his  then its fortunate that a change is not impossible to mein fact i think ive changed a good deal already it rather hurt me elcot that you didnt seem to notice it  the man stooped and kissed her  i noticed it he said but i was almost afraid  afraid it wouldnt last florence reproached him well i suppose that is not so very astonishingbut i think this change will go on and grow greater steadily anyway i want it to  then she drew away from him  youre rather a reserved person elcot and it will no doubt be a relief to you if we become severely practical besides i want to show you how determined i am now that you have paid off my debts well get out the accountbooks and you shall decide how im to carry on the homestead  hunter laughed  no accounts tonight its beginning to strike me that both of us might have been happier if i hadnt thought about them so much after all i dare say it isnt wise to give economic questions the foremost place  ah exclaimed florence its a pity it has taken you so long to learn that truth i suppose im fond of moneyat least im fond of the things i used to fancy it could buy but by degrees i found out that it cant buy those that are really worth the most now it almost looks as if i could get them at homewithout any cost  she paused while she sat down and then once more she smiled up at him  well she continued ill probably embarrass you if i go on in this strainyou seem to get uneasy when you venture ever so little out of your shell for a change you can read me the paper you brought from the settlement and i wont grumble if its about the markets and the price of wheat  hunter took up the paper he was where his deeper feelings were concerned a singularly reticent man which was perhaps an excuse for florence and one explanation of the coldness that had grown up between them now he felt that there was to be a change and because the prospect brought him a fervent satisfaction he refrained from speaking of it he had however scarcely opened the paper when he started  heres a piece of striking news he exclaimed brand of winnipeg has gone downa disastrous smash the fall in wheat has broken him it appears that his liabilities are enormous and theres practically nothing to meet them with  he laid down the paper  i wonder he added if nevis could have heard of it before he left the settlementthough i think he must have done so for the mail was already in anyway when i was getting your team bill told me that the man had driven off a few minutes earlier as fast as he could go  but how could the failure in winnipeg affect nevis  brand has been backing him finding him the money to carry on his business and now that he has gone under it may pull him down the creditors will at once try to call in all outstanding loans and i expect nevis has his money so scattered that he cant immediately get hold of it its possible that the failure may drive him out of this part of the country  they talked over the matter at some length and the man was slightly astonished at the acumen his wife displayed when at last he rose it was with a deep content he felt that a vista of happier days was opening up before them both  on the following monday he drove over to the farquhar homestead where thorne was already waiting to hear what the lawyer had to tell the latter however did not arrive until the evening and farquhar took him into the generalroom where the others were sitting  you can of course speak to miss leigh privately if you prefer he said on the other hand we are all of us acquaintances of winthrops and what is as much to the purpose nobody you see here is very fond of nevis  parsons smiled  as a matter of fact i have winthrops permission to tell his friends anything they desire to learn and he mentioned you and mr thorne particularly to begin with i must excuse myself for the delay but i found it necessary to go on to the railroad to meet sergeant williamson and i had to call at mrs calverts to proceed after considering winthrops mortgage deed its my opinion that if he can substantiate his statements he has no cause for serious anxiety about the result in the event of his being brought to trial  it would be difficult to get over the fact that he sold the cattle contested farquhar  it would be impossible parsons corrected him still theres very little doubt that nevis went farther than the homestead laws permit and while our friend would very likely be found guilty of the offense theres so much to mitigate it that im inclined to believe it would be regarded very leniently in fact its scarcely reasonable to suppose that nevis would have proceeded to extremities unless he had counted on being able to retain possession of the mortgage deed  but couldnt he have been compelled to produce it in court thorne inquired  yes if winthrop had been ably represented it must however be borne in mind that he has no great education and he would probably not have set out matters clearly to any one who undertook to plead for him he admits that he never thought of the mortgage deed until somebody suggested that he should try to recover it besides this im inclined to fancy that nevis was influenced by the fact that what appears to be a simple police case based upon an indisputable actin this case the selling of the cattleis apt to be rather casually handled by the court  then you believe he will get off  its by no means certain yet that he will be tried  they heard the announcement with varying astonishment and parsons continued  i endeavored to impress the views i have laid before you on sergeant williamson he explained the matter of course does not rest with him but he has come over to make inquiries and what he has to say will be listened to i also pointed out to him that one would expect the police case to break down if the man who had instituted it was either absent or reluctant to press it he stopped a moment and looked round with a confidential air you have heard that brand of winnipeg has failed disastrously there are reasons for believing that nevis is involved in his fall in any case his office is closed and it is known that he left the settlement presumably for winnipeg by the last montreal express  there was only satisfaction in the faces of those who heard him then mrs farquhar broke the silence  i wonder whether you could add anything to the last piece of information  well smiled parsons prediction is generally dangerous and in my case it would be unprofessional but i may confess that from one or two things i gathered i shouldnt be greatly astonished if nevis failed to come back again  thorne laughed outright  after that he said well take the thing for granted and i havent the least hesitation in declaring that its a great relief to hear it  then the group broke up and alison strolled out with thorne across the prairie a halfmoon hung above its eastern rim and the great sweep of grass ran back into the dim distance faintly touched with the pale silvery light it fell upon the girls face when at length she stopped and stood looking about her with the mans hand on her shoulder a long rise of ground so slight as to be almost imperceptible had cut off the lights of the house and they stood alone in the empty waste surrounded by a deep stillness  it seems such a little while since i first saw the prairie and i shrank from it then she said it looked so bare and grim and utterly forbidding  and now thorne prompted her  alison laughed a little happy laugh  now its harshness has vanished and it has grown beautiful when it lies under the moonlight it is steeped in glamour and mystery even the tiny grasses make elfin music when everything is still i came out at sunrise this morning when a faint breeze got up and listened to them  ah exclaimed thorne softly it is only a few who can hear that music at all and those i think must have it in their hearts already it is a sign that you belong to the wilderness and it has laid its claim on you  alison smiled  now that i have learned to know it a fondness for the wilderness has crept into my blood but after all your views are narrow you dont go quite far enough i think one could sometimes hear the music i spoke of in the noisy cities only as you say it must be in ones heart already  thorne looked down at her with a glow in his eyes  ours are in unison  no protested alison smilingly i think we should not benefit if that were possible the most we can look for is a complex harmony in the strain humanity raises there must be many different notes and many different parts  thorne laughed rather strangely as with a little instinctive movement he straightened himself  but the same insistent throb in all that is worth listening to  ah murmured the girl then you recognized the note of unrest and endeavor though you tried to shut your ears  now i know i heard it in crowded places in the pounding of the forges and the rumble of the mills ive heard it a little plainer in the wash beneath the liners bows and the din the pacific express made crossing the silent prairie with the empress mails still as you suggested i wouldnt grasp its message until one night i sat in the bluff and heard the birch twigs whispering while you rested in the wagon then i knew i was an idler and a trifler one who stood aside while the others took their fill of the joys and pains of life  alison glanced up at him  then you were awake that night  yes i sat beneath a tree and i dont know how often i smoked my pipe out but my mouth was parched at sunrise and there was a new purpose growing into shape at the bottom of my mind you see i realized that i must fall into line and toil like the rest if i wanted you  but you had seen me for only two or three days  thorne laughed softly  i think if i had seen you for only an hour it would have had the same result anyway i tried farming andthough i was very nearly beatenyou can see what i have made of it  he stooped a little toward her  the house is almost ready dear and i want you to drive in to the railroad with me tomorrow a man from winnipeg will be at the hotel then and i should like you to choose what you think is needed from his lists of furnishings  alison looked down for she was conscious of a warmth in her cheeks if you will come over early ill be ready  thorne drew her hand within his arm and they moved on slowly in the faint moonlight that etherealized the plain  it is a marvelous night he exclaimed the wilderness gripped me when i came out but i dont think i ever realized how wonderful it is as i do just now and there are people who can see in it only an empty windswept land  he drew her impulsively to him  still there are excuses for them only part of the glamour is in the prairie the rest of it is due to the supreme good fortune that has fallen to me  you are very sure of that murmured alison  yes declared thorne with resolute decisiveness its a certainty that will only grow deeper as the years roll on   the end
