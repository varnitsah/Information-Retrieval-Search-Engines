phebe earned her welcome      chapter  22  short and sweet     chapter 1 coming home  three young men stood together on a wharf one bright october day awaiting the arrival of an ocean steamer with an impatience which found a vent in lively skirmishes with a small lad who pervaded the premises like a willothewisp and afforded much amusement to the other groups assembled there  they are the campbells waiting for their cousin who has been abroad several years with her uncle the doctor whispered one lady to another as the handsomest of the young men touched his hat to her as he passed lugging the boy whom he had just rescued from a little expedition down among the piles  which is that asked the stranger  prince charlie as hes called a fine fellow the most promising of the seven but a little fast people say answered the first speaker with a shake of the head  are the others his brothers  no cousins the elder is archie a most exemplary young man he has just gone into business with the merchant uncle and bids fair to be an honor to his family the other with the eyeglasses and no gloves is mac the odd one just out of college  and the boy  oh he is jamie the youngest brother of archibald and the pet of the whole family mercy on us hell be in if they dont hold on to him  the ladies chat came to a sudden end just there for by the time jamie had been fished out of a hogshead the steamer hove in sight and everything else was forgotten as it swung slowly around to enter the dock a boyish voice shouted there she is i see her and uncle and phebe hooray for cousin rose and three small cheers were given with a will by jamie as he stood on a post waving his arms like a windmill while his brother held onto the tail of his jacket  yes there they were uncle alec swinging his hat like a boy with phebe smiling and nodding on one side and rose kissing both hands delightedly on the other as she recognized familiar faces and heard familiar voices welcoming her home  bless her dear heart shes bonnier than ever looks like a madonna doesnt she with that blue cloak round her and her bright hair flying in the wind said charlie excitedly as they watched the group upon the deck with eager eyes  madonnas dont wear hats like that rose hasnt changed much but phebe has why shes a regular beauty answered archie staring with all his might at the darkeyed young woman with the brilliant color and glossy black braids shining in the sun  dear old uncle doesnt it seem good to have him back was all mac said but he was not looking at dear old uncle as he made the fervent remark for he saw only the slender blond girl nearby and stretched out his hands to meet hers forgetful of the green water tumbling between them  during the confusion that reigned for a moment as the steamer settled to her moorings rose looked down into the four faces upturned to hers and seemed to read in them something that both pleased and pained her it was only a glance and her own eyes were full but through the mist of happy tears she received the impression that archie was about the same that mac had decidedly improved and that something was amiss with charlie there was no time for observation however for in a moment the shoreward rush began and before she could grasp her traveling bag jamie was clinging to her like an ecstatic young bear she was with difficulty released from his embrace to fall into the gentler ones of the elder cousins who took advantage of the general excitement to welcome both blooming girls with affectionate impartiality then the wanderers were borne ashore in a triumphal procession while jamie danced rapturous jigs before them even on the gangway  archie remained to help his uncle get the luggage through the custom house and the others escorted the damsels home no sooner were they shut up in a carriage however than a new and curious constraint seemed to fall upon the young people for they realized all at once that their former playmates were men and women now fortunately jamie was quite free from this feeling of restraint and sitting bodkinwise between the ladies took all sorts of liberties with them and their belongings  well my mannikin what do you think of us asked rose to break an awkward pause  youve both grown so pretty i cant decide which i like best phebe is the biggest and brightestlooking and i was always fond of phebe but somehow you are so kind of sweet and precious i really think i must hug you again and the small youth did it tempestuously  if you love me best i shall not mind a bit about your thinking phebe the handsomest because she is isnt she boys asked rose with a mischievous look at the gentlemen opposite whose faces expressed a respectful admiration which much amused her  im so dazzled by the brilliancy and beauty that has suddenly burst upon me i have no words to express my emotions answered charlie gallantly dodging the dangerous question  i cant say yet for i have not had time to look at anyone i will now if you dont mind and to the great amusement of the rest mac gravely adjusted his eyeglasses and took an observation  well said phebe smiling and blushing under his honest stare yet seeming not to resent it as she did the lordly sort of approval which made her answer the glance of charlies audacious blue eyes with a flash of her black ones  i think if you were my sister i should be very proud of you because your face shows what i admire more than its beauty truth and courage phebe answered mac with a little bow full of such genuine respect that surprise and pleasure brought a sudden dew to quench the fire of the girls eyes and soothe the sensitive pride of the girls heart  rose clapped her hands just as she used to do when anything delighted her and beamed at mac approvingly as she said now thats a criticism worth having and we are much obliged i was sure youd admire my phebe when you knew her but i didnt believe you would be wise enough to see it at once and you have gone up many pegs in my estimation i assure you  i was always fond of mineralogy you remember and ive been tapping round a good deal lately so ive learned to know precious metals when i see them mac said with his shrewd smile  that is the latest hobby then your letters have amused us immensely for each one had a new theory or experiment and the latest was always the best i thought uncle would have died of laughter over the vegetarian mania it was so funny to imagine you living on bread and milk baked apples and potatoes roasted in your own fire continued rose changing the subject again  this old chap was the laughingstock of his class they called him don quixote and the way he went at windmills of all sorts was a sight to see put in charlie evidently feeling that mac had been patted on the head quite as much as was good for him  but in spite of that the don got through college with all the honors oh wasnt i proud when aunt jane wrote to us about it and didnt she rejoice that her boy kept at the head of his class and won the medal cried rose shaking mac by both hands in a way that caused charlie to wish the old chap had been left behind with dr alec  oh come thats all mothers nonsense i began earlier than the other fellows and liked it better so i dont deserve any praise prince is right though i did make a regular jack of myself but on the whole im not sure that my wild oats werent better than some ive seen sowed anyway they didnt cost much and im none the worse for them said mac placidly  i know what wild oats means i heard uncle mac say charlie was sowing em too fast and i asked mama so she told me and i know that he was suspelled or expended i dont remember which but it was something bad and aunt clara cried added jamie all in one breath for he possessed a fatal gift of making malapropos remarks which caused him to be a terror to his family  do you want to go on the box again demanded prince with a warning frown  no i dont  then hold your tongue  well mac neednt kick me for i was only began the culprit innocently trying to make a bad matter worse  that will do interrupted charlie sternly and james subsided a crushed boy consoling himself with roses new watch for the indignities he suffered at the hands of the old fellows as he vengefully called his elders  mac and charlie immediately began to talk as hard as their tongues could wag bringing up all sorts of pleasant subjects so successfully that peals of laughter made passersby look after the merry load with sympathetic smiles  an avalanche of aunts fell upon rose as soon as she reached home and for the rest of the day the old house buzzed like a beehive evening found the whole tribe collected in the drawing rooms with the exception of aunt peace whose place was empty now  naturally enough the elders settled into one group after a while and the young fellows clustered about the girls like butterflies around two attractive flowers dr alec was the central figure in one room and rose in the other for the little girl whom they had all loved and petted had bloomed into a woman and two years of absence had wrought a curious change in the relative positions of the cousins especially the three elder ones who eyed her with a mixture of boyish affection and manly admiration that was both new and pleasant  something sweet yet spirited about her charmed them and piqued their curiosity for she was not quite like other girls and rather startled them now and then by some independent little speech or act which made them look at one another with a sly smile as if reminded that rose was uncles girl  let us listen as in duty bound to what the elders are saying first for they are already building castles in air for the boys and girls to inhabit  dear child how nice it is to see her safely back so well and happy and like her sweet little self said aunt plenty folding her hands as if giving thanks for a great happiness  i shouldnt wonder if you found that youd brought a firebrand into the family alec two in fact for phebe is a fine girl and the lads have found it out already if im not mistaken added uncle mac with a nod toward the other room  all eyes followed his and a highly suggestive tableau presented itself to the paternal and maternal audience in the back parlor  rose and phebe sitting side by side on the sofa had evidently assumed at once the places which they were destined to fill by right of youth sex and beauty for phebe had long since ceased to be the maid and become the friend and rose meant to have that fact established at once  jamie occupied the rug on which will and geordie stood at ease showing their uniforms to the best advantage for they were now in a great school where military drill was the delight of their souls steve posed gracefully in an armchair with mac lounging over the back of it while archie leaned on one corner of the low chimneypiece looking down at phebe as she listened to his chat with smiling lips and cheeks almost as rich in color as the carnations in her belt  but charlie was particularly effective although he sat upon a music stool that most trying position for any man not gifted with grace in the management of his legs fortunately prince was and had fallen into an easy attitude with one arm over the back of the sofa his handsome head bent a little as he monopolized rose with a devoted air and a very becoming expression of contentment on his face  aunt clara smiled as if well pleased aunt jessie looked thoughtful aunt janes keen eyes went from dapper steve to broadshouldered mac with an anxious glance mrs myra murmured something about her blessed caroline and aunt plenty said warmly bless the dears anyone might be proud of such a bonny flock of bairns as that  i am all ready to play chaperon as soon as you please alec for i suppose the dear girl will come out at once as she did not before you went away my services wont be wanted long i fancy for with her many advantages she will be carried off in her first season or im much mistaken said mrs clara with significant nods and smiles  you must settle all those matters with rose i am no longer captain only first mate now you know answered dr alec adding soberly half to himself half to his brother i wonder people are in such haste to bring out their daughters as its called to me there is something almost pathetic in the sight of a young girl standing on the threshold of the world so innocent and hopeful so ignorant of all that lies before her and usually so ill prepared to meet the ups and downs of life we do our duty better by the boys but the poor little women are seldom provided with any armor worth having and sooner or later they are sure to need it for every one must fight her own battle and only the brave and strong can win  you cant reproach yourself with neglect of that sort alec for you have done your duty faithfully by georges girl and i envy you the pride and happiness of having such a daughter for she is that to you answered old mac unexpectedly betraying the paternal sort of tenderness men seldom feel for their sons  ive tried mac and i am both proud and happy but with every year my anxiety seems to increase ive done my best to fit rose for what may come as far as i can foresee it but now she must stand alone and all my care is powerless to keep her heart from aching her life from being saddened by mistakes or thwarted by the acts of others i can only stand ready to share her joy and sorrow and watch her shape her life  why alec what is the child going to do that you need look so solemn exclaimed mrs clara who seemed to have assumed a sort of right to rose already  hark and let her tell you herself answered dr alec as roses voice was heard saying very earnestly now you have all told your plans for the future why dont you ask us ours  because we know that there is only one thing for a pretty girl to do break a dozen or so hearts before she finds one to suit then marry and settle answered charlie as if no other reply was possible  that may be the case with many but not with us for phebe and i believe that it is as much a right and a duty for women to do something with their lives as for men and we are not going to be satisfied with such frivolous parts as you give us cried rose with kindling eyes i mean what i say and you cannot laugh me down would you be contented to be told to enjoy yourself for a little while then marry and do nothing more till you die she added turning to archie  of course not that is only a part of a mans life he answered decidedly  a very precious and lovely part but not all continued rose neither should it be for a woman for weve got minds and souls as well as hearts ambition and talents as well as beauty and accomplishments and we want to live and learn as well as love and be loved im sick of being told that is all a woman is fit for i wont have anything to do with love till i prove that i am something besides a housekeeper and babytender  heaven preserve us heres womans rights with a vengeance cried charlie starting up with mock horror while the others regarded rose with mingled surprise and amusement evidently fancying it all a girlish outbreak  ah you neednt pretend to be shocked you will be in earnest presently for this is only the beginning of my strongmindedness continued rose nothing daunted by the smiles of goodnatured incredulity or derision on the faces of her cousins i have made up my mind not to be cheated out of the real things that make one good and happy and just because im a rich girl fold my hands and drift as so many do i havent lived with phebe all these years in vain i know what courage and selfreliance can do for one and i sometimes wish i hadnt a penny in the world so that i could go and earn my bread with her and be as brave and independent as she will be pretty soon  it was evident that rose was in earnest now for as she spoke she turned to her friend with such respect as well as love in her face that the look told better than any words how heartily the rich girl appreciated the virtues hard experience had given the poor girl and how eagerly she desired to earn what all her fortune could not buy for her  something in the glance exchanged between the friends impressed the young men in spite of their prejudices and it was in a perfectly serious tone that archie said i fancy youll find your hands full cousin if you want work for ive heard people say that wealth has its troubles and trials as well as poverty  i know it and im going to try and fill my place well ive got some capital little plans all made and have begun to study my profession already answered rose with an energetic nod  could i ask what it is to be inquired charlie in a tone of awe  guess and rose looked up at him with an expression halfearnest halfmerry  well i should say that you were fitted for a beauty and a belle but as that is evidently not to your taste i am afraid you are going to study medicine and be a doctor wont your patients have a heavenly time though it will be easy dying with an angel to poison them  now charlie thats base of you when you know how well women have succeeded in this profession and what a comfort dr mary kirk was to dear aunt peace i did want to study medicine but uncle thought it wouldnt do to have so many mds in one family since mac thinks of trying it besides i seem to have other work put into my hands that i am better fitted for  you are fitted for anything that is generous and good and ill stand by you no matter what youve chosen cried mac heartily for this was a new style of talk from a girls lips and he liked it immensely  philanthropy is a generous good and beautiful profession and ive chosen it for mine because i have much to give im only the steward of the fortune papa left me and i think if i use it wisely for the happiness of others it will be more blest than if i keep it all for myself  very sweetly and simply was this said but it was curious to see how differently the various hearers received it  charlie shot a quick look at his mother who exclaimed as if in spite of herself now alec are you going to let that girl squander a fine fortune on all sorts of charitable nonsense and wild schemes for the prevention of pauperism and crime  they who give to the poor lend to the lord and practical christianity is the kind he loves the best was all dr alec answered but it silenced the aunts and caused even prudent uncle mac to think with sudden satisfaction of certain secret investments he had made which paid him no interest but the thanks of the poor  archie and mac looked well pleased and promised their advice and assistance with the enthusiasm of generous young hearts steve shook his head but said nothing and the lads on the rug at once proposed founding a hospital for invalid dogs and horses white mice and wounded heroes  dont you think that will be a better way for a woman to spend her life than in dancing dressing and husbandhunting charlie asked rose observing his silence and anxious for his approval  very pretty for a little while and very effective too for i dont know anything more captivating than a sweet girl in a meek little bonnet going on charitable errands and glorifying poor peoples houses with a delightful mixture of beauty and benevolence fortunately the dear souls soon tire of it but its heavenly while it lasts  charlie spoke in a tone of mingled admiration and contempt and smiled a superior sort of smile as if he understood all the innocent delusions as well as the artful devices of the sex and expected nothing more from them it both surprised and grieved rose for it did not sound like the charlie she had left two years ago but she only said with a reproachful look and a proud little gesture of head and hand as if she put the subject aside since it was not treated with respect i am sorry you have so low an opinion of women there was a time when you believed in them sincerely  i do still upon my word i do they havent a more devoted admirer and slave in the world than i am just try me and see cried charlie gallantly kissing his hand to the sex in general  but rose was not appeased and gave a disdainful shrug as she answered with a look in her eyes that his lordship did not like thank you i dont want admirers or slaves but friends and helpers ive lived so long with a wise good man that i am rather hard to suit perhaps but i dont intend to lower my standard and anyone who cares for my regard must at least try to live up to it  whew heres a wrathful dove come and smooth her ruffled plumage mac ill dodge before i do further mischief and charlie strolled away into the other room privately lamenting that uncle alec had spoiled a fine girl by making her strongminded  he wished himself back again in five minutes for mac said something that produced a gale of laughter and when he took a look over his shoulder the wrathful dove was cooing so peacefully and pleasantly he was sorely tempted to return and share the fun but charlie had been spoiled by too much indulgence and it was hard for him to own himself in the wrong even when he knew it he always got what he wanted sooner or later and having long ago made up his mind that rose and her fortune were to be his he was secretly displeased at the new plans and beliefs of the young lady but flattered himself that they would soon be changed when she saw how unfashionable and inconvenient they were  musing over the delightful future he had laid out he made himself comfortable in the sofa corner near his mother till the appearance of a slight refection caused both groups to melt into one aunt plenty believed in eating and drinking so the slightest excuse for festivity delighted her hospitable soul and on this joyful occasion she surpassed herself  it was during this informal banquet that rose roaming about from one admiring relative to another came upon the three younger lads who were having a quiet little scuffle in a secluded corner  come out here and let me have a look at you she said enticingly for she predicted an explosion and public disgrace if peace was not speedily restored  hastily smoothing themselves down the young gentlemen presented three flushed and merry countenances for inspection feeling highly honored by the command  dear me how you two have grown you big things how dare you get head of me in this way she said standing on tiptoe to pat the curly pates before her for will and geordie had shot up like weeds and now grinned cheerfully down upon her as she surveyed them in comic amazement  the campbells are all fine tall fellows and we mean to be the best of the lot shouldnt wonder if we were sixfooters like grandpa observed will proudly looking so like a young shanghai rooster all legs and an insignificant head that rose kept her countenance with difficulty  we shall broaden out when we get our growth we are taller than steve now a half a head both of us added geordie with his nose in the air  rose turned to look at steve and with a sudden smile beckoned to him he dropped his napkin and flew to obey the summons for she was queen of the hour and he had openly announced his deathless loyalty  tell the other boys to come here ive a fancy to stand you all in a row and look you over as you did me that dreadful day when you nearly frightened me out of my wits she said laughing at the memory of it as she spoke  they came in a body and standing shoulder to shoulder made such an imposing array that the young commander was rather daunted for a moment but she had seen too much of the world lately to be abashed by a trifle and the desire to see a girlish test gave her courage to face the line of smiling cousins with dignity and spirit  now im going to stare at you as you stared at me it is my revenge on you seven bad boys for entrapping one poor little girl and enjoying her alarm im not a bit afraid of you now so tremble and beware  as she spoke rose looked up into archies face and nodded approvingly for the steady gray eyes met hers fairly and softened as they did so a becoming change for naturally they were rather keen than kind  a true campbell bless you she said and shook his hand heartily as she passed on  charlie came next and here she felt less satisfied though scarcely conscious why for as she looked there came a defiant sort of flash changing suddenly to something warmer than anger stronger than pride making her shrink a little and say hastily i dont find the charlie i left but the prince is there still i see  turning to mac with a sense of relief she gently took off his winkers as jamie called them and looked straight into the honest blue eyes that looked straight back at her full of a frank and friendly affection that warmed her heart and made her own eyes brighten as she gave back the glasses saying with a look and tone of cordial satisfaction you are not changed my dear old mac and im so glad of that  now say something extra sweet to me because im the flower of the family said steve twirling the blond moustache which was evidently the pride of his life  rose saw at a glance that dandy deserved his name more than ever and promptly quenched his vanities by answering with a provoking laugh then the name of the flower of the family is cockscomb  ah ha whos got it now jeered will  let us off easy please whispered geordie mindful that their turn came next  you blessed beanstalks im proud of you only dont grow quite out of sight or even be ashamed to look a woman in the face answered rose with a gentle pat on the cheek of either bashful young giant for both were red as peonies though their boyish eyes were as clear and calm as summer lakes  now me and jamie assumed his manliest air feeling that he did not appear to advantage among his tall kinsmen but he went to the head of the class in everyones opinion when rose put her arms around him saying with a kiss you must be my boy now for all the others are too old and i want a faithful little page to do my errands for me  i will i will ill marry you too if youll just hold on till i grow up cried jamie rather losing his head at this sudden promotion  bless the baby what is he talking about laughed rose looking down at her little knight as he clung about her with grateful ardor  oh i heard the aunts say that youd better marry one of us and keep the property in the family so i speak first because you are very fond of me and i do love curls  alas for jamie this awful speech had hardly left his innocent lips when will and geordie swept him out of the room like a whirlwind and the howls of that hapless boy were heard from the torture hall where being shut into the skeleton case was one of the mildest punishments inflicted upon him  dismay fell upon the unfortunates who remained but their confusion was soon ended for rose with a look which they had never seen upon her face before dismissed them with the brief command break ranks the review is over and walked away to phebe  confound that boy you ought to shut him up or gag him fumed charlie irritably  he shall be attended to answered poor archie who was trying to bring up the little marplot with the success of most parents and guardians  the whole thing was deuced disagreeable growled steve who felt that he had not distinguished himself in the late engagement  truth generally is observed mac dryly as he strolled away with his odd smile  as if he suspected discord somewhere dr alec proposed music at this crisis and the young people felt that it was a happy thought  i want you to hear both my birds for they have improved immensely and i am very proud of them said the doctor twirling up the stool and pulling out the old music books  i had better come first for after you have heard the nightingale you wont care for the canary added rose wishing to put phebe at her ease for she sat among them looking like a picture but rather shy and silent remembering the days when her place was in the kitchen  ill give you some of the dear old songs you used to like so much this was a favorite i think and sitting down she sang the first familiar air that came and sang it well in a pleasant but by no means finished manner  it chanced to be the birks of aberfeldie and vividly recalled the time when mac was ill and she took care of him the memory was sweet to her and involuntarily her eye wandered in search of him he was not far away sitting just as he used to sit when she soothed his most despondent moods astride of a chair with his head down on his arms as if the song suggested the attitude her heart quite softened to him as she looked and she decided to forgive him if no one else for she was sure that he had no mercenary plans about her tiresome money  charlie had assumed a pensive air and fixed his fine eyes upon her with an expression of tender admiration which made her laugh in spite of all her efforts to seem unconscious of it she was both amused and annoyed at his very evident desire to remind her of certain sentimental passages in the last year of their girl and boyhood and to change what she had considered a childish joke into romantic earnest rose had very serious ideas of love and had no intention of being beguiled into even a flirtation with her handsome cousin  so charlie attitudinized unnoticed and was getting rather out of temper when phebe began to sing and he forgot all about himself in admiration of her it took everyone by surprise for two years of foreign training added to several at home had worked wonders and the beautiful voice that used to warble cheerily over pots and kettles now rang out melodiously or melted to a mellow music that woke a sympathetic thrill in those who listened rose glowed with pride as she accompanied her friend for phebe was in her own world now a lovely world where no depressing memory of poorhouse or kitchen ignorance or loneliness came to trouble her a happy world where she could be herself and rule others by the magic of her sweet gift  yes phebe was herself now and showed it in the change that came over her at the first note of music no longer shy and silent no longer the image of a handsome girl but a blooming woman alive and full of the eloquence her art gave her as she laid her hands softly together fixed her eye on the light and just poured out her song as simply and joyfully as the lark does soaring toward the sun  my faith alec thats the sort of voice that wins a mans heart out of his breast exclaimed uncle mac wiping his eyes after one of the plaintive ballads that never grow old  so it would answered dr alec delightedly  so it has added archie to himself and he was right for just at that moment he fell in love with phebe he actually did and could fix the time almost to a second for at a quarter past nine he merely thought her a very charming young person at twenty minutes past he considered her the loveliest woman he ever beheld at five and twenty minutes past she was an angel singing his soul away and at half after nine he was a lost man floating over a delicious sea to that temporary heaven on earth where lovers usually land after the first rapturous plunge  if anyone had mentioned this astonishing fact nobody would have believed it nevertheless it was quite true and sober businesslike archie suddenly discovered a fund of romance at the bottom of his hitherto wellconducted heart that amazed him he was not quite clear what had happened to him at first and sat about in a dazed sort of way seeing hearing knowing nothing but phebe while the unconscious idol found something wanting in the cordial praise so modestly received because mr archie never said a word  this was one of the remarkable things which occurred that evening another was that mac paid rose a compliment which was such an unprecedented fact it produced a great sensation though only one person heard it  everybody had gone but mac and his father who was busy with the doctor aunt plenty was counting the teaspoons in the dining room and phebe was helping her as of old mac and rose were alone he apparently in a brown study leaning his elbows on the chimneypiece and she lying back in a low chair looking thoughtfully at the fire she was tired and the quiet was grateful to her so she kept silence and mac respectfully held his tongue presently however she became conscious that he was looking at her as intently as eyes and glasses could do it and without stirring from her comfortable attitude she said smiling up at him he looks as wise as an owl i wonder what hes thinking about  you cousin  something good i hope  i was thinking leigh hunt was about right when he said a girl is the sweetest thing god ever made  why mac and rose sat bolt upright with an astonished face this was such an entirely unexpected sort of remark for the philosopher to make  evidently interested in the new discovery mac placidly continued do you know it seems as if i never really saw a girl before or had any idea what agreeable creatures they could be i fancy you are a remarkably good specimen rose  no indeed im only hearty and happy and being safe at home again may make me look better than usual perhaps but im no beauty except to uncle  hearty and happy that must be it echoed mac soberly investigating the problem most girls are sickly or silly i think i have observed and that is probably why i am so struck with you  of all the queer boys you are the queerest do you really mean that you dont like or notice girls asked rose much amused at this new peculiarity of her studious cousin  well no i am only conscious of two sorts noisy and quiet ones i prefer the latter but as a general thing i dont notice any of them much more than i do flies unless they bother me then id like to flap them away but as that wont do i hide  rose leaned back and laughed until her eyes were full it was so comical to hear mac sink his voice to a confidential whisper at the last words and see him smile with sinful satisfaction at the memory of the tormentors he had eluded  you neednt laugh its a fact i assure you charlie likes the creatures and they spoil him steve follows suit of course archie is a respectful slave when he cant help himself as for me i dont often give them a chance and when i get caught i talk science and dead languages till they run for their lives now and then i find a sensible one and then we get on excellently  a sad prospect for phebe and me sighed rose trying to keep sober  phebe is evidently a quiet one i know she is sensible or you wouldnt care for her i can see that she is pleasant to look at so i fancy i shall like her as for you i helped bring you up therefore i am a little anxious to see how you turn out i was afraid your foreign polish might spoil you but i think it has not in fact i find you quite satisfactory so far if you dont mind my saying it i dont quite know what the charm is though must be the power of inward graces since you insist that you have no outer ones  mac was peering at her with a shrewd smile on his lips but such a kindly look behind the glasses that she found both words and glance very pleasant and answered merrily i am glad you approve of me and much obliged for your care of my early youth i hope to be a credit to you and depend on your keeping me straight for im afraid i shall be spoilt among you all  ill keep my eye on you upon one condition replied the youthful mentor  name it  if you are going to have a lot of lovers around i wash my hands of you if not im your man  you must be sheep dog and help keep them away for i dont want any yet awhile and between ourselves i dont believe i shall have any if it is known that i am strongminded that fact will scare most men away like a yellow flag said rose for thanks to dr alecs guardianship she had wasted neither heart nor time in the foolish flirtations so many girls fritter away their youth upon  hum i rather doubt that muttered mac as he surveyed the damsel before him  she certainly did not look unpleasantly strongminded and she was beautiful in spite of her modest denials beautiful with the truest sort of beauty for nobility of character lent its subtle charm to the bloom of youth the freshness of health the innocence of a nature whose sweet maidenliness mac felt but could not describe gentle yet full of spirit and all aglow with the earnestness that suggests lovely possibilities and makes one hope that such human flowers may have heavens purest air and warmest sunshine to blossom in  wait and see answered rose then as her uncles voice was heard in the hall she held out her hand adding pleasantly the old times are to begin again so come soon and tell me all your doings and help me with mine just as you used to do  you really mean it and mac looked much pleased  i really do you are so little altered except to grow big that i dont feel at all strange with you and want to begin where we left off  that will be capital good night cousin and to her great amazement he gave her a hearty kiss  oh but that is not the old way at all cried rose stepping back in merry confusion while the audacious youth assumed an air of mild surprise as he innocently asked didnt we always say good night in that way i had an impression that we did and were to begin just as we left off  of course not no power on earth would have bribed you to do it as you know well enough i dont mind the first night but we are too old for that sort of thing now  ill remember it was the force of habit i suppose for im sure i must have done it in former times it seemed so natural coming father and mac retired evidently convinced he was right  dear old thing he is as much a boy as ever and that is such a comfort for some of the others have grown up very fast said rose to herself recalling charlies sentimental airs and archies beatified expression while phebe sang     chapter 2 old friends with new faces  it is so good to be home again i wonder how we ever made up our minds to go away exclaimed rose as she went roaming about the old house next morning full of the satisfaction one feels at revisiting familiar nooks and corners and finding them unchanged  that we might have the pleasure of coming back again answered phebe walking down the hall beside her little mistress as happy as she  everything seems just as we left it even to the rose leaves we used to tuck in here continued the younger girl peeping into one of the tall india jars that stood about the hall  dont you remember how jamie and pokey used to play forty thieves with them and how you tried to get into that blue one and got stuck and the other boys found us before i could pull you out asked phebe laughing  yes indeed and speaking of angels one is apt to hear the rustling of their wings added rose as a shrill whistle came up the avenue accompanied by the clatter of hoofs  it is the circus cried phebe gaily as they both recalled the red cart and the charge of the clan  there was only one boy now alas but he made noise enough for half a dozen and before rose could run to the door jamie came bouncing in with a shining morning face a bat over his shoulder a red and white jockey cap on his head one pocket bulging with a big ball the other overflowing with cookies and his mouth full of the apple he was just finishing off in hot haste  morning i just looked in to make sure youd really come and see that you were all right he observed saluting with bat and doffing the gay cap with one effective twitch  good morning dear yes we really are here and getting to rights as fast as possible but it seems to me you are rather gorgeous jamie what do you belong to a fire company or a jockey club asked rose turning up the once chubby face which now was getting brown and square about the chin  no maam why dont you know im captain of the base ball star club look at that will you and as if the fact were one of national importance jamie flung open his jacket to display upon his proudly swelling chest an heartshaped red flannel shield decorated with a white cotton star the size of a tea plate  superb ive been away so long i forgot there was such a game and you the captain cried rose deeply impressed by the high honor to which her kinsman had arrived  i just am and its no joke youd better believe for we knock our teeth out black our eyes and split our fingers almost as well as the big fellows you come down to the common between one and two and see us play a match then youll understand what hard work it is ill teach you to bat now if youll come out on the lawn added jamie fired with a wish to exhibit his prowess  no thank you captain the grass is wet and youll be late at school if you stay for us  im not afraid girls are not good for much generally but you never used to mind a little wet and played cricket like a good one cant you ever do that sort of thing now asked the boy with a pitying look at these hapless creatures debarred from the joys and perils of manly sports  i can run still and ill get to the gate before you see if i dont and yielding to the impulse of the moment rose darted down the steps before astonished jamie could mount and follow  he was off in a moment but rose had the start and though old sheltie did his best she reached the goal just ahead and stood there laughing and panting all rosy with fresh october air a pretty picture for several gentlemen who were driving by  good for you rose said archie jumping out to shake hands while will and geordie saluted and uncle mac laughed at jamie who looked as if girls had risen slightly in his opinion  im glad it is you because you wont be shocked but im so happy to be back i forgot i was not little rose still said atalanta smoothing down her flying hair  you look very like her with the curls on your shoulders in the old way i missed them last night and wondered what it was how are uncle and phebe asked archie whose eyes had been looking over roses head while he spoke toward the piazza where a female figure was visible among the reddening woodbines  all well thanks wont you come up and see for yourselves  cant my dear cant possibly business you know business this fellow is my righthand man and i cant spare him a minute come arch we must be off or these boys will miss their train answered uncle mac pulling out his watch  with a last look from the lighthaired figure at the gate to the darkhaired one among the vines archie drove away and jamie cantered after consoling himself for his defeat with apple number two  rose lingered a moment feeling much inclined to continue her run and pop in upon all the aunts in succession but remembering her uncovered head was about to turn back when a cheerful ahoy ahoy made her look up to see mac approaching at a great pace waving his hat as he came  the campbells are coming thick and fast this morning and the more the merrier she said running to meet him you look like a good boy going to school and virtuously conning your lesson by the way she added smiling to see him take his finger out of the book he had evidently been reading and tuck it under his arm just as he used to do years ago  i am a schoolboy going to the school i like best he answered waving a plumy spray of asters as if pointing out the lovely autumn world about them full of gay hues fresh airs and mellow sunshine  that reminds me that i didnt get a chance to hear much about your plans last night the other boys all talked at once and you only got a word now and then what have you decided to be mac asked rose as they went up the avenue side by side  a man first and a good one if possible after that what god pleases  something in the tone as well as the words made rose look up quickly into macs face to see a new expression there it was indescribable but she felt as she had often done when watching the mists part suddenly giving glimpses of some mountaintop shining serene and high against the blue  i think you will be something splendid for you really look quite glorified walking under this arch of yellow leaves with the sunshine on your face she exclaimed conscious of a sudden admiration never felt before for mac was the plainest of all the cousins  i dont know about that but i have my dreams and aspirations and some of them are pretty high ones aim at the best you know and keep climbing if you want to get on he said looking at the asters with an inward sort of smile as if he and they had some sweet secret between them  you are queerer than ever but i like your ambition and hope you will get on only mustnt you begin at something soon i fancied you would study medicine with uncle that used to be our plan you know  i shall for the present at least because i quite agree with you that it is necessary to have an anchor somewhere and not go floating off into the world of imagination without ballast of the right sort uncle and i had some talk about it last night and im going to begin as soon as possible for ive mooned long enough and giving himself a shake mac threw down the pretty spray adding half aloud      chide me not laborious band       for the idle flowers i brought      every aster in my hand       goes home laden with a thought  rose caught the words and smiled thinking to herself oh thats it he is getting into the sentimental age and aunt jane has been lecturing him dear me how we are growing up  you look as if you didnt like the prospect very well she said aloud for mac had rammed the volume of shelley into his pocket and the glorified expression was so entirely gone rose fancied she had been mistaken about the mountaintop behind the mists  yes well enough i always thought the profession a grand one and where could i find a better teacher than uncle ive got into lazy ways lately and it is high time i went at something useful so here i go and mac abruptly vanished into the study while rose joined phebe in aunt plentys room  the dear old lady had just decided after long and earnest discussion which of six favorite puddings should be served for dinner and thus had a few moments to devote to sentiment so when rose came in she held out her arms saying fondly i shall not feel as if id got my child back again until i have her in my lap a minute no youre not a bit too heavy my rheumatism doesnt begin much before november so sit here darling and put your two arms round my neck  rose obeyed and neither spoke for a moment as the old woman held the young one close and appeased the two years longing of a motherly heart by the caresses women give the creatures dearest to them right in the middle of a kiss however she stopped suddenly and holding out one arm caught phebe who was trying to steal away unobserved  dont go theres room for both in my love though there isnt in my lap im so grateful to get my dear girls safely home again that i hardly know what im about said aunt plenty embracing phebe so heartily that she could not feel left out in the cold and stood there with her black eyes shining through the happiest tears  there now ive had a good hug and feel as if i was all right again i wish youd set that cap in order rose i went to bed in such a hurry i pulled the strings off it and left it all in a heap phebe dear you shall dust round a mite just as you used to for i havent had anyone to do it as i like since youve been gone and it will do me good to see all my knickknacks straightened out in your tidy way said the elder lady getting up with a refreshed expression on her rosy old face  shall i dust in here too asked phebe glancing toward an inner room which used to be her care  no dear id rather do that myself go in if you like nothing is changed i must go and see to my pudding and aunt plenty trotted abruptly away with a quiver of emotion in her voice which made even her last words pathetic  pausing on the threshold as if it was a sacred place the girls looked in with eyes soon dimmed by tender tears for it seemed as if the gentle occupant was still there sunshine shone on the old geraniums by the window the cushioned chair stood in its accustomed place with the white wrapper hung across it and the faded slippers lying ready books and basket knitting and spectacles were all just as she had left them and the beautiful tranquility that always filled the room seemed so natural both lookers turned involuntarily toward the bed where aunt peace used to greet them with a smile there was no sweet old face upon the pillow now yet the tears that wet the blooming cheeks were not for her who had gone but for her who was left because they saw something which spoke eloquently of the love which outlives death and makes the humblest things beautiful and sacred  a wellworn footstool stood beside the bed and in the highpiled whiteness of the empty couch there was a little hollow where a gray head nightly rested while aunt plenty said the prayers her mother taught her seventy years ago  without a word the girls softly shut the door and while phebe put the room in the most exquisite order rose retrimmed the plain white cap where pink and yellow ribbons never rustled now both feeling honored by their tasks and better for their knowledge of the faithful love and piety which sanctified a good old womans life  you darling creature im so glad to get you back i know its shamefully early but i really couldnt keep away another minute let me help you im dying to see all your splendid things i saw the trunks pass and i know youve quantities of treasures cried annabel bliss all in one breath as she embraced rose an hour later and glanced about the room bestrewn with a variety of agreeable objects  how well you are looking sit down and ill show you my lovely photographs uncle chose all the best for me and its a treat to see them answered rose putting a roll on the table and looking about for more  oh thanks i havent time now one needs hours to study such things show me your paris dresses theres a dear im perfectly aching to see the last styles and annabel cast a hungry eye toward certain large boxes delightfully suggestive of french finery  i havent got any said rose fondly surveying the fine photographs as she laid them away  rose campbell you dont mean to say that you didnt get one paris dress at least cried annabel scandalized at the bare idea of such neglect  not one for myself aunt clara ordered several and will be charmed to show them when her box comes  such a chance right there and plenty of money how could you love your uncle after such cruelty sighed annabel with a face full of sympathy  rose looked puzzled for a minute then seemed to understand and assumed a superior air which became her very well as she said goodnaturedly opening a box of laces uncle did not forbid my doing it and i had money enough but i chose not to spend it on things of that sort  could and didnt i cant believe it and annabel sank into a chair as if the thought was too much for her  i did rather want to at first just for the fun of the thing in fact i went and looked at some amazing gowns but they were very expensive very much trimmed and not my style at all so i gave them up and kept what i valued more than all the gowns worth every made  what in the world was it cried annabel hoping she would say diamonds  uncles good opinion answered rose looking thoughtfully into the depths of a packing case where lay the lovely picture that would always remind her of the little triumph over girlish vanity which not only kept but increased uncles good opinion  oh indeed said annabel blankly and fell to examining aunt plentys lace while rose went on with a happy smile in her eyes as she dived into another trunk  uncle thinks one has no right to waste money on such things but he is very generous and loves to give useful beautiful or curious gifts see all these pretty ornaments are for presents and you shall choose first whatever you like  hes a perfect dear cried annabel reveling in the crystal filigree coral and mosaic trinkets spread before her while rose completed her rapture by adding sundry tasteful trifles fresh from paris  now tell me when do you mean to have your comingout party i ask because ive nothing ready and want plenty of time for i suppose it will be the event of the season asked annabel a few minutes later as she wavered between a pink coral and a blue lava set  i came out when i went to europe but i suppose aunty plen will want to have some sort of merrymaking to celebrate our return i shall begin as i mean to go on and have a simple sociable sort of party and invite everyone whom i like no matter in what set they happen to belong no one shall ever say i am aristocratic and exclusive so prepare yourself to be shocked for old friends and young rich and poor will be asked to all my parties  oh my heart you are going to be odd just as mama predicted sighed annabel clasping her hands in despair and studying the effect of three bracelets on her chubby arm in the midst of her woe  in my own house im going to do as i think best and if people call me odd i cant help it i shall endeavor not to do anything very dreadful but i seem to inherit uncles love for experiments and mean to try some i daresay they will fail and i shall get laughed at i intend to do it nevertheless so you had better drop me now before i begin said rose with an air of resolution that was rather alarming  what shall you wear at this new sort of party of yours asked annabel wisely turning a deaf ear to all delicate or dangerous topics and keeping to matters she understood  that white thing over there it is fresh and pretty and phebe has one like it i never want to dress more than she does and gowns of that sort are always most becoming and appropriate to girls of our age  phebe you dont mean to say you are going to make a lady of her gasped annabel upsetting her treasures as she fell back with a gesture that made the little chair creak again for miss bliss was as plump as a partridge  she is one already and anybody who slights her slights me for she is the best girl i know and the dearest cried rose warmly  yes of course i was only surprised you are quite right for she may turn out to be somebody and then how glad youll feel that you were so good to her said annabel veering around at once seeing which way the wind blew  before rose could speak again a cheery voice called from the hall little mistress where are you  in my room phebe dear and up came the girl rose was going to make a lady of looking so like one that annabel opened her chinablue eyes and smiled involuntarily as phebe dropped a little curtsey in playful imitation of her old manner and said quietly how do you do miss bliss  glad to see you back miss moore answered annabel shaking hands in a way that settled the question of phebes place in her mind forever for the stout damsel had a kind heart in spite of a weak head and was really fond of rose it was evidently love me love my phebe so she made up her mind on the spot that phebe was somebody and that gave an air of romance even to the poorhouse  she could not help staring a little as she watched the two friends work together and listened to their happy talk over each new treasure as it came to light for every look and word plainly showed that years of close companionship had made them very dear to one another it was pretty to see rose try to do the hardest part of any little job herself still prettier to see phebe circumvent her and untie the hard knots fold the stiff papers or lift the heavy trays with her own strong hands and prettiest of all to hear her say in a motherly tone as she put rose into an easy chair now my deary sit and rest for you will have to see company all day and i cant let you get tired out so early  that is no reason why i should let you either call jane to help or ill bob up again directly answered rose with a very bad assumption of authority  jane may take my place downstairs but no one shall wait on you here except me as long as im with you said stately phebe stooping to put a hassock under the feet of her little mistress  it is very nice and pretty to see but i dont know what people will say when she goes into society with the rest of us i do hope rose wont be very odd said annabel to herself as she went away to circulate the depressing news that there was to be no grand ball and saddest disappointment of all that rose had not a single paris costume with which to refresh the eyes and rouse the envy of her amiable friends  now ive seen or heard from all the boys but charlie and i suppose he is too busy i wonder what he is about thought rose turning from the hall door whither she had courteously accompanied her guest  the wish was granted a moment after for going into the parlor to decide where some of her pictures should hang she saw a pair of brown boots at one end of the sofa a tawnybrown head at the other and discovered that charlie was busily occupied in doing nothing  the voice of the bliss was heard in the land so i dodged till she went upstairs and then took a brief siesta while waiting to pay my respects to the distinguished traveler lady hester stanhope he said leaping up to make his best bow  the voice of the sluggard would be a more appropriate quotation i think does annabel still pine for you asked rose recalling certain youthful jokes upon the subject of unrequited affections  not a bit of it fun has cut me out and the fair annabella will be mrs tokio before the winter is over if im not much mistaken  what little fun see how droll it seems to think of him grown up and married to annabel of all people she never said a word about him but this accounts for her admiring my pretty chinese things and being so interested in canton  little fun is a great swell now and much enamored of our fat friend who will take to chopsticks whenever he says the word i neednt ask how you do cousin for you beat that aurora all hollow in the way of color i should have been up before but i thought youd like a good rest after your voyage  i was running a race with jamie before nine oclock what were you doing young man  sleeping i dreamed love dreamed love of thee began charlie but rose cut him short by saying as reproachfully as she could while the culprit stood regarding her with placid satisfaction you ought to have been up and at work like the rest of the boys i felt like a drone in a hive of very busy bees when i saw them all hurrying off to their business  but my dear girl ive got no business im making up my mind you see and do the ornamental while im deciding there always ought to be one gentleman in a family and that seems to be rather my line answered charlie posing for the character with an assumption of languid elegance which would have been very effective if his twinkling eyes had not spoilt it  there are none but gentlemen in our family i hope answered rose with the proud air she always wore when anything was said derogatory to the name of campbell  of course of course i should have said gentleman of leisure you see it is against my principles to slave as archie does whats the use dont need the money got plenty so why not enjoy it and keep jolly as long as possible im sure cheerful people are public benefactors in this world of woe  it was not easy to object to this proposition especially when made by a comely young man who looked the picture of health and happiness as he sat on the arm of the sofa smiling at his cousin in the most engaging manner rose knew very well that the epicurean philosophy was not the true one to begin life upon but it was difficult to reason with charlie because he always dodged sober subjects and was so full of cheery spirits one hated to lessen the sort of sunshine which certainly is a public benefactor  you have such a clever way of putting things that i dont know how to contradict you though i still think im right she said gravely mac likes to idle as well as you but he is not going to do it because he knows its bad for him to fritter away his time he is going to study a profession like a wise boy though he would much prefer to live among his beloved books or ride his hobbies in peace  thats all very well for him because he doesnt care for society and may as well be studying medicine as philandering about the woods with his pockets full of musty philosophers and oldfashioned poets answered charlie with a shrug which plainly expressed his opinion of mac  i wonder if musty philosophers like socrates and aristotle and oldfashioned poets like shakespeare and milton are not safer company for him to keep than some of the more modern friends you have said rose remembering jamies hints about wild oats for she could be a little sharp sometimes and had not lectured the boys for so long it seemed unusually pleasant  but charlie changed the subject skillfully by exclaiming with an anxious expression i do believe you are going to be like aunt jane for thats just the way she comes down on me whenever she gets the chance dont take her for a model i beg she is a good woman but a mighty disagreeable one in my humble opinion  the fear of being disagreeable is a great bugbear to a girl as this artful young man well knew and rose fell into the trap at once for aunt jane was far from being her model though she could not help respecting her worth  have you given up your painting she asked rather abruptly turning to a gilded fra angelico angel which leaned in the sofa corner  sweetest face i ever saw and very like you about the eyes isnt it said charlie who seemed to have a yankee trick of replying to one question with another  i want an answer not a compliment and rose tried to look severe as she put away the picture more quickly than she had taken it up  have i given up painting oh no i daub a little in oils slop a little in watercolors sketch now and then and poke about the studios when the artistic fit comes on  how is the music  more flourishing i dont practice much but sing a good deal in company set up a guitar last summer and went troubadouring round in great style the girls like it and its jolly among the fellows  are you studying anything  well i have some lawbooks on my table good big wiselooking chaps and i take a turn at them semioccasionally when pleasure palls or parents chide but i doubt if i do more than learn what a allybi is this year and a sly laugh in charlies eye suggested that he sometimes availed himself of this bit of legal knowledge  what do you do then  fair catechist i enjoy myself private theatricals have been the rage of late and i have won such laurels that i seriously think of adopting the stage as my profession  really cried rose alarmed  why not if i must go to work isnt that as good as anything  not without more talent than i think you possess with genius one can do anything without it one had better let the stage alone  theres a quencher for the star of the goodlie companie to which i belong mac hasnt a ray of genius for anything yet you admire him for trying to be an md cried charlie rather nettled at her words  it is respectable at all events and id rather be a secondrate doctor than a secondrate actor but i know you dont mean it and only say so to frighten me  exactly i always bring it up when anyone begins to lecture and it works wonders uncle mac turns pale the aunts hold up their hands in holy horror and a general panic ensues then i magnanimously promise not to disgrace the family and in the first burst of gratitude the dear souls agree to everything i ask so peace is restored and i go on my way rejoicing  just the way you used to threaten to run off to sea if your mother objected to any of your whims you are not changed in that respect though you are in others you had great plans and projects once charlie and now you seem to be contented with being a jack of all trades and master of none  boyish nonsense time has brought wisdom and i dont see the sense of tying myself down to one particular thing and grinding away at it year after year people of one idea get so deucedly narrow and tame ive no patience with them culture is the thing and the sort one gets by ranging over a wide field is the easiest to acquire the handiest to have and the most successful in the end at any rate it is the kind i like and the only kind i intend to bother myself about  with this declaration charlie smoothed his brow clasped his hands over his head and leaning back gently warbled the chorus of a college song as if it expressed his views of life better than he could      while our rosy fillets shed     blushes oer each fervid head     with many a cup and many a smile     the festal moments we beguile  some of my saints here were people of one idea and though they were not very successful from a worldly point of view while alive they were loved and canonized when dead said rose who had been turning over a pile of photographs on the table and just then found her favorite st francis among them  this is more to my taste those wornout cadaverous fellows give me the blues but heres a gentlemanly saint who takes things easy and does good as he goes along without howling over his own sins or making other people miserable by telling them of theirs and charlie laid a handsome st martin beside the brownfrocked monk  rose looked at both and understood why her cousin preferred the soldierly figure with the sword to the ascetic with his crucifix one was riding bravely through the world in purple and fine linen with horse and hound and squires at his back and the other was in a lazarhouse praying over the dead and dying the contrast was a strong one and the girls eyes lingered longest on the knight though she said thoughtfully yours is certainly the pleasantest and yet i never heard of any good deed he did except divide his cloak with a beggar while st francis gave himself to charity just when life was most tempting and spent years working for god without reward hes old and poor and in a dreadful place but i wont give him up and you may have your gay st martin if you want him  no thank you saints are not in my line but id like the goldenhaired angel in the blue gown if youll let me have her she shall be my little madonna and ill pray to her like a good catholic answered charlie turning to the delicate deepeyed figure with the lilies in its hand  with all my heart and any others that you like choose some for your mother and give them to her with my love  so charlie sat down beside rose to turn and talk over the pictures for a long and pleasant hour but when they went away to lunch if there had been anyone to observe so small but significant a trifle good st francis lay face downward behind the sofa while gallant st martin stood erect upon the chimneypiece     chapter 3 miss campbell  while the travelers unpack their trunks we will pick up as briefly as possible the dropped stitches in the little romance we are weaving  roses life had been a very busy and quiet one for the four years following the may day when she made her choice study exercise housework and many wholesome pleasures kept her a happy hearty creature yearly growing in womanly graces yet always preserving the innocent freshness girls lose so soon when too early set upon the worlds stage and given a part to play  not a remarkably gifted girl in any way and far from perfect full of all manner of youthful whims and fancies a little spoiled by much love rather apt to think all lives as safe and sweet as her own and when want or pain appealed to her the tender heart overflowed with a remorseful charity which gave of its abundance recklessly yet with all her human imperfections the upright nature of the child kept her desires climbing toward the just and pure and true as flowers struggle to the light and the womans soul was budding beautifully under the green leaves behind the little thorns  at seventeen dr alec pronounced her ready for the voyage around the world which he considered a better finishing off than any school could give her but just then aunt peace began to fail and soon slipped quietly away to rejoin the lover she had waited for so long youth seemed to come back in a mysterious way to touch the dead face with lost loveliness and all the romance of her past to gather around her memory unlike most aged women her friends were among the young and at her funeral the grayheads gave place to the band of loving girls who made the sweet old maiden ready for her rest bore her pall and covered her grave with the white flowers she had never worn  when this was over poor aunt plenty seemed so lost without her lifelong charge that dr alec would not leave her and rose gladly paid the debt she owed by the tender service which comforts without words but aunt plenty having lived for others all her days soon rebelled against this willing sacrifice soon found strength in her own sincere piety solace in cheerful occupation and amusement in nursing aunt myra who was a capital patient as she never died and never got well  so at last the moment came when with free minds the travelers could set out and on roses eighteenth birthday with uncle alec and the faithful phebe she sailed away to see and study the big beautiful world which lies ready for us all if we only know how to use and enjoy it  phebe was set to studying music in the best schools and while she trained her lovely voice with happy industry rose and her uncle roamed about in the most delightful way till two years were gone like a dream and those at home clamored for their return  back they came and now the heiress must make ready to take her place for at twentyone she came into possession of the fortune she had been trying to learn how to use well great plans fermented in her brain for though the heart was as generous as ever time had taught her prudence and observation shown her that the wisest charity is that which helps the poor to help themselves  dr alec found it a little difficult to restrain the ardor of this young philanthropist who wanted to begin at once to endow hospitals build homes adopt children and befriend all mankind  take a little time to look about you and get your bearings child the world you have been living in is a much simpler honester one than that you are now to enter test yourself a bit and see if the old ways seem best after all for you are old enough to decide and wise enough to discover what is for your truest good i hope he said trying to feel ready to let the bird escape from under his wing and make little flights alone  now uncle im very much afraid you are going to be disappointed in me answered rose with unusual hesitation yet a very strong desire visible in her eyes you like to have me quite honest and ive learned to tell you all my foolish thoughts so ill speak out and if you find my wish very wrong and silly please say so for i dont want you to cast me off entirely though i am grown up you say wait a little test myself and try if the old ways are best i should like to do that and can i in a better way than leading the life other girls lead just for a little while she added as her uncles face grew grave  he was disappointed yet acknowledged that the desire was natural and in a moment saw that a trial of this sort might have its advantages nevertheless he dreaded it for he had intended to choose her society carefully and try to keep her unspoiled by the world as long as possible like many another fond parent and guardian but the spirit of eve is strong in all her daughters forbidden fruit will look rosier to them than any in their own orchards and the temptation to take just one little bite proves irresistible to the wisest so rose looking out from the safe seclusion of her girlhood into the womans kingdom which she was about to take possession of felt a sudden wish to try its pleasures before assuming its responsibilities and was too sincere to hide the longing  very well my dear try it if you like only take care of your health be temperate in your gaiety and dont lose more than you gain if that is possible he added under his breath endeavoring to speak cheerfully and not look anxious  i know it is foolish but i do want to be a regular butterfly for a little while and see what it is like you know i couldnt help seeing a good deal of fashionable life abroad though we were not in it and here at home the girls tell me about all sorts of pleasant things that are to happen this winter so if you wont despise me very much i should like to try it  for how long  would three months be too long new year is a good time to take a fresh start everyone is going to welcome me so i must be gay in spite of myself unless im willing to seem very ungrateful and morose said rose glad to have so good a reason to offer for her new experiment  you may like it so well that the three months may become years pleasure is very sweet when we are young  do you think it will intoxicate me  we shall see my dear  we shall and rose marched away looking as if she had taken a pledge of some sort and meant to keep it  it was a great relief to the public mind when it became known that miss campbell was really coming out at last and invitations to aunt plentys party were promptly accepted aunt clara was much disappointed about the grand ball she had planned but rose stood firm and the dear old lady had her way about everything  the consequence was a delightfully informal gathering of friends to welcome the travelers home just a good oldfashioned hospitable housewarming so simple cordial and genuine that those who came to criticize remained to enjoy and many owned the charm they could neither describe nor imitate  much curiosity was felt about phebe and much gossip went on behind fans that evening for those who had known her years ago found it hard to recognize the little housemaid in the handsome young woman who bore herself with such quiet dignity and charmed them all with her fine voice cinderella has turned out a princess was the general verdict and rose enjoyed the little sensation immensely for she had had many battles to fight for her phebe since she came among them and now her faith was vindicated  miss campbell herself was in great demand and did the honors so prettily that even miss bliss forgave her for her sad neglect of worth though she shook her head over the white gowns just alike except that phebe wore crimson and rose blue trimmings  the girls swarmed eagerly around their recovered friend for rose had been a favorite before she went away and found her throne waiting for her now the young men privately pronounced phebe the handsomest but then you know theres neither family nor money so its no use phebe therefore was admired as one of the ornamental properties belonging to the house and left respectfully alone  but bonny rose was all right as these amiable youths expressed it and many a wistful eye followed the bright head as it flitted about the rooms as if it were a second golden fleece to be won with difficulty for stalwart kinsmen hedged it round and watchful aunts kept guard  little wonder that the girl found her new world an enchanting one and that her first sip of pleasure rather went to her head for everybody welcomed and smiled on her flattered and praised whispered agreeable prophecies in her ear and looked the compliments and congratulations they dared not utter till she felt as if she must have left her old self somewhere abroad and suddenly become a new and wonderfully gifted being  it is very nice uncle and im not sure i maynt want another three months of it when the first are gone she whispered to dr alec as he stood watching the dance she was leading with charlie in the long hall after supper  steady my lass steady and remember that you are not really a butterfly but a mortal girl with a head that will ache tomorrow he answered watching the flushed and smiling face before him i almost wish there wasnt any tomorrow but that tonight would last forever it is so pleasant and everyone so kind she said with a little sigh of happiness as she gathered up her fleecy skirts like a white bird pluming itself for flight  ill ask your opinion about that at two am began her uncle with a warning nod  ill give it honestly was all rose had time to say before charlie swept her away into the particolored cloud before them  its no use alec train a girl as wisely as you choose she will break loose when the time comes and go in for pleasure as eagerly as the most frivolous for tis their nature to said uncle mac keeping time to the music as if he would not mind going in for a bit of pleasure himself  my girl shall taste and try but unless im much mistaken a little bit of it will satisfy her i want to see if she will stand the test because if not all my work is a failure and id like to know it answered the doctor with a hopeful smile on his lips but an anxious look in his eyes  she will come out all right bless her heart so let her sow her innocent wild oats and enjoy herself till she is ready to settle down i wish all our young folks were likely to have as small a crop and get through as safely as she will added uncle mac with a shake of the head as he glanced at some of the young men revolving before him  nothing amiss with your lads i hope  no thank heaven so far ive had little trouble with either though mac is an odd stick and steve a puppy i dont complain for both will outgrow that sort of thing and are good fellows at heart thanks to their mother but claras boy is in a bad way and she will spoil him as a man as she has as a boy if his father doesnt interfere  i told brother stephen all about him when i was in calcutta last year and he wrote to the boy but clara has got no end of plans in her head and so she insisted on keeping charlie a year longer when his father ordered him off to india replied the doctor as they walked away  it is too late to order charlie is a man now and stephen will find he has been too easy with him all these years poor fellow it has been hard lines for him and is likely to be harder i fancy unless he comes home and straightens things out  he wont do that if he can help it he has lost all his energy living in that climate and hates worry more than ever so you can imagine what an effort it would be to manage a foolish woman and a headstrong boy we must lend a hand mac and do our best for poor old steve  the best we can do for the lad is to marry and settle him as soon as possible  my dear fellow he is only three and twenty began the doctor as if the idea was preposterous then a sudden change came over him as he added with a melancholy smile i forget how much one can hope and suffer even at twentythree  and be all the better for if bravely outlived said uncle mac with his hand on his brothers shoulder and the sincerest approval in his voice then kindly returning to the younger people he went on inquiringly you dont incline to claras view of a certain matter i fancy  decidedly not my girl must have the best and claras training would spoil an angel answered dr alec quickly  but we shall find it hard to let our little rose go out of the family how would archie do he has been well brought up and is a thoroughly excellent lad  the brothers had retired to the study by this time and were alone yet dr alec lowered his voice as he said with a tender sort of anxiety pleasant to see you know i do not approve of cousins marrying so im in a quandary mac for i love the child as if she were my own and feel as if i could not give her up to any man whom i did not know and trust entirely it is of no use for us to plan for she must choose for herself yet i do wish we could keep her among us and give one of our boys a wife worth having  we must so never mind your theories but devote yourself to testing our elder lads and making one of them a happy fellow all are heartwhole i believe and though young still for this sort of thing we can be gently shaping matters for them since no one knows how soon the moment may come my faith it is like living in a powder mill to be among a lot of young folks nowadays all looks as calm as possible till a sudden spark produces an explosion and heaven only knows where we find ourselves after it is over  and uncle mac sat himself comfortably down to settle roses fate while the doctor paced the room plucking at his beard and knitting his brows as if he found it hard to see his way  yes archie is a good fellow he said answering the question he had ignored before an upright steady intelligent lad who will make an excellent husband if he ever finds out that he has a heart i suppose im an old fool but i do like a little more romance in a young man than he seems to have more warmth and enthusiasm you know bless the boy he might be forty instead of three or four and twenty hes so sober calm and cool im younger than he is and could go awooing like a romeo if i had any heart to offer a woman  the doctor looked rather shamefaced as he spoke and his brother burst out laughing see here alec its a pity so much romance and excellence as yours should be lost so why dont you set these young fellows an example and go awooing yourself jessie has been wondering how you have managed to keep from falling in love with phebe all this time and clara is quite sure that you waited only till she was safe under aunt plentys wing to offer yourself in the good oldfashioned style  i and the doctor stood aghast at the mere idea then he gave a resigned sort of sigh and added like a martyr if those dear women would let me alone id thank them forever put the idea out of their minds for heavens sake mac or i shall be having that poor girl flung at my head and her comfort destroyed she is a fine creature and im proud of her but she deserves a better lot than to be tied to an old fellow like me whose only merit is his fidelity  as you please i was only joking and uncle mac dropped the subject with secret relief the excellent man thought a good deal of family and had been rather worried at the hints of the ladies after a moments silence he returned to a former topic which was rather a pet plan of his i dont think you do archie justice alec you dont know him as well as i do but youll find that he has heart enough under his cool quiet manner ive grown very fond of him think highly of him and dont see how you could do better for rose than to give her to him  if she will go said the doctor smiling at his brothers businesslike way of disposing of the young people  shell do anything to please you began uncle mac in perfect good faith for twentyfive years in the society of a very prosaic wife had taken nearly all the romance out of him  it is of no use for us to plan and i shall never interfere except to advise and if i were to choose one of the boys i should incline to my godson answered the doctor gravely  what my ugly duckling exclaimed uncle mac in great surprise  the ugly duckling turned out a swan you remember ive always been fond of the boy because hes so genuine and original crude as a green apple now but sound at the core and only needs time to ripen im sure hell turn out a capital specimen of the campbell variety  much obliged alec but it will never do at all hes a good fellow and may do something to be proud of by and by but hes not the mate for our rose she needs someone who can manage her property when we are gone and archie is the man for that depend upon it  confound the property cried dr alec impetuously i want her to be happy and i dont care how soon she gets rid of her money if it is going to be a millstone round her neck i declare to you i dreaded the thought of this time so much that ive kept her away as long as i could and trembled whenever a young fellow joined us while we were abroad had one or two narrow escapes and now im in for it as you can see by tonights success as clara calls it thank heaven i havent many daughters to look after  come come dont be anxious take archie and settle it right up safely and happily thats my advice and youll find it sound replied the elder conspirator like one having experience  ill think of it but mind you mac not a word of this to the sisters we are a couple of old fools to be matchmaking so soon but i see what is before me and its a comfort to free my mind to someone  so it is depend on me not a breath even to jane answered uncle mac with a hearty shake and a sympathetic slap on the shoulder  why what dark and awful secrets are going on here is it a freemasons lodge and those the mystic signs asked a gay voice at the door and there stood rose full of smiling wonder at the sight of her two uncles hand in hand whispering and nodding to one another mysteriously  they stared like schoolboys caught plotting mischief and looked so guilty that she took pity on them innocently imagining the brothers were indulging in a little sentiment on this joyful occasion so she added quickly as she beckoned without crossing the threshold women not allowed of course but both of you dear odd fellows are wanted for aunt plenty begs we will have an oldfashioned contra dance and im to lead off with uncle mac i chose you sir because you do it in style pigeon wings and all so please come and phebe is waiting for you uncle alec she is rather shy you know but will enjoy it with you to take care of her  thank you thank you cried both gentlemen following with great alacrity  unconscious rose enjoyed that virginia reel immensely for the pigeon wings were superb and her partner conducted her through the convolutions of the dance without a fault going down the middle in his most gallant style landing safely at the bottom she stood aside to let him get his breath for stout uncle mac was bound to do or die on that occasion and would have danced his pumps through without a murmur if she had desired it  leaning against the wall with his hair in his eyes and a decidedly bored expression of countenance was mac jr who had been surveying the gymnastics of his parent with respectful astonishment  come and take a turn my lad rose is fresh as a daisy but we old fellows soon get enough of it so you shall have my place said his father wiping his face which glowed like a cheerful peony  no thank you sir i cant stand that sort of thing ill race you round the piazza with pleasure cousin but his oven is too much for me was macs uncivil reply as he backed toward the open window as if glad of an excuse to escape  fragile creature dont stay on my account i beg i cant leave my guests for a moonlight run even if i dared to take it on a frosty night in a thin dress said rose fanning herself and not a bit ruffled by macs refusal for she knew his ways and they amused her  not half so bad as all this dust gas heat and noise what do you suppose lungs are made of demanded mac ready for a discussion then and there  i used to know but ive forgotten now been so busy with other things that ive neglected the hobbies i used to ride five or six years ago she said laughing  ah those were times worth having are you going in for much of this sort of thing rose he asked with a disapproving glance at the dancers  about three months of it i think  then goodbye till new year and mac vanished behind the curtains  rose my dear you really must take that fellow in hand before he gets to be quite a bear since you have been gone he has lived in his books and got on so finely that we have let him alone though his mother groans over his manners polish him up a bit i beg of you for it is high time he mended his odd ways and did justice to the fine gifts he hides behind them said uncle mac scandalized at the bluntness of his son  i know my chestnut burr too well to mind his prickles but others do not so i will take him in hand and make him a credit to his family answered rose readily  take archie for your model hes one of a thousand and the girl who gets him gets a prize i do assure you added uncle mac who found matchmaking to his taste and thought that closing remark a deep one  oh me how tired i am cried rose dropping into a chair as the last carriage rolled away somewhere between one and two  what is your opinion now miss campbell asked the doctor addressing her for the first time by the name which had been uttered so often that night  my opinion is that miss campbell is likely to have a gay life if she goes on as she has begun and that she finds it very delightful so far answered the girl with lips still smiling from their first taste of what the world calls pleasure     chapter 4 thorns among the roses  for a time everything went smoothly and rose was a happy girl the world seemed a beautiful and friendly place and fulfillment of her brightest dreams appeared to be a possibility of course this could not last and disappointment was inevitable because young eyes look for a paradise and weep when they find a workaday world which seems full of care and trouble till one learns to gladden and glorify it with high thoughts and holy living  those who loved her waited anxiously for the disillusion which must come in spite of all their cherishing for till now rose had been so busy with her studies travels and home duties that she knew very little of the triumphs trials and temptations of fashionable life birth and fortune placed her where she could not well escape some of them and dr alec knowing that experience is the best teacher wisely left her to learn this lesson as she must many another devoutly hoping that it would not be a hard one  october and november passed rapidly and christmas was at hand with all its merry mysteries home gatherings and good wishes  rose sat in her own little sanctum opening from the parlor busily preparing gifts for the dear five hundred friends who seemed to grow fonder and fonder as the holidays drew near the drawers of her commode stood open giving glimpses of dainty trifles which she was tying up with bright ribbons  a young girls face at such moments is apt to be a happy one but roses was very grave as she worked and now and then she threw a parcel into the drawer with a careless toss as if no love made the gift precious so unusual was this expression that it struck dr alec as he came in and brought an anxious look to his eyes for any cloud on that other countenance dropped its shadow over his  can you spare a minute from your pretty work to take a stitch in my old glove he asked coming up to the table strewn with ribbon lace and colored papers  yes uncle as many as you please  the face brightened with sudden sunshine both hands were put out to receive the shabby driving glove and the voice was full of that affectionate alacrity which makes the smallest service sweet  my lady bountiful is hard at work i see can i help in any way he asked glancing at the display before him  no thank you unless you can make me as full of interest and pleasure in these things as i used to be dont you think preparing presents a great bore except for those you love and who love you she added in a tone which had a slight tremor in it as she uttered the last words  i dont give to people whom i care nothing for cant do it especially at christmas when goodwill should go into everything one does if all these pretties are for dear friends you must have a great many  i thought they were friends but i find many of them are not and thats the trouble sir  tell me all about it dear and let the old glove go he said sitting down beside her with his most sympathetic air  but she held the glove fast saying eagerly no no i love to do this i dont feel as if i could look at you while i tell what a bad suspicious girl i am she added keeping her eyes on her work  very well im ready for confessions of any iniquity and glad to get them for sometimes lately ive seen a cloud in my girls eyes and caught a worried tone in her voice is there a bitter drop in the cup that promised to be so sweet rose  yes uncle ive tried to think there was not but it is there and i dont like it im ashamed to tell and yet i want to because you will show me how to make it sweet or assure me that i shall be the better for it as you used to do when i took medicine  she paused a minute sewing swiftly then out came the trouble all in one burst of girlish grief and chagrin  uncle half the people who are so kind to me dont care a bit for me but for what i can give them and that makes me unhappy because i was so glad and proud to be liked i do wish i hadnt a penny in the world then i should know who my true friends were  poor little lass she has found out that all that glitters is not gold and the disillusion has begun said the doctor to himself adding aloud smiling yet pitiful and so all the pleasure is gone out of the pretty gifts and christmas is a failure  oh no not for those whom nothing can make me doubt it is sweeter than ever to make these things because my heart is in every stitch and i know that poor as they are they will be dear to you aunty plen aunt jessie phebe and the boys  she opened a drawer where lay a pile of pretty gifts wrought with loving care by her own hands touching them tenderly as she spoke and patting the sailors knot of blue ribbon on one fat parcel with a smile that told how unshakable her faith in someone was but these she said pulling open another drawer and tossing over its gay contents with an air half sad half scornful these i bought and give because they are expected these people care only for a rich gift not one bit for the giver whom they will secretly abuse if she is not as generous as they expect how can i enjoy that sort of thing uncle  you cannot but perhaps you do some of them injustice my dear dont let the envy or selfishness of a few poison your faith in all are you sure that none of these girls care for you he asked reading a name here and there on the parcels scattered about  im afraid i am you see i heard several talking together the other evening at annabels only a few words but it hurt me very much for nearly everyone was speculating on what i would give them and hoping it would be something fine shes so rich she ought to be generous said one ive been perfectly devoted to her for weeks and hope she wont forget it said another if she doesnt give me some of her gloves i shall think shes very mean for she has heaps and i tried on a pair in fun so she could see they fitted and take a hint added a third i did take the hint you see and rose opened a handsome box in which lay several pairs of her best gloves with buttons enough to satisfy the heart of the most covetous  plenty of silver paper and perfume but not much love went into that bundle i fancy and dr alec could not help smiling at the disdainful little gesture with which rose pushed away the box  not a particle nor in most of these i have given them what they wanted and taken back the confidence and respect they didnt care for it is wrong i know but i cant bear to think all the seeming goodwill and friendliness ive been enjoying was insincere and for a purpose thats not the way i treat people  i am sure of it take things for what they are worth dear and try to find the wheat among the tares for there is plenty if one knows how to look is that all the trouble  no sir that is the lightest part of it i shall soon get over my disappointment in those girls and take them for what they are worth as you advise but being deceived in them makes me suspicious of others and that is hateful if i cannot trust people id rather keep by myself and be happy i do detest maneuvering and underhanded plots and plans  rose spoke petulantly and twitched her silk till it broke while regret seemed to give place to anger as she spoke  there is evidently another thorn pricking let us have it out and then ill kiss the place to make it well as i used to do when i took the splinters from the fingers you are pricking so unmercifully said the doctor anxious to relieve his pet patient as soon as possible  rose laughed but the color deepened in her cheeks as she answered with a pretty mixture of maidenly shyness and natural candor  aunt clara worries me by warning me against half the young men i meet and insisting that they want only my money now that is dreadful and i wont listen but i cant help thinking of it sometimes for they are very kind to me and im not vain enough to think it is my beauty i suppose i am foolish but i do like to feel that i am something besides an heiress  the little quiver was in roses voice again as she ended and dr alec gave a quick sigh as he looked at the downcast face so full of the perplexity ingenuous spirits feel when doubt first mars their faith and dims the innocent beliefs still left from childhood he had been expecting this and knew that what the girl just began to perceive and try modestly to tell had long ago been plain to worldlier eyes the heiress was the attraction to most of the young men whom she met good fellows enough but educated as nearly all are nowadays to believe that girls with beauty or money are brought to market to sell or buy as the case may be  rose could purchase anything she liked as she combined both advantages and was soon surrounded by many admirers each striving to secure the prize not being trained to believe that the only end and aim of a womans life was a good match she was a little disturbed when the first pleasing excitement was over to discover that her fortune was her chief attraction  it was impossible for her to help seeing hearing guessing this from a significant glance a stray word a slight hint here and there and the quick instinct of a woman felt even before it understood the selfinterest which chilled for her so many opening friendships in her eyes love was a very sacred thing hardly to be thought of till it came reverently received and cherished faithfully to the end therefore it is not strange that she shrank from hearing it flippantly discussed and marriage treated as a bargain to be haggled over with little thought of its high duties great responsibilities and tender joys many things perplexed her and sometimes a doubt of all that till now she had believed and trusted made her feel as if at sea without a compass for the new world was so unlike the one she had been living in that it bewildered while it charmed the novice  dr alec understood the mood in which he found her and did his best to warn without saddening by too much worldly wisdom  you are something besides an heiress to those who know and love you so take heart my girl and hold fast to the faith that is in you there is a touchstone for all these things and whatever does not ring true doubt and avoid test and try men and women as they come along and i am sure conscience instinct and experience will keep you from any dire mistake he said with a protecting arm about her and a trustful look that was very comforting  after a moments pause she answered while a sudden smile dimpled around her mouth and the big glove went up to hide her telltale cheeks uncle if i must have lovers i do wish theyd be more interesting how can i like or respect men who go on as some of them do and then imagine women can feel honored by the offer of their hands hearts are out of fashion so they dont say much about them  ah ha that is the trouble is it and we begin to have delicate distresses do we said dr alec glad to see her brightening and full of interest in the new topic for he was a romantic old fellow as he had confessed to his brother  rose put down the glove and looked up with a droll mixture of amusement and disgust in her face uncle it is perfectly disgraceful ive wanted to tell you but i was ashamed because i never could boast of such things as some girls do and they were so absurd i couldnt feel as if they were worth repeating even to you perhaps i ought though for you may think it proper to command me to make a good match and of course i should have to obey she added trying to look meek  tell by all means dont i always keep your secrets and give you the best advice like a model guardian you must have a confidant and where find a better one than here he asked tapping his waistcoat with an inviting gesture  nowhere so ill tell all but the names id best be prudent for im afraid you may get a little fierce you do sometimes when people vex me began rose rather liking the prospect of a confidential chat with uncle for he had kept himself a good deal in the background lately  you know our ideas are oldfashioned so i was not prepared to have men propose at all times and places with no warning but a few smiles and soft speeches i expected things of that sort would be very interesting and proper not to say thrilling on my part but they are not and i find myself laughing instead of crying feeling angry instead of glad and forgetting all about it very soon why uncle one absurd boy proposed when wed met only half a dozen times but he was dreadfully in debt so that accounted for it perhaps and rose dusted her fingers as if she had soiled them  i know him and i thought hed do it observed the doctor with a shrug  you see and know everything so theres no need of going on is there  do do who else i wont even guess  well another went down upon his knees in mrs vans greenhouse and poured forth his passion manfully with a great cactus pricking his poor legs all the while kitty found him there and it was impossible to keep sober so he has hated me ever since  the doctors ha ha was good to hear and rose joined him for it was impossible to regard these episodes seriously since no true sentiment redeemed them from absurdity  another sent me reams of poetry and went on so byronically that i began to wish i had red hair and my name was betsy ann i burnt all the verses so dont expect to see them and he poor fellow is consoling himself with emma but the worst of all was the one who would make love in public and insisted on proposing in the middle of a dance i seldom dance round dances except with our boys but that night i did because the girls laughed at me for being so prudish as they called it i dont mind them now for i found i was right and felt that i deserved my fate  is that all asked her uncle looking fierce as she predicted at the idea of his beloved girl obliged to listen to a declaration twirling on the arm of a lover  one more but him i shall not tell about for i know he was in earnest and really suffered though i was as kind as i knew how to be im young in these things yet so i grieved for him and treat his love with the tenderest respect  roses voice sank almost to a whisper as she ended and dr alec bent his head as if involuntarily saluting a comrade in misfortune then he got up saying with a keen look into the face he lifted by a finger under the chin do you want another three months of this  ill tell you on new years day uncle  very well try to keep a straight course my little captain and if you see dirty weather ahead call on your first mate  aye aye sir ill remember     chapter 5 prince charming  the old glove lay upon the floor forgotten while rose sat musing till a quick step sounded in the hall and a voice drew near tunefully humming      as he was walkin doun the street     the city for to view     oh there he spied a bonny lass     the window lookin through      sae licht he jumpèd up the stair     and tirled at the pin     oh wha sae ready as hersel     to let the laddie in  sang rose as the voice paused and a tap came at the door  good morning rosamunda here are your letters and your most devoted ready to execute any commissions you may have for him was charlies greeting as he came in looking comely gay and debonair as usual  thanks ive no errands unless you mail my replies if these need answering so by your leave prince and rose began to open the handful of notes he threw into her lap  ha what sight is this to blast mine eyes ejaculated charlie as he pointed to the glove with a melodramatic start for like most accomplished amateur actors he was fond of introducing private theatricals into his daily talk and conversation  uncle left it  tis well methought perchance a rival had been here and picking it up charlie amused himself with putting it on the head of a little psyche which ornamented the mantelpiece softly singing as he did so another verse of the old song      he set his jenny on his knee     all in his highland dress     for brawly well he kenned the way     to please a bonny lass  rose went on reading her letters but all the while was thinking of her conversation with her uncle as well as something else suggested by the newcomer and his ditty  during the three months since her return she had seen more of this cousin than any of the others for he seemed to be the only one who had leisure to play with rose as they used to say years ago the other boys were all at work even little jamie many of whose play hours were devoted to manful struggles with latin grammar the evil genius of his boyish life dr alec had many affairs to arrange after his long absence phebe was busy with her music and aunt plenty still actively superintended her housekeeping thus it fell out quite naturally that charlie should form the habit of lounging in at all hours with letters messages bits of news and agreeable plans for rose he helped her with her sketching rode with her sang with her and took her to parties as a matter of course for aunt clara being the gaiest of the sisters played chaperon on all occasions  for a time it was very pleasant but by and by rose began to wish charlie would find something to do like the rest and not make dawdling after her the business of his life the family was used to his selfindulgent ways and there was an amiable delusion in the minds of the boys that he had a right to the best of everything for to them he was still the prince the flower of the flock and in time to be an honor to the name no one exactly knew how for though full of talent he seemed to have no especial gift or bias and the elders began to shake their heads because in spite of many grand promises and projects the moment for decisive action never came  rose saw all this and longed to inspire her brilliant cousin with some manful purpose which should win for him respect as well as admiration but she found it very hard for though he listened with imperturbable good humor and owned his shortcomings with delightful frankness he always had some argument reason or excuse to offer and outtalked her in five minutes leaving her silenced but unconvinced  of late she had observed that he seemed to feel as if her time and thoughts belonged exclusively to him and rather resented the approach of any other claimant this annoyed her and suggested the idea that her affectionate interest and efforts were misunderstood by him misrepresented and taken advantage of by aunt clara who had been most urgent that she should use her influence with the dear boy though the fond mother resented all other interference this troubled rose and made her feel as if caught in a snare for while she owned to herself that charlie was the most attractive of her cousins she was not ready to be taken possession of in this masterful way especially since other and sometimes better men sought her favor more humbly  these thoughts were floating vaguely in her mind as she read her letters and unconsciously influenced her in the chat that followed  only invitations and i cant stop to answer them now or i shall never get through this job she said returning to her work  let me help you do up and ill direct have a secretary do now and see what a comfort it will be proposed charlie who could turn his hand to anything and had made himself quite at home in the sanctum  id rather finish this myself but you may answer the notes if you will just regrets to all but two or three read the names as you go along and ill tell you which  to hear is to obey who says im a frivolous idler now and charlie sat down at the writing table with alacrity for these hours in the little room were his best and happiest  order is heavens first law and the view a lovely one but i dont see any notepaper he added opening the desk and surveying its contents with interest  righthand drawer violet monogram for the notes plain paper for the business letter ill see to that though answered rose trying to decide whether annabel or emma should have the laced handkerchief  confiding creature suppose i open the wrong drawer and come upon the tender secrets of your soul continued the new secretary rummaging out the delicate notepaper with masculine disregard of order  i havent got any answered rose demurely  what not one despairing scrawl one cherished miniature one faded floweret etc etc i cant believe it cousin and he shook his head incredulously  if i had i certainly should not show them to you impertinent person there are a few little souvenirs in that desk but nothing very sentimental or interesting  how id like to see em but i should never dare to ask observed charlie peering over the top of the halfopen lid with a most persuasive pair of eyes  you may if you want to but youll be disappointed paul pry lower lefthand drawer with the key in it  angel of goodness how shall i requite thee interesting moment with what palpitating emotions art thou fraught and quoting from the mysteries of udolpho he unlocked and opened the drawer with a tragic gesture  seven locks of hair in a box all light for heres your straw color your orange tawny your french crown color and your perfect yellow shakespeare they look very familiar and i fancy i know the heads they thatched  yes you all gave me one when i went away you know and i carried them round the world with me in that very box  i wish the heads had gone too heres a jolly little amber god with a gold ring in his back and a most balmy breath continued charlie taking a long sniff at the scent bottle  uncle brought me that long ago and im very fond of it  this now looks suspicious mans ring with a lotus cut on the stone and a note attached i tremble as i ask who when and where  a gentleman on my birthday in calcutta  i breathe again it was my sire  dont be absurd of course it was and he did everything to make my visit pleasant i wish youd go and see him like a dutiful son instead of idling here  thats what uncle mac is eternally telling me but i dont intend to be lectured into the treadmill till ive had my fling first muttered charlie rebelliously  if you fling yourself in the wrong direction you may find it hard to get back again began rose gravely  no fear if you look after me as you seem to have promised to do judging by the thanks you get in this note poor old governor i should like to see him for its almost four years since he came home last and he must be getting on  charlie was the only one of the boys who ever called his father governor perhaps because the others knew and loved their fathers while he had seen so little of his that the less respectful name came more readily to his lips since the elder man in truth seemed a governor issuing requests or commands which the younger too often neglected or resented  long ago rose had discovered that uncle stephen found home made so distasteful by his wifes devotion to society that he preferred to exile himself taking business as an excuse for his protracted absences  the girl was thinking of this as she watched her cousin turn the ring about with a sudden sobriety which became him well and believing that the moment was propitious she said earnestly he is getting on dear charlie do think of duty more than pleasure in this case and im sure you never will regret it  do you want me to go he asked quickly  i think you ought  and i think youd be much more charming if you wouldnt always be worrying about right and wrong uncle alec taught you that along with the rest of his queer notions  im glad he did cried rose warmly then checked herself and said with a patient sort of sigh you know women always want the men they care for to be good and cant help trying to make them so  so they do and we ought to be a set of angels but ive a strong conviction that if we were the dear souls wouldnt like us half as well would they now asked charlie with an insinuating smile  perhaps not but that is dodging the point will you go persisted rose unwisely  no i will not  that was sufficiently decided and an uncomfortable pause followed during which rose tied a knot unnecessarily tight and charlie went on exploring the drawer with more energy than interest  why heres an old thing i gave you ages ago he suddenly exclaimed in a pleased tone holding up a little agate heart on a faded blue ribbon will you let me take away the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh he asked half in earnest half in jest touched by the little trinket and the recollections it awakened  no i will not answered rose bluntly much displeased by the irreverent and audacious question  charlie looked rather abashed for a moment but his natural lightheartedness made it easy for him to get the better of his own brief fits of waywardness and put others in good humor with him and themselves  now we are even lets drop the subject and start afresh he said with irresistible affability as he coolly put the little heart in his pocket and prepared to shut the drawer but something caught his eye and exclaiming whats this whats this he snatched up a photograph which lay half under a pile of letters with foreign postmarks  oh i forgot that was there said rose hastily  who is the man demanded charlie eyeing the goodlooking countenance before him with a frown  that is the honorable gilbert murray who went up the nile with us and shot crocodiles and other small game being a mighty hunter as i told you in my letters answered rose gaily though ill pleased at the little discovery just then for this had been one of the narrow escapes her uncle spoke of  and they havent eaten him yet i infer from the pile of letters said charlie jealously  i hope not his sister did not mention it when she wrote last  ah then she is your correspondent sisters are dangerous things sometimes and charlie eyed the packet suspiciously  in this case a very convenient thing for she tells me all about her brothers wedding as no one else would take the trouble to do  oh well if hes married i dont care a straw about him i fancied id found out why you are such a hardhearted charmer but if there is no secret idol im all at sea again and charlie tossed the photograph into the drawer as if it no longer interested him  im hardhearted because im particular and as yet do not find anyone at all to my taste  no one with a tender glance  no one with a rebellious blush and the truthful addition i see much to admire and like in many persons but none quite strong and good enough to suit me my heroes are oldfashioned you know  prigs like guy carleton count altenberg and john halifax i know the pattern you goody girls like sneered charlie who preferred the guy livingston beauclerc and rochester style  then im not a goody girl for i dont like prigs i want a gentleman in the best sense of the word and i can wait for ive seen one and know there are more in the world  the deuce you have do i know him asked charlie much alarmed  you think you do answered rose with a mischievous sparkle in her eye  if it isnt pem i give it up hes the bestbred fellow i know  oh dear no far superior to mr pemberton and many years older said rose with so much respect that charlie looked perplexed as well as anxious  some apostolic minister i fancy you pious creatures always like to adore a parson but all we know are married  he isnt  give a name for pitys sake im suffering tortures of suspense begged charlie  alexander campbell  uncle well upon my word thats a relief but mighty absurd all the same so when you find a young saint of that sort you intend to marry him do you demanded charlie much amused and rather disappointed  when i find any man half as honest good and noble as uncle i shall be proud to marry him if he asks me answered rose decidedly  what odd tastes women have and charlie leaned his chin on his hand to muse pensively for a moment over the blindness of one woman who could admire an excellent old uncle more than a dashing young cousin  rose meanwhile tied up her parcels industriously hoping she had not been too severe for it was very hard to lecture charlie though he seemed to like it sometimes and came to confession voluntarily knowing that women love to forgive when the sinners are of his sort  it will be mail time before you are done she said presently for silence was less pleasant than his rattle  charlie took the hint and dashed off several notes in his best manner coming to the business letter he glanced at it and asked with a puzzled expression what is all this cost of repairs etc from a man named buffum  never mind that ill see to it by and by  but i do mind for im interested in all your affairs and though you think ive no head for business youll find i have if youll try me  this is only about my two old houses in the city which are being repaired and altered so that the rooms can be let singly  going to make tenement houses of them well thats not a bad idea such places pay well ive heard  that is just what im not going to do i wouldnt have a tenement house on my conscience for a million dollars not as they are now said rose decidedly  why what do you know about it except that people live in them and the owners turn a pretty penny on the rents  i know a good deal about them for ive seen many such both here and abroad it was not all pleasure with us i assure you uncle was interested in hospitals and prisons and i sometimes went with him but they made me sad so he suggested other charities that i could be of help about when we came home i visited infant schools working womens homes orphan asylums and places of that sort you dont know how much good it did me and how glad i am that i have the means of lightening a little some of the misery in the world  but my dear girl you neednt make ducks and drakes of your fortune trying to feed and cure and clothe all the poor wretches you see give of course everyone should do something in that line and no one likes it better than i but dont for mercys sake go at it as some women do and get so desperately earnest practical and charitymad that there is no living in peace with you protested charlie looking alarmed at the prospect  you can do as you please i intend to do all the good i can by asking the advice and following the example of the most earnest practical and charitable people i know so if you dont approve you can drop my acquaintance answered rose emphasizing the obnoxious words and assuming the resolute air she always wore when defending her hobbies  youll be laughed at  im used to that  and criticized and shunned  not by people whose opinion i value  women shouldnt go poking into such places  ive been taught that they should  well youll get some dreadful disease and lose your beauty and then where are you added charlie thinking that might daunt the young philanthropist  but it did not for rose answered with a sudden kindling of the eyes as she remembered her talk with uncle alec i shouldnt like it but there would be one satisfaction in it for when id lost my beauty and given away my money i should know who really cared for me  charlie nibbled his pen in silence for a moment then asked meekly could i respectfully inquire what great reform is to be carried on in the old houses which their amiable owner is repairing  i am merely going to make them comfortable homes for poor but respectable women to live in there is a class who cannot afford to pay much yet suffer a great deal from being obliged to stay in noisy dirty crowded places like tenement houses and cheap lodgings i can help a few of them and im going to try  may i humbly ask if these decayed gentlewomen are to inhabit their palatial retreat rentfree  that was my first plan but uncle showed me that it was wiser not make genteel paupers of them but let them pay a small rent and feel independent i dont want the money of course and shall use it in keeping the houses tidy or helping other women in like case said rose entirely ignoring her cousins covert ridicule  dont expect any gratitude for you wont get it nor much comfort with a lot of forlornities on your hands and be sure that when it is too late you will tire of it all and wish you had done as other people do  thanks for your cheerful prophecies but i think ill venture  she looked so undaunted that charlie was a little nettled and fired his last shot rather recklessly well one thing i do know youll never get a husband if you go on in this absurd way and by jove you need one to take care of you and keep the property together  rose had a temper but seldom let it get the better of her now however it flashed up for a moment those last words were peculiarly unfortunate because aunt clara had used them more than once when warning her against impecunious suitors and generous projects she was disappointed in her cousin annoyed at having her little plans laughed at and indignant with him for his final suggestion  ill never have one if i must give up the liberty of doing what i know is right and id rather go into the poorhouse tomorrow than keep the property together in the selfish way you mean  that was all but charlie saw that he had gone too far and hastened to make his peace with the skill of a lover for turning to the little cabinet piano behind him he sang in his best style the sweet old song      oh were thou in the cauld blast  dwelling with great effect not only upon the tender assurance that my plaid should shelter thee  but also that even if a king      the brightest jewel in my crown     wad be my queen wad be my queen  it was very evident that prince charming had not gone troubadouring in vain for orpheus himself could not have restored harmony more successfully the tuneful apology was accepted with a forgiving smile and a frank im sorry i was cross but you havent forgotten how to tease and im rather out of sorts today late hours dont agree with me  then you wont feel like going to mrs hopes tomorrow im afraid and charlie took up the last note with an expression of regret which was very flattering  i must go because it is made for me but i can come away early and make up lost sleep i do hate to be so fractious and rose rubbed the forehead that ached with too much racketing  but the german does not begin till late im to lead and depend upon you just stay this once to oblige me pleaded charlie for he had set his heart on distinguishing himself  no i promised uncle to be temperate in my pleasures and i must keep my word im so well now it would be very foolish to get ill and make him anxious not to mention losing my beauty as you are good enough to call it for that depends on health you know  but the fun doesnt begin till after supper everything will be delightful i assure you and well have a gay old time as we did last week at emmas  then i certainly will not for im ashamed of myself when i remember what a romp that was and how sober uncle looked as he let me in at three in the morning all fagged out my dress in rags my head aching my feet so tired that i could hardly stand and nothing to show for five hours hard work but a pocketful of bonbons artificial flowers and tissuepaper fools caps uncle said id better put one on and go to bed for i looked as though id been to a french bal masque i never want to hear him say so again and ill never let dawn catch me out in such a plight anymore  you were all right enough for mother didnt object and i got you both home before daylight uncle is notional about such things so i shouldnt mind for we had a jolly time and we were none the worse for it  indeed we were every one of us aunt clara hasnt gotten over her cold yet i slept all the next day and you looked like a ghost for youd been out every night for weeks i think  oh nonsense everyone does it during the season and youll get used to the pace very soon began charlie bent on making her go for he was in his element in a ballroom and never happier than when he had his pretty cousin on his arm  ah but i dont want to get used to it for it costs too much in the end i dont wish to get used to being whisked about a hot room by men who have taken too much wine to turn day into night wasting time that might be better spent and grow into a fashionable fast girl who cant get along without excitement i dont deny that much of it is pleasant but dont try to make me too fond of gaiety help me to resist what i know is hurtful and please dont laugh me out of the good habits uncle has tried so hard to give me  rose was quite sincere in her appeal and charlie knew she was right but he always found it hard to give up anything he had set his heart on no matter how trivial for the maternal indulgence which had harmed the boy had fostered the habit of selfindulgence which was ruining the man so when rose looked up at him with a very honest desire to save him as well as herself from being swept into the giddy vortex which keeps so many young people revolving aimlessly till they go down or are cast upon the shore wrecks of what they might have been he gave a shrug and answered briefly as you please ill bring you home as early as you like and effie waring shall take your place in the german what flowers shall i send you  now that was an artful speech of charlies for miss waring was a fast and fashionable damsel who openly admired prince charming and had given him the name rose disliked her and was sure her influence was bad for youth made frivolity forgivable wit hid want of refinement and beauty always covers a multitude of sins in a mans eyes at the sound of effies name rose wavered and would have yielded but for the memory of the first mates last words she did desire to keep a straight course so though the current of impulse set strongly in a southerly direction principle the only compass worth having pointed due north and she tried to obey it like a wise young navigator saying steadily while she directed to annabel the parcel containing a capacious pair of slippers intended for uncle mac dont trouble yourself about me i can go with uncle and slip away without disturbing anybody  i dont believe youll have the heart to do it said charlie incredulously as he sealed the last note  wait and see  i will but i shall hope to the last and kissing his hand to her he departed to post her letters quite sure that miss waring would not lead the german  it certainly looked for a moment as if miss campbell would because she ran to the door with the words ill go upon her lips but she did not open it till she had stood a minute staring hard at the old glove on psyches head then like one who had suddenly gotten a bright idea she gave a decided nod and walked slowly out of the room     chapter 6 polishing mac  please could i say one word was the question three times repeated before a rough head bobbed out from the grotto of books in which mac usually sat when he studied  did anyone speak he asked blinking in the flood of sunshine that entered with rose  only three times thank you dont disturb yourself i beg for i merely want to say a word answered rose as she prevented him from offering the easy chair in which he sat  i was rather deep in a compound fracture and didnt hear what can i do for you cousin and mac shoved a stack of pamphlets off the chair near him with a hospitable wave of the hand that sent his papers flying in all directions  rose sat down but did not seem to find her word an easy one to utter for she twisted her handkerchief about her fingers in embarrassed silence till mac put on his glasses and after a keen look asked soberly is it a splinter a cut or a whitlow maam  it is neither do forget your tiresome surgery for a minute and be the kindest cousin that ever was answered rose beginning rather sharply and ending with her most engaging smile  cant promise in the dark said the wary youth  it is a favor a great favor and one i dont choose to ask any of the other boys answered the artful damsel  mac looked pleased and leaned forward saying more affably name it and be sure ill grant it if i can  go with me to mrs hopes party tomorrow night  what and mac recoiled as if she had put a pistol to his head  ive left you in peace a long time but it is your turn now so do your duty like a man and a cousin  but i never go to parties cried the unhappy victim in great dismay  high time you began sir  but i dont dance fit to be seen  ill teach you  my dress coat isnt decent i know  archie will lend you one he isnt going  im afraid theres a lecture that i ought not to cut  no there isnt i asked uncle  im always so tired and dull in the evening  this sort of thing is just what you want to rest and freshen up your spirits  mac gave a groan and fell back vanquished for it was evident that escape was impossible  what put such a perfectly wild idea into your head he demanded rather roughly for hitherto he had been left in peace and this sudden attack decidedly amazed him  sheer necessity but dont do it if it is so very dreadful to you i must go to several more parties because they are made for me but after that ill refuse and then no one need be troubled with me  something in roses voice made mac answer penitently even while he knit his brows in perplexity i dont mean to be rude and of course ill go anywhere if im really needed but i dont understand where the sudden necessity is with three other fellows at command all better dancers and beaus than i am  i dont want them and i do want you for i havent the heart to drag uncle out anymore and you know i never go with any gentleman but those of my own family  now look here rose if steve has been doing anything to tease you just mention it and ill attend to him cried mac plainly seeing that something was amiss and fancying that dandy was at the bottom of it as he had done escort duty several times lately  no steve has been very good but i know he had rather be with kitty van so of course i feel like a marplot though he is too polite to hint it  what a noodle that boy is but theres archie hes steady as a church and has no sweetheart to interfere continued mac bound to get at the truth and half suspecting what it was  he is on his feet all day and aunt jessie wants him in the evening he does not care for dancing as he used and i suppose he really does prefer to rest and read rose might have added and hear phebe sing for phebe did not go out as much as rose did and aunt jessie often came to sit with the old lady when the young folks were away and of course dutiful archie came with her so willingly of late  whats amiss with charlie i thought he was the prince of cavaliers annabel says he dances like an angel and i know a dozen mothers couldnt keep him at home of an evening have you had a tiff with adonis and so fall back on poor me asked mac coming last to the person of whom he thought first but did not mention feeling shy about alluding to a subject often discussed behind her back  yes i have and i dont intend to go with him any more for some time his ways do not suit me and mine do not suit him so i want to be quite independent and you can help me if you will said rose rather nervously spinning the big globe close by  mac gave a low whistle looking wide awake all in a minute as he said with a gesture as if he brushed a cobweb off his face now see here cousin im not good at mysteries and shall only blunder if you put me blindfold into any nice maneuver just tell me straight out what you want and ill do it if i can play im uncle and free your mind come now  he spoke so kindly and the honest eyes were so full of merry goodwill that rose thought she might confide in him and answered as frankly as he could desire you are right mac and i dont mind talking to you almost as freely as to uncle because you are such a reliable fellow and wont think me silly for trying to do what i believe to be right charlie does and so makes it hard for me to hold to my resolutions i want to keep early hours dress simply and behave properly no matter what fashionable people do you will agree to that im sure and stand by me through thick and thin for principles sake  i will and begin by showing you that i understand the case i dont wonder you are not pleased for charlie is too presuming and you do need someone to help you head him off a bit hey cousin  what a way to put it and rose laughed in spite of herself adding with an air of relief that is it and i do want someone to help me make him understand that i dont choose to be taken possession of in that lordly way as if i belonged to him more than to the rest of the family i dont like it for people begin to talk and charlie wont see how disagreeable it is to me  tell him so was macs blunt advice  i have but he only laughs and promises to behave and then he does it again when i am so placed that i cant say anything you will never understand and i cannot explain for it is only a look or a word or some little thing but i wont have it and the best way to cure him is to put it out of his power to annoy me so  he is a great flirt and wants to teach you how i suppose ill speak to him if you like and tell him you dont want to learn shall i asked mac finding the case rather an interesting one  no thank you that would only make trouble if you will kindly play escort a few times it will show charlie that i am in earnest without more words and put a stop to the gossip said rose coloring like a poppy at the recollection of what she heard one young man whisper to another as charlie led her through a crowded supper room with his most devoted air lucky dog he is sure to get the heiress and we are nowhere  theres no danger of people gossiping about us is there and mac looked up with the oddest of all his odd expressions  of course not youre only a boy  im twentyone thank you and prince is but a couple of years older said mac promptly resenting the slight put upon his manhood  yes but he is like other young men while you are a dear old bookworm no one would ever mind what you did so you may go to parties with me every night and not a word would be said or if there was i shouldnt mind since it is only mac answered rose smiling as she quoted a household phrase often used to excuse his vagaries  then i am nobody he said lifting his brows as if the discovery surprised and rather nettled him  nobody in society as yet but my very best cousin in private and ive just proved my regard by making you my confidant and choosing you for my knight said rose hastening to soothe the feelings her careless words seemed to have ruffled slightly  much good that is likely to do me grumbled mac  you ungrateful boy not to appreciate the honor ive conferred upon you i know a dozen who would be proud of the place but you only care for compound fractures so i wont detain you any longer except to ask if i may consider myself provided with an escort for tomorrow night said rose a trifle hurt at his indifference for she was not used to refusals  if i may hope for the honor and rising he made her a bow which was such a capital imitation of charlies grand manner that she forgave him at once exclaiming with amused surprise why mac i didnt know you could be so elegant  a fellow can be almost anything he likes if he tries hard enough he answered standing very straight and looking so tall and dignified that rose was quite impressed and with a stately courtesy she retired saying graciously i accept with thanks good morning dr alexander mackenzie campbell  when friday evening came and word was sent up that her escort had arrived rose ran down devoutly hoping that he had not come in a velveteen jacket topboots black gloves or made any trifling mistake of that sort a young gentleman was standing before the long mirror apparently intent upon the arrangement of his hair and rose paused suddenly as her eye went from the glossy broadcloth to the whitegloved hands busy with an unruly lock that would not stay in place  why charlie i thought she began with an accent of surprise in her voice but got no further for the gentleman turned and she beheld mac in immaculate evening costume with his hair parted sweetly on his brow a superior posy at his buttonhole and the expression of a martyr on his face  ah dont you wish it was no one but yourself to thank that it isnt he am i right dandy got me up and he ought to know what is what demanded mac folding his hands and standing as stiff as a ramrod  you are so regularly splendid that i dont know you  neither do i  i really had no idea you could look so like a gentleman added rose surveying him with great approval  nor that i could feel so like a fool  poor boy he does look rather miserable what can i do to cheer him up in return for the sacrifice he is making  stop calling me a boy it will soothe my agony immensely and give me courage to appear in a lownecked coat and curl on my forehead for im not used to such elegancies and i find them no end of a trial  mac spoke in such a pathetic tone and gave such a gloomy glare at the aforesaid curl that rose laughed in his face and added to his woe by handing him her cloak he surveyed it gravely for a minute then carefully put it on wrong side out and gave the swansdown hood a good pull over the head to the utter destruction of all smoothness to the curls inside  rose uttered a cry and cast off the cloak bidding him learn to do it properly which he meekly did and then led her down the hall without walking on her skirts more than three times on the way but at the door she discovered that she had forgotten her furred overshoes and bade mac get them  never mind its not wet he said pulling his cap over his eyes and plunging into his coat regardless of the elegancies that afflicted him  but i cant walk on cold stones with thin slippers can i began rose showing him a little white foot  you neednt for there you are my lady and unceremoniously picking her up mac landed her in the carriage before she could say a word  what an escort she exclaimed in comic dismay as she rescued her delicate dress from a rug in which he was about to tuck her up like a mummy  its only mac so dont mind and he cast himself into an opposite corner with the air of a man who had nerved himself to the accomplishment of many painful duties and was bound to do them or die  but gentlemen dont catch up ladies like bags of meal and poke them into carriages in this way it is evident that you need looking after and it is high time i undertook your society manners now do mind what you are about and dont get yourself or me into a scrape if you can help it besought rose feeling that on many accounts she had gone further and fared worse  ill behave like a turveydrop see if i dont  macs idea of the immortal turveydrops behavior seemed to be a peculiar one for after dancing once with his cousin he left her to her own devices and soon forgot all about her in a long conversation with professor stumph the learned geologist rose did not care for one dance proved to her that that branch of macs education had been sadly neglected and she was glad to glide smoothly about with steve though he was only an inch or two taller than herself she had plenty of partners however and plenty of chaperons for all the young men were her most devoted and all the matrons beamed upon her with maternal benignity  charlie was not there for when he found that rose stood firm and had moreover engaged mac as a permanency he would not go at all and retired in high dudgeon to console himself with more dangerous pastimes rose feared it would be so and even in the midst of the gaiety about her an anxious mood came over her now and then and made her thoughtful for a moment she felt her power and wanted to use it wisely but did not know how to be kind to charlie without being untrue to herself and giving him false hopes  i wish we were all children again with no hearts to perplex us and no great temptations to try us she said to herself as she rested a minute in a quiet nook while her partner went to get a glass of water right in the midst of this halfsad halfsentimental reverie she heard a familiar voice behind her say earnestly and allophite is the new hydrous silicate of alumina and magnesia much resembling pseudophite which websky found in silesia  what is mac talking about she thought and peeping behind a great azalea in full bloom she saw her cousin in deep conversation with the professor evidently having a capital time for his face had lost its melancholy expression and was all alive with interest while the elder man was listening as if his remarks were both intelligent and agreeable  what is it asked steve coming up with the water and seeing a smile on roses face  she pointed out the scientific teteatete going on behind the azalea and steve grinned as he peeped then grew sober and said in a tone of despair if you had seen the pains i took with that fellow the patience with which i brushed his wig the time i spent trying to convince him that he must wear thin boots and the fight i had to get him into that coat youd understand my feelings when i see him now  why whats the matter with him asked rose  will you take a look and see what a spectacle he has made of himself hed better be sent home at once or he will disgrace the family by looking as if hed been in a row  steve spoke in such a tragic tone that rose took another peep and did sympathize with dandy for macs elegance was quite gone his tie was under one ear his posy hung upside down his gloves were rolled into a ball which he absently squeezed and pounded as he talked and his hair looked as if a whirlwind had passed over it for his ten fingers set it on end now and then as they had a habit of doing when he studied or talked earnestly but he looked so happy and wide awake in spite of his dishevelment that rose gave an approving nod and said behind her fan it is a trying spectacle steve yet on the whole i think his own odd ways suit him best and i fancy we shall be proud of him for he knows more than all the rest of us put together hear that now and rose paused that they might listen to the following burst of eloquence from macs lips you know frenzal has shown that the globular forms of silicate of bismuth at schneeburg and johanngeorgenstadt are not isometric but monoclinic in crystalline form and consequently he separates them from the old eulytite and gives them the new name agricolite  isnt it awful let us get out of this before theres another avalanche or we shall be globular silicates and isometric crystals in spite of ourselves whispered steve with a panicstricken air and they fled from the hailstorm of hard words that rattled about their ears leaving mac to enjoy himself in his own way  but when rose was ready to go home and looked about for her escort he was nowhere to be seen for the professor had departed and mac with him so absorbed in some new topic that he entirely forgot his cousin and went placidly home still pondering on the charms of geology when this pleasing fact dawned upon rose her feelings may be imagined she was both angry and amused it was so like mac to go mooning off and leave her to her fate not a hard one however for though steve was gone with kitty before her plight was discovered mrs bliss was only too glad to take the deserted damsel under her wing and bear her safely home  rose was warming her feet and sipping the chocolate which phebe always had ready for her as she never ate supper when a hurried tap came at the long window whence the light streamed and macs voice was heard softly asking to be let in just for one minute  curious to know what had befallen him rose bade phebe obey his call and the delinquent cavalier appeared breathless anxious and more dilapidated than ever for he had forgotten his overcoat his tie was at the back of his neck now and his hair as rampantly erect as if all the winds of heaven had been blowing freely through it as they had for he had been tearing to and fro the last half hour trying to undo the dreadful deed he had so innocently committed  dont take any notice of me for i dont deserve it i only came to see that you were safe cousin and then go hang myself as steve advised he began in a remorseful tone that would have been very effective if he had not been obliged to catch his breath with a comical gasp now and then  i never thought you would be the one to desert me said rose with a reproachful look thinking it best not to relent too soon though she was quite ready to do it when she saw how sincerely distressed he was  it was that confounded man he was a regular walking encyclopedia and finding i could get a good deal out of him i went in for general information as the time was short you know i always forget everything else when i get hold of such a fellow  that is evident i wonder how you came to remember me at all answered rose on the brink of a laugh it was so absurd  i didnt till steve said something that reminded me then it burst upon me in one awful shock that id gone and left you and you might have knocked me down with a feather said honest mac hiding none of his iniquity  what did you do then  do i went off like a shot and never stopped till i reached the hopes  you didnt walk all the way cried rose  bless you no i ran but you were gone with mrs bliss so i pelted back again to see with my own eyes that you were safe at home answered mac with a sigh of relief wiping his hot forehead  but it is three miles at least each way and twelve oclock and dark and cold oh mac how could you exclaimed rose suddenly realizing what he had done as she heard his labored breathing saw the state of the thin boots and detected the absence of an overcoat  couldnt do less could i asked mac leaning up against the door and trying not to pant  there was no need of half killing yourself for such a trifle you might have known i could take care of myself for once at least with so many friends about sit down this minute bring another cup please phebe this boy isnt going home till he is rested and refreshed after such a run as that commanded rose  dont be good to me id rather take a scolding than a chair and drink hemlock instead of chocolate if you happen to have any ready answered mac with a pathetic puff as he subsided onto the sofa and meekly took the draft phebe brought him  if you had anything the matter with your heart sir a race of this sort might be the death of you so never do it again said rose offering her fan to cool his heated countenance  havent got any heart  yes you have for i hear it beating like a triphammer and it is my fault i ought to have stopped as we went by and told you i was all right  its the mortification not the miles that upsets me i often take that run for exercise and think nothing of it but tonight i was so mad i made extragood time i fancy now dont you worry but compose your mind and sip your dish of tea as evelina says answered mac artfully turning the conversation from himself  what do you know about evelina asked rose in great surprise  all about her do you suppose i never read a novel  i thought you read nothing but greek and latin with an occasional glance at webskys pseudophites and the monoclinics of johanngeorgenstadt  mac opened his eyes wide at this reply then seemed to see the joke and joined in the laugh with such heartiness that aunt plentys voice was heard demanding from above with sleepy anxiety is the house afire  no maam everything is safe and im only saying good night answered mac diving for his cap  then go at once and let that child have her sleep added the old lady retiring to her bed  rose ran into the hall and catching up her uncles fur coat met mac as he came out of the study absently looking about for his own  you havent any you benighted boy so take this and have your wits about you next time or i wont let you off so easily she said holding up the heavy garment and peeping over it with no sign of displeasure in her laughing eyes  next time then you do forgive me you will try me again and give me a chance to prove that im not a fool cried mac embracing the big coat with emotion  of course i will and so far from thinking you a fool i was much impressed with your learning tonight and told steve that we ought to be proud of our philosopher  learning be hanged ill show you that im not a bookworm but as much a man as any of them and then you may be proud or not as you like cried mac with a defiant nod that caused the glasses to leap wildly off his nose as he caught up his hat and departed as he came  a day or two later rose went to call upon aunt jane as she dutifully did once or twice a week on her way upstairs she heard a singular sound in the drawing room and involuntarily stopped to listen  one two three slide one two three turn now then come on said one voice impatiently  its very easy to say come on but what the dickens do i do with my left leg while im turning and sliding with my right demanded another voice in a breathless and mournful tone  then the whistling and thumping went on more vigorously than before and rose recognizing the voices peeped through the halfopen door to behold a sight which made her shake with suppressed laughter steve with a red tablecloth tied around his waist languished upon macs shoulder dancing in perfect time to the air he whistled for dandy was proficient in the graceful art and plumed himself upon his skill mac with a flushed face and dizzy eye clutched his brother by the small of his back vainly endeavoring to steer him down the long room without entangling his own legs in the tablecloth treading on his partners toes or colliding with the furniture it was very droll and rose enjoyed the spectacle till mac in a frantic attempt to swing around dashed himself against the wall and landed steve upon the floor then it was impossible to restrain her laughter any longer and she walked in upon them saying merrily it was splendid do it again and ill play for you  steve sprang up and tore off the tablecloth in great confusion while mac still rubbing his head dropped into a chair trying to look quite calm and cheerful as he gasped out how are you cousin when did you come john should have told us  im glad he didnt for then i should have missed this touching tableau of cousinly devotion and brotherly love getting ready for our next party i see  trying to but there are so many things to remember all at once keep time steer straight dodge the petticoats and manage my confounded legs that it isnt easy to get on at first answered mac with a sigh of exhaustion wiping his hot forehead  hardest job i ever undertook and as im not a battering ram i decline to be knocked round any longer growled steve dusting his knees and ruefully surveying the feet that had been trampled on till they tingled for his boots and broadcloth were dear to the heart of the dapper youth  very good of you and im much obliged ive got the pace i think and can practice with a chair to keep my hand in said mac with such a comic mixture of gratitude and resignation that rose went off again so irresistibly that her cousins joined her with a hearty roar  as you are making a martyr of yourself in my service the least i can do is lend a hand play for us steve and ill give mac a lesson unless he prefers the chair and throwing off her hat and cloak rose beckoned so invitingly that the gravest philosopher would have yielded  a thousand thanks but im afraid i shall hurt you began mac much gratified but mindful of past mishaps  im not steve didnt manage his train well for good dancers always loop theirs up i have none at all so that trouble is gone and the music will make it much easier to keep step just do as i tell you and youll go beautifully after a few turns  i will i will pipe up steve now rose and brushing his hair out of his eyes with an air of stern determination mac grasped rose and returned to the charge bent on distinguishing himself if he died in the attempt  the second lesson prospered for steve marked the time by a series of emphatic bangs mac obeyed orders as promptly as if his life depended on it and after several narrow escapes at exciting moments rose had the satisfaction of being steered safely down the room and landed with a grand pirouette at the bottom steve applauded and mac much elated exclaimed with artless candor there really is a sort of inspiration about you rose i always detested dancing before but now do you know i rather like it  i knew you would only you mustnt stand with your arm round your partner in this way when you are done you must seat and fan her if she likes it said rose anxious to perfect a pupil who seemed so lamentably in need of a teacher  yes of course i know how they do it and releasing his cousin mac raised a small whirlwind around her with a folded newspaper so full of zeal that she had not the heart to chide him again  well done old fellow i begin to have hopes of you and will order you a new dress coat at once since you are really going in for the proprieties of life said steve from the music stool with the approving nod of one who was a judge of said proprieties now rose if you will just coach him a little in his small talk he wont make a laughingstock of himself as he did the other night added steve i dont mean his geological gabble that was bad enough but his chat with emma curtis was much worse tell her mac and see if she doesnt think poor emma had a right to think you a firstclass bore  i dont see why when i merely tried to have a little sensible conversation began mac with reluctance for he had been unmercifully chaffed by his cousins to whom his brother had betrayed him  what did you say i wont laugh if i can help it said rose curious to hear for steves eyes were twinkling with fun  well i knew she was fond of theaters so i tried that first and got on pretty well till i began to tell her how they managed those things in greece most interesting subject you know  very did you give her one of the choruses or a bit of agamemnon as you did when you described it to me asked rose keeping sober with difficulty as she recalled that seriocomic scene  of course not but i was advising her to read prometheus when she gaped behind her fan and began to talk about phebe what a nice creature she was kept her place dressed according to her station and that sort of twaddle i suppose it was rather rude but being pulled up so short confused me a bit and i said the first thing that came into my head which was that i thought phebe the bestdressed woman in the room because she wasnt all fuss and feathers like most of the girls  oh mac that to emma who makes it the labor of her life to be always in the height of fashion and was particularly splendid that night what did she say cried rose full of sympathy for both parties  she bridled and looked daggers at me  and what did you do  i bit my tongue and tumbled out of one scrape into another following her example i changed the subject by talking about the charity concert for the orphans and when she gushed about the little darlings i advised her to adopt one and wondered why young ladies didnt do that sort of thing instead of cuddling cats and lapdogs  unhappy boy her pug is the idol of her life and she hates babies said rose  more fool she well she got my opinion on the subject anyway and shes very welcome for i went on to say that i thought it would not only be a lovely charity but excellent training for the time when they had little darlings of their own no end of poor things die through the ignorance of mothers you know added mac so seriously that rose dared not smile at what went before  imagine emma trotting round with a pauper baby under her arm instead of her cherished toto said steve with an ecstatic twirl on the stool  did she seem to like your advice monsieur malapropos asked rose wishing she had been there  no she gave a little shriek and said good gracious mr campbell how droll you are take me to mama please which i did with a thankful heart catch me setting her pugs leg again ended mac with a grim shake of the head  never mind you were unfortunate in your listener that time dont think all girls are so foolish i can show you a dozen sensible ones who would discuss dress reform and charity with you and enjoy greek tragedy if you did the chorus for them as you did for me said rose consolingly for steve would only jeer  give me a list of them please and ill cultivate their acquaintance a fellow must have some reward for making a teetotum of himself  i will with pleasure and if you dance well they will make it very pleasant for you and youll enjoy parties in spite of yourself  i cannot be a glass of fashion and a mold of form like dandy here but ill do my best only if i had my choice id much rather go round the streets with an organ and a monkey answered mac despondently  thank you kindly for the compliment and rose made him a low courtesy while steve cried now you have done it in a tone of reproach which reminded the culprit all too late that he was roses chosen escort  by the gods so i have and casting away the newspaper with a gesture of comic despair mac strode from the room chanting tragically the words of cassandra woe woe o earth o apollo i will dare to die i will accost the gates of hades and make my prayer that i may receive a mortal blow     chapter 7 phebe  while rose was making discoveries and having experiences phebe was doing the same in a quieter way but though they usually compared notes during the bedtime teteatete which always ended their day certain topics were never mentioned so each had a little world of her own into which even the eye of friendship did not peep  roses life just now was the gaiest but phebes the happiest both went out a good deal for the beautiful voice was welcomed everywhere and many were ready to patronize the singer who would have been slow to recognize the woman phebe knew this and made no attempt to assert herself content to know that those whose regard she valued felt her worth and hopeful of a time when she could gracefully take the place she was meant to fill  proud as a princess was phebe about some things though in most as humble as a child therefore when each year lessened the service she loved to give and increased the obligations she would have refused from any other source dependence became a burden which even the most fervent gratitude could not lighten hitherto the children had gone on together finding no obstacles to their companionship in the secluded world in which they lived now that they were women their paths inevitably diverged and both reluctantly felt that they must part before long  it had been settled when they were abroad that on their return phebe should take her one gift in her hand and try her fortunes on no other terms would she accept the teaching which was to fit her for the independence she desired faithfully had she used the facilities so generously afforded both at home and abroad and now was ready to prove that they had not been in vain much encouraged by the small successes she won in drawing rooms and the praise bestowed by interested friends she began to feel that she might venture on a larger field and begin her career as a concert singer for she aimed no higher  just at this time much interest was felt in a new asylum for orphan girls which could not be completed for want of funds the campbells well had borne their part and still labored to accomplish the muchneeded charity several fairs had been given for this purpose followed by a series of concerts rose had thrown herself into the work with all her heart and now proposed that phebe should make her debut at the last concert which was to be a peculiarly interesting one as all the orphans were to be present and were expected to plead their own cause by the sight of their innocent helplessness as well as touch hearts by the simple airs they were to sing  some of the family thought phebe would object to so humble a beginning but rose knew her better and was not disappointed for when she made her proposal phebe answered readily where could i find a fitter time and place to come before the public than here among my little sisters in misfortune ill sing for them with all my heart only i must be one of them and have no flourish made about me  you shall arrange it as you like and as there is to be little vocal music but yours and the childrens ill see that you have everything as you please promised rose  it was well she did for the family got much excited over the prospect of our phebes debut and would have made a flourish if the girls had not resisted aunt clara was in despair about the dress because phebe decided to wear a plain claretcolored merino with frills at neck and wrists so that she might look as much as possible like the other orphans in their stuff gowns and white aprons aunt plenty wanted to have a little supper afterward in honor of the occasion but phebe begged her to change it to a christmas dinner for the poor children the boys planned to throw bushels of flowers and charlie claimed the honor of leading the singer in but phebe with tears in her eyes declined their kindly offers saying earnestly i had better begin as i am to go on and depend upon myself entirely indeed mr charlie id rather walk in alone for youd be out of place among us and spoil the pathetic effect we wish to produce and a smile sparkled through the tears as phebe looked at the piece of elegance before her and thought of the brown gowns and pinafores  so after much discussion it was decided that she should have her way in all things and the family content themselves with applauding from the front  well blister our hands every man of us and carry you home in a chariot and four see if we dont you perverse prima donna threatened steve not at all satisfied with the simplicity of the affair  a chariot and two will be very acceptable as soon as im done i shall be quite steady till my part is all over and then i may feel a little upset so id like to get away before the confusion begins indeed i dont mean to be perverse but you are all so kind to me my heart is full whenever i think of it and that wouldnt do if im to sing said phebe dropping one of the tears on the little frill she was making  no diamond could have adorned it better archie thought as he watched it shine there for a moment and felt like shaking steve for daring to pat the dark head with an encouraging all right ill be on hand and whisk you away while the rest are splitting their gloves no fear of your breaking down if you feel the least bit like it though just look at me and ill glare at you and shake my fist since kindness upsets you  i wish you would because one of my ballads is rather touching and i always want to cry when i sing it the sight of you trying to glare will make me want to laugh and that will steady me nicely so sit in front please ready to slip out when i come off the last time  depend upon me and the little man departed taking great credit to himself for his influence over tall handsome phebe  if he had known what was going on in the mind of the silent young gentleman behind the newspaper steve would have been much astonished for archie though apparently engrossed by business was fathoms deep in love by this time no one suspected this but rose for he did his wooing with his eyes and only phebe knew how eloquent they could be he had discovered what the matter was long ago had made many attempts to reason himself out of it but finding it a hopeless task had given up trying and let himself drift deliciously the knowledge that the family would not approve only seemed to add ardor to his love and strength to his purpose for the same energy and persistence which he brought to business went into everything he did and having once made up his mind to marry phebe nothing could change this plan except a word from her  he watched and waited for three months so that he might not be accused of precipitation though it did not take him one to decide that this was the woman to make him happy her steadfast nature quiet busy ways and the reserved power and passion betrayed sometimes by a flash of the black eyes a quiver of the firm lips suited archie who possessed many of the same attributes himself the obscurity of her birth and isolation of her lot which would have deterred some lovers not only appealed to his kindly heart but touched the hidden romance which ran like a vein of gold through his strong common sense and made practical steadygoing archie a poet when he fell in love if uncle mac had guessed what dreams and fancies went on in the head bent over his ledgers and what emotions were fermenting in the bosom of his staid righthand man he would have tapped his forehead and suggested a lunatic asylum the boys thought archie had sobered down too soon his mother began to fear that the air of the counting room did not suit him and dr alec was deluded into the belief that the fellow really began to think of rose he came so often in the evening seeming quite content to sit beside her worktable and snip tape or draw patterns while they chatted  no one observed that though he talked to rose on these occasions he looked at phebe in her low chair close by busy but silent for she always tried to efface herself when rose was near and often mourned that she was too big to keep out of sight no matter what he talked about archie always saw the glossy black braids on the other side of the table the damask cheek curving down into the firm white throat and the dark lashes lifted now and then showing eyes so deep and soft he dared not look into them long even the swift needle charmed him the little brooch which rose and fell with her quiet breath the plain work she did and the tidy way she gathered her bits of thread into a tiny bag he seldom spoke to her never touched her basket though he ravaged roses if he wanted string or scissors very rarely ventured to bring her some curious or pretty thing when ships came in from china only sat and thought of her imagined that this was his parlor this her worktable and they two sitting there alone a happy man and wife  at this stage of the little evening drama he would be conscious of such a strong desire to do something rash that he took refuge in a new form of intoxication and proposed music sometimes so abruptly that rose would pause in the middle of a sentence and look at him surprised to meet a curiously excited look in the usually cool gray eyes  then phebe folding up her work would go to the piano as if glad to find a vent for the inner life which she seemed to have no power of expressing except in song rose would follow to accompany her and archie moving to a certain shady corner whence he could see phebes face as she sang would give himself up to unmitigated rapture for half an hour phebe never sang so well as at such times for the kindly atmosphere was like sunshine to a bird criticisms were few and gentle praises hearty and abundant and she poured out her soul as freely as a spring gushes up when its hidden source is full  in moments such as these phebe was beautiful with the beauty that makes a mans eye brighten with honest admiration and fills his heart with a sense of womanly nobility and sweetness little wonder then that the chief spectator of this agreeable tableau grew nightly more enamored and while the elders were deep in whist the young people were playing that still more absorbing game in which hearts are always trumps  rose having dummy for a partner soon discovered the fact and lately had begun to feel as she fancied wall must have done when pyramus wooed thisbe through its chinks she was a little startled at first then amused then anxious then heartily interested as every woman is in such affairs and willingly continued to be a medium though sometimes she quite tingled with the electricity which seemed to pervade the air she said nothing waiting for phebe to speak but phebe was silent seeming to doubt the truth till doubt became impossible then to shrink as if suddenly conscious of wrongdoing and seize every possible pretext for absenting herself from the girls corner as the pretty recess was called  the concert plan afforded excellent opportunities for doing this and evening after evening she slipped away to practice her songs upstairs while archie sat staring disconsolately at the neglected work basket and mute piano rose pitied him and longed to say a word of comfort but felt shy he was such a reserved fellow so left him to conduct his quiet wooing in his own way feeling that the crisis would soon arrive  she was sure of this as she sat beside him on the evening of the concert for while the rest of the family nodded and smiled chatted and laughed in great spirits archie was as mute as a fish and sat with his arms tightly folded as if to keep in any unruly emotions which might attempt to escape he never looked at the program but rose knew when phebes turn came by the quick breath he drew and the intent look so absent before that came into his eyes  but her own excitement prevented much notice of his for rose was in a flutter of hope and fear sympathy and delight about phebe and her success the house was crowded the audience sufficiently mixed to make the general opinion impartial and the stage full of little orphans with shining faces a most effective reminder of the object in view  little dears how nice they look poor things so young to be fatherless and motherless it will be a disgrace to the city if those girls are not taken proper care of subscriptions are always in order you know and pretty miss campbell will give you her sweetest smile if you hand her a handsome check ive heard this phebe moore and she really has a delicious voice such a pity she wont fit herself for opera only sings three times tonight thats modest im sure when shes the chief attraction so we must give her an encore after the italian piece the orphans lead off i see stop your ears if you like but dont fail to applaud or the ladies will never forgive you  chat of this sort went on briskly while fans waved programs rustled and ushers flew about distractedly till an important gentleman appeared made his bow skipped upon the leaders stand and with a wave of his baton caused a general uprising of white pinafores as the orphans led off with that muchenduring melody america in shrill small voices but with creditable attention to time and tune pity and patriotism produced a generous round of applause and the little girls sat down beaming with innocent satisfaction  an instrumental piece followed and then a youthful gentleman with his hair in picturesque confusion and what his friends called a musical brow bounded up the steps and clutching a roll of music with a pair of tightly gloved hands proceed to inform the audience in a husky tenor voice that it was a lovely violet  what else the song contained in the way of sense or sentiment it was impossible to discover as the three pages of music appeared to consist of variations upon that one line ending with a prolonged quaver which flushed the musical brow and left the youth quite breathless when he made his bow  now shes coming oh uncle my heart beats as if it were myself whispered rose clutching dr alecs arm with a little gasp as the piano was rolled forward the leaders stand pushed back and all eyes turned toward the anteroom door  she forgot to glance at archie and it was as well perhaps for his heart was thumping almost audibly as he waited for his phebe not from the anteroom but out among the children where she had sat unseen in the shadow of the organ came stately phebe in her winecolored dress with no ornament but her fine hair and a white flower at her throat very pale but quite composed apparently for she stepped slowly through the narrow lane of upturned faces holding back her skirts lest they should rudely brush against some little head straight to the front she went bowed hastily and with a gesture to the accompanist stood waiting to begin her eyes fixed on the great gilt clock at the opposite end of the hall  they never wandered from that point while she sang but as she ended they dropped for an instant on an eager girlish countenance bending from a front seat then with her hasty little bow she went quickly back among the children who clapped and nodded as she passed well pleased with the ballad she had sung  everyone courteously followed their example but there was no enthusiasm and it was evident that phebe had not produced a particularly favorable impression  never sang so badly in her life muttered charlie irefully  she was frightened poor thing give her time give her time said uncle mac kindly  i know she was and i glared like a gorgon but she never looked at me added steve smoothing his gloves and his brows at the same time  that first song was the hardest and she got through much better than i expected put in dr alec bound not to show the disappointment he felt  dont be troubled phebe has courage enough for anything and shell astonish you before the evenings over prophesied mac with unabated confidence for he knew something the rest did not  rose said nothing but under cover of her burnous gave archies hand a sympathetic squeeze for his arms were unfolded now as if the strain was over and one lay on his knee while with the other he wiped his hot forehead with an air of relief  friends about them murmured complimentary fibs and affected great delight and surprise at miss moores charming style exquisite simplicity and undoubted talent but strangers freely criticized and rose was so indignant at some of their remarks she could not listen to anything on the stage though a fine overture was played a man with a remarkable bass voice growled and roared melodiously and the orphans sang a lively air with a chorus of tra la la which was a great relief to little tongues unused to long silence  ive often heard that womens tongues were hung in the middle and went at both ends now im sure of it whispered charlie trying to cheer her up by pointing out the comical effect of some seventyfive open mouths in each of which the unruly member was wagging briskly  rose laughed and let him fan her leaning from his seat behind with the devoted air he always assumed in public but her wounded feelings were not soothed and she continued to frown at the stout man on the left who had dared to say with a shrug and a glance at phebes next piece that young woman can no more sing this italian thing than she can fly and they ought not to let her attempt it  phebe did however and suddenly changed the stout mans opinion by singing it grandly for the consciousness of her first failure pricked her pride and spurred her to do her best with the calm sort of determination which conquers fear fires ambition and changes defeat to success she looked steadily at rose now or the flushed intent face beside her and throwing all her soul into the task let her voice ring out like a silver clarion filling the great hall and setting the hearers blood atingle with the exulting strain  that settled phebes fate as a cantatrice the applause was genuine and spontaneous this time and broke out again and again with the generous desire to atone for former coldness but she would not return and the shadow of the great organ seemed to have swallowed her up for no eye could find her no pleasant clamor win her back  now i can die content said rose beaming with heartfelt satisfaction while archie looked steadfastly at his program trying to keep his face in order and the rest of the family assumed a triumphant air as if they had never doubted from the first  very well indeed said the stout man with an approving nod quite promising for a beginner shouldnt wonder if in time they made a second cary or kellogg of her  now youll forgive him wont you murmured charlie in his cousins ear  yes and id like to pat him on the head but take warning and never judge by first appearances again whispered rose at peace now with all mankind  phebes last song was another ballad she meant to devote her talent to that much neglected but always attractive branch of her art it was a great surprise therefore to all but one person in the hall when instead of singing auld robin grey she placed herself at the piano and with a smiling glance over her shoulder at the children broke out in the old bird song which first won rose but the chirping twittering and cooing were now the burden to three verses of a charming little song full of springtime and the awakening life that makes it lovely a rippling accompaniment flowed through it all and a burst of delighted laughter from the children filled up the first pause with a fitting answer to the voices that seemed calling to them from the vernal woods  it was very beautiful and novelty lent its charm to the surprise for art and nature worked a pretty miracle and the clever imitation first heard from a kitchen hearth now became the favorite in a crowded concert room phebe was quite herself again color in the cheeks now eyes that wandered smiling to and fro and lips that sang as gaily and far more sweetly than when she kept time to her blithe music with a scrubbing brush  this song was evidently intended for the children and they appreciated the kindly thought for as phebe went back among them they clapped ecstatically flapped their pinafores and some caught her by the skirts with audible requests to do it again please do it again  but phebe shook her head and vanished for it was getting late for such small people several of whom lay sweetly slumbering there till roused by the clamor round them the elders however were not to be denied and applauded persistently especially aunt plenty who seized uncle macs cane and pounded with it as vigorously as mrs nubbles at the play  never mind your gloves steve keep it up till she comes cried charlie enjoying the fun like a boy while jamie lost his head with excitement and standing up called phebe phebe in spite of his mothers attempts to silence him  even the stout man clapped and rose could only laugh delightedly as she turned to look at archie who seemed to have let himself loose at last and was stamping with a dogged energy funny to see  so phebe had to come and stood there meekly bowing with a moved look on her face that showed how glad and grateful she was till a sudden hush came then as if inspired by the memory of the cause that brought her there she looked down into the sea of friendly faces before her with no trace of fear in her own and sang the song that never will grow old  that went straight to the hearts of those who heard her for there was something inexpressibly touching in the sight of this sweetvoiced woman singing of home for the little creatures who were homeless and phebe made her tuneful plea irresistible by an almost involuntary gesture of the hands which had hung loosely clasped before her till with the last echo of the beloved word they fell apart and were half outstretched as if pleading to be filled  it was the touch of nature that works wonders for it made full purses suddenly weigh heavily in pockets slow to open brought tears to eyes unused to weep and caused that group of redgowned girls to grow very pathetic in the sight of fathers and mothers who had left little daughters safe asleep at home this was evident from the stillness that remained unbroken for an instant after phebe ended and before people could get rid of their handkerchiefs she would have been gone if the sudden appearance of a mite in a pinafore climbing up the stairs from the anteroom with a great bouquet grasped in both hands had not arrested her  up came the little creature intent on performing the mission for which rich bribes of sugarplums had been promised and trotting bravely across the stage she held up the lovely nosegay saying in her baby voice dis for you maam then startled by the sudden outburst of applause she hid her face in phebes gown and began to sob with fright  an awkward minute for poor phebe but she showed unexpected presence of mind and left behind her a pretty picture of the oldest and youngest orphan as she went quickly down the step smiling over the great bouquet with the baby on her arm  nobody minded the closing piece for people began to go sleepy children to be carried off and whispers grew into a buzz of conversation in the general confusion rose looked to see if steve had remembered his promise to help phebe slip away before the rush began no there he was putting on kittys cloak quite oblivious to any other duty turning to ask archie to hurry out rose found that he had already vanished leaving his gloves behind him  have you lost anything asked dr alec catching a glimpse of her face  no sir ive found something she whispered back giving him the gloves to pocket along with her fan and glass adding hastily as the concert ended please uncle tell them all not to come with us phebe has had enough excitement and ought to rest  roses word was law to the family in all things concerning phebe so word was passed that there were to be no congratulations until tomorrow and dr alec got his party off as soon as possible but all the way home while he and aunt plenty were prophesying a brilliant future for the singer rose sat rejoicing over the happy present of the woman she was sure that archie had spoken and imagined the whole scene with feminine delight how tenderly he had asked the momentous question how gratefully phebe had given the desired reply and now how both were enjoying that delicious hour which rose had been given to understand never came but once such a pity to shorten it she thought and begged her uncle to go home the longest way the night was so mild the moonlight so clear and herself so in need of fresh air after the excitement of the evening  i thought you would want to rush into phebes arms the instant she got done said aunt plenty innocently wondering at the whims girls took into their heads  so i should if i consulted my own wishes but as phebe asked to be let alone i want to gratify her answered rose making the best excuse she could  a little piqued thought the doctor fancying he understood the case  as the old ladys rheumatism forbade their driving about till midnight home was reached much too soon rose thought and tripped away to warn the lovers the instant she entered the house but study parlor and boudoir were empty and when jane appeared with cake and wine she reported that miss phebe went right upstairs and wished to be excused please being very tired  that isnt at all like phebe i hope she isnt ill began aunt plenty sitting down to toast her feet  she may be a little hysterical for she is a proud thing and represses her emotions as long as she can ill step up and see if she doesnt need a soothing draft of some sort and dr alec threw off his coat as he spoke  no no shes only tired ill run up to her she wont mind me and ill report if anything is amiss  away went rose quite trembling with suspense but phebes door was shut no light shone underneath and no sound came from the room within she tapped and receiving no answer went on to her own chamber thinking to herself love always makes people queer ive heard so i suppose they settled it all in the carriage and the dear thing ran away to think about her happiness alone ill not disturb her why phebe said rose surprised for entering her room there was the cantatrice busy about the nightly services she always rendered her little mistress  im waiting for you dear where have you been so long asked phebe poking the fire as if anxious to get some color into cheeks that were unnaturally pale  the instant she spoke rose knew that something was wrong and a glance at her face confirmed the fear it was like a dash of cold water and quenched her happy fancies in a moment but being a delicateminded girl she respected phebes mood and asked no questions made no comments and left her friend to speak or be silent as she chose  i was so excited i would take a turn in the moonlight to calm my nerves oh dearest phebe i am so glad so proud so full of wonder at your courage and skill and sweet ways altogether that i cannot half tell you how i love and honor you she cried kissing the white cheeks with such tender warmth they could not help glowing faintly as phebe held her little mistress close sure that nothing could disturb this innocent affection  it is all your work dear because but for you i might still be scrubbing floors and hardly dare to dream of anything like this she said in her old grateful way but in her voice there was a thrill of something deeper than gratitude and at the last two words her head went up with a gesture of soft pride as if it had been newly crowned  rose heard and saw and guessed at the meaning of both tone and gesture feeling that her phebe deserved both the singers laurel and the brides myrtle wreath but she only looked up saying very wistfully then it has been a happy night for you as well as for us  the happiest of my life and the hardest answered phebe briefly as she looked away from the questioning eyes  you should have let us come nearer and help you through im afraid you are very proud my jenny lind  i have to be for sometimes i feel as if i had nothing else to keep me up she stopped short there fearing that her voice would prove traitorous if she went on in a moment she asked in a tone that was almost hard you think i did well tonight  they all think so and were so delighted they wanted to come in a body and tell you so but i sent them home because i knew youd be tired out perhaps i ought not to have done it and youd rather have had a crowd about you than just me  it was the kindest thing you ever did and what could i like better than just you my darling  phebe seldom called her that and when she did her heart was in the little word making it so tender that rose thought it the sweetest in the world next to uncle alecs my little girl now it was almost passionate and phebes face grew rather tragical as she looked down at rose it was impossible to seem unconscious any longer and rose said caressing phebes cheek which burned with a feverish color now then dont shut me out if you have a trouble but let me share it as i let you share all mine  i will little mistress ive got to go away sooner even than we planned  why phebe  because archie loves me  thats the very reason you should stay and make him happy  not if it caused dissension in the family and you know it would  rose opened her lips to deny this impetuously but checked herself and answered honestly uncle and i would be heartily glad and im sure aunt jessie never could object if you loved archie as he does you  she has other hopes i think and kind as she is it would be a disappointment if he brought me home she is right they all are and i alone am to blame i should have gone long ago i knew i should but it was so pleasant i couldnt bear to go away alone  i kept you and i am to blame if anyone but indeed dear phebe i cannot see why you should care even if aunt myra croaks and aunt clara exclaims or aunt jane makes disagreeable remarks be happy and never mind them cried rose so much excited by all this that she felt the spirit of revolt rise up within her and was ready to defy even that aweinspiring institution the family for her friends sake  but phebe shook her head with a sad smile and answered still with the hard tone in her voice as if forcing back all emotion that she might see her duty clearly you could do that but i never can answer me this rose and answer truly as you love me if you had been taken into a house a friendless penniless forlorn girl and for years been heaped with benefits trusted taught loved and made oh so happy could you think it right to steal away something that these good people valued very much to have them feel that you had been ungrateful had deceived them and meant to thrust yourself into a high place not fit for you when they had been generously helping you in other ways far more than you deserved could you then say as you do now be happy and never mind them  phebe held rose by the shoulders now and searched her face so keenly that the other shrank a little for the black eyes were full of fire and there was something almost grand about this girl who seemed suddenly to have become a woman there was no need for words to answer the question so swiftly asked for rose put herself in phebes place in the drawing of a breath and her own pride made her truthfully reply no i could not  i knew youd say that and help me do my duty and all the coldness melted out of phebes manner as she hugged her little mistress close feeling the comfort of sympathy even through the blunt sincerity of roses words  i will if i know how now come and tell me all about it and seating herself in the great chair which had often held them both rose stretched out her hands as if glad and ready to give help of any sort  but phebe would not take her accustomed place for as if coming to confession she knelt down upon the rug and leaning on the arm of the chair told her love story in the simplest words  i never thought he cared for me until a little while ago i fancied it was you and even when i knew he liked to hear me sing i supposed it was because you helped and so i did my best and was glad you were to be a happy girl but his eyes told the truth then i saw what i had been doing and was frightened he did not speak so i believed what is quite true that he felt i was not a fit wife for him and would never ask me it was right i was glad of it yet i was proud and though i did not ask or hope for anything i did want him to see that i respected myself remembered my duty and could do right as well as he i kept away i planned to go as soon as possible and resolved that at this concert i would do so well he should not be ashamed of poor phebe and her one gift  it was this that made you so strange then preferring to go alone and refusing every little favor at our hands asked rose feeling very sure now about the state of phebes heart  yes i wanted to do everything myself and not owe one jot of my success if i had any to even the dearest friend ive got it was bad and foolish of me and i was punished by the first dreadful failure i was so frightened rose my breath was all gone my eyes so dizzy i could hardly see and that great crowd of faces seemed so near i dared not look if it had not been for the clock i never should have gotten through and when i did not knowing in the least how id sung one look at your distressed face told me id failed  but i smiled phebe indeed i did as sweetly as i could for i was sure it was only fright protested rose eagerly  so you did but the smile was full of pity not of pride as i wanted it to be and i rushed into a dark place behind the organ feeling ready to kill myself how angry and miserable i was i set my teeth clenched my hands and vowed that i would do well next time or never sing another note i was quite desperate when my turn came and felt as if i could do almost anything for i remembered that he was there im not sure how it was but it seemed as if i was all voice for i let myself go trying to forget everything except that two people must not be disappointed though i died when the song was done  oh phebe it was splendid i nearly cried i was so proud and glad to see you do yourself justice at last  and he whispered phebe with her face half hidden on the arm of the chair  said not a word but i saw his lips tremble and his eyes shine and i knew he was the happiest creature there because i was sure he did think you fit to be his wife and did mean to speak very soon  phebe made no answer for a moment seeming to forget the small success in the greater one which followed and to comfort her sore heart with the knowledge that rose was right  he sent the flowers he came for me and on the way home showed me how wrong i had been to doubt him for an hour dont ask me to tell that part but be sure i was the happiest creature in the world then  and phebe hid her face again all wet with tender tears that fell soft and sudden as a summer shower  rose let them flow undisturbed while she silently caressed the bent head wondering with a wistful look in her own wet eyes what this mysterious passion was which could so move ennoble and beautify the beings whom it blessed  an impertinent little clock upon the chimneypiece striking eleven broke the silence and reminded phebe that she could not indulge in love dreams there she started up brushed off her tears and said resolutely that is enough for tonight go happily to bed and leave the troubles for tomorrow  but phebe i must know what you said cried rose like a child defrauded of half its bedtime story  i said no  ah but it will change to yes by and by im sure of that so ill let you go to dream of him the campbells are rather proud of being descendants of robert the bruce but they have common sense and love you dearly as youll see tomorrow  perhaps and with a good night kiss poor phebe went away to lie awake till dawn     chapter 8 breakers ahead  anxious to smooth the way for phebe rose was up betimes and slipped into aunt plentys room before the old lady had gotten her cap on  aunty ive something pleasant to tell you and while you listen ill brush your hair as you like to have me she began well aware that the proposed process was a very soothing one  yes dear only dont be too particular because im late and must hurry down or jane wont get things straight and it does fidget me to have the saltcellars uneven the tea strainer forgotten and your uncles paper not aired returned miss plenty briskly unrolling the two gray curls she wore at her temples  then rose brushing away at the scanty back hair led skillfully up to the crisis of her tale by describing phebes panic and brave efforts to conquer it all about the flowers archie sent her and how steve forgot and dear thoughtful archie took his place so far it went well and aunt plenty was full of interest sympathy and approbation but when rose added as if it was quite a matter of course so on the way home he told her he loved her a great start twitched the gray locks out of her hands as the old lady turned around with the little curls standing erect exclaiming in undisguised dismay not seriously rose  yes aunty very seriously he never jokes about such things  mercy on us what shall we do about it  nothing maam but be as glad as we ought and congratulate him as soon as she says yes  do you mean to say she didnt accept at once  she never will if we dont welcome her as kindly as if she belonged to one of our best families and i dont blame her  im glad the girl has so much sense of course we cant do anything of the sort and im surprised at archies forgetting what he owes to the family in this rash manner give me my cap child i must speak to alec at once and aunt plenty twisted her hair into a button at the back of her head with one energetic twirl  do speak kindly aunty and remember that it was not phebes fault she never thought of this till very lately and began at once to prepare for going away said rose pleadingly  she ought to have gone long ago i told myra we should have trouble somewhere as soon as i saw what a goodlooking creature she was and here it is as bad as can be dear dear why cant young people have a little prudence  i dont see that anyone need object if uncle jem and aunt jessie approve and i do think it will be very very unkind to scold poor phebe for being wellbred pretty and good after doing all we could to make her so  child you dont understand these things yet but you ought to feel your duty toward your family and do all you can to keep the name as honorable as it always has been what do you suppose our blessed ancestress lady marget would say to our oldest boy taking a wife from the poorhouse  as she spoke miss plenty looked up almost apprehensively at one of the woodenfaced old portraits with which her room was hung as if asking pardon of the severenosed matron who stared back at her from under the sort of blue dish cover which formed her headgear  as lady marget died about two hundred years ago i dont care a pin what she would say especially as she looks like a very narrowminded haughty woman but i do care very much what miss plenty campbell says for she is a very sensible generous discreet and dear old lady who wouldnt hurt a fly much less a good and faithful girl who has been a sister to me would she entreated rose knowing well that the elder aunt led all the rest more or less  but miss plenty had her cap on now and consequently felt herself twice the woman she was without it so she not only gave it a somewhat belligerent air by setting it well up but she shook her head decidedly smoothed down her stiff white apron and stood up as if ready for battle  i shall do my duty rose and expect the same of others dont say any more now i must turn the matter over in my mind for it has come upon me suddenly and needs serious consideration  with which unusually solemn address she took up her keys and trotted away leaving her niece to follow with an anxious countenance uncertain whether her championship had done good or ill to the cause she had at heart  she was much cheered by the sound of phebes voice in the study for rose was sure that if uncle alec was on their side all would be well but the clouds lowered again when they came in to breakfast for phebes heavy eyes and pale cheeks did not look encouraging while dr alec was as sober as a judge and sent an inquiring glance toward rose now and then as if curious to discover how she bore the news  an uncomfortable meal though all tried to seem as usual and talked over last nights events with all the interest they could but the old peace was disturbed by a word as a pebble thrown into a quiet pool sends telltale circles rippling its surface far and wide aunt plenty while turning the subject over in her mind also seemed intent on upsetting everything she touched and made sad havoc in her tea tray dr alec unsociably read his paper rose having salted instead of sugared her oatmeal absently ate it feeling that the sweetness had gone out of everything and phebe after choking down a cup of tea and crumbling a roll excused herself and went away sternly resolving not to be a bone of contention to this beloved family  as soon as the door was shut rose pushed away her plate and going to dr alec she peeped over the paper with such an anxious face that he put it down at once  uncle this is a serious matter and we must take our stand at once for you are phebes guardian and i am her sister began rose with pretty solemnity you have often been disappointed in me she continued but i know i never shall be in you because you are too wise and good to let any worldly pride or prudence spoil your sympathy with archie and our phebe you wont desert them will you  never answered dr alec with gratifying energy  thank you thank you cried rose now if i have you and aunty on my side im not afraid of anybody  gently gently child i dont intend to desert the lovers but i certainly shall advise them to consider well what they are about ill own i am rather disappointed because archie is young to decide his life in this way and phebes career seemed settled in another fashion old people dont like to have their plans upset you know he added more lightly for roses face fell as he went on  old people shouldnt plan too much for the young ones then we are very grateful im sure but we cannot always be disposed of in the most prudent and sensible way so dont set your hearts on little arrangements of that sort i beg and rose looked wondrous wise for she could not help suspecting even her best uncle of plans in her behalf  you are quite rightwe shouldnt yet it is very hard to help it confessed dr alec with a conscious air and returning hastily to the lovers he added kindly i was much pleased with the straightforward way in which phebe came to me this morning and told me all about it as if i really was her guardian she did not own it in words but it was perfectly evident that she loves archie with all her heart yet knowing the objections which will be made very sensibly and bravely proposes to go away at once and end the matter as if that were possible poor child and the tenderhearted man gave a sigh of sympathy that did rose good to hear and mollified her rising indignation at the bare idea of ending phebes love affairs in such a summary way  you dont think she ought to go i hope  i think she will go  we must not let her  we have no right to keep her  oh uncle surely we have our phebe whom we all love so much  you forget that she is a woman now and we have no claim on her because weve befriended her for years is the very reason we should not make our benefits a burden but leave her free and if she chooses to do this in spite of archie we must let her with a godspeed  before rose could answer aunt plenty spoke out like one having authority for oldfashioned ways were dear to her soul and she thought even love affairs should be conducted with a proper regard to the powers that be  the family must talk the matter over and decide what is best for the children who of course will listen to reason and do nothing ill advised for my part i am quite upset by the news but shall not commit myself till ive seen jessie and the boy jane clear away and bring me the hot water  that ended the morning conference and leaving the old lady to soothe her mind by polishing spoons and washing cups rose went away to find phebe while the doctor retired to laugh over the downfall of brother macs matchmaking schemes  the campbells did not gossip about their concerns in public but being a very united family it had long been the custom to talk over any interesting event which occurred to any member thereof and everyone gave his or her opinion advice or censure with the utmost candor therefore the first engagement if such it could be called created a great sensation among the aunts especially and they were in as much of a flutter as a flock of maternal birds when their young begin to hop out of the nest so at all hours the excellent ladies were seen excitedly nodding their caps together as they discussed the affair in all its bearings without ever arriving at any unanimous decision  the boys took it much more calmly mac was the only one who came out strongly in archies favor charlie thought the chief ought to do better and called phebe a siren who had bewitched the sage youth steve was scandalized and delivered long orations upon ones duty to society keeping the old name up and the danger of mésalliances while all the time he secretly sympathized with archie being much smitten with kitty van himself will and geordie unfortunately home for the holidays considered it a jolly lark and little jamie nearly drove his elder brother distracted by curious inquiries as to how folks felt when they were in love  uncle macs dismay was so comical that it kept dr alec in good spirits for he alone knew how deep was the deluded mans chagrin at the failure of the little plot which he fancied was prospering finely  ill never set my heart on anything of the sort again and the young rascals may marry whom they like im prepared for anything nowso if steve brings home the washerwomans daughter and mac runs away with our pretty chambermaid i shall say bless you my children with mournful resignation for upon my soul that is all thats left for a modern parent to do  with which tragic burst poor uncle mac washed his hands of the whole affair and buried himself in the countinghouse while the storm raged  about this time archie might have echoed roses childish wish that she had not quite so many aunts for the tongues of those interested relatives made sad havoc with his little romance and caused him to long fervently for a desert island where he could woo and win his love in delicious peace that nothing of the sort was possible soon became evident since every word uttered only confirmed phebes resolution to go away and proved to rose how mistaken she had been in believing that she could bring everyone to her way of thinking  prejudices are unmanageable things and the good aunts like most women possessed a plentiful supply so rose found it like beating her head against a wall to try and convince them that archie was wise in loving poor phebe his mother who had hoped to have rose for her daughter not because of her fortune but the tender affection she felt for her put away her disappointment without a word and welcomed phebe as kindly as she could for her boys sake but the girl felt the truth with the quickness of a nature made sensitive by love and clung to her resolve all the more tenaciously though grateful for the motherly words that would have been so sweet if genuine happiness had prompted them  aunt jane called it romantic nonsense and advised strong measures kind but firm jessie aunt clara was sadly distressed about what people would say if one of our boys married a nobodys daughter and aunt myra not only seconded her views by painting portraits of phebes unknown relations in the darkest colors but uttered direful prophecies regarding the disreputable beings who would start up in swarms the moment the girl made a good match  these suggestions so wrought upon aunt plenty that she turned a deaf ear to the benevolent emotions native to her breast and taking refuge behind our blessed ancestress lady marget refused to sanction any engagement which could bring discredit upon the stainless name which was her pride  so it all ended where it began for archie steadily refused to listen to anyone but phebe and she as steadily reiterated her bitter no fortifying herself half unconsciously with the hope that by and by when she had won a name fate might be kinder  while the rest talked she had been working for every hour showed her that her instinct had been a true one and pride would not let her stay though love pleaded eloquently so after a christmas anything but merry phebe packed her trunks rich in gifts from those who generously gave her all but the one thing she desired and with a pocketful of letters to people who could further her plans she went away to seek her fortune with a brave face and a very heavy heart  write often and let me know all you do my phebe and remember i shall never be contented till you come back again whispered rose clinging to her till the last  she will come back for in a year im going to bring her home please god said archie pale with the pain of parting but as resolute as she  ill earn my welcome then perhaps it will be easier for them to give and me to receive it answered phebe with a backward glance at the group of caps in the hall as she went down the steps on dr alecs arm  you earned it long ago and it is always waiting for you while i am here remember that and god bless you my good girl he said with a paternal kiss that warmed her heart  i never shall forget it and phebe never did     chapter 9 new years calls  now im going to turn over a new leaf as i promised i wonder what i shall find on the next page said rose coming down on new years morning with a serious face and a thick letter in her hand  tired of frivolity my dear asked her uncle pausing in his walk up and down the hall to glance at her with a quick bright look she liked to bring into his eyes  no sir and thats the sad part of it but ive made up my mind to stop while i can because im sure it is not good for me ive had some very sober thoughts lately for since my phebe went away ive had no heart for gaiety so it is a good place to stop and make a fresh start answered rose taking his arm and walking on with him  an excellent time now how are you going to fill the aching void he asked well pleased  by trying to be as unselfish brave and good as she is and rose held the letter against her bosom with a tender touch for phebes strength had inspired her with a desire to be as selfreliant im going to set about living in earnest as she has though i think it will be harder for me than for her because she stands alone and has a career marked out for her im nothing but a commonplace sort of girl with no end of relations to be consulted every time i wink and a dreadful fortune hanging like a millstone round my neck to weigh me down if i try to fly it is a hard case uncle and i get low in my mind when i think about it sighed rose oppressed with her blessings  afflicted child how can i relieve you and there was amusement as well as sympathy in dr alecs face as he patted the hand upon his arm  please dont laugh for i really am trying to be good in the first place help me to wean myself from foolish pleasures and show me how to occupy my thoughts and time so that i may not idle about and dream instead of doing great things  good well begin at once come to town with me this morning and see your houses they are all ready and mrs gardner has half a dozen poor souls waiting to go in as soon as you give the word answered the doctor promptly glad to get his girl back again though not surprised that she still looked with regretful eyes at the vanity fair always so enticing when we are young  ill give it today and make the new year a happy one to those poor souls at least im so sorry that its impossible for me to go with you but you know i must help aunty plen receive we havent been here for so long that she had set her heart on having a grand time today and i particularly want to please her because i have not been as amiable as i ought lately i really couldnt forgive her for siding against phebe  she did what she thought was right so we must not blame her i am going to make my new years calls today and as my friends live down that way ill get the list of names from mrs g and tell the poor ladies with miss campbells compliments that their new home is ready shall i  yes uncle but take all the credit to yourself for i never should have thought of it if you had not proposed the plan  bless your heart im only your agent and suggest now and then ive nothing to offer but advice so i lavish that on all occasions  you have nothing because youve given your substance all away as generously as you do your advice never mind you shall never come to want while i live ill save enough for us two though i do make ducks and drakes of my fortune  dr alec laughed at the toss of the head with which she quoted charlies offensive words then offered to take the letter saying as he looked at his watch ill post that for you in time for the early mail i like a run before breakfast  but rose held her letter fast dimpling with sudden smiles half merry and half shy  no thank you sir archie likes to do that and never fails to call for all i write he gets a peep at phebes in return and i cheer him up a bit for though he says nothing he has a hard time of it poor fellow  how many letters in five days  four sir to me she doesnt write to him uncle  as yet well you show hers so its all right and you are a set of sentimental youngsters and the doctor walked away looking as if he enjoyed the sentiment as much as any of them  old miss campbell was nearly as great a favorite as young miss campbell so a succession of black coats and white gloves flowed in and out of the hospitable mansion pretty steadily all day the clan was out in great force and came by in installments to pay their duty to aunt plenty and wish the compliments of the season to our cousin archie appeared first looking sad but steadfast and went away with phebes letter in his left breast pocket feeling that life was still endurable though his love was torn from him for rose had many comfortable things to say and read him delicious bits from the voluminous correspondence lately begun  hardly was he gone when will and geordie came marching in looking as fine as gray uniforms with much scarlet piping could make them and feeling peculiarly important as this was their first essay in new years callmaking brief was their stay for they planned to visit every friend they had and rose could not help laughing at the droll mixture of manly dignity and boyish delight with which they drove off in their own carriage both as erect as ramrods arms folded and caps stuck at exactly the same angle on each blond head  here comes the other couple steve in full feather with a big bouquet for kitty and poor mac looking like a gentleman and feeling like a martyr im sure said rose watching one carriage turn in as the other turned out of the great gate with its arch of holly ivy and evergreen  here he is ive got him in tow for the day and want you to cheer him up with a word of praise for he came without a struggle though planning to bolt somewhere with uncle cried steve falling back to display his brother who came in looking remarkably well in his state and festival array for polishing had begun to tell  a happy new year aunty same to you cousin and best wishes for as many more as you deserve said mac heeding steve no more than if he had been a fly as he gave the old lady a hearty kiss and offered rose a quaint little nosegay of pansies  heartsease do you think i need it she asked looking up with sudden sobriety  we all do could i give you anything better on a day like this  no thank you very much and a sudden dew came to roses eyes for though often blunt in speech when mac did do a tender thing it always touched her because he seemed to understand her moods so well  has archie been here he said he shouldnt go anywhere else but i hope you talked that nonsense out of his head said steve settling his tie before the mirror  yes dear he came but looked so out of spirits i really felt reproached rose cheered him up a little but i dont believe he will feel equal to making calls and i hope he wont for his face tells the whole story much too plainly answered aunty plenty rustling about her bountiful table in her richest black silk with all her old lace on  oh hell get over it in a month or two and phebe will soon find another lover so dont be worried about him aunty said steve with the air of a man who knew all about that sort of thing  if archie does forget i shall despise him and i know phebe wont try to find another lover though shell probably have them she is so sweet and good cried rose indignantly for having taken the pair under her protection she defended them valiantly  then youd have arch hope against hope and never give up would you asked mac putting on his glasses to survey the thin boots which were his especial abomination  yes i would for a lover is not worth having if hes not in earnest  exactly so youd like them to wait and work and keep on loving till they made you relent or plainly proved that it was no use  if they were good as well as constant i think i should relent in time  ill mention that to pemberton for he seemed to be hit the hardest and a ray of hope will do him good whether he is equal to the ten years wait or not put in steve who liked to rally rose about her lovers  ill never forgive you if you say a word to anyone it is only macs odd way of asking questions and i ought not to answer them you will talk about such things and i cant stop you but i dont like it said rose much annoyed  poor little penelope she shall not be teased about her suitors but left in peace till her ulysses comes home said mac sitting down to read the mottoes sticking out of certain fanciful bonbons on the table  it is this fuss about archie which has demoralized us all even the owl waked up and hasnt got over the excitement yet you see hes had no experience poor fellow so he doesnt know how to behave observed steve regarding his bouquet with tender interest  thats true and i asked for information because i may be in love myself someday and all this will be useful dont you see  you in love and steve could not restrain a laugh at the idea of the bookworm a slave to the tender passion  quite unruffled mac leaned his chin in both hands regarding them with a meditative eye as he answered in his whimsical way why not i intend to study love as well as medicine for it is one of the most mysterious and remarkable diseases that afflict mankind and the best way to understand it is to have it i may catch it someday and then i should like to know how to treat and cure it  if you take it as badly as you did measles and whooping cough it will go hard with you old fellow said steve much amused with the fancy  i want it to no great experience comes or goes easily and this is the greatest we can know i believe except death  something in macs quiet tone and thoughtful eyes made rose look at him in surprise for she had never heard him speak in that way before steve also stared for an instant equally amazed then said below his breath with an air of mock anxiety hes been catching something at the hospital typhoid probably and is beginning to wander ill take him quietly away before he gets any wilder come old lunatic we must be off  dont be alarmed im all right and much obliged for your advice for i fancy i shall be a desperate lover when my time comes if it ever does you dont think it impossible do you and mac put the question so soberly that there was a general smile  certainly not youll be a regular douglas tender and true answered rose wondering what queer question would come next  thank you the fact is ive been with archie so much in his trouble lately that ive gotten interested in this matter and very naturally want to investigate the subject as every rational man must sooner or later thats all now steve im ready and mac got up as if the lesson was over  my dear that boy is either a fool or a genius and im sure i should be glad to know which said aunt plenty putting her bonbons to rights with a puzzled shake of her best cap  time will show but i incline to think that he is not a fool by any means answered the girl pulling a cluster of white roses out of her bosom to make room for the pansies though they did not suit the blue gown half so well  just then aunt jessie came in to help them receive with jamie to make himself generally useful which he proceeded to do by hovering around the table like a fly about a honey pot when not flattening his nose against the windowpanes to announce excitedly heres another man coming up the drive  charlie arrived next in his most sunshiny humor for anything social and festive was his delight and when in this mood the prince was quite irresistible he brought a pretty bracelet for rose and was graciously allowed to put it on while she chid him gently for his extravagance  i am only following your example for you know nothing is too good for those we love and giving away is the best thing one can do he retorted quoting words of her own  i wish you would follow my example in some other things as well as you do in this said rose soberly as aunt plenty called him to come and see if the punch was right  must conform to the customs of society auntys heart would be broken if we did not drink her health in the good old fashion but dont be alarmed ive a strong head of my own and thats lucky for i shall need it before i get through laughed charlie showing a long list as he turned away to gratify the old lady with all sorts of merry and affectionate compliments as the glasses touched  rose did feel rather alarmed for if he drank the health of all the owners of those names she felt sure that charlie would need a very strong head indeed it was hard to say anything then and there without seeming disrespect to aunt plenty yet she longed to remind her cousin of the example she tried to set him in this respect for rose never touched wine and the boys knew it she was thoughtfully turning the bracelet with its pretty device of turquoise forgetmenots when the giver came back to her still bubbling over with good spirits  dear little saint you look as if youd like to smash all the punch bowls in the city and save us jolly young fellows from tomorrows headache  i should for such headaches sometimes end in heartaches im afraid dear charlie dont be angry but you know better than i that this is a dangerous day for such as you so do be careful for my sake she added with an unwonted touch of tenderness in her voice for looking at the gallant figure before her it was impossible to repress the womanly longing to keep it always as brave and blithe as now  charlie saw that new softness in the eyes that never looked unkindly on him fancied that it meant more than it did and with a sudden fervor in his own voice answered quickly my darling i will  the glow which had risen to his face was reflected in hers for at that moment it seemed as if it would be possible to love this cousin who was so willing to be led by her and so much needed some helpful influence to make a noble man of him the thought came and went like a flash but gave her a quick heartthrob as if the old affection was trembling on the verge of some warmer sentiment and left her with a sense of responsibility never felt before obeying the impulse she said with a pretty blending of earnestness and playfulness if i wear the bracelet to remember you by you must wear this to remind you of your promise  and you whispered charlie bending his head to kiss the hands that put a little white rose in his buttonhole  just at that most interesting moment they became aware of an arrival in the front drawing room whither aunt plenty had discreetly retired rose felt grateful for the interruption because not being at all sure of the state of her heart as yet she was afraid of letting a sudden impulse lead her too far but charlie conscious that a very propitious instant had been spoiled regarded the newcomer with anything but a benignant expression of countenance and whispering goodbye my rose i shall look in this evening to see how you are after the fatigues of the day he went away with such a cool nod to poor fun see that the amiable asiatic thought he must have mortally offended him  rose had little leisure to analyze the new emotions of which she was conscious for mr tokio came up at once to make his compliments with a comical mingling of chinese courtesy and american awkwardness and before he had got his hat on jamie shouted with admiring energy heres another oh such a swell  they now came thick and fast for many hours and the ladies stood bravely at their posts till late into the evening then aunt jessie went home escorted by a very sleepy little son and aunt plenty retired to bed used up dr alec had returned in good season for his friends were not fashionable ones but aunt myra had sent up for him in hot haste and he had goodnaturedly obeyed the summons in fact he was quite used to them now for mrs myra having tried a variety of dangerous diseases had finally decided upon heart complaint as the one most likely to keep her friends in a chronic state of anxiety and was continually sending word that she was dying one gets used to palpitations as well as everything else so the doctor felt no alarm but always went and prescribed some harmless remedy with the most amiable sobriety and patience  rose was tired but not sleepy and wanted to think over several things so instead of going to bed she sat down before the open fire in the study to wait for her uncle and perhaps charlie though she did not expect him so late  aunt myras palpitations must have been unusually severe for the clock struck twelve before dr alec came and rose was preparing to end her reverie when the sound of someone fumbling at the hall door made her jump up saying to herself poor man his hands are so cold he cant get his latchkey in is that you uncle she added running to admit him for jane was slow and the night as bitter as it was brilliant  a voice answered yes and as the door swung open in walked not dr alec but charlie who immediately took one of the hall chairs and sat there with his hat on rubbing his gloveless hands and blinking as if the light dazzled him as he said in a rapid abrupt sort of tone i told you id come left the fellows keeping it up gloriously going to see the old year out you know but i promised never break my word and here i am angel in blue did you slay your thousands  hush the waiters are still about come to the study fire and warm yourself you must be frozen said rose going before to roll up the easy chair  not at all never warmer looks very comfortable though wheres uncle asked charlie following with his hat still on his hands in his pockets and his eye fixed steadily on the bright head in front of him  aunt myra sent for him and i was waiting up to see how she was answered rose busily mending the fire  charlie laughed and sat down upon a corner of the library table poor old soul what a pity she doesnt die before he is quite worn out a little too much ether some of these times would send her off quite comfortably you know  dont speak in that way uncle says imaginary troubles are often as hard to bear as real ones said rose turning around displeased  till now she had not fairly looked at him for recollections of the morning made her a little shy his attitude and appearance surprised her as much as his words and the quick change in her face seemed to remind him of his manners getting up he hastily took off his hat and stood looking at her with a curiously fixed yet absent look as he said in the same rapid abrupt way as if when once started he found it hard to stop i beg pardon only joking very bad taste i know and wont do it again the heat of the room makes me a little dizzy and i think i got a chill coming out it is cold i am frozen i daresay though i drove like the devil  not that bad horse of yours i hope i know it is dangerous so late and alone said rose shrinking behind the big chair as charlie approached the fire carefully avoiding a footstool in his way  danger is exciting thats why i like it no man ever called me a coward let him try it once i never give in and that horse shall not conquer me ill break his neck if he breaks my spirit doing it no i dont mean that never mind its all right and charlie laughed in a way that troubled her because there was no mirth in it  have you had a pleasant day asked rose looking at him intently as he stood pondering over the cigar and match which he held as if doubtful which to strike and which to smoke  day oh yes capital about two thousand calls and a nice little supper at the club randal cant sing any more than a crow but i left him with a glass of champagne upside down trying to give them my old favorite  tis better to laugh than be sighing  and charlie burst forth in that bacchanalian melody at the top of his voice waving an allumette holder over his head to represent randals inverted wineglass  hush youll wake aunty cried rose in a tone so commanding that he broke off in the middle of a roulade to stare at her with a blank look as he said apologetically i was merely showing how it should be done dont be angry dearest look at me as you did this morning and ill swear never to sing another note if you say so im only a little gay we drank your health handsomely and they all congratulated me told em it wasnt out yet stop though i didnt mean to mention that no matter im always in a scrape but you always forgive me in the sweetest way do it now and dont be angry little darling and dropping the vase he went toward her with a sudden excitement that made her shrink behind the chair  she was not angry but shocked and frightened for she knew now what the matter was and grew so pale he saw it and asked pardon before she could utter a rebuke  well talk of that tomorrow it is very late go home now please before uncle comes she said trying to speak naturally yet betraying her distress by the tremor of her voice and the sad anxiety in her eyes  yes yes i will go you are tired ill make it all right tomorrow and as if the sound of his uncles name steadied him for an instant charlie made for the door with an unevenness of gait which would have told the shameful truth if his words had not already done so before he reached it however the sound of wheels arrested him and leaning against the wall he listened with a look of dismay mingled with amusement creeping over his face brutus has bolted now i am in a fix cant walk home with this horrid dizziness in my head its the cold rose nothing else i do assure you and a chill yes a chill see here let one of those fellows there lend me an arm no use to go after that brute wont mother be frightened though when he gets home and with that empty laugh again he fumbled for the door handle  no no dont let them see you dont let anyone know stay here till uncle comes and hell take care of you oh charlie how could you do it how could you when you promised and forgetting fear in the sudden sense of shame and anguish that came over her rose ran to him caught his hand from the lock and turned the key then as if she could not bear to see him standing there with that vacant smile on his lips she dropped into a chair and covered up her face  the cry the act and more than all the sight of the bowed head would have sobered poor charlie if it had not been too late he looked about the room with a vague despairing look as if to find reason fast slipping from his control but heat and cold excitement and reckless pledging of many healths had done their work too well to make instant sobriety possible and owning his defeat with a groan he turned away and threw himself facedownward on the sofa one of the saddest sights the new year looked upon as it came in  as she sat there with hidden eyes rose felt that something dear to her was dead forever the ideal which all women cherish look for and too often think they have found when love glorifies a mortal man is hard to give up especially when it comes in the likeness of the first lover who touches a young girls heart rose had just begun to feel that perhaps this cousin despite his faults might yet become the hero that he sometimes looked and the thought that she might be his inspiration was growing sweet to her although she had not entertained it until very lately alas how short the tender dream had been how rude the awakening how impossible it would be ever again to surround that fallen figure with all the romance of an innocent fancy or gift it with the high attributes beloved by a noble nature  breathing heavily in the sudden sleep that kindly brought a brief oblivion of himself he lay with flushed cheeks disordered hair and at his feet the little rose that never would be fresh and fair again a pitiful contrast now to the brave blithe young man who went so gaily out that morning to be so ignominiously overthrown at night  many girls would have made light of a trespass so readily forgiven by the world but rose had not yet learned to offer temptation with a smile and shut her eyes to the weakness that makes a man a brute it always grieved or disgusted her to see it in others and now it was very terrible to have it brought so near not in its worst form by any means but bad enough to wring her heart with shame and sorrow and fill her mind with dark forebodings for the future so she could only sit mourning for the charlie that might have been while watching the charlie that was with an ache in her heart which found no relief till putting her hands there as if to ease the pain they touched the pansies faded but still showing gold among the somber purple and then two great tears dropped on them as she sighed ah me i do need heartsease sooner than i thought  her uncles step made her spring up and unlock the door showing him such an altered face that he stopped short ejaculating in dismay good heavens child whats the matter adding as she pointed to the sofa in pathetic silence is he hurt ill dead  no uncle he is she could not utter the ugly word but whispered with a sob in her throat be kind to him and fled away to her own room feeling as if a great disgrace had fallen on the house     chapter 10 the sad and sober part  how will he look what will he say can anything make us forget and be happy again were the first questions rose asked herself as soon as she woke from the brief sleep which followed a long sad vigil it seemed as if the whole world must be changed because a trouble darkened it for her she was too young yet to know how possible it is to forgive much greater sins than this forget far heavier disappointments outlive higher hopes and bury loves compared to which hers was but a girlish fancy she wished it had not been so bright a day wondered how her birds could sing with such shrill gaiety put no ribbon in her hair and said as she looked at the reflection of her own tired face in the glass poor thing you thought the new leaf would have something pleasant on it the story has been very sweet and easy to read so far but the sad and sober part is coming now  a tap at the door reminded her that in spite of her afflictions breakfast must be eaten and the sudden thought that charlie might still be in the house made her hurry to the door to find dr alec waiting for her with his morning smile she drew him in and whispered anxiously as if someone lay dangerously ill nearby is he better uncle tell me all about it i can bear it now  some men would have smiled at her innocent distress and told her this was only what was to be expected and endured but dr alec believed in the pure instincts that make youth beautiful desired to keep them true and hoped his girl would never learn to look unmoved by pain and pity upon any human being vanquished by a vice no matter how trivial it seemed how venial it was held so his face grew grave though his voice was cheerful as he answered all right i daresay by this time for sleep is the best medicine in such cases i took him home last night and no one knows he came but you and i  no one ever shall how did you do it uncle  just slipped out of the long study window and got him cannily off for the air and motion after a dash of cold water brought him around and he was glad to be safely landed at home his rooms are below you know so no one was disturbed and i left him sleeping nicely  thank you so much sighed rose and brutus werent they frightened when he got back alone  not at all the sagacious beast went quietly to the stable and the sleepy groom asked no questions for charlie often sends the horse round by himself when it is late or stormy rest easy dear no eye but ours saw the poor lad come and go and well forgive it for loves sake  yes but not forget it i never can and he will never be again to me the charlie ive been so proud and fond of all these years oh uncle such a pity such a pity  dont break your tender heart about it child for it is not incurable thank god i dont make light of it but i am sure that under better influences charlie will redeem himself because his impulses are good and this his only vice i can hardly blame him for what he is because his mother did the harm i declare to you rose i sometimes feel as if i must break out against that woman and thunder in her ears that she is ruining the immortal soul for which she is responsible to heaven  dr alec seldom spoke in this way and when he did it was rather awful for his indignation was of the righteous sort and such thunder often rouses up a drowsy soul when sunshine has no effect rose liked it and sincerely wished aunt clara had been there to get the benefit of the outbreak for she needed just such an awakening from the selfindulgent dream in which she lived  do it and save charlie before it is too late she cried kindling herself as she watched him for he looked like a roused lion as he walked about the room with his hand clenched and a spark in his eye evidently in desperate earnest and ready to do almost anything  will you help he asked stopping suddenly with a look that made her stand up straight and strong as she answered with an eager voice i will  then dont love him yet  that startled her but she asked steadily though her heart began to beat and her color to come why not  firstly because no woman should give her happiness into the keeping of a man without fixed principles secondly because the hope of being worthy of you will help him more than any prayers or preaching of mine thirdly because it will need all our wit and patience to undo the work of nearly four and twenty years you understand what i mean  yes sir  can you say no when he asks you to say yes and wait a little for your happiness  i can  and will you  i will  then im satisfied and a great weight taken off my heart i cant help seeing what goes on or trembling when i think of you setting sail with no better pilot than poor charlie now you answer as i hoped you would and i am proud of my girl  they had been standing with the width of the room between them dr alec looking very much like a commander issuing orders rose like a welldrilled private obediently receiving them and both wore the air of soldiers getting ready for a battle with the bracing of nerves and quickening of the blood brave souls feel as they put on their armor at the last words he went to her brushed back the hair and kissed her on the forehead with a tender sort of gravity and a look that made her feel as if he had endowed her with the victoria cross for courage on the field  no more was said then for aunt plenty called them down and the days duties began but that brief talk showed rose what to do and fitted her to do it for it set her to thinking of the duty one owes ones self in loving as in all the other great passions or experiences which make or mar a life  she had plenty of time for quiet meditation that day because everyone was resting after yesterdays festivity and she sat in her little room planning out a new year so full of good works grand successes and beautiful romances that if it could have been realized the millennium would have begun it was a great comfort to her however and lightened the long hours haunted by a secret desire to know when charlie would come and a secret fear of the first meeting she was sure he would be bowed down with humiliation and repentance and a struggle took place in her mind between the pity she could not help feeling and the disapprobation she ought to show she decided to be gentle but very frank to reprove but also to console and to try to improve the softened moment by inspiring the culprit with a wish for all the virtues which make a perfect man  the fond delusion grew quite absorbing and her mind was full of it as she sat watching the sun set from her western window and admiring with dreamy eyes the fine effect of the distant hills clear and dark against a daffodil sky when the bang of a door made her sit suddenly erect in her low chair and say with a catch in her breath hes coming i must remember what i promised uncle and be very firm  usually charlie announced his approach with music of some sort now he neither whistled hummed nor sang but came so quietly rose was sure that he dreaded this meeting as much as she did and compassionating his natural confusion did not look around as the steps drew near she thought perhaps he would go down upon his knees as he used to after a boyish offense but hoped not for too much humility distressed her so she waited for the first demonstration anxiously  it was rather a shock when it came however for a great nosegay dropped into her lap and a voice bold and gay as usual said lightly here she is as pretty and pensive as you please is the world hollow our doll stuffed with sawdust and do we want to go into a nunnery today cousin  rose was so taken aback by this unexpected coolness that the flowers lay unnoticed as she looked up with a face so full of surprise reproach and something like shame that it was impossible to mistake its meaning charlie did not and had the grace to redden deeply and his eyes fell as he said quickly though in the same light tone i humbly apologize for coming so late last night dont be hard upon me cousin you know america expects every man to do his duty on new years day  i am tired of forgiving you make and break promises as easily as you did years ago and i shall never ask you for another answered rose putting the bouquet away for the apology did not satisfy her and she would not be bribed to silence  but my dear girl you are so very exacting so peculiar in your notions and so angry about trifles that a poor fellow cant please you try as he will began charlie ill at ease but too proud to show half the penitence he felt not so much for the fault as for her discovery of it  i am not angry i am grieved and disappointed for i expect every man to do his duty in another way and keep his word to the uttermost as i try to do if that is exacting im sorry and wont trouble you with my oldfashioned notions anymore  bless my soul what a rout about nothing i own that i forgot i know i acted like a fool and i beg pardon what more can i do  act like a man and never let me be so terribly ashamed of you again as i was last night and rose gave a little shiver as she thought of it  that involuntary act hurt charlie more than her words and it was his turn now to feel terribly ashamed for the events of the previous evening were very hazy in his mind and fear magnified them greatly turning sharply away he went and stood by the fire quite at a loss how to make his peace this time because rose was so unlike herself usually a word of excuse sufficed and she seemed glad to pardon and forget now though very quiet there was something almost stern about her that surprised and daunted him for how could he know that all the while her pitiful heart was pleading for him and the very effort to control it made her a little hard and cold  as he stood there restlessly fingering the ornaments upon the chimneypiece his eye brightened suddenly and taking up the pretty bracelet lying there he went slowly back to her saying in a tone that was humble and serious enough now i will act like a man and you shall never be ashamed again only be kind to me let me put this on and promise afresh this time i swear ill keep it wont you trust me rose  it was very hard to resist the pleading voice and eyes for this humility was dangerous and but for uncle alec rose would have answered yes the blue forgetmenots reminded her of her own promise and she kept it with difficulty now to be glad always afterward putting back the offered trinket with a gentle touch she said firmly though she dared not look up into the anxious face bending toward her no charlie i cant wear it my hands must be free if im to help you as i ought i will be kind i will trust you but dont swear anything only try to resist temptation and well all stand by you  charlie did not like that and lost the ground he had gained by saying impetuously i dont want anyone but you to stand by me and i must be sure you wont desert me else while im mortifying soul and body to please you some stranger will come and steal your heart away from me i couldnt bear that so i give you fair warning in such a case ill break the bargain and go straight to the devil  the last sentence spoiled it all for it was both masterful and defiant rose had the campbell spirit in her though it seldom showed as yet she valued her liberty more than any love offered her and she resented the authority he assumed too soon resented it all the more warmly because of the effort she was making to reinstate her hero who would insist on being a very faulty and ungrateful man she rose straight out of her chair saying with a look and tone which rather startled her hearer and convinced him that she was no longer a tenderhearted child but a woman with a will of her own and a spirit as proud and fiery as any of her race my heart is my own to dispose of as i please dont shut yourself out of it by presuming too much for you have no claim on me but that of cousinship and you never will have unless you earn it remember that and neither threaten nor defy me anymore  for a minute it was doubtful whether charlie would answer this flash with another and a general explosion ensue or wisely quench the flame with the mild answer which turneth away wrath he chose the latter course and made it very effective by throwing himself down before his offended goddess as he had often done in jest this time it was not acting but serious earnest and there was real passion in his voice as he caught roses dress in both hands saying eagerly no no dont shut your heart against me or i shall turn desperate im not half good enough for such a saint as you but you can do what you will with me i only need a motive to make a man of me and where can i find a stronger one than in trying to keep your love  it is not yours yet began rose much moved though all the while she felt as if she were on a stage and had a part to play for charlie had made life so like a melodrama that it was hard for him to be quite simple even when most sincere  let me earn it then show me how and ill do anything for you are my good angel rose and if you cast me off i feel as if i shouldnt care how soon there was an end of me cried charlie getting tragic in his earnestness and putting both arms around her as if his only safety lay in clinging to this beloved fellow creature  behind footlights it would have been irresistible but somehow it did not touch the one spectator though she had neither time nor skill to discover why for all their ardor the words did not ring quite true despite the grace of the attitude she would have liked him better manfully erect upon his feet and though the gesture was full of tenderness a subtle instinct made her shrink away as she said with a composure that surprised herself even more than it did him please dont no i will promise nothing yet for i must respect the man i love  that brought charlie to his feet pale with something deeper than anger for the recoil told him more plainly than the words how much he had fallen in her regard since yesterday the memory of the happy moment when she gave the rose with that new softness in her eyes the shy color the sweet for my sake came back with sudden vividness contrasting sharply with the now averted face the hand outstretched to put him back the shrinking figure and in that instants silence poor charlie realized what he had lost for a girls first thought of love is as delicate a thing as the rosy morning glory which a breath of air can shatter only a hint of evil only an hours debasement for him a moments glimpse for her of the coarser pleasures men know and the innocent heart just opening to bless and to be blessed closed again like a sensitive plant and shut him out perhaps forever  the consciousness of this turned him pale with fear for his love was deeper than she knew and he proved this when he said in a tone so full of mingled pain and patience that it touched her to the heart you shall respect me if i can make you and when ive earned it may i hope for something more  she looked up then saw in his face the noble shame the humble sort of courage that shows repentance to be genuine and gives promise of success and with a hopeful smile that was a cordial to him answered heartily you may  bless you for that ill make no promises ill ask for none only trust me rose and while you treat me like a cousin remember that no matter how many lovers you may have youll never be to any of them as dear as you are to me  a traitorous break in his voice warned charlie to stop there and with no other goodbye he very wisely went away leaving rose to put the neglected flowers into water with remorseful care and lay away the bracelet saying to herself ill never wear it till i feel as i did before then he shall put it on and ill say yes     chapter 11 small temptations  oh rose ive got something so exciting to tell you cried kitty van tassel skipping into the carriage next morning when her friend called for her to go shopping  kitty always did have some perfectly thrilling communication to make and rose had learned to take them quietly but the next demonstration was a new one for regardless alike of curious observers outside and disordered hats within kitty caught rose around the neck exclaiming in a rapturous whisper my dearest creature im engaged  im so glad of course it is steve  dear fellow he did it last night in the nicest way and mama is so delighted now what shall i be married in and kitty composed herself with a face full of the deepest anxiety  how can you talk of that so soon why kit you unromantic girl you ought to be thinking of your lover and not your clothes said rose amused yet rather scandalized at such want of sentiment  i am thinking of my lover for he says he will not have a long engagement so i must begin to think about the most important things at once mustnt i  ah he wants to be sure of you for you are such a slippery creature he is afraid youll treat him as you did poor jackson and the rest interrupted rose shaking her finger at her prospective cousin who had tried this pastime twice before and was rather proud than otherwise of her brief engagements  you neednt scold for i know im right and when youve been in society as long as i have youll find that the only way to really know a man is to be engaged to him while they want you they are all devotion but when they think theyve got you then you find out what wretches they are answered kitty with an air of worldly wisdom which contrasted oddly with her youthful face and giddy manners  a sad prospect for poor steve unless i give him a hint to look well to his ways  oh my dear child im sure of him for my experience has made me very sharp and im convinced i can manage him without a bit of trouble weve known each other for ages steve was twenty and kitty eighteen and always been the best of friends besides he is quite my ideal man i never could bear big hands and feet and his are simply adorable then hes the best dancer i know and dresses in perfect taste i really do believe i fell in love with his pocket handkerchiefs first they were so enchanting i couldnt resist laughed kitty pulling a large one out of her pocket and burying her little nose in the folds which shed a delicious fragrance upon the air  now that looks promising and i begin to think you have got a little sentiment after all said rose well pleased for the merry brown eyes had softened suddenly and a quick color came up in kittys cheek as she answered still half hiding her face in the beloved handkerchief of course i have lots of it only im ashamed to show it to most people because its the style to take everything in the most nonchalant way my gracious rose youd have thought me a romantic goose last night while steve proposed in the back parlor for i actually cried he was so dreadfully in earnest when i pretended that i didnt care for him and so very dear and nice when i told the truth i didnt know he had it in him but he came out delightfully and never cared a particle though i dropped tears all over his lovely shirtfront wasnt that good of him for you know he hates his things to be mussed  hes a true campbell and has got a good warm heart of his own under those fine fronts of his aunt jane doesnt believe in sentiment so he has been trained never to show any but it is there and you must encourage him to let it out not foolishly but in a way to make him more manly and serious  i will if i can for though i wouldnt own this to everybody i like it in him very much and feel as if steve and i should get on beautifully here we are now be sure not to breathe a word if we meet anyone i want it to be a profound secret for a week at least added kitty whisking her handkerchief out of sight as the carriage stopped before the fashionable store they were about to visit  rose promised with a smile for kittys face betrayed her without words so full was it of the happiness which few eyes fail to understand whenever they see it  just a glance at the silks you ask my opinion about white ones and ill look at the colors mama says satin but that is out now and ive set my heart on the heaviest corded thing i can find whispered kitty as they went rustling by the long counters strewn with all that could delight the feminine eye and tempt the feminine pocket  isnt that opal the loveliest thing you ever saw im afraid im too dark to wear it but it would just suit you youll need a variety you know added kitty in a significant aside as rose stood among the white silks while her companion affected great interest in the delicate hues laid before her  but i have a variety now and dont need a new dress of any sort  no matter get it else it will be gone youve worn all yours several times already and must have a new one whether you need it or not dear me if i had as much pocket money as you have id come out in a fresh toilet at every party i went to answered kitty casting an envious eye upon the rainbow piles before her  the quickwitted shopman saw that a wedding was afoot for when two pretty girls whisper smile and blush over their shopping clerks scent bridal finery and a transient gleam of interest brightens their imperturbable countenances and lends a brief energy to languid voices weary with crying cash gathering both silks with a practiced turn of the hand he held them up for inspection detecting at a glance which was the brideelect and which the friend for kitty fell back to study the effect of silvery white folds with an absorbing interest impossible to mistake while rose sat looking at the opal as if she scarcely heard a bland voice saying with the rustle of silk so dear to girlish ears a superb thing just opened all the rage in paris very rare shade trying to most as the lady says but quite perfect for a blonde  rose was not listening to those words but to others which aunt clara had lately uttered laughed at then but thought over more than once since  im tired of hearing people wonder why miss campbell does not dress more simplicity is all very well for schoolgirls and women who cant afford anything better but you can and you really ought your things are pretty enough in their way and i rather like you to have a style of your own but it looks odd and people will think you are mean if you dont make more show besides you dont do justice to your beauty which would be both peculiar and striking if youd devote your mind to getting up ravishing costumes  much more to the same effect did her aunt say discussing the subject quite artistically and unconsciously appealing to several of roses ruling passions one was a love for the delicate fabrics colors and ornaments which refined tastes enjoy and whose costliness keeps them from ever growing common another her strong desire to please the eyes of those she cared for and gratify their wishes in the smallest matter if she could and last but not least the natural desire of a young and pretty woman to enhance the beauty which she so soon discovers to be her most potent charm for the other sex her passport to a high place among her maiden peers  she had thought seriously of surprising and delighting everyone by appearing in a costume which should do justice to the loveliness which was so modest that it was apt to forget itself in admiring others what girls call a ravishing dress such as she could imagine and easily procure by the magic of the fortunatus purse in her pocket she had planned it all the shimmer of pale silk through lace like woven frostwork ornaments of some classic pattern and all the dainty accessories as perfect as time taste and money could make them  she knew that uncle alecs healthful training had given her a figure that could venture on any fashion and nature blessed her with a complexion that defied all hues so it was little wonder that she felt a strong desire to use these gifts not for the pleasure of display but to seem fair in the eyes that seldom looked at her without a tender sort of admiration all the more winning when no words marred the involuntary homage women love  these thoughts were busy in roses mind as she sat looking at the lovely silk and wondering what charlie would say if she should some night burst upon him in a pale rosy cloud like the aurora to whom he often likened her she knew it would please him very much and she longed to do all she honestly could to gratify the poor fellow for her tender heart already felt some remorseful pangs remembering how severe she had been the night before she could not revoke her words because she meant them every one but she might be kind and show that she did not wholly shut him out from her regard by asking him to go with her to kittys ball and gratify his artistic taste by a lovely costume a very girlish but kindly plan for that ball was to be the last of her frivolities so she wanted it to be a pleasant one and felt that being friends with charlie would add much to her enjoyment  this idea made her fingers tighten on the gleaming fabric so temptingly upheld and she was about to take it when if ye please sir would ye kindly tell me where id be finding the flannel place said a voice behind her and glancing up she saw a meek little irishwoman looking quite lost and out of place among the luxuries around her  downstairs turn to the left was the clerks hasty reply with a vague wave of the hand which left the inquirer more in the dark than ever  rose saw the womans perplexity and said kindly ill show you this way  im ashamed to be throublin ye miss but its strange i am in it and wouldnt be comin here at all at all barrin they tould me id get the bit im wantin chaper in this big shop than the little ones more becomin the like o me explained the little woman humbly  rose looked again as she led the way through a welldressed crowd of busy shoppers and something in the anxious tired face under the old woolen hood the bare purple hands holding fast a meager wallet and a faded scrap of the dotted flannel little childrens frocks are so often made of touched the generous heart that never could see want without an impulse to relieve it she had meant only to point the way but following a new impulse she went on listening to the poor souls motherly prattle about me baby and the throuble it was to find clothes for the growin childer when me man is out av work and the bit and sup inconvaynient these hard times as they descended to that darksome lower world where necessities take refuge when luxuries crowd them out from the gayer place above  the presence of a lady made mrs sullivans shopping very easy now and her one poor bit of flannel grew miraculously into yards of several colors since the shabby purse was no lighter when she went away wiping her eyes on the corner of a big brown bundle a very little thing and no one saw it but a woodenfaced clerk who never told yet it did rose good and sent her up into the light again with a sober face thinking selfreproachfully what right have i to more gay gowns when some poor babies have none or to spend time making myself fine while there is so much bitter want in the world  nevertheless the pretty things were just as tempting as ever and she yearned for the opal silk with a renewed yearning when she got back it is not certain that it would not have been bought in spite of her better self if a good angel in the likeness of a stout lady with silvery curls about the benevolent face enshrined in a plain bonnet had not accosted her as she joined kitty still brooding over the wedding gowns  i waited a moment for you my dear because im in haste and very glad to save myself a journey or a note began the newcomer in a low tone as rose shook hands with the most affectionate respect you know the great box factory was burned a day or two ago and over a hundred girls thrown out of work some were hurt and are in the hospital many have no homes to go to and nearly all need temporary help of some sort weve had so many calls this winter i hardly know which way to turn for want is pressing and ive had my finger in so many purses im almost ashamed to ask again any little contribution ah thank you i was sure you wouldnt fail me my good child and mrs gardener warmly pressed the hand that went so quickly into the little portemonnaie and came out so generously filled  let me know how else i can help and thank you very much for allowing me to have a share in your good works said rose forgetting all about gay gowns as she watched the black bonnet go briskly away with an approving smile on the fine old face inside it  you extravagant thing how could you give so much whispered kitty whose curious eye had seen three figures on the single bill which had so rapidly changed hands  i believe if mrs gardener asked me for my head i should give it to her answered rose lightly then turning to the silks she asked which have you decided upon the yellow white or the blue the corded or the striped  ive decided nothing except that you are to have the pink and wear it at my ahem ball said kitty who had made up her mind but could not give her orders till mama had been consulted  no i cant afford it just yet i never overstep my allowance and i shall have to if i get any more finery come we ought not to waste time here if you have all the patterns you want and rose walked quickly away glad that it was out of her power to break through two resolutions which hitherto had been faithfully kept one to dress simply for examples sake the other not to be extravagant for charitys sake  as rosamond had her day of misfortunes so this seemed to be one of small temptations to rose after she had set kitty down at home and been to see her new houses she drove about doing various errands for the aunts and while waiting in the carriage for the execution of an order young pemberton came by  as steve said this gentleman had been hard hit and still hovered mothlike about the forbidden light being the most eligible parti of the season his regard was considered a distinction to be proud of and rose had been well scolded by aunt clara for refusing so honorable a mate the girl liked him and he was the suitor of whom she had spoken so respectfully to dr alec because he had no need of the heiress and had sincerely loved rose he had been away and she hoped had gotten over his disappointment as happily as the rest but now when he saw her and came hurrying up so hungry for a word she felt that he had not forgotten and was too kind to chill him with the bow which plainly says dont stop  a personable youth was pemberton and had brought with him from the wilds of canada a sablelined overcoat which was the envy of every masculine and the admiration of every feminine friend he had and as he stood at her carriage window rose knew that this luxurious garment and its stalwart wearer were objects of interest to the passersby it chanced that the tide of shoppers flowed in that direction and as she chatted familiar faces often passed with glances smiles and nods of varying curiosity significance and wonder  she could not help feeling a certain satisfaction in giving him a moments pleasure since she could do no more but it was not that amiable desire alone which made her ignore the neat white parcels which the druggists boy deposited on the front seat and kept her lingering a little longer to enjoy one of the small triumphs which girls often risk more than a cold in the head to display the sight of several snowflakes on the broad shoulders which partially obstructed her view as well as the rapidly increasing animation of pembertons chat reminded her that it was high time to go  i mustnt keep you it is beginning to storm she said taking up her muff much to old jacobs satisfaction for small talk is not exciting to a hungry man whose nose feels like an icicle  is it i thought the sun was shining and the absorbed gentleman turned to the outer world with visible reluctance for it looked very warm and cozy in the redlined carriage  wise people say we must carry our sunshine with us answered rose taking refuge in commonplaces for the face at the window grew pensive suddenly as he answered with a longing look i wish i could then smiling gratefully he added thank you for giving me a little of yours  you are very welcome and rose offered him her hand while her eyes mutely asked pardon for withholding her leave to keep it  he pressed it silently and shouldering the umbrella which he forgot to open turned away with an up again and take another expression which caused the soft eyes to follow him admiringly  i ought not to have kept him a minute longer than i could help for it wasnt all pity it was my foolish wish to show off and do as i liked for a minute to pay for being good about the gown oh me how weak and silly i am in spite of all my trying and miss campbell fell into a remorseful reverie which lasted till she got home  now young man what brought you out in this driving storm asked rose as jamie came stamping in that same afternoon  mama sent you a new book thought youd like it i dont mind your old storms replied the boy wrestling his way out of his coat and presenting a face as round and red and shiny as a wellpolished baldwin apple  much obliged it is just the day to enjoy it and i was longing for something nice to read said rose as jamie sat down upon the lower stair for a protracted struggle with his rubber boots  here you are then no yes i do believe ive forgotten it after all cried jamie slapping his pockets one after the other with a dismayed expression of countenance  never mind ill hunt up something else let me help you with those your hands are so cold and rose goodnaturedly gave a tug at the boots while jamie clutched the banisters murmuring somewhat incoherently as his legs flew up and down ill go back if you want me to im so sorry its very good of you im sure getting these horrid things on made me forget mother would make me wear em though i told her theyd stick like like gumdrops he added inspired by recollections of certain dire disappointments when the abovementioned sweetmeat melted in his pockets and refused to come out  now what shall we do asked rose when he was finally extricated since ive nothing to read i may as well play  ill teach you to pitch and toss you catch very well for a girl but you cant throw worth a cent replied jamie gamboling down the hall in his slippers and producing a ball from some of the mysterious receptacles in which boys have the art of storing rubbish enough to fill a peck measure  of course rose agreed and cheerfully risked getting her eyes blackened and her fingers bruised till her young receptor gratefully observed that it was no fun playing where you had to look out for windows and jars and things so id like that jolly book about captain nemo and the nautilus please  being gratified he spread himself upon the couch crossed his legs in the air and without another word dived twenty thousand leagues under the sea where he remained for two mortal hours to the general satisfaction of his relatives  bereft both of her unexpected playfellow and the much desired book rose went into the parlor there to discover a french novel which kitty had taken from a library and left in the carriage among the bundles settling herself in her favorite lounging chair she read as diligently as jamie while the wind howled and snow fell fast without  for an hour nothing disturbed the cozy quiet of the house for aunt plenty was napping upstairs and dr alec writing in his own sanctum at least rose thought so till his step made her hastily drop the book and look up with very much the expression she used to wear when caught in mischief years ago  did i startle you have a screen you are burning your face before this hot fire and dr alec pulled one forward  thank you uncle i didnt feel it and the color seemed to deepen in spite of the screen while the uneasy eyes fell upon the book in her lap  have you got the quarterly there i want to glance at an article in it if you can spare it for a moment he said leaning toward her with an inquiring glance  no sir i am reading and without mentioning the name rose put the book into his hand  the instant his eye fell on the title he understood the look she wore and knew what mischief she had been in he knit his brows then smiled because it was impossible to help it rose looked so consciencestricken in spite of her twenty years  how do you find it interesting  oh very i felt as if i was in another world and forgot all about this  not a very good world i fancy if you were afraid or ashamed to be found in it where did this come from asked dr alec surveying the book with great disfavor rose told him and added slowly i particularly wanted to read it and fancied i might because you did when it was so much talked about the winter we were in rome  i did read it to see if it was fit for you  and decided that it was not i suppose since you never gave it to me  yes  then i wont finish it but uncle i dont see why i should not added rose wistfully for she had reached the heart of the romance and found it wonderfully fascinating  you may not see but dont you feel why not asked dr alec gravely  rose leaned her flushed cheek on her hand and thought a minute then looked up and answered honestly yes i do but cant explain it except that i know something must be wrong because i blushed and started when you came in  exactly and the doctor gave an emphatic nod as if the symptoms pleased him  but i really dont see any harm in the book so far it is by a famous author wonderfully well written as you know and the characters so lifelike that i feel as if i should really meet them somewhere  i hope not ejaculated the doctor shutting the book quickly as if to keep the objectionable beings from escaping  rose laughed but persisted in her defense for she did want to finish the absorbing story yet would not without leave  i have read french novels before and you gave them to me not many to be sure but the best so i think i know what is good and shouldnt like this if it was harmful  her uncles answer was to reopen the volume and turn the leaves an instant as if to find a particular place then he put it into her hand saying quietly read a page or two aloud translating as you go you used to like that try it again  rose obeyed and went glibly down a page doing her best to give the sense in her purest english presently she went more slowly then skipped a sentence here and there and finally stopped short looking as if she needed a screen again  whats the matter asked her uncle who had been watching her with a serious eye  some phrases are untranslatable and it only spoils them to try they are not amiss in french but sound coarse and bad in our blunt english she said a little pettishly for she felt annoyed by her failure to prove the contested point  ah my dear if the fine phrases wont bear putting into honest english the thoughts they express wont bear putting into your innocent mind that chapter is the key to the whole book and if you had been led up or rather down to it artfully and artistically you might have read it to yourself without seeing how bad it is all the worse for the undeniable talent which hides the evil so subtly and makes the danger so delightful  he paused a moment then added with an anxious glance at the book over which she was still bending finish it if you choose only remember my girl that one may read at forty what is unsafe at twenty and that we never can be too careful what food we give that precious yet perilous thing called imagination  and taking his review he went away to look over a learned article which interested him much less than the workings of a young mind nearby  another long silence broken only by an occasional excited bounce from jamie when the sociable cuttlefish looked in at the windows or the nautilus scuttled a ship or two in its terrific course a bell rang and the doctor popped his head out to see if he was wanted it was only a message for aunt plenty and he was about to pop in again when his eye was caught by a square parcel on the slab  whats this he asked taking it up  rose wants me to leave it at kitty vans when i go i forgot to bring her book from mama so i shall go and get it as soon as ever ive done this replied jamie from his nest  as the volume in his hands was a corpulent one and jamie only a third of the way through dr alec thought roses prospect rather doubtful and slipping the parcel into his pocket he walked away saying with a satisfied air virtue doesnt always get rewarded but it shall be this time if i can do it  more than half an hour afterward rose woke from a little nap and found the various old favorites with which she had tried to solace herself replaced by the simple wholesome story promised by aunt jessie  good boy ill go and thank him she said half aloud jumping up wide awake and much pleased  but she did not go for just then she spied her uncle standing on the rug warming his hands with a generally fresh and breezy look about him which suggested a recent struggle with the elements  how did this come she asked suspiciously  a man brought it  this man oh uncle why did you take so much trouble just to gratify a wish of mine she cried taking both the cold hands in hers with a tenderly reproachful glance from the storm without to the ruddy face above her  because having taken away your french bonbons with the poisonous color on them i wanted to get you something better here it is all pure sugar the sort that sweetens the heart as well as the tongue and leaves no bad taste behind  how good you are to me i dont deserve it for i didnt resist temptation though i tried uncle after id put the book away i thought i must just see how it ended and im afraid i should have read it all if it had not been gone said rose laying her face down on the hands she held as humbly as a repentant child  but uncle alec lifted up the bent head and looking into the eyes that met his frankly though either held a tear he said with the energy that always made his words remembered my little girl i would face a dozen storms far worse than this to keep your soul as stainless as snow for it is the small temptations which undermine integrity unless we watch and pray and never think them too trivial to be resisted  some people would consider dr alec an overcareful man but rose felt that he was right and when she said her prayers that night added a meek petition to be kept from yielding to three of the small temptations which beset a rich pretty and romantic girl extravagance coquetry and novel reading     chapter 12 at kittys ball  rose had no new gown to wear on this festive occasion and gave one little sigh of regret as she put on the pale blue silk refreshed with clouds of gaze de chambéry but a smile followed very bright and sweet as she added the clusters of forgetmenot which charlie had conjured up through the agency of an old german florist for one part of her plan had been carried out and prince was invited to be her escort much to his delight though he wisely made no protestations of any sort and showed his gratitude by being a model gentleman this pleased rose for the late humiliation and a very sincere desire to atone for it gave him an air of pensive dignity which was very effective  aunt clara could not go for a certain new cosmetic privately used to improve the once fine complexion which had been her pride till late hours impaired it had brought out an unsightly eruption reducing her to the depths of woe and leaving her no solace for her disappointment but the sight of the elegant velvet dress spread forth upon her bed in melancholy state  so aunt jessie was chaperon to roses great satisfaction and looked as pretty as a pink archie thought in her matronly pearlcolored gown with a dainty trifle of rich lace on her still abundant hair he was very proud of his little mama and as devoted as a lover to keep his hand in against phebes return she said laughingly when he brought her a nosegay of blush roses to light up her quiet costume  a happier mother did not live than mrs jessie as she sat contentedly beside sister jane who graced the frivolous scene in a serious black gown with a diadem of purple asters nodding above her severe brow both watching their boys with the maternal conviction that no other parent could show such remarkable specimens as these each had done her best according to her light and years of faithful care were now beginning to bear fruit in the promise of goodly men so dear to the hearts of true mothers  mrs jessie watched her three tall sons with something like wonder for archie was a fine fellow grave and rather stately but full of the cordial courtesy and respect we see so little of nowadays and which is the sure sign of good home training the cadets as will and geordie called themselves were there as gorgeous as you please and the agonies they suffered that night with tight boots and stiff collars no pen can fitly tell but only to one another did they confide these sufferings and the rare moments of repose when they could stand on one aching foot with heads comfortably sunken inside the excruciating collars which rasped their ears and made the lobes thereof a pleasing scarlet brief were these moments however and the spartan boys danced on with smiling faces undaunted by the hidden anguish which preyed upon them fore and aft as will expressed it  mrs janes pair were an odd contrast and even the stern disciplinarian herself could not help smiling as she watched them steve was superb and might have been married on the spot so superfine was his broadcloth glossy his linen and perfect the fit of his gloves while pride and happiness so fermented in his youthful bosom there would have been danger of spontaneous combustion if dancing had not proved a safety valve for his strong sense of the proprieties would not permit him to vent his emotions in any other way  kitty felt no such restraint and looked like a blissful little gypsy with her brunet prettiness set off by a dashing costume of cardinal and cream color and every hair on her head curled in a merry pecksniffian crop for youth was her strong point and she much enjoyed the fact that she had been engaged three times before she was nineteen  to see her and steve spin around the room was a sight to bring a smile to the lips of the crustiest bachelor or saddest spinster for happy lovers are always a pleasing spectacle and two such merry little grigs as these are seldom seen  mac meantime with glasses astride his nose surveyed his brothers performances on the light fantastic very much as a benevolent newfoundland would the gambols of a toy terrier receiving with thanks the hasty hints for his guidance which steve breathed into his ear as he passed and forgetting all about them the next minute when not thus engaged mac stood about with his thumbs in his vest pockets regarding the lively crowd like a meditative philosopher of a cheerful aspect often smiling to himself at some whimsical fancy of his own knitting his brows as some bit of illnatured gossip met his ear or staring with undisguised admiration as a beautiful face or figure caught his eye  i hope that girl knows what a treasure she has got but i doubt if she ever fully appreciates it said mrs jane bringing her spectacles to bear upon kitty as she whisked by causing quite a gale with her flying skirts  i think she will for steve has been so well brought up she cannot but see and feel the worth of what she has never had and being so young she will profit by it answered mrs jessie softly thinking of the days when she and her jem danced together just betrothed  ive done my duty by both the boys and done it thoroughly or their father would have spoilt them for hes no more idea of discipline than a child and aunt jane gave her own palm a smart rap with her closed fan emphasizing the word thoroughly in a most suggestive manner  ive often wished i had your firmness jane but after all im not sure that i dont like my own way best at least with my boys for plenty of love and plenty of patience seem to have succeeded pretty well and aunt jessie lifted the nosegay from her lap feeling as if that unfailing love and patience were already blooming into her life as beautifully as the sweetbreathed roses given by her boy refreshed and brightened these long hours of patient waiting in a corner  i dont deny that youve done well jessie but youve been let alone and had no one to hold your hand or interfere if my mac had gone to sea as your jem did i never should have been as severe as i am men are so perverse and shortsighted they dont trouble about the future as long as things are quiet and comfortable in the present continued mrs jane quite forgetting that the shortsighted partner of the firm physically speaking at least was herself  ah yes we mothers love to foresee and foretell our childrens lives even before they are born and are very apt to be disappointed if they do not turn out as we planned i know i am yet i really have no cause to complain and am learning to see that all we can do is to give the dear boys good principles and the best training we may then leave them to finish what we have begun and mrs jessies eye wandered away to archie dancing with rose quite unconscious what a pretty little castle in the air tumbled down when he fell in love with phebe  right quite right on that point we agree exactly i have spared nothing to give my boys good principles and good habits and i am willing to trust them anywhere nine times did i whip my steve to cure him of fibbing and over and over again did mac go without his dinner rather than wash his hands but i whipped and starved them both into obedience and now i have my reward concluded the stern parent with a proud wave of the fan which looked very like a ferule being as big hard and uncompromising as such an article could be  mrs jessie gave a mild murmur of assent but could not help thinking with a smile that in spite of their early tribulations the sins for which the boys suffered had gotten a little mixed in their result for fibbing steve was now the tidy one and careless mac the truth teller but such small contradictions will happen in the bestregulated families and all perplexed parents can do is to keep up a steadfast preaching and practicing in the hope that it will bear fruit sometime for according to an old proverb children pick up words as pigeons pease to utter them again as god shall please  i hope they wont dance the child to death among them for each one seems bound to have his turn even your sober mac said mrs jessie a few minutes later as she saw archie hand rose over to his cousin who carried her off with an air of triumph from several other claimants  shes very good to him and her influence is excellent for he is of an age now when a young womans opinion has more weight than an old ones though he is always good to his mother and i feel as if i should take great comfort in him hes one of the sort who will not marry till late if ever being fond of books and a quiet life responded mrs jane remembering how often her son had expressed his belief that philosophers should not marry and brought up plato as an example of the serene wisdom to be attained only by a single man while her husband sided with socrates for whom he felt a profound sympathy though he didnt dare to own it  well i dont know about that since my archie surprised me by losing his heart as he did im prepared for anything and advise you to do likewise i really shouldnt wonder if mac did something remarkable in that line though he shows no sign of it yet i confess answered mrs jessie laughing  it wont be in that direction you may be sure for her fate is sealed dear me how sad it is to see a superior girl like that about to throw herself away on a handsome scapegrace i wont mention names but you understand me and mrs jane shook her head as if she could mention the name of one superior girl who had thrown herself away and now saw the folly of it  im very anxious of course and so is alec but it may be the saving of one party and the happiness of the other for some women love to give more than they receive said mrs jessie privately wondering for the thousandth time why brother mac ever married the learned miss humphries  youll see that it wont prosper and i shall always maintain that a wife cannot entirely undo a mothers work rose will have her hands full if she tries to set all claras mistakes right answered aunt jane grimly then began to fan violently as their hostess approached to have a dish of chat about our dear young people  rose was in a merry mood that night and found mac quite ready for fun which was fortunate since her first remark set them off on a droll subject  oh mac annabel has just confided to me that she is engaged to fun see think of her going to housekeeping in canton someday and having to order rats puppies and birdsnest soup for dinner whispered rose too much amused to keep the news to herself  by confucius isnt that a sweet prospect and mac burst out laughing to the great surprise of his neighbors who wondered what there was amusing about the chinese sage it is rather alarming though to have these infants going on at this rate seems to be catching a new sort of scarlet fever to judge by annabels cheeks and kittys gown he added regarding the aforesaid ladies with eyes still twinkling with merriment  dont be ungallant but go and do likewise for it is all the fashion i heard mrs van tell old mrs joy that it was going to be a marrying year so youll be sure to catch it answered rose reefing her skirts for with all his training mac still found it difficult to keep his long legs out of the mantraps  it doesnt look like a painful disease but i must be careful for ive no time to be ill now what are the symptoms asked mac trying to combine business with pleasure and improve his mind while doing his duty  if you ever come back ill tell you laughed rose as he danced away into the wrong corner bumped smartly against another gentleman and returned as soberly as if that was the proper figure  well tell me how not to do it he said subsiding for a moments talk when rose had floated to and fro in her turn  oh you see some young girl who strikes you as particularly charming whether she really is or not doesnt matter a bit and you begin to think about her a great deal to want to see her and to get generally sentimental and absurd began rose finding it difficult to give a diagnosis of the most mysterious disease under the sun  dont think it sounds enticing cant i find an antidote somewhere for if it is in the air this year im sure to get it and it may be fatal said mac who felt pretty lively and liked to make rose merry for he suspected that she had a little trouble from a hint dr alec had given him  i hope you will catch it because youll be so funny  will you take care of me as you did before or have you got your hands full  ill help but really with archie and steve and charlie i shall have enough to do youd better take it lightly the first time and so wont need much care  very well how shall i begin enlighten my ignorance and start me right i beg  go about and see people make yourself agreeable and not sit in corners observing other people as if they were puppets dancing for your amusement i heard mrs van once say that propinquity works wonders and she ought to know having married off two daughters and just engaged a third to a most charming young man  good lack the cure sounds worse than the disease propinquity hey why i may be in danger this identical moment and cant flee for my life said mac gently catching her round the waist for a general waltz  dont be alarmed but mind your steps for charlie is looking at us and i want you to do your best thats perfect take me quite round for i love to waltz and seldom get a good turn except with you boys said rose smiling up at him approvingly as his strong arm guided her among the revolving couples and his feet kept time without a fault  this certainly is a great improvement on the chair business to which i have devoted myself with such energy that ive broken the backs of two partners and dislocated the arm of the old rocker i took an occasional turn with that heavy party thinking it good practice in case i ever happen to dance with stout ladies and mac nodded toward annabel pounding gaily with mr tokio whose yellow countenance beamed as his beady eyes rested on his plump fiancée  pausing in the midst of her merriment at the image of mac and the old rocking chair rose said reprovingly though a heathen chinee fun puts you to shame for he did not ask foolish questions but went awooing like a sensible little man and ive no doubt annabel will be very happy  choose me a suitable divinity and i will try to adore can i do more than that to retrieve my character answered mac safely landing his partner and plying the fan according to instructions  how would emma do inquired rose whose sense of the ludicrous was strong and who could not resist the temptation of horrifying mac by the suggestion  never it sets my teeth on edge to look at her tonight i suppose that dress is a sweet thing just out but upon my word she reminds me of nothing but a harlequin ice and mac turned his back on her with a shudder for he was sensitive to discords of all kinds  she certainly does and that mixture of chocolate pea green and pink is simply detestable though many people would consider it decidedly chic to use her favorite word i suppose you will dress your wife like a spartan matron of the time of lycurgus added rose much tickled by his new conceit  ill wait till i get her before i decide but one thing im sure of she shall not dress like a greek dancer of the time of pericles answered mac regarding with great disfavor a young lady who having a statuesque figure affected drapery of the scanty and clinging description  then it is of no use to suggest that classic creature so as you reject my first attempts i wont go on but look about me quietly and you had better do the same seriously mac more gaiety and less study would do you good for you will grow old before your time if you shut yourself up and pore over books so much  i dont believe there is a younger or a jollierfeeling fellow in the room than i am though i may not conduct myself like a dancing dervish but i own you may be right about the books for there are many sorts of intemperance and a library is as irresistible to me as a barroom to a toper i shall have to sign a pledge and cork up the only bottle that tempts me my inkstand  ill tell you how to make it easier to abstain stop studying and write a novel into which you can put all your wise things and so clear your brains for a new start by and by do i should so like to read it cried rose delighted with the project for she was sure mac could do anything he liked in that line  first live then write how can i go to romancing till i know what romance means he asked soberly feeling that so far he had had very little in his life  then you must find out and nothing will help you more than to love someone very much do as ive advised and be a modern diogenes going about with spectacles instead of a lantern in search not of an honest man but a perfect woman i do hope you will be successful and rose made her curtsey as the dance ended  i dont expect perfection but i should like one as good as they ever make them nowadays if you are looking for the honest man i wish you success in return said mac relinquishing her fan with a glance of such sympathetic significance that a quick flush of feeling rose to the girls face as she answered very low if honesty was all i wanted i certainly have found it in you  then she went away with charlie who was waiting for his turn and mac roamed about wondering if anywhere in all that crowd his future wife was hidden saying to himself as he glanced from face to face quite unresponsive to the various allurements displayed      what care i how fair she be     if she be not fair for me  just before supper several young ladies met in the dressing room to repair damages and being friends they fell into discourse as they smoothed their locks and had their tattered furbelows sewed or pinned up by the neathanded phillisinwaiting  when each had asked the other how do i look tonight dear and been answered with reciprocal enthusiasm perfectly lovely darling kitty said to rose who was helping her to restore order out of the chaos to which much exercise had reduced her curls by the way young randal is dying to be presented to you may i after supper  no thank you answered rose very decidedly  well im sure i dont see why not began kitty looking displeased but not surprised  i think you do else why didnt you present him when he asked you seldom stop to think of etiquette why did you now  i didnt like to do it till i had you are so particular i thought youd say no but i couldnt tell him so stammered kitty feeling that she had better have settled the matter herself for rose was very particular and had especial reason to dislike this person because he was not only a dissipated young reprobate himself but seemed possessed of satan to lead others astray likewise  i dont wish to be rude dear but i really must decline for i cannot know such people even though i meet them here said rose remembering charlies revelations on new years night and hardening her heart against the man who had been his undoing on that as well as on other occasions she had reason to believe  i couldnt help it old mr randal and papa are friends and though i spoke of it brother alf wouldnt hear of passing that bad boy over explained kitty eagerly  yet alf forbade you driving or skating with him for he knows better than we how unfit he is to come among us  id drop him tomorrow if i could but i must be civil in my own house his mother brought him and he wont dare to behave here as he does at their bachelor parties  she ought not to have brought him till he had shown some desire to mend his ways it is none of my business i know but i do wish people wouldnt be so inconsistent letting boys go to destruction and then expecting us girls to receive them like decent people rose spoke in an energetic whisper but annabel heard her and exclaimed as she turned round with a powder puff in her hand my goodness rose what is all that about going to destruction  she is being strongminded and i dont very much blame her in this case but it leaves me in a dreadful scrape said kitty supporting her spirits with a sniff of aromatic vinegar  i appeal to you since you heard me and theres no one here but ourselves do you consider young randal a nice person to know and rose turned to annabel and emma with an anxious eye for she did not find it easy to abide by her principles when so doing annoyed friends  no indeed hes perfectly horrid papa says he and gorham are the wildest young men he knows and enough to spoil the whole set im so glad ive got no brothers responded annabel placidly powdering her pink arms quite undeterred by the memory of sundry white streaks left on sundry coat sleeves  i think that sort of scrupulousness is very illbred if youll excuse my saying so rose we are not supposed to know anything about fastness and wildness and so on but to treat every man alike and not be fussy and prudish said emma settling her manycolored streamers with the superior air of a woman of the world aged twenty  ah but we do know and if our silence and civility have no effect we ought to try something else and not encourage wickedness of any kind we neednt scold and preach but we can refuse to know such people and that will do some good for they dont like to be shunned and shut out from respectable society uncle alec told me not to know that man and i wont rose spoke with unusual warmth forgetting that she could not tell the real reason for her strong prejudice against that man  well i know him i think him very jolly and im engaged to dance the german with him after supper he leads quite as well as your cousin charlie and is quite as fascinating some people think returned emma tossing her head disdainfully for prince charming did not worship at her shrine and it piqued her vanity  in spite of her quandary rose could not help smiling as she recalled macs comparison for emma turned so red with spiteful chagrin she seemed to have added strawberry ice to the other varieties composing the harlequin  each must judge for herself i shall follow aunt jessies advice and try to keep my atmosphere as pure as i can for she says every woman has her own little circle and in it can use her influence for good if she will i do will heartily and ill prove that im neither proud nor fussy by receiving here or at home any respectable man you like to present to me no matter how poor or plain or insignificant he may be  with which declaration rose ended her protest and the four damsels streamed downstairs together like a wandering rainbow but kitty laid to heart what she had said annabel took credit herself for siding with her and emma owned that she was not trying to keep her atmosphere pure when she came to dance with the objectionable randal so roses little circle was the better for the influence she tried to exert although she never knew it  at suppertime charlie kept near her and she was quite content with him for he drank only coffee and she saw him shake his head with a frown when young van beckoned him toward an anteroom from whence the sound of popping corks had issued with increasing frequency as the evening wore on  dear fellow he does try thought rose longing to show how she admired his selfdenial but she could only say as they left the supper room with the aunts who were going early if i had not promised uncle to get home as soon after midnight as possible id stay and dance the german with you for you deserve a reward tonight  a thousand thanks but i am going when you do answered charlie understanding both her look and words and very grateful for them  really cried rose delighted  really ill be in the hall when you come down and charlie thought the fra angelico angel was not half so bright and beautiful as the one who looked back at him out of a pale blue cloud as rose went upstairs as if on wings  when she came down again charlie was not in the hall however and after waiting a few minutes mac offered to go and find him for aunt jane was still hunting a lost rubber above  please say im ready but he neednt come if he doesnt want to said rose not wishing to demand too much of her promising penitent  if he has gone into that barroom ill have him out no matter who is there growled mac to himself as he made his way to the small apartment whither the gentlemen retired for a little private refreshment when the spirit moved as it often did  the door was ajar and charlie seemed to have just entered for mac heard a familiar voice call out in a jovial tone come prince youre just in time to help us drink steves health with all the honors  cant stop only ran in to say good night van had a capital time but im on duty and must go  thats a new dodge take a stirrup cup anyway and come back in time for a merrygorounder when youve disposed of the ladies answered the young host diving into the wine cooler for another bottle  charlies going in for sanctity and it doesnt seem to agree with him laughed one of the two other young men who occupied several chairs apiece resting their soles in every sense of the word  apron strings are coming into fashion the bluer the better hey prince added the other trying to be witty with the usual success  youd better go home early yourself barrow or that tongue of yours will get you into trouble retorted charlie conscious that he ought to take his own advice yet lingering nervously putting on his gloves while the glasses were being filled  now brotherinlaw fire away here you are prince and steve handed a glass across the table to his cousin feeling too much elated with various pleasurable emotions to think what he was doing for the boys all knew charlies weakness and usually tried to defend him from it  before the glass could be taken however mac entered in a great hurry delivering his message in an abbreviated and rather peremptory form rose is waiting for you hurry up  all right good night old fellows and charlie was off as if the name had power to stop him in the very act of breaking the promise made to himself  come solon take a social drop and give us an epithalamium in your best greek heres to you and steve was lifting the wine to his own lips when mac knocked the glass out of his hand with a flash of the eye that caused his brother to stare at him with his mouth open in an imbecile sort of way which seemed to excite mac still more for turning to his young host he said in a low voice and with a look that made the gentlemen on the chairs sit up suddenly i beg pardon van for making a mess but i cant stand by and see my own brother tempt another man beyond his strength or make a brute of himself thats plain english but i cant help speaking out for i know not one of you would willingly hurt charlie and you will if you dont let him alone  what do you pitch into me for ive done nothing a fellow must be civil in his own house mustnt he asked van goodhumoredly as he faced about corkscrew in hand  yes but it is not civil to urge or joke a guest into doing what you know and he knows is bad for him thats only a glass of wine to you but it is perdition to charlie and if steve knew what he was about hed cut his right hand off before hed offer it  do you mean to say im tipsy demanded steve ruffling up like a little gamecock for though he saw now what he had done and was ashamed of it he hated to have mac air his peculiar notions before other people  with excitement not champagne i hope for i wouldnt own you if you were answered mac in whom indignation was effervescing like the wine in the forgotten bottle for the men were all young friends of steves and admirers of charlies look here boys he went on more quietly i know i ought not to explode in this violent sort of way but upon my life i couldnt help it when i heard what you were saying and saw what steve was doing since i have begun i may as well finish and tell you straight out that prince cant stand this sort of thing he is trying to flee temptation and whoever leads him into it does a cowardly and sinful act for the loss of ones own selfrespect is bad enough without losing the more precious things that make life worth having dont tell him ive said this but lend a hand if you can and never have to reproach yourselves with the knowledge that you helped to ruin a fellow creature soul and body  it was well for the success of macs first crusade that his hearers were gentlemen and sober so his outburst was not received with jeers or laughter but listened to in silence while the expression of the faces changed from one of surprise to regret and respect for earnestness is always effective and championship of this sort seldom fails to touch hearts as yet unspoiled as he paused with an eloquent little quiver in his eager voice van corked the bottle at a blow threw down the corkscrew and offered mac his hand saying heartily in spite of his slang you are a firstclass old brick ill lend a hand for one and do my best to back up charlie for hes the finest fellow i know and shant go to the devil like poor randal if i can help it  murmurs of applause from the others seemed to express a general assent to this vigorous statement and giving the hand a grateful shake mac retreated to the door anxious to be off now that he had freed his mind with such unusual impetuosity  count on me for anything i can do in return for this van im sorry to be such a marplot but you can take it out in quizzing me after im gone im fair game and steve can set you going  with that mac departed as abruptly as he had come feeling that he had made a mess of it but comforting himself with the thought that perhaps he had secured help for charlie at his own expense and thinking with a droll smile as he went back to his mother my romance begins by looking after other girls lovers instead of finding a sweetheart for myself but i cant tell rose so she wont laugh at me     chapter 13 both sides  steves engagement made a great stir in the family a pleasant one this time for nobody objected everything seemed felicitous and the course of true love ran very smoothly for the young couple who promised to remove the only obstacle to their union by growing old and wise as soon as possible if he had not been so genuinely happy the little lovers airs would have been unbearable for he patronized all mankind in general his brother and elder cousins in particular  now that is the way to manage matters he declared standing before the fire in aunt claras billiard room a day or two after the ball with his hands behind his back no nonsense no delay no domestic rows or tragic separations just choose with taste and judgment make yourself agreeable through thick and thin and when it is perfectly evident that the dear creature adores the ground you walk on say the word like a man and there you are  all very easy to do that with a girl like kitty who has no confounded notions to spoil her and trip you up every time you dont exactly toe the mark muttered charlie knocking the balls about as if it were a relief to hit something for he was in a gloriously bad humor that evening because time hung heavy on his hands since he had forsworn the company he could not keep without danger to himself  you should humor those little notions for all women have them and it needs tact to steer clear of them kittys got dozens but i treat them with respect have my own way when i can give in without growling when i cant and we get on like a couple of  spoons put in charlie who felt that he had not steered clear and so suffered shipwreck in sight of land  steve meant to have said doves but his cousins levity caused him to add with calm dignity reasonable beings and then revenged himself by making a good shot which won him the game  you always were a lucky little dog steve i dont begrudge you a particle of your happiness but it does seem as if things werent quite fair sometimes said archie suppressing an envious sigh for though he seldom complained it was impossible to contrast his own and his cousins prospects with perfect equanimity      his worth shines forth the brightest who in hope      always confides the abject soul despairs  observed mac quoting euripides in a conversational tone as he lay upon a divan reposing after a hard days work  thank you said archie brightening a little for a hopeful word from any source was very comfortable  thats your favorite rip isnt it he was a wise old boy but you could find advice as good as that nearer home put in steve who just then felt equal to slapping plato on the shoulder so elated was he at being engaged first of all the lot as he gracefully expressed it  dont halloo till you are out of the wood dandy mrs kit has jilted two men and may a third so youd better not brag of your wisdom too soon for she may make a fool of you yet said charlie cynically his views of life being very gloomy about this time  no she wont steve if you do your part honestly theres the making of a good little woman in kitty and she has proved it by taking you instead of those other fellows you are not a solomon but youre not spoilt yet and she had the sense to see it said mac encouragingly from his corner for he and his brother were better friends than even since the little scene at the van tassels  hear hear cried steve looking more than ever like a cheerful young cockerel trying to crow as he stood upon the hearth rug with his hands under his coat tails rising and falling alternately upon the toes and heels of his neat little boots  come youve given them each a pat on the head havent you got one for me i need it enough for if ever there was a poor devil born under an evil star it is c c campbell exclaimed charlie leaning his chin on his cue with a discontented expression of countenance for trying to be good is often very hard work till one gets used to it  oh yes i can accommodate you and as if his words suggested the selection mac still lying flat upon his back repeated one of his favorite bits from beaumont and fletcher for he had a wonderful memory and could reel off poetry by the hour together      man is his own star and the soul that can     render an honest and a perfect man     commands all light all influence all fate     nothing to him falls early or too late      our acts our angels are or good or ill     our fatal shadows that walk by us still  confoundedly bad angels they are too muttered charlie ruefully remembering the one that undid him  his cousins never knew exactly what occurred on new years night but suspected that something was amiss for charlie had the blues and rose though as kind as ever expressed no surprise at his long absences they had all observed and wondered at this state of things yet discreetly made no remark till steve who was as inquisitive as a magpie seized this opportunity to say in a friendly tone which showed that he bore no malice for the dark prophecy regarding his kittys faithfulness whats the trouble prince you are so seldom in a bad humor that we dont know what to make of it and all feel out of spirits when you have the blues had a tiff with rose  never you mind little boy but this i will say the better women are the more unreasonable they are they dont require us to be saints like themselves which is lucky but they do expect us to render an honest and a perfect man sometimes and that is asking rather too much in a fallen world like this said charlie glad to get a little sympathy though he had no intention of confessing his transgressions  no it isnt said mac decidedly  much you know about it began charlie ill pleased to be so flatly contradicted  well i know this much added mac suddenly sitting up with his hair in a highly disheveled condition it is very unreasonable in us to ask women to be saints and then expect them to feel honored when we offer them our damaged hearts or at best one not half as good as theirs if they werent blinded by love theyd see what a mean advantage we take of them and not make such bad bargains  upon my word the philosopher is coming out strong upon the subject we shall have him preaching womens rights directly said steve much amazed at this outburst  ive begun you see and much good may it do you answered mac laying himself placidly down again  well but look here man you are arguing on the wrong side put in archie quite agreeing with him but feeling that he must stand by his order at all costs  never mind sides uphold the right wherever you find it you neednt stare steve i told you i was going to look into this matter and i am you think im wrapped up in books but i see a great deal more of what is going on around me than you imagine and im getting on in this new branch let me tell you quite as fast as is good for me i daresay  going in for perfection are you asked charlie both amused and interested for he respected mac more than he owned even to himself and though he had never alluded to the timely warning neither forgot  yes i think of it  how will you begin  do my best allround keep good company read good books love good things and cultivate soul and body as faithfully and wisely as i can  and you expect to succeed do you  please god i will  the quiet energy of macs last words produced a momentary silence charlie thoughtfully studied the carpet archie who had been absently poking the fire looked over at mac as if he thanked him again and steve forgetting his selfconceit began to wonder if it was not possible to improve himself a little for kittys sake only a minute for young men do not give much time to thoughts of this kind even when love stirs up the noblest impulses within them to act rather than to talk is more natural to most of them as charlies next question showed for having the matter much at heart he ventured to ask in an offhand way as he laughed and twirled his cue do you intend to reach the highest point of perfection before you address one of the fair saints or shall you ask her to lend a hand somewhere short of that  as it takes a long lifetime to do what i plan i think i shall ask some good woman to lend a hand when ive got anything worth offering her not a saint for i never shall be one myself but a gentle creature who will help me as i shall try to help her so that we can go on together and finish our work hereafter if we havent time to do it here  if mac had been a lover he would not have discussed the subject in this simple and sincere fashion though he might have felt it far more deeply but being quite heartfree he frankly showed his interest and curiously enough out of his wise young head unconsciously gave the three lovers before him counsel which they valued because he practiced what he preached  well i hope youll find her said charlie heartily as he went back to his game  i think i shall and while the others played mac lay staring at the window curtain as contentedly as if through it he beheld a dream of fair women from which to choose his future mate  a few days after this talk in the billiard room kitty went to call upon rose for as she was about to enter the family she felt it her duty to become acquainted with all its branches this branch however she cultivated more assiduously than any other and was continually running in to confer with cousin rose whom she considered the wisest dearest kindest girl ever created and rose finding that in spite of her flighty head kitty had a good heart of her own did her best to encourage all the new hopes and aspirations springing up in it under the warmth of the first genuine affection she had ever known  my dear i want to have some serious conversation with you upon a subject in which i take an interest for the first time in my life began miss kitty seating herself and pulling off her gloves as if the subject was one which needed a firm grasp  tell away and dont mind if i go on working as i want to finish this job today answered rose with a longhandled paintbrush in her hand and a great pair of shears at her side  you are always so busy what is it now let me help i can talk faster when im doing something which seemed hardly possible for kittys tongue went like a mill clapper at all hours  making picture books for my sick babies at the hospital pretty work isnt it you cut out and ill paste them on these squares of gay cambric then we just tie up a few pages with a ribbon and there is a nice light durable book for the poor dears to look at as they lie in their little beds  a capital idea do you go there often how ever do you find the time for such things asked kitty busily cutting from a big sheet the touching picture of a parent bird with a red head and a blue tail offering what looked like a small boa constrictor to one of its nestlings a fat young squab with a green head yellow body and no tail at all  i have plenty of time now i dont go out so much for a party uses up two days generally one to prepare for it and one to get over it you know  people think it is so odd of you to give up society all of a sudden they say you have turned pious and it is owing to your peculiar bringingup i always take your part and say it is a pity other girls havent as sensible an education for i dont know one who is as satisfactory on the whole as you are  much obliged you may also tell people i gave up gaiety because i value health more but i havent forsworn everything of the kind kit i go to concerts and lectures and all sorts of early things and have nice times at home as you know i like fun as well as ever but im getting on you see and must be preparing a little for the serious part of life one never knows when it may come said rose thoughtfully as she pasted a squirrel upside down on the pink cotton page before her  that reminds me of what i wanted to say if youll believe me my dear steve has got that very idea into his head did you or mac put it there asked kitty industriously clashing her shears  no ive given up lecturing the boys lately they are so big now they dont like it and i fancy id got into a way that was rather tiresome  well then he is turning pious too and what is very singular i like it now dont smile i really do and i want to be getting ready for the serious part of life as you call it that is i want to grow better as fast as i can for steve says he isnt half good enough for me just think of that  kitty looked so surprised and pleased and proud that rose felt no desire to laugh at her sudden fancy for sobriety but said in her most sympathetic tone im very glad to hear it for it shows that he loves you in the right way  is there more than one way  yes i fancy so because some people improve so much after they fall in love and others do not at all have you never observed that  i never learned how to observe of course i know that some matches turn out well and some dont but i never thought much about it  well i have for i was rather interested in the subject lately and had a talk with aunt jessie and uncle about it  gracious you dont talk to them about such things do you  yes indeed i ask any questions i like and always get a good answer it is such a nice way to learn kitty for you dont have to pore over books but as things come along you talk about them and remember and when they are spoken of afterward you understand and are interested though you dont say a word explained rose  it must be nice but i havent anyone to do so for me papa is too busy and mama always says when i ask question dont trouble your head with such things child so i dont what did you learn about matches turning out well im interested in that because i want mine to be quite perfect in all respects  after thinking it over i came to the conclusion that uncle was right and it is not always safe to marry a person just because you love him began rose trying to enlighten kitty without betraying herself  of course not if they havent money or are bad but otherwise i dont see what more is needed said kitty wonderingly  one should stop and see if it is a wise love likely to help both parties and wear well for you know it ought to last all ones lifetime and it is very sad if it doesnt  i declare it quite scares me to think of it for i dont usually go beyond my wedding day in making plans i remember though that when i was engaged the first time you dont know the man it was just after you went away and i was only sixteen someone very illnaturedly said i should marry in haste and repent at leisure and that made me try to imagine how it would seem to go on year after year with gustavus who had a dreadful temper by the way and it worried me so to think of it that i broke the engagement and was so glad ever afterward  you were a wise girl and i hope youll do it again if you find after a time that you and steve do not truly trust and respect as well as love one another if you dont youll be miserable when it is too late as so many people are who do marry in haste and have a lifetime to repent it aunt jessie says so and she knows  dont be solemn rose it fidgets me to think about lifetimes and respecting and all those responsible things im not used to it and i dont know how to do it  but you must think and you must learn how before you take the responsibility upon yourself that is what your life is for and you mustnt spoil it by doing a very solemn thing without seeing if you are ready for it  do you think about all this asked kitty shrugging up her shoulders as if responsibility of any sort did not sit comfortably on them  one has to sometimes you know but is that all you wanted to tell me added rose anxious to turn the conversation from herself  oh dear no the most serious thing of all is this steve is putting himself in order generally and so i want to do my part and i must begin right away before my thoughts get distracted with clothes and all sorts of dear delightful frivolous things that i cant help liking now i wish youd tell me where to begin shouldnt i improve my mind by reading something solid and kitty looked over at the wellfilled bookcase as if to see if it contained anything large and dry enough to be considered solid  it would be an excellent plan and well look up something what do you feel as if you needed most  a little of everything i should say for when i look into my mind there really doesnt seem to be much there but odds and ends and yet im sure ive read a great deal more than some girls do i suppose novels dont count though and are of no use for goodness knows the people and things they describe arent a bit like the real ones  some novels are very useful and do as much good as sermons ive heard uncle say because they not only describe truly but teach so pleasantly that people like to learn in that way said rose who knew the sort of books kitty had read and did not wonder that she felt rather astray when she tried to guide herself by their teaching  you pick me out some of the right kind and ill apply my mind to them then i ought to have some serious views and methods and principles steve said principles good firm ones you know and kitty gave a little pull at the bit of cambric she was cutting as housewives pull cotton or calico when they want a good firm article  rose could not help laughing now though much pleased for kitty was so prettily in earnest and yet so perfectly ignorant how to begin on the selfimprovement she very much needed that it was pathetic as well as comical to see and hear her  you certainly want some of those and must begin at once to get them but aunt jessie can help you there better than i can or aunt jane for she has very firm ones i assure you said rose sobering down as quickly as possible  mercy on us i should never dare to say a word about it to mrs mac for im dreadfully afraid of her she is so stern and how im ever to get on when she is my motherinlaw i dont know cried kitty clasping her hands in dismay at the idea  she isnt half as stern as she looks and if you go to her without fear youve no idea how sensible and helpful she is i used to be frightened out of my wits with her but now im not a bit and we get on nicely indeed im fond of her she is so reliable and upright in all things  she certainly is the straightest woman i ever saw and the most precise i never shall forget how scared i was when steve took me up to see her that first time i put on all my plainest things did my hair in a meek knob and tried to act like a sober sedate young woman steve would laugh at me and say i looked like a pretty nun so i couldnt be as proper as i wished mrs mac was very kind of course but her eye was so sharp i felt as if she saw right through me and knew that id pinned on my bonnet strings lost a button off my boot and didnt brush my hair for ten minutes every night said kitty in an awestricken tone  she likes you though and so does uncle and hes set his heart on having you live with them by and by so dont mind her eyes but look straight up at her and youll see how kind they can grow  mac likes me too and that did please me for he doesnt like girls generally steve told me he said i had the making of a capital little woman in me wasnt it nice of him steve was so proud though he does laugh at mac sometimes  dont disappoint them dear encourage steve in all the good things he likes or wants make friends with mac love aunt jane and be a daughter to uncle and youll find yourself a very happy girl  i truly will and thank you very much for not making fun of me i know im a little goose but lately ive felt as if i might come to something if i had the right sort of help ill go up and see aunt jessie tomorrow im not a bit afraid of her and then if youll just quietly find out from uncle doctor what i must read ill work as hard as i can dont tell anyone please theyll think it odd and affected and i cant bear to be laughed at though i daresay it is good discipline  rose promised and both worked in silence for a moment then kitty asked rather timidly are you and charlie trying this plan too since youve left off going out so much he keeps away also and we dont know what to make of it  he has had what he calls an artistic fit lately set up a studio and is doing some crayon sketches of us all if hed only finish his things they would be excellent but he likes to try a great variety at once ill take you in sometime and perhaps he will do a portrait of you for steve he likes girls faces and gets the likenesses wonderfully well  people say you are engaged but i contradict it because of course i should know if you were  we are not  im glad of it for really rose im afraid charlie hasnt got firm principles though he is a fascinating fellow and one cant scold him you dont mind my saying so do you dear added kitty for rose did not answer at once  not in the least for you are one of us now and i can speak frankly and i will for i think in one way you can help steve very much you are right about charlie both as to the principles and the fascination steve admires him exceedingly and always from a boy liked to imitate his pleasant ways some of them are very harmless and do steve good but some are not i neednt talk about it only you must show your boy that you depend on him to keep out of harm and help him do it  i will i will and then perhaps when he is a perfect model charlie will imitate him i really begin to feel as if i had a great deal to do and kitty looked as if she was beginning to like it also  we all have and the sooner we go to work the better for us and those we love you wouldnt think now that phebe was doing anything for archie but she is and writes such splendid letters they stir him up wonderfully and make us all love and admire her more than ever  how is she getting on asked kitty who though she called herself a little goose had tact enough to see that rose did not care to talk about charlie  nicely for you know she used to sing in our choir so that was a good recommendation for another she got a fine place in the new church at l and that gives her a comfortable salary though she has something put away she was always a saving creature and kept her wages carefully uncle invested them and she begins to feel quite independent already no fear but my phebe will get on she has such energy and manages so well i sometimes wish i could run away and work with her  ah my dear we rich girls have our trials as well as poor ones though we dont get as much pity as they do sighed kitty nobody knows what i suffer sometimes from worries that i cant talk about and i shouldnt get much sympathy if i did just because i live in a big house wear good gowns and have lots of lovers annabel used to say she envied me above all created beings but she doesnt now and is perfectly absorbed in her dear little chinaman do you see how she ever could like him  so they began to gossip and the sober talk was over for that time but when kitty departed after criticizing all her dear friends and their respective sweethearts she had a helpful little book in her muff a resolute expression on her bright face and so many excellent plans for selfimprovement in her busy brain that she and steve bid fair to turn out the model couple of the century     chapter 14 aunt claras plan  being seriously alarmed by the fear of losing the desire of his heart charlie had gone resolutely to work and like many another young reformer he rather overdid the matter for in trying to keep out of the way of temptation he denied himself much innocent enjoyment the artistic fit was a good excuse for the seclusion which he fancied would be a proper penance and he sat listlessly plying crayon or paintbrush with daily wild rides on black brutus which seemed to do him good for danger of that sort was his delight  people were used to his whims and made light of what they considered a new one but when it lasted week after week and all attempts to draw him out were vain his jolly comrades gave him up and the family began to say approvingly now he really is going to settle down and do something fortunately his mother let him alone for though dr alec had not thundered in her ear as he threatened he had talked with her in a way which first made her very angry then anxious and lastly quite submissive for her heart was set on the boys winning rose and she would have had him put on sackcloth and ashes if that would have secured the prize she made light of the cause of roses displeasure considering her extremely foolish and straitlaced for all young men of any spirit had their little vices and came out well enough when the wild oats were sowed so she indulged charlie in his new vagary as she had in all his others and treated him like an illused being which was neither an inspiring nor helpful course on her part poor soul she saw her mistake by and by and when too late repented of it bitterly  rose wanted to be kind and tried in various ways to help her cousin feeling very sure she should succeed as many another hopeful woman has done quite unconscious how much stronger an undisciplined will is than the truest love and what a difficult task the wisest find it to undo the mistakes of a bad education but it was a hard thing to do for at the least hint of commendation or encouragement he looked so hopeful that she was afraid of seeming to promise too much and of all things she desired to escape the accusation of having trifled with him  so life was not very comfortable to either just then and while charlie was mortifying soul and body to please her she was studying how to serve him best aunt jessie helped her very much and no one guessed when they saw pretty miss campbell going up and down the hill with such a serious face that she was intent upon anything except taking with praiseworthy regularity the constitutionals which gave her such a charming color  matters were in this state when one day a note came to rose from mrs clara  my sweet child do take pity on my poor boy and cheer him up with a sight of you for he is so triste it breaks my heart to see him he has a new plan in his head which strikes me as an excellent one if you will only favor it let him come and take you for a drive this fine afternoon and talk things over it will do him a world of good and deeply oblige  your ever loving  aunt clara  rose read the note twice and stood a moment pondering with her eyes absently fixed on the little bay before her window the sight of several black figures moving briskly to and fro across its frozen surface seemed to suggest a mode of escape from the drive she dreaded in more ways than one that will be safer and pleasanter she said and going to her desk wrote her answer  dear aunty im afraid of brutus but if charlie will go skating with me i should enjoy it very much and it would do us both good i can listen to the new plan with an undivided mind there so give him my love please and say i shall expect him at three  affectionately rose  punctually at three charlie appeared with his skates over his arm and with a very contented face which brightened wonderfully as rose came downstairs in a sealskin suit and scarlet skirt so like the one she wore years ago that he involuntarily exclaimed as he took her skates you look so like little rose i hardly know you and it seems so like old times i feel sixteen again  that is just the way one ought to feel on such a day as this now let us be off and have a good spin before anyone comes there are only a few children there now but it is saturday you know and everybody will be out before long answered rose carefully putting on her mittens as she talked for her heart was not as light as the one little rose carried under the brown jacket and the boy of sixteen never looked at her with the love and longing she read in the eyes of the young man before her  away they went and were soon almost as merry and warm as the children around them for the ice was in good condition the february sunshine brilliant and the keen wind set their blood atingle with a healthful glow  now tell me the plan your mother spoke of began rose as they went gliding across the wide expanse before them for charlie seemed to have forgotten everything but the bliss of having her all to himself for a little while  plan oh yes it is simply this im going out to father next month  really and rose looked both surprised and incredulous for this plan was not a new one  really you dont believe it but i am and mother means to go with me weve had another letter from the governor and he says if she cant part from her big baby to come along too and all be happy together what do you think of that he asked eyeing her intently for they were face to face as she went backward and he held both of her hands to steer and steady her  i like it immensely and do believe it now only it rather takes my breath away to think of auntys going when she never would hear of it before  she doesnt like the plan very well now and consents to go only on one condition  what is that asked rose trying to free her hands for a look at charlie made her suspect what was coming  that you go with us and holding the hands fast he added rapidly let me finish before you speak i dont mean that anything is to be changed till you are ready but if you go i am willing to give up everything else and live anywhere as long as you like why shouldnt you come to us for a year or two weve never had our share father would be delighted mother contented and i the happiest man alive  who made this plan asked rose as soon as she got the breath which certainly had been rather taken away by this entirely new and by no means agreeable scheme  mother suggested it i shouldnt have dared even to dream of such richness id made up my mind to go alone and when i told her she was in despair till this superb idea came into her head after that of course it was easy enough for me to stick to the resolution id made  why did you decide to go charlie and rose looked up into the eyes that were fixed beseechingly on hers  they wavered and glanced aside then met hers honestly yet full of humility which made her own fall as he answered very low because i dont dare to stay  is it so hard she said pitifully  very hard i havent the moral courage to own up and face ridicule and it seems so mean to hide for fear of breaking my word i will keep it this time rose if i go to the ends of the earth to do it  it is not cowardly to flee temptation and nobody whose opinion is worth having will ridicule any brave attempt to conquer ones self dont mind it charlie but stand fast and i am sure you will succeed  you dont know what it is and i cant tell you for till i tried to give it up i never guessed what a grip it had on me i thought it was only a habit easy to drop when i liked but it is stronger than i and sometimes i feel as if possessed of a devil that will get the better of me try as i may  he dropped her hands abruptly as he said that with the energy of despair and as if afraid of saying too much he left her for a minute striking away at full speed as if in truth he would go to the ends of the earth to escape the enemy within himself  rose stood still appalled by this sudden knowledge of how much greater the evil was than she had dreamed what ought she to do go with her cousin and by so doing tacitly pledge herself as his companion on that longer journey for which he was as yet so poorly equipped both heart and conscience protested against this so strongly that she put the thought away but compassion pleaded for him tenderly and the spirit of selfsacrifice which makes women love to give more than they receive caused her to feel as if in a measure this mans fate lay in her hands to be decided for good or ill through her how should she be true both to him and to herself  before this question could be answered he was back again looking as if he had left his care behind him for his moods varied like the wind her attitude as she stood motionless and alone with downcast face was so unlike the cheerful creature who came to meet him an hour ago it filled him with selfreproach and coming up he drew one hand through his arm saying as she involuntarily followed him you must not stand still forget my heroics and answer my question will you go with us rose  not now that is asking too much charlie and i will promise nothing because i cannot do it honestly she answered so firmly that he knew appeal was useless  am i to go alone then leaving all i care for behind me  no take your mother with you and do your best to reunite your parents you could not give yourself to a better task  she wont go without you  i think she will if you hold fast to your resolution you wont give that up i hope  no i must go somewhere for i cant stay here and it may as well be india since that pleases father answered charlie doggedly  it will more than you can imagine tell him all the truth and see how glad he will be to help you and how sincerely he will respect you for what youve done  if you respect me i dont care much about the opinion of anyone else answered charlie clinging with a lovers pertinacity to the hope that was dearest  i shall if you go manfully away and do the duty you owe your father and yourself  and when ive done it may i come back to be rewarded rose he asked taking possession of the hand on his arm as if it was already his  i wish i could say what you want me to but how can i promise when i am not sure of anything i dont love you as i ought and perhaps i never shall so why persist in making me bind myself in this way be generous charlie and dont ask it implored rose much afflicted by his persistence  i thought you did love me it looked very like it a month ago unless you have turned coquette and i cant quite believe that he answered bitterly  i was beginning to love you but you made me afraid to go on murmured rose trying to tell the truth kindly  that cursed custom what can a man do when his hostess asks him to drink wine with her and charlie looked as if he could have cursed himself even more heartily  he can say no  i cant  ah thats the trouble you never learned to say it even to yourself and now it is so hard you want me to help you  and you wont  yes i will by showing you that i can say it to myself for your sake and rose looked up with a face so full of tender sorrow he could not doubt the words which both reproached and comforted him  my little saint i dont deserve one half your goodness to me but i will and go away without one complaint to do my best for your sake he cried touched by her grief and stirred to emulation by the example of courage and integrity she tried to set him  here kitty and steve bore down upon them and obeying the impulse to put care behind them which makes it possible for young hearts to ache one minute and dance the next rose and charlie banished their troubles joined in the sport that soon turned the lonely little bay into a ballroom and enjoyed the splendors of a winter sunset forgetful of separation and calcutta     chapter 15 alas for charlie  in spite of much internal rebellion charlie held fast to his resolution and aunt clara finding all persuasions vain gave in and in a state of chronic indignation against the world in general and rose in particular prepared to accompany him the poor girl had a hard time of it and but for her uncle would have fared still worse he was a sort of shield upon which mrs claras lamentations reproaches and irate glances fell unavailingly instead of wounding the heart against which they were aimed  the days passed very quickly now for everyone seemed anxious to have the parting over and preparations went on rapidly the big house was made ready to shut up for a year at least comforts for the long voyage laid in and farewell visits paid the general activity and excitement rendered it impossible for charlie to lead the life of an artistic hermit any longer and he fell into a restless condition which caused rose to long for the departure of the rajah when she felt that he would be safe for these farewell festivities were dangerous to one who was just learning to say no  half the month safely gone if we can only get well over these last weeks a great weight will be off my mind thought rose as she went down one wild wet morning toward the end of february  opening the study door to greet her uncle she exclaimed why archie then paused upon the threshold transfixed by fear for in her cousins white face she read the tidings of some great affliction  hush dont be frightened come in and ill tell you he whispered putting down the bottle he had just taken from the doctors medicine closet  rose understood and obeyed for aunt plenty was poorly with her rheumatism and depended on her morning doze  what is it she said looking about the room with a shiver as if expecting to see again what she saw there new years night archie was alone however and drawing her toward the closet answered with an evident effort to be quite calm and steady charlie is hurt uncle wants more ether and the wide bandages in some drawer or other he told me but i forget you keep this place in order find them for me quick  before he had done rose was at the drawer turning over the bandages with hands that trembled as they searched  all narrow i must make some can you wait and catching up a piece of old linen she tore it into wide strips adding in the same quick tone as she began to roll them now tell me  i can wait those are not needed just yet i didnt mean anyone should know you least of all began archie smoothing out the strips as they lay across the table and evidently surprised at the girls nerve and skill  i can bear it make haste is he much hurt  im afraid he is uncle looks sober and the poor boy suffers so i couldnt stay answered archie turning still whiter about the lips that never had so hard a tale to tell before  you see he went to town last evening to meet the man who is going to buy brutus  and brutus did it i knew he would cried rose dropping her work to wring her hands as if she guessed the ending of the story now  yes and if he wasnt shot already id do it myself with pleasure for hes done his best to kill charlie muttered charlies mate with a grim look then gave a great sigh and added with averted face i shouldnt blame the brute it wasnt his fault he needed a firm hand and he stopped there but rose said quickly go on i must know  charlie met some of his old cronies quite by accident there was a dinner party and they made him go just for a goodbye they said he couldnt refuse and it was too much for him he would come home alone in the storm though they tried to keep him as he wasnt fit down by the new bridge that high embankment you know the wind had put the lantern out he forgot or something scared brutus and all went down together  archie had spoken fast and brokenly but rose understood and at the last word hid her face with a little moan as if she saw it all  drink this and never mind the rest he said dashing into the next room and coming back with a glass of water longing to be done and away for this sort of pain seemed almost as bad as that he had left  rose drank but held his arm tightly as he would have turned away saying in a tone of command he could not disobey dont keep anything back tell me the worst at once  we knew nothing of it he went on obediently aunt clara thought he was with me and no one found him till early this morning a workman recognized him and he was brought home dead they thought i came for uncle an hour ago charlie is conscious now but awfully hurt and im afraid from the way mac and uncle looked at one another that oh think of it rose crushed and helpless alone in the rain all night and i never knew i never knew  with that poor archie broke down entirely and flinging himself into a chair laid his face on the table sobbing like a girl rose had never seen a man cry before and it was so unlike a womans gentler grief that it moved her very much putting by her own anguish she tried to comfort his and going to him lifted up his head and made him lean on her for in such hours as this women are the stronger it was a very little to do but it did comfort archie for the poor fellow felt as if fate was very hard upon him just then and in this faithful bosom he could pour his brief but pathetic plaint  phebes gone and now if charlies taken i dont see how i can bear it  phebe will come back dear and let us hope poor charlie isnt going to be taken yet such things always seem worst at first ive heard people say so cheer up and hope for the best answered rose seeking for some comfortable words to say and finding very few  they took effect however for archie did cheer up like a man wiping away the tears which he so seldom shed that they did not know where to go he got up gave himself a little shake and said with a long breath as if he had been underwater now im all right thank you i couldnt help it the shock of being waked suddenly to find the dear old fellow in such a pitiful state upset me i ought to go are these ready  in a minute tell uncle to send for me if i can be of any use oh poor aunt clara how does she bear it  almost distracted i took mother to her and she will do all that anybody can heaven only knows what aunt will do if  and only heaven can help her added rose as archie stopped at the words he could not utter now take them and let me know often  you brave little soul i will and archie went away through the rain with his sad burden wondering how rose could be so calm when the beloved prince might be dying  a long dark day followed with nothing to break its melancholy monotony except the bulletins that came from hour to hour reporting little change either for better or for worse rose broke the news gently to aunt plenty and set herself to the task of keeping up the old ladys spirits for being helpless the good soul felt as if everything would go wrong without her at dusk she fell asleep and rose went down to order lights and fire in the parlor with tea ready to serve at any moment for she felt sure some of the men would come and that a cheerful greeting and creature comforts would suit them better than tears darkness and desolation  presently mac arrived saying the instant he entered the room more comfortable cousin  thank heaven cried rose unclasping her hands then seeing how worn out wet and weary mac looked as he came into the light she added in a tone that was a cordial in itself poor boy how tired you are come here and let me make you comfortable  i was going home to freshen up a bit for i must be back in an hour mother took my place so i could be spared and came off as uncle refused to stir  dont go home for if aunty isnt there it will be very dismal step into uncles room and refresh then come back and ill give you your tea let me let me i cant help in any other way and i must do something this waiting is so dreadful  her last words betrayed how much suspense was trying her and mac yielded at once glad to comfort and be comforted when he came back looking much revived a tempting little tea table stood before the fire and rose went to meet him saying with a faint smile as she liberally bedewed him with the contents of a cologne flask i cant bear the smell of ether it suggests such dreadful things  what curious creatures women are archie told us you bore the news like a hero and now you turn pale at a whiff of bad air i cant explain it mused mac as he meekly endured the fragrant shower bath  neither can i but ive been imagining horrors all day and made myself nervous dont let us talk about it but come and have some tea  thats another queer thing tea is your panacea for all human ills yet there isnt any nourishment in it id rather have a glass of milk thank you said mac taking an easy chair and stretching his feet to the fire  she brought it to him and made him eat something then as he shut his eyes wearily she went away to the piano and having no heart to sing played softly till he seemed asleep but at the stroke of six he was up and ready to be off again  he gave me that take it with you and put some on his hair he likes it and i do so want to help a little she said slipping the pretty flagon into his pocket with such a wistful look mac never thought of smiling at this very feminine request  ill tell him is there anything else i can do for you cousin he asked holding the cold hand that had been serving him so helpfully  only this if there is any sudden change promise to send for me no matter at what hour it is i must say goodbye  i will come for you but rose i am sure you may sleep in peace tonight and i hope to have good news for you in the morning  bless you for that come early and let me see him soon i will be very good and i know it will not do him any harm  no fear of that the first thing he said when he could speak was tell rose carefully and as i came away he guessed where i was going and tried to kiss his hand in the old way you know  mac thought it would cheer her to hear that charlie remembered her but the sudden thought that she might never see the familiar little gesture anymore was the last drop that made her full heart overflow and mac saw the hero of the morning sink down at his feet in a passion of tears that frightened him he took her to the sofa and tried to comfort her but as soon as the bitter sobbing quieted she looked up and said quite steadily great drops rolling down her cheeks the while let me cry it is what i need and i shall be all the better for it by and by go to charlie now and tell him i said with all my heart good night  i will and mac trudged away marveling in his turn at the curiously blended strength and weakness of womankind  that was the longest night rose ever spent but joy came in the morning with the early message he is better you are to come by and by then aunt plenty forgot her lumbago and arose aunt myra who had come to have a social croak took off her black bonnet as if it would not be needed at present and the girl made ready to go and say welcome back not the hard goodbye  it seemed very long to wait for no summons came till afternoon then her uncle arrived and at the first sight of his face rose began to tremble  i came for my little girl myself because we must go back at once he said as she hurried toward him hat in hand  im ready sir but her hands shook as she tried to tie the ribbons and her eyes never left the face that was full of tender pity for her  he took her quickly into the carriage and as they rolled away said with the quiet directness which soothes such agitation better than any sympathetic demonstration charlie is worse i feared it when the pain went so suddenly this morning but the chief injuries are internal and one can never tell what the chances are he insists that he is better but he will soon begin to fail i fear become unconscious and slip away without more suffering this is the time for you to see him for he has set his heart on it and nothing can hurt him now my child it is very hard but we must help each other bear it  rose tried to say yes uncle bravely but the words would not come and she could only slip her hand into his with a look of mute submission he laid her head on his shoulder and went on talking so quietly that anyone who did not see how worn and haggard his face had grown with two days and a night of sharp anxiety might have thought him cold  jessie has gone home to rest and jane is with poor clara who has dropped asleep at last ive sent for steve and the other boys there will be time for them later but he so begged to see you now i thought it best to come while this temporary strength keeps him up i have told him how it is but he will not believe me if he asks you answer honestly and try to fit him a little for this sudden ending of so many hopes  how soon uncle  a few hours probably this tranquil moment is yours make the most of it and when we can do no more for him well comfort one another  mac met them in the hall but rose hardly saw him she was conscious only of the task before her and when her uncle led her to the door she said quietly let me go in alone please  archie who had been hanging over the bed slipped away into the inner room as she appeared and rose found charlie waiting for her with such a happy face she could not believe what she had heard and found it easy to say almost cheerfully as she took his eager hand in both of hers dear charlie im so glad you sent for me i longed to come but waited till you were better you surely are she added as a second glance showed to her the indescribable change which had come upon the face which at first seemed to have both light and color in it  uncle says not but i think he is mistaken because the agony is all gone and except for this odd sinking now and then i dont feel so much amiss he answered feebly but with something of the old lightness in his voice  you will hardly be able to sail in the rajah i fear but you wont mind waiting a little while we nurse you said poor rose trying to talk on quietly with her heart growing heavier every minute  i shall go if im carried ill keep that promise though it costs me my life oh rose you know theyve told you and with a sudden memory of what brought him there he hid his face in the pillow  you broke no promise for i would not let you make one you remember forget all that and let us talk about the better time that may be coming for you  always so generous so kind he murmured with her hand against his feverish cheek then looking up he went on in a tone so humbly contrite it made her eyes fill with slow hot tears  i tried to flee temptation i tried to say no but i am so pitiably weak i couldnt you must despise me but dont give me up entirely for if i live ill do better ill go away to father and begin again  rose tried to keep back the bitter drops but they would fall to hear him still speak hopefully when there was no hope something in the mute anguish of her face seemed to tell him what she could not speak and a quick change came over him as he grasped her hand tighter saying in a sharp whisper have i really got to die rose  her only answer was to kneel down and put her arms about him as if she tried to keep death away a little longer he believed it then and lay so still she looked up in a moment fearing she knew not what  but charlie bore it manfully for he had the courage which can face a great danger bravely though not the strength to fight a bosom sin and conquer it his eyes were fixed as if trying to look into the unseen world whither he was going and his lips firmly set that no word of complaint should spoil the proof he meant to give that though he had not known how to live he did know how to die it seemed to rose as if for one brief instant she saw the man that might have been if early training had taught him how to rule himself and the first words he uttered with a long sigh as his eye came back to her showed that he felt the failure and owned it with pathetic candor  better so perhaps better go before i bring any more sorrow to you and shame to myself id like to stay a little longer and try to redeem the past it seems so wasted now but if i cant dont grieve rose im no loss to anyone and perhaps it is too late to mend  oh dont say that no one will find your place among us we never can forget how much we loved you and you must believe how freely we forgive as we would be forgiven cried rose steadied by the pale despair that had fallen on charlies face with those bitter words  forgive us our trespasses yes i should say that rose im not ready it is so sudden what can i do he whispered clinging to her as if he had no anchor except the creature whom he loved so much  uncle will tell you i am not good enough i can only pray for you and she moved as if to call in the help so sorely needed  no no not yet stay by me darling read something there in grandfathers old book some prayer for such as i it will do me more good from you than any minister alive  she got the venerable book given to charlie because he bore the good mans name and turning to the prayer for the dying read it brokenly while the voice beside her echoed now and then some word that reproved or comforted  the testimony of a good conscience by the sadness of his countenance may his heart be made better christian patience and fortitude leave the world in peace amen  there was silence for a little then rose seeing how wan he looked said softly shall i call uncle now  if you will but first dont smile at my foolishness dear i want my little heart they took it off please give it back and let me keep it always he answered with the old fondness strong as ever even when he could show it only by holding fast the childish trinket which she found and had given him the old agate heart with the faded ribbon put it on and never let them take it off he said and when she asked if there was anything else she could do for him he tried to stretch out his arms to her with a look which asked for more  she kissed him very tenderly on lips and forehead tried to say goodbye but could not speak and groped her way to the door turning for a last look charlies hopeful spirit rose for a moment as if anxious to send her away more cheerful and he said with a shadow of the old blithe smile a feeble attempt at the familiar farewell gesture till tomorrow rose  alas for charlie his tomorrow never came and when she saw him next he lay there looking so serene and noble it seemed as if it must be well with him for all the pain was past temptation ended doubt and fear hope and love could no more stir his quiet heart and in solemn truth he had gone to meet his father and begin again     chapter 16 good works  the rajah was delayed awhile and when it sailed poor mrs clara was on board for everything was ready all thought she had better go to comfort her husband and since her boy died she seemed to care very little what became of her so with friends to cheer the long voyage she sailed away a heavyhearted woman yet not quite disconsolate for she knew her mourning was excessively becoming and felt sure that stephen would not find her altered by her trials as much as might have been expected   then nothing was left of that gay household but the empty rooms silence never broken by a blithe voice anymore and pictures full of promise but all unfinished like poor charlies life  there was much mourning for the bonny prince but no need to tell of it except as it affected rose for it is with her we have most to do the other characters being of secondary importance  when time had soothed the first shock of sudden loss she was surprised to find the memory of his faults and failings short life and piteous death grew dim as if a kindly hand had wiped out the record and given him back to her in the likeness of the brave bright boy she had loved not as the wayward passionate young man who had loved her  this comforted her very much and folding down the last blotted leaf where his name was written she gladly turned back to reopen and reread the happier chapters which painted the youthful knight before he went out to fall in his first battle none of the bitterness of love bereaved marred this memory for rose because she found that the warmer sentiment just budding in her heart had died with charlie and lay cold and quiet in his grave she wondered yet was glad though sometimes a remorseful pang smote her when she discovered how possible it was to go on without him feeling almost as if a burden had been lifted off since his happiness was taken out of her hands the time had not yet come when the knowledge that a mans heart was in her keeping would make the pride and joy of her life and while she waited for that moment she enjoyed the liberty she seemed to have recovered  such being her inward state it much annoyed her to be regarded as a brokenhearted girl and pitied for the loss of her young lover she could not explain to all the world so let it pass and occupied her mind with the good works which always lie ready to be taken up and carried on having chosen philanthropy as her profession she felt that it was high time to begin the task too long neglected  her projects were excellent but did not prosper as rapidly as she hoped for having to deal with people not things unexpected obstacles were constantly arising the home for decayed gentlewomen as the boys insisted on calling her two newly repaired houses started finely and it was a pleasant sight to see the comfortable rooms filled with respectable women busy at their various tasks surrounded by the decencies and many of the comforts which make life endurable but presently rose was disturbed to find that the good people expected her to take care of them in a way she had not bargained for buffum her agent was constantly reporting complaints new wants and general discontent if they were not attended to things were very neglected water pipes froze and burst drains got out of order yards were in a mess and rents behindhand worst of all outsiders instead of sympathizing only laughed and said we told you so which is a most discouraging remark to older and wiser workers than rose  uncle alec however stood by her staunchly and helped her out of many of her woes by good advice and an occasional visit of inspection which did much to impress upon the dwellers there the fact that if they did not do their part their leases would be short ones  i didnt expect to make anything out of it but i did think they would be grateful said rose on one occasion when several complaints had come in at once and buffum had reported great difficulty in collecting the low rents  if you do this thing for the sake of the gratitude then it is a failure but if it is done for the love of helping those who need help it is a success for in spite of their worry every one of these women feel what privileges they enjoy and value them highly said dr alec as they went home after one of these unsatisfactory calls  then the least they can do is to say thank you im afraid i have thought more of the gratitude than the work but if there isnt any i must make up my mind to go without answered rose feeling defrauded of her due  favors often separate instead of attracting people nearer to one another and ive seen many a friendship spoilt by the obligation being all on one side cant explain it but it is so and ive come to the conclusion that it is as hard to give in the right spirit as it is to receive puzzle it out my dear while you are learning to do good for its own sake  i know one sort of people who are grateful and im going to devote my mind to them they thank me in many ways and helping them is all pleasure and no worry come into the hospital and see the dear babies or the asylum and carry oranges to phebes orphans they dont complain and fidget ones life out bless their hearts cried rose cheering up suddenly  after that she left buffum to manage the retreat and devoted her energies to the little folks always so ready to receive the smallest gift and repay the giver with their artless thanks here she found plenty to do and did it with such sweet goodwill that she won her way like sunshine making many a little heart dance over splendid dolls gay picture books and pots of flowers as well as food fire and clothes for the small bodies pinched with want and pain  as spring came new plans sprang up as naturally as dandelions the poor children longed for the country and as the green fields could not come to them rose carried them to the green fields down on the point stood an old farmhouse often used by the campbell tribe for summer holidays that spring it was set to rights unusually early several women installed as housekeeper cook and nurses and when the may days grew bright and warm squads of pale children came to toddle in the grass run over the rocks and play upon the smooth sands of the beach a pretty sight and one that well repaid those who brought it to pass  everyone took an interest in the rose garden as mac named it and the womenfolk were continually driving over to the point for something for the poor dears aunt plenty sowed gingerbread broadcast aunt jessie made pinafores by the dozen while aunt jane kept her eye on the nurses and aunt myra supplied medicines so liberally that the mortality would have been awful if dr alec had not taken them in charge to him this was the most delightful spot in the world and well it might be for he suggested the idea and gave rose all the credit of it he was often there and his appearance was always greeted with shrieks of rapture as the children gathered from all quarters creeping running hopping on crutches or carried in arms which they gladly left to sit on uncle doctors knee for that was the title by which he went among them  he seemed as young as any of his comrades though the curly head was getting gray and the frolics that went on when he arrived were better than any medicine to children who had never learned to play it was a standing joke among the friends that the bachelor brother had the largest family and was the most domestic man of the remaining four though uncle mac did his part manfully and kept aunt jane in a constant fidget by his rash propositions to adopt the heartiest boys and prettiest girls to amuse him and employ her  on one occasion aunt jane had a very narrow escape and the culprit being her son not her husband she felt free to repay herself for many scares of this sort by a good scolding which unlike many produced excellent results  one bright june day as rose came cantering home from the point on her pretty bay pony she saw a man sitting on a fallen tree beside the road and something in his despondent attitude arrested her attention as she drew nearer he turned his head and she stopped short exclaiming in great surprise why mac what are you doing here  trying to solve a problem he answered looking up with a whimsical expression of perplexity and amusement in his face which made rose smile till his next words turned her sober in a twinkling ive eloped with a young lady and dont know what to do with her i took her home of course but mother turned her out of the house and im in a quandary  is that her baggage asked rose pointing with her whip to the large bundle which he held while the wild idea flashed through her head that perhaps he really had done some rash deed of this sort  no this is the young lady herself and opening a corner of the brown shawl he displayed a child of three so pale so thin and tiny that she looked like a small scared bird just fallen from the nest as she shrank away from the light with great frightened eyes and a hand like a little claw tightly clutched a button of macs coat  poor baby where did it come from cried rose leaning down to look  ill tell you the story and then you shall advise me what to do at our hospital weve had a poor woman who got hurt and died two days ago i had nothing to do with her only took her a bit of fruit once or twice for she had big wistful sort of eyes that haunted me the day she died i stopped a minute and the nurse said shed been wanting to speak to me but didnt dare so i asked if i could do anything for her and though she could hardly breathe for pain being almost gone she implored me to take care of baby i found out where the child was and promised id see after her for the poor soul couldnt seem to die till id given her that comfort i never can forget the look in her eyes as i held her hand and said baby shall be taken care of she tried to thank me and died soon after quite peacefully well i went today and hunted up the poor little wretch found her in a miserable place left in the care of an old hag who had shut her up alone to keep her out of the way and there this mite was huddled in a corner crying marmar marmar fit to touch a heart of stone i blew up at the woman and took the baby straightaway for she had been abused it was high time look there will you  mac turned the little skinny arm and showed a blue mark which made rose drop her reins and stretch out both hands crying with a tender sort of indignation how dared they do it give her to me poor little motherless thing  mac laid the bundle in her arms and rose began to cuddle it in the fond foolish way women have a most comfortable and effective way nevertheless and baby evidently felt that things were changing for the better when warm lips touched her cheeks a soft hand smoothed her tumbled hair and a womanly face bent over her with the inarticulate cooings and purrings mothers make the frightened eyes went up to this gentle countenance and rested there as if reassured the little claw crept to the girls neck and poor baby nestled to her with a long sigh and a plaintive murmur of marmar marmar that certainly would have touched a stony heart  now go on no rosa not you said the new nurse as the intelligent animal looked around to see if things were all right before she proceeded  i took the child home to mother not knowing what else to do but she wouldnt have it at any price even for a night she doesnt like children you know and father has joked so much about the pointers that she is quite rampant at the mere idea of a child in the house she told me to take it to the rose garden i said it was running over now and no room even for a mite like this go to the hospital says she baby isnt ill maam says i orphan asylum says she not an orphan got a father who cant take care of her says i take her to the foundling place or mrs gardener or someone whose business it is i will not have the creature here sick and dirty and noisy carry it back and ask rose to tell you what to do with it so my cruel parent cast me forth but relented as i shouldered baby gave me a shawl to put her in a jumble to feed her with and money to pay her board in some good place mothers bark is always worse than her bite you know  and you were trying to think of the good place as you sat here asked rose looking down at him with great approval as he stood patting rosas glossy neck  exactly i didnt want to trouble you for you have your house full already and i really couldnt lay my hand on any good soul who would be bothered with this little forlornity she has nothing to recommend her you see not pretty feeble shy as a mouse no end of care i daresay yet she needs every bit she can get to keep soul and body together if im any judge  rose opened her lips impulsively but closed them without speaking and sat a minute looking straight between rosas ears as if forcing herself to think twice before she spoke mac watched her out of the corner of his eyes as he said in a musing tone tucking the shawl around a pair of shabby little feet the while this seems to be one of the charities that no one wants to undertake yet i cant help feeling that my promise to the mother binds me to something more than merely handing baby over to some busy matron or careless nurse in any of our overcrowded institutions she is such a frail creature she wont trouble anyone long perhaps and i should like to give her just a taste of comfort if not love before she finds her marmar again  lead rosa im going to take this child home and if uncle is willing ill adopt her and she shall be happy cried rose with the sudden glow of feeling that always made her lovely and gathering poor baby close she went on her way like a modern britomart ready to redress the wrongs of any who had need of her  as he led the slowly stepping horse along the quiet road mac could not help thinking that they looked a little like the flight into egypt but he did not say so being a reverent youth only glanced back now and then at the figure above him for rose had taken off her hat to keep the light from babys eyes and sat with the sunshine turning her uncovered hair to gold as she looked down at the little creature resting on the saddle before her with the sweet thoughtfulness one sees in some of correggios young madonnas  no one else saw the picture but mac long remembered it and ever after there was a touch of reverence added to the warm affection he had always borne his cousin rose  what is the childs name was the sudden question which disturbed a brief silence broken only by the sound of pacing hoofs the rustle of green boughs overhead and the blithe caroling of birds  im sure i dont know answered mac suddenly aware that he had fallen out of one quandary into another  didnt you ask  no the mother called her baby and the old woman brat and that is all i know of the first name the last is kennedy you may christen her what you like  then i shall name her dulcinea as you are her knight and call her dulce for short that is a sweet diminutive im sure laughed rose much amused at the idea  don quixote looked pleased and vowed to defend his little lady stoutly beginning his services on the spot by filling the small hands with buttercups thereby winning for himself the first smile babys face had known for weeks  when they got home aunt plenty received her new guest with her accustomed hospitality and on learning the story was as warmly interested as even enthusiastic rose could desire bustling about to make the child comfortable with an energy pleasant to see for the grandmotherly instincts were strong in the old lady and of late had been beautifully developed  in less than half an hour from the time baby went upstairs she came down again on roses arm freshly washed and brushed in a pink gown much too large and a white apron decidedly too small an immaculate pair of socks but no shoes a neat bandage on the bruised arm and a string of spools for a plaything hanging on the other a resigned expression sat upon her little face but the frightened eyes were only shy now and the forlorn heart evidently much comforted  there how do you like your dulce now said rose proudly displaying the work of her hands as she came in with her habit pinned up and carrying a silver porringer of bread and milk  mac knelt down took the small reluctant hand and kissed it as devoutly as ever good alonzo quixada did that of the duchess while he said merrily quoting from the immortal story high and sovereign lady thine till death the knight of the rueful countenance  but baby had no heart for play and withdrawing her hand pointed to the porringer with the suggestive remark dindin now  so rose sat down and fed the duchess while the don stood by and watched the feast with much satisfaction  how nice she looks do you consider shoes unhealthy he asked surveying the socks with respectful interest  no her shoes are drying you must have let her go in the mud  i only put her down for a minute when she howled and she made for a puddle like a duck ill buy her some new ones clothes too where do i go what do i ask for and how much do i get he said diving for his pocketbook amiably anxious but pitiably ignorant  ill see to that we always have things on hand for the pointers as they come along and can soon fit dulce out you may make some inquiries about the father if you will for i dont want to have her taken away just as i get fond of her do you know anything about him  only that he is in state prison for twentyone years and not likely to trouble you  how dreadful i really think phebe was better off to have none at all ill go to work at once then and try to bring up the convicts little daughter to be a good woman so that she will have an honest name of her own since he has nothing but disgrace to give her  uncle can show you how to do that if you need any help he has been so successful in his first attempt i fancy you wont require much said mac picking up the spools for the sixth time  yes i shall for it is a great responsibility and i do not undertake it lightly answered rose soberly though the doublebarreled compliment pleased her very much  im sure phebe has turned out splendidly and you began very early with her  so i did thats encouraging dear thing how bewildered she looked when i proposed adopting her i remember all about it for uncle had just come and i was quite crazy over a box of presents and rushed at phebe as she was cleaning brasses how little i thought my childish offer would end so well and rose fell amusing with a happy smile on her face while baby picked the last morsels out of the porringer with her own busy fingers  it certainly had ended well for phebe at the end of six months not only had a good place as choir singer but several young pupils and excellent prospects for the next winter  accept the blessing of a poor young man whose lucky steps have led him to your door and let me help as much as i can goodbye my dulcinea  and with a farewell stroke of the smooth head mac went away to report his success to his mother who in spite of her seeming harshness was already planning how she could best befriend this inconvenient baby     chapter 17 among the haycocks  uncle alec did not object and finding that no one had any claim upon the child permitted rose to keep it for a time at least so little dulce newly equipped even to a name took her place among them and slowly began to thrive but she did not grow pretty and never was a gay attractive child for she seemed to have been born in sorrow and brought up in misery a pale pensive little creature always creeping into corners and looking timidly out as if asking leave to live and when offered playthings taking them with a meek surprise that was very touching  rose soon won her heart and then almost wished she had not for baby clung to her with inconvenient fondness changing her former wail of marmar into a lament for aunty wose if separated long nevertheless there was great satisfaction in cherishing the little waif for she learned more than she could teach and felt a sense of responsibility which was excellent ballast for her enthusiastic nature  kitty van who made rose her model in all things was immediately inspired to go and do likewise to the great amusement as well as annoyance of her family selecting the prettiest liveliest child in the asylum she took it home on trial for a week a perfect cherub she pronounced it the first day but an enfant terrible before the week was over for the young hero rioted by day howled by night ravaged the house from top to bottom and kept his guardians in a series of panics by his hairbreadth escapes so early on saturday poor exhausted kitty restored the cherub with many thanks and decided to wait until her views of education were rather more advanced  as the warm weather came on rose announced that dulce needed mountain air for she dutifully repeated as many of dr alecs prescriptions as possible and remembering how much good cozy corner did her long ago resolved to try it on her baby aunt jessie and jamie went with her and mother atkinson received them as cordially as ever the pretty daughters were all married and gone but a stout damsel took their place and nothing seemed changed except that the old heads were grayer and the young ones a good deal taller than six years ago  jamie immediately fraternized with neighboring boys and devoted himself to fishing with an ardor which deserved greater success aunt jessie reveled in reading for which she had no time at home and lay in her hammock a happy woman with no socks to darn buttons to sew or housekeeping cares to vex her soul rose went about with dulce like a very devoted hen with one rather feeble chicken for she was anxious to have this treatment work well and tended her little patient with daily increasing satisfaction dr alec came up to pass a few days and pronounced the child in a most promising condition but the grand event of the season was the unexpected arrival of phebe  two of her pupils had invited her to join them in a trip to the mountains and she ran away from the great hotel to surprise her little mistress with a sight of her so well and happy that rose had no anxiety left on her account  three delightful days they spent roaming about together talking as only girls can talk after a long separation and enjoying one another like a pair of lovers as if to make it quite perfect by one of those remarkable coincidences which sometimes occur archie happened to run up for the sunday so phebe had her surprise and aunt jessie and the telegraph kept their secret so well no one ever knew what maternal machinations brought the happy accident to pass  then rose saw a very pretty pastoral bit of lovemaking and long after it was over and phebe gone one way archie another the echo of sweet words seemed to linger in the air tender ghosts to haunt the pine grove and even the big coffeepot had a halo of romance about it for its burnished sides reflected the soft glances the lovers interchanged as one filled the others cup at that last breakfast  rose found these reminiscences more interesting than any novel she had read and often beguiled her long leisure by planning a splendid future for her phebe as she trotted about after her baby in the lovely july weather  on one of the most perfect days she sat under an old apple tree on the slope behind the house where they used to play before her opened the wide intervale dotted with haymakers at their picturesque work on the left flowed the swift river fringed with graceful elms in their bravest greenery on the right rose the purple hills serene and grand and overhead glowed the midsummer sky which glorified it all  little dulce tired of play lay fast asleep in the nest she had made in one of the haycocks close by and rose leaned against the gnarled old tree dreaming daydreams with her work at her feet happy and absorbing fancies they seemed to be for her face was beautifully tranquil and she took no heed of the train which suddenly went speeding down the valley leaving a white cloud behind its rumble concealed the sound of approaching steps and her eyes never turned from the distant hills till the abrupt appearance of a very sunburned but smiling young man made her jump up exclaiming joyfully why mac where did you drop from  the top of mount washington how do you do  never better wont you go in you must be tired after such a fall  no thank you ive seen the old lady she told me aunt jessie and the boy had gone to town and that you were settin round in the old place i came on at once and will take a lounge here if you dont mind answered mac unstrapping his knapsack and taking a haycock as if it were a chair  rose subsided into her former seat surveying her cousin with much satisfaction as she said this is the third surprise ive had since i came uncle popped in upon us first then phebe and now you have you had a pleasant tramp uncle said you were off  delightful i feel as if id been in heaven or near it for about three weeks and thought id break the shock of coming down to the earth by calling here on my way home  you look as if heaven suited you brown as a berry but so fresh and happy i should never guess you had been scrambling down a mountain said rose trying to discover why he looked so well in spite of the blue flannel suit and dusty shoes for there was a certain sylvan freshness about him as he sat there full of reposeful strength the hills seemed to have given the wholesome cheerful days of air and sunshine put into a man and the clear bright look of one who had caught glimpses of a new world from the mountaintop  tramping agrees with me i took a dip in the river as i came along and made my toilet in a place where miltons sabrina might have lived he said shaking back his damp hair and settling the knot of scarlet bunchberries stuck in his buttonhole  you look as if you found the nymph at home said rose knowing how much he liked the comus  i found her here and he made a little bow  thats very pretty and ill give you one in return you grow more like uncle alec every day and i think ill call you alec jr  alexander the great wouldnt thank you for that and mac did not look as grateful as she had expected  very like indeed except the forehead his is broad and benevolent yours high and arched do you know if you had no beard and wore your hair long i really think youd look like milton added rose sure that would please him  it certainly did amuse him for he lay back on the hay and laughed so heartily that his merriment scared the squirrel on the wall and woke dulce  you ungrateful boy will nothing suit you when i say you look like the best man i know you gave a shrug and when i liken you to a great poet you shout im afraid you are very conceited mac and rose laughed too glad to see him so gay  if i am it is your fault nothing i can do will ever make a milton of me unless i go blind someday he said sobering at the thought  you once said a man could be what he liked if he tried hard enough so why shouldnt you be a poet asked rose liking to trip him up with his own words as he often did her  i thought i was to be an md  you might be both there have been poetical doctors you know  would you like me to be such a one asked mac looking at her as seriously as if he really thought of trying it  no id rather have you one or the other i dont care which only you must be famous in either you choose im very ambitious for you because i insist upon it you are a genius of some sort i think it is beginning to simmer already and ive got a great curiosity to know what it will turn out to be  macs eyes shone as she said that but before he could speak a little voice said aunty wose and he turned to find dulce sitting up in her nest staring at the broad blue back before her with round eyes  do you know your don he asked offering his hand with respectful gentleness for she seemed a little doubtful whether he was a friend or stranger  it is mat said rose and that familiar word seemed to reassure the child at once for leaning forward she kissed him as if quite used to doing it  i picked up some toys for her by the way and she shall have them at once to pay for that i didnt expect to be so graciously received by this shy mouse said mac much gratified for dulce was very chary of her favors  she knew you for i always carry my home album with me and when she comes to your picture she always kisses it because i never want her to forget her first friend explained rose pleased with her pupil  first but not best answered mac rummaging in his knapsack for the promised toys which he set forth upon the hay before delighted dulce  neither picture books nor sweeties but berries strung on long stems of grass acorns and pretty cones bits of rock shining with mica several bluebirds feathers and a nest of moss with white pebbles for eggs  dearest nature strong and kind knows what children love and has plenty of such playthings ready for them all if one only knows how to find them these were received with rapture and leaving the little creature to enjoy them in her own quiet way mac began to tumble the things back into his knapsack again two or three books lay near rose and she took up one which opened at a place marked by a scribbled paper  keats i didnt know you condescended to read anything so modern she said moving the paper to see the page beneath  mac looked up snatched the book out of her hand and shook down several more scraps then returned it with a curiously shamefaced expression saying as he crammed the papers into his pocket i beg pardon but it was full of rubbish oh yes im fond of keats dont you know him  i used to read him a good deal but uncle found me crying over the pot of basil and advised me to read less poetry for a while or i should get too sentimental answered rose turning the pages without seeing them for a new idea had just popped into her head  the eve of st agnes is the most perfect love story in the world i think said mac enthusiastically  read it to me i feel just like hearing poetry and you will do it justice if you are fond of it said rose handing him the book with an innocent air  nothing id like better but it is rather long  ill tell you to stop if i get tired baby wont interrupt she will be contented for an hour with those pretty things  as if well pleased with his task mac laid himself comfortably on the grass and leaning his head on his hand read the lovely story as only one could who entered fully into the spirit of it rose watched him closely and saw how his face brightened over some quaint fancy delicate description or delicious word heard how smoothly the melodious measures fell from his lips and read something more than admiration in his eyes as he looked up now and then to mark if she enjoyed it as much as he  she could not help enjoying it for the poets pen painted as well as wrote and the little romance lived before her but she was not thinking of john keats as she listened she was wondering if this cousin was a kindred spirit born to make such music and leave as sweet an echo behind him it seemed as if it might be and after going through the rough caterpillar and the pentup chrysalis changes the beautiful butterfly would appear to astonish and delight them all so full of this fancy was she that she never thanked him when the story ended but leaning forward asked in a tone that made him start and look as if he had fallen from the clouds mac do you ever write poetry  never  what do you call the song phebe sang with her bird chorus  that was nothing till she put the music to it but she promised not to tell  she didnt i suspected and now i know laughed rose delighted to have caught him  much discomfited mac gave poor keats a fling and leaning on both elbows tried to hide his face for it had reddened like that of a modest girl when teased about her lover  you neednt look so guilty it is no sin to write poetry said rose amused at his confession  its a sin to call that rubbish poetry muttered mac with great scorn  it is a greater sin to tell a fib and say you never write it  reading so much sets one thinking about such things and every fellow scribbles a little jingle when he is lazy or in love you know explained mac looking very guilty  rose could not quite understand the change she saw in him till his last words suggested a cause which she knew by experience was apt to inspire young men leaning forward again she asked solemnly though her eyes danced with fun mac are you in love  do i look like it and he sat up with such an injured and indignant face that she apologized at once for he certainly did not look loverlike with hayseed in his hair several lively crickets playing leapfrog over his back and a pair of long legs stretching from tree to haycock  no you dont and i humbly beg your pardon for making such an unwarrantable insinuation it merely occurred to me that the general upliftedness i observe in you might be owing to that since it wasnt poetry  it is the good company ive been keeping if anything a fellow cant spend a week with thoreau and not be the better for it im glad i show it because in the scramble life is to most of us even an hour with such a sane simple and sagacious soul as his must help one said mac taking a much worn book out of his pocket with the air of introducing a dear and honored friend  ive read bits and like them they are so original and fresh and sometimes droll said rose smiling to see what natural and appropriate marks of approbation the elements seemed to set upon the pages mac was turning eagerly for one had evidently been rained on a crushed berry stained another some appreciative fieldmouse or squirrel had nibbled one corner and the cover was faded with the sunshine which seemed to have filtered through to the thoughts within  heres a characteristic bit for you i would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself than be crowded on a velvet cushion i would rather ride on earth in an oxcart with free circulation than go to heaven in the fancy car of an excursion train and breathe malaria all the way  ive tried both and quite agree with him laughed mac and skimming down another page gave her a paragraph here and there  read the best books first or you may not have a chance to read them at all  we do not learn much from learned books but from sincere human books frank honest biographies  at least let us have healthy books let the poet be as vigorous as the sugar maple with sap enough to maintain his own verdure besides what runs into the trough and not like a vine which being cut in the spring bears no fruit but bleeds to death in the endeavor to heal its wounds  that will do for you said rose still thinking of the new suspicion which pleased her by its very improbability  mac flashed a quick look at her and shut the book saying quietly although his eyes shone and a conscious smile lurked about his mouth we shall see and no one need meddle for as my thoreau says      whateer we leave to god god does     and blesses us the work we choose should be our own     god lets alone  rose sat silent as if conscious that she deserved his poetical reproof  come you have catechized me pretty well now ill take my turn and ask you why you look uplifted as you call it what have you been doing to make yourself more like your namesake than ever asked mac carrying war into the enemys camp with the sudden question  nothing but live and enjoy doing it i actually sit here day after day as happy and contented with little things as dulce is and feel as if i wasnt much older than she answered the girl feeling as if some change was going on in that pleasant sort of pause but unable to describe it  as if a rose should shut and be a bud again murmured mac borrowing from his beloved keats  ah but i cant do that i must go on blooming whether i like it or not and the only trouble i have is to know what leaf i ought to unfold next said rose playfully smoothing out the white gown in which she looked very like a daisy among the green  how far have you got asked mac continuing his catechism as if the fancy suited him  let me see since i came home last year ive been gay then sad then busy and now i am simply happy i dont know why but seem to be waiting for what is to come next and getting ready for it perhaps unconsciously she said looking dreamily away to the hills again is if the new experience was coming to her from afar  mac watched her thoughtfully for a minute wondering how many more leaves must unfold before the golden heart of this human flower would lie open to the sun he felt a curious desire to help in some way and could think of none better than to offer her what he had found most helpful to himself picking up another book he opened it at a place where an oak leaf lay and handing it to her said as if presenting something very excellent and precious if you want to be ready to take whatever comes in a brave and noble way read that and the one where the page is turned down  rose took it saw the words selfreliance and turning the leaves read here and there a passage which was marked my life is for itself and not for a spectacle  insist on yourself never imitate that which each can do best none but his maker can teach him  do that which is assigned to you and you cannot hope or dare too much  then coming to the folded page whose title was heroism she read and brightened as she read  let the maiden with erect soul walk serenely on her way accept the hint of each new experience search in turn all the objects that solicit her eye that she may learn the power and the charm of her newborn being  the fair girl who repels interference by a decided and proud choice of influences inspires every beholder with something of her own nobleness and the silent heart encourages her o friend never strike sail to a fear come into port greatly or sail with god the seas  you understand that dont you asked mac as she glanced up with the look of one who had found something suited to her taste and need  yes but i never dared to read these essays because i thought they were too wise for me  the wisest things are sometimes the simplest i think everyone welcomes light and air and cannot do without them yet very few could explain them truly i dont ask you to read or understand all of that dont myself but i do recommend the two essays ive marked as well as love and friendship try them and let me know how they suit ill leave you the book  thanks i wanted something fine to read up here and judging by what i see i fancy this will suit only aunt jessie may think im putting on airs if i try emerson  why should she he has done more to set young men and women thinking than any man in this century at least dont you be afraid if it is what you want take it and go ahead as he tells you      without halting without rest     lifting better up to best  ill try said rose meekly feeling that mac had been going ahead himself much faster than she had any suspicion  here a voice exclaimed hallo and looking around jamie was discovered surveying them critically as he stood in an independent attitude like a small colossus of rhodes in brown linen with a bundle of molasses candy in one hand several new fishhooks cherished carefully in the other and his hat well on the back of his head displaying as many freckles as one somewhat limited nose could reasonably accommodate  how are you young one said mac nodding  tiptop glad its you thought archie might have turned up again and hes no fun where did you come from what did you come for how long are you going to stay want a bit its jolly good  with which varied remarks jamie approached shook hands in a manly way and sitting down beside his long cousin hospitably offered sticks of candy all around  did you get any letters asked rose declining the sticky treat  lots but mama forgot to give em to me and i was rather in a hurry for mrs atkinson said somebody had come and i couldnt wait explained jamie reposing luxuriously with his head on macs legs and his mouth full  ill step and get them aunty must be tired and we should enjoy reading the news together  she is the most convenient girl that ever was observed jamie as rose departed thinking mac might like some more substantial refreshment than sweetmeats  i should think so if you let her run your errands you lazy little scamp answered mac looking after her as she went up the green slope for there was something very attractive to him about the slender figure in a plain white gown with a black sash about the waist and all the wavy hair gathered to the top of the head with a little black bow  sort of preraphaelite and quite refreshing after the furbelowed creatures at the hotels he said to himself as she vanished under the arch of scarlet runners over the garden gate  oh well she likes it rose is fond of me and im very good to her when i have time continued jamie calmly explaining i let her cut out a fishhook when it caught in my leg with a sharp penknife and youd better believe it hurt but i never squirmed a bit and she said i was a brave boy and then one day i got left on my desert island out in the pond you know the boat floated off and there i was for as much as an hour before i could make anyone hear but rose thought i might be there and down she came and told me to swim ashore it wasnt far but the water was horrid cold and i didnt like it i started though just as she said and got on all right till about halfway then cramp or something made me shut up and howl and she came after me slapdash and pulled me ashore yes sir as wet as a turtle and looked so funny i laughed and that cured the cramp wasnt i good to mind when she said come on  she was to dive after such a scapegrace i guess you lead her a life of it and id better take you home with me in the morning suggested mac rolling the boy over and giving him a goodnatured pummeling on the haycock while dulce applauded from her nest  when rose returned with icecold milk gingerbread and letters she found the reader of emerson up in the tree pelting and being pelted with green apples as jamie vainly endeavored to get at him the siege ended when aunt jessie appeared and the rest of the afternoon was spent in chat about home affairs  early the next morning mac was off and rose went as far as the old church with him  shall you walk all the way she asked as he strode along beside her in the dewy freshness of the young day  only about twenty miles then take car and whisk back to my work he answered breaking a delicate fern for her  are you never lonely  never i take my best friends along you know and he gave a slap to the pocket from which peeped the volume of thoreau  im afraid you leave your very best behind you said rose alluding to the book he had lent her yesterday  im glad to share it with you i have much of it here and a little goes a great way as you will soon discover he answered tapping his head  i hope the reading will do as much for me as it seems to have done for you im happy but you are wise and good i want to be also  read away and digest it well then write and tell me what you think of it will you he asked as they paused where the four roads met  if you will answer shall you have time with all your other work poetry i beg pardon medicine is very absorbing you know answered rose mischievously for just then as he stood bareheaded in the shadows of the leaves playing over his fine forehead she remembered the chat among the haycocks and he did not look at all like an md  ill make time  goodbye milton  goodbye sabrina     chapter 18 which was it  rose did read and digest and found her days much richer for the good company she kept for an introduction to so much that was wise beautiful and true could not but make that month a memorable one it is not strange that while the young man most admired heroism and selfreliance the girl preferred love and friendship reading them over and over like prose poems as they are to the fitting accompaniment of sunshine solitude and sympathy for letters went to and fro with praiseworthy regularity  rose much enjoyed this correspondence and found herself regretting that it was at an end when she went home in september for mac wrote better than he talked though he could do that remarkably well when he chose but she had no chance to express either pleasure or regret for the first time she saw him after her return the great change in his appearance made her forget everything else some whim had seized him to be shaven and shorn and when he presented himself to welcome rose she hardly knew him the shaggy hair was nicely trimmed and brushed the cherished brown beard entirely gone showing a wellcut mouth and handsome chin and giving a new expression to the whole face  are you trying to look like keats she asked after a critical glance which left her undecided whether the change was an improvement or not  i am trying not to look like uncle answered mac coolly  and why if you please demanded rose in great surprise  because i prefer to look like myself and not resemble any other man no matter how good or great he may be  you havent succeeded then for you look now very much like the young augustus returned rose rather pleased on the whole to see what a finely shaped head appeared after the rough thatch was off  trust a woman to find a comparison for everything under the sun laughed mac not at all flattered by the one just made what do you think of me on the whole he asked a minute later as he found rose still scrutinizing him with a meditative air  havent made up my mind it is such an entire change i dont know you and feel as if i ought to be introduced you certainly look much more tidy and i fancy i shall like it when im used to seeing a somewhat distinguishedlooking man about the house instead of my old friend orson answered rose with her head on one side to get a profile view  dont tell uncle why i did it please he thinks it was for the sake of coolness and likes it so take no notice they are all used to me now and dont mind said mac roving about the room as if rather ashamed of his whim after all  no i wont but you mustnt mind if im not as sociable as usual for a while i never can be with strangers and you really do seem like one that will be a punishment for your want of taste and love of originality returned rose resolved to punish him for the slight put upon her beloved uncle  as you like i wont trouble you much anyway for im going to be very busy may go to l this winter if uncle thinks best and then my originality cant annoy you  i hope you wont go why mac im just getting to know and enjoy you and thought wed have a nice time this winter reading something together must you go and rose seemed to forget his strangeness as she held him still by one button while she talked  that would be nice but i feel as if i must go my plans are all made and ive set my heart on it answered mac looking so eager that rose released him saying sadly i suppose it is natural for you all to get restless and push off but it is hard for me to let you go one after the other and stay here alone charlie is gone archie and steve are wrapped up in their sweethearts the boys away and only jamie left to play with rose  but ill come back and youll be glad i went if i bring you my began mac with sudden animation then stopped abruptly to bite his lips as if he had nearly said too much  your what asked rose curiously for he neither looked nor acted like himself  i forgot how long it takes to get a diploma he said walking away again  there will be one comfort if you go youll see phebe and can tell me all about her for she is so modest she doesnt half do it i shall want to know how she gets on if she is engaged to sing ballads in the concerts they talk of for next winter you will write wont you  oh yes no doubt of that and mac laughed low to himself as he stooped to look at the little psyche on the mantelpiece what a pretty thing it is he added soberly as he took it up  be careful uncle gave it to me last new year and im very fond of it she is just lifting her lamp to see what cupid is like for she hasnt seen him yet said rose busy putting her worktable in order  you ought to have a cupid for her to look at she has been waiting patiently a whole year with nothing but a bronze lizard in sight said mac with the halfshy halfdaring look which was so new and puzzling  cupid fled away as soon as she woke him you know and she had a bad time of it she must wait longer till she can find and keep him  do you know she looks like you hair tied up in a knot and a spiritual sort of face dont you see it asked mac turning the graceful little figure toward her  not a bit of it i wonder whom i shall resemble next ive been compared to a fra angelico angel saint agnes and now syke as annabel once called her  youd see what i mean if youd ever watched your own face when you were listening to music talking earnestly or much moved then your soul gets into your eyes and you are like psyche  tell me the next time you see me in a soulful state and ill look in the glass for id like to see if it is becoming said rose merrily as she sorted her gay worsteds      your feet in the fullgrown grasses     moved soft as a soft wind blows     you passed me as april passes     with a face made out of a rose  murmured mac under his breath thinking of the white figure going up a green slope one summer day then as if chiding himself for sentimentality he set psyche down with great care and began to talk about a course of solid reading for the winter  after that rose saw very little of him for several weeks as he seemed to be making up for lost time and was more odd and absent than ever when he did appear  as she became accustomed to the change in his external appearance she discovered that he was altering fast in other ways and watched the distinguishedlooking gentleman with much interest saying to herself when she saw a new sort of dignity about him alternating with an unusual restlessness of manner and now and then a touch of sentiment genius is simmering just as i predicted  as the family were in mourning there were no festivities on roses twentyfirst birthday though the boys had planned all sorts of rejoicings everyone felt particularly tender toward their girl on that day remembering how poor charlie had loved her and they tried to show it in the gifts and good wishes they sent her she found her sanctum all aglow with autumn leaves and on her table so many rare and pretty things she quite forgot she was an heiress and only felt how rich she was in loving friends  one gift greatly pleased her though she could not help smiling at the source from whence it came for mac sent her a cupid not the chubby child with a face of naughty merriment but a slender winged youth leaning on his unstrung bow with a broken arrow at his feet a poem to psyche came with it and rose was much surprised at the beauty of the lines for instead of being witty complimentary or gay there was something nobler than mere sentiment in them and the sweet old fable lived again in language which fitly painted the maiden soul looking for a love worthy to possess it  rose read them over and over as she sat among the gold and scarlet leaves which glorified her little room and each time found new depth and beauty in them looking from the words that made music in her ear to the lovely shapes that spoke with their mute grace to her eye the whole thing suited her exactly it was so delicate and perfect in its way for she was tired of costly gifts and valued very much this proof of her cousins taste and talent seeing nothing in it but an affectionate desire to please her  all the rest dropped in at intervals through the day to say a loving word and last of all came mac rose happened to be alone with dulce enjoying a splendid sunset from her western window for october gave her child a beautiful good night  rose turned around as he entered and putting down the little girl went to him with the evening red shining on her happy face as she said gratefully dear mac it was so lovely i dont know how to thank you for it in any way but this and drawing down his tall head she gave him the birthday kiss she had given all the others  but this time it produced a singular effect for mac turned scarlet then grew pale and when rose added playfully thinking to relieve the shyness of so young a poet never again say you dont write poetry or call your verses rubbish i knew you were a genius and now im sure of it he broke out as if against his will no it isnt genius it is love then as she shrank a little startled at his energy he added with an effort at selfcontrol which made his voice sound strange i didnt mean to speak but i cant suffer you to deceive yourself so i must tell the truth and not let you kiss me like a cousin when i love you with all my heart and soul  oh mac dont joke cried rose bewildered by this sudden glimpse into a heart she thought she knew so well  im in solemn earnest he answered steadily in such a quiet tone that but for the pale excitement of his face she might have doubted his words be angry if you will i expect it for i know it is too soon to speak i ought to wait for years perhaps but you seemed so happy i dared to hope you had forgotten  forgotten what asked rose sharply  charlie  ah you all will insist on believing that i loved him better than i did she cried with both pain and impatience in her voice for the family delusion tried her very much at times  how could we help it when he was everything women most admire said mac not bitterly but as if he sometimes wondered at their want of insight  i do not admire weakness of any sort i could never love without either confidence or respect do me the justice to believe that for im tired of being pitied  she spoke almost passionately being more excited by macs repressed emotion than she had ever been by charlies most touching demonstration though she did not know why  but he loved you so began mac feeling as if a barrier had suddenly gone down but not daring to venture in as yet  that was the hard part of it that was why i tried to love him why i hoped he would stand fast for my sake if not for his own and why i found it so sad sometimes not to be able to help despising him for his want of courage i dont know how others feel but to me love isnt all i must look up not down trust and honor with my whole heart and find strength and integrity to lean on i have had it so far and i know i could not live without it  your ideal is a high one do you hope to find it rose mac asked feeling with the humility of a genuine love that he could not give her all she desired  yes she answered with a face full of the beautiful confidence in virtue the instinctive desire for the best which so many of us lose too soon to find again after lifes great lessons are well learned i do hope to find it because i try not to be unreasonable and expect perfection smile if you will but i wont give up my hero yet and she tried to speak lightly hoping to lead him away from a more dangerous topic  youll have to look a long while im afraid and all the glow was gone out of macs face for he understood her wish and knew his answer had been given  i have uncle to help me and i think my ideal grew out of my knowledge of him how can i fail to believe in goodness when he shows me what it can be and do  its no use for me to say any more for i have very little to offer i did not mean to say a word till i earned a right to hope for something in return i cannot take it back but i can wish you success and i do because you deserve the very best and mac moved as if he was going away without more words accepting the inevitable as manfully as he could  thank you that makes me feel very ungrateful and unkind i wish i could answer you as you want me to for indeed dear mac im very fond of you in my own way and rose looked up with such tender pity and frank affection in her face it was no wonder the poor fellow caught at a ray of hope and brightening suddenly said in his own odd way couldnt you take me on trial while you are waiting for a true hero it may be years before you find him meantime you could be practicing on me in ways that would be useful when you get him  oh mac what shall i do with you exclaimed rose so curiously affected by this very characteristic wooing that she did not know whether to laugh or cry for he was looking at her with his heart in his eyes though his proposition was the queerest ever made at such a time  just go on being fond of me in your own way and let me love you as much as i like in mine ill try to be satisfied with that and he took both her hands so beseechingly that she felt more ungrateful than ever  no it would not be fair for you would love the most and if the hero did appear what would become of you  i should resemble uncle alec in one thing at least fidelity for my first love would be my last  that went straight to roses heart and for a minute she stood silent looking down at the two strong hands that held hers so firmly yet so gently and the thought went through her mind must he too be solitary all his life i have no dear lover as my mother had why cannot i make him happy and forget myself  it did not seem very hard and she owned that even while she told herself that compassion was no equivalent for love she wanted to give all she could and keep as much of macs affection as she honestly might because it seemed to grow more sweet and precious when she thought of putting it away  you will be like uncle in happier ways than that i hope for you too must have a high ideal and find her and be happy she said resolving to be true to the voice of conscience not be swayed by the impulse of the moment  i have found her but i dont see any prospect of happiness do you he asked wistfully  dear mac i cannot give you the love you want but i do trust and respect you from the bottom of my heart if that is any comfort began rose looking up with eyes full of contrition for the pain her reply must give  she got no further however for those last words wrought a marvelous change in mac dropping her hands he stood erect as if inspired with sudden energy and hope while over his face there came a brave bright look which for the moment made him a nobler and comelier man than ever handsome prince had been it is a comfort he said in a tone of gratitude that touched her very much you said your love must be founded on respect and that you have given me why can i not earn the rest im nothing now but everything is possible when one loves with all his heart and soul and strength rose i will be your hero if a mortal man can even though i have to work and wait for years ill make you love me and be glad to do it dont be frightened ive not lost my wits ive just found them i dont ask anything ill never speak of my hope but it is no use to stop me i must try it and i will succeed  with the last words uttered in a ringing voice while his face glowed his eyes shone and he looked as if carried out of himself by the passion that possessed him mac abruptly left the room like one eager to change words to deeds and begin his task at once  rose was so amazed by all this that she sat down trembling a little not with fear or anger but a feeling half pleasure half pain and a sense of some new power subtle strong and sweet that had come into her life it seemed as if another mac had taken the place of the one she had known so long an ardent ambitious man ready for any work now that the magical moment had come when everything seems possible to love if hope could work such a marvelous change for a moment could not happiness do it for a lifetime it would be an exciting experiment to try she thought remembering the sudden illumination which made that familiar face both beautiful and strange  she could not help wondering how long this unsuspected sentiment had been growing in his heart and felt perplexed by its peculiar demonstration for she had never had a lover like this before it touched and flattered her nevertheless and she could not but feel honored by a love so genuine and generous for it seemed to make a man of mac all at once and a manly man too who was not daunted by disappointment but could hope against hope and resolve to make her love him if it took years to do it  there was the charm of novelty about this sort of wooing and she tried to guess how he would set about it felt curious to see how he would behave when next they met and was half angry with herself for not being able to decide how she ought to act the more she thought the more bewildered she grew for having made up her mind that mac was a genius it disturbed all her plans to find him a lover and such an ardent one as it was impossible to predict what would come next she gave up trying to prepare for it and tired with vain speculations carried dulce off to bed wishing she could tuck away her love troubles as quietly and comfortably as she did her sleepy little charge  simple and sincere in all things mac gave rose a new surprise by keeping his promise to the letter asked nothing of her said nothing of his hope and went on as if nothing had happened quite in the old friendly way no not quite for now and then when she least expected it she saw again the indescribable expression on his face a look that seemed to shed a sudden sunshine over her making her eyes fall involuntarily her color rise and her heart beat quicker for a moment not a word did he say but she felt that a new atmosphere surrounded her when he was by and although he used none of the little devices most lovers employ to keep the flame alight it was impossible to forget that underneath his quietude there was a hidden world of fire and force ready to appear at a touch a word from her  this was rather dangerous knowledge for rose and she soon began to feel that there were more subtle temptations than she had expected for it was impossible to be unconscious of her power or always to resist the trials of it which daily came unsought she had never felt this desire before for charlie was the only one who had touched her heart and he was constantly asking as well as giving and wearied her by demanding too much or oppressed her by offering more than she could accept  mac did neither he only loved her silently patiently hopefully and this generous sort of fidelity was very eloquent to a nature like hers she could not refuse or chide since nothing was asked or urged there was no need of coldness for he never presumed no call for pity since he never complained all that could be done was to try and be as just and true as he was and to wait as trustfully for the end whatever it was to be  for a time she liked the new interest it put into her life yet did nothing to encourage it and thought that if she gave this love no food it would soon starve to death but it seemed to thrive on air and presently she began to feel as if a very strong will was slowly but steadily influencing her in many ways if mac had never told her that he meant to make her love him she might have yielded unconsciously but now she mistook the impulse to obey this undercurrent for compassion and resisted stoutly not comprehending yet the reason for the unrest which took possession of her about this time  she had as many moods as an april day and would have much surprised dr alec by her vagaries had he known them all he saw enough however to guess what was the matter but took no notice for he knew this fever must run its course and much medicine only does harm the others were busy about their own affairs and aunt plenty was too much absorbed in her rheumatism to think of love for the cold weather set in early and the poor lady kept her room for days at a time with rose as nurse  mac had spoken of going away in november and rose began to hope he would for she decided that this silent sort of adoration was bad for her as it prevented her from steadily pursuing the employments she had marked out for that year what was the use of trying to read useful books when her thoughts continually wandered to those charming essays on love and friendship to copy antique casts when all the masculine heads looked like cupid and the feminine ones like the psyche on her mantelpiece to practice the best music if it ended in singing over and over the pretty spring song without phebes bird chorus dulces company was pleasantest now for dulce seldom talked so much meditation was possible even aunt plentys red flannel camphor and ponds extract were preferable to general society and long solitary rides on rosa seemed the only thing to put her in tune after one of her attempts to find out what she ought to do or leave undone  she made up her mind at last and arming herself with an unmade pen like fanny squeers she boldly went into the study to confer with dr alec at an hour when mac was usually absent i want a pen for marking can you make me one uncle she asked popping her head in to be sure he was alone  yes my dear answered a voice so like the doctors that she entered without delay  but before she had taken three steps she stopped looking rather annoyed for the head that rose from behind the tall desk was not rough and gray but brown and smooth and mac not uncle alec sat there writing late experience had taught her that she had nothing to fear from a teteatete and having with difficulty taken a resolution she did not like to fail of carrying it out  dont get up i wont trouble you if you are busy there is no hurry she said not quite sure whether it were wiser to stay or run away  mac settled the point by taking the pen out of her hand and beginning to cut it as quietly as nicholas did on that thrilling occasion perhaps he was thinking of that for he smiled as he asked hard or soft  rose evidently had forgotten that the family of squeers ever existed for she answered hard please in a voice to match im glad to see you doing that she added taking courage from his composure and going as straight to her point as could be expected of a woman  and i am very glad to do it  i dont mean making pens but the romance i advised and she touched the closely written page before him looking as if she would like to read it  that is my abstract on a lecture on the circulation of the blood he answered kindly turning it so that she could see i dont write romances im living one and he glanced up with the happy hopeful expression which always made her feel as if he was heaping coals of fire on her head  i wish you wouldnt look at me in that way it fidgets me she said a little petulantly for she had been out riding and knew that she did not present a spiritual appearance after the frosty air had reddened nose as well as cheeks  ill try to remember it does itself before i know it perhaps this may mend matters and taking out the blue glasses he sometimes wore in the wind he gravely put them on  rose could not help laughing but his obedience only aggravated her for she knew he could observe her all the better behind his ugly screen  no it wont they are not becoming and i dont want to look blue when i do not feel so she said finding it impossible to guess what he would do next or to help enjoying his peculiarities  but you dont to me for in spite of the goggles everything is rosecolored now and he pocketed the glasses without a murmur at the charming inconsistency of his idol  really mac im tired of this nonsense it worries me and wastes your time  never worked harder but does it really trouble you to know i love you he asked anxiously  dont you see how cross it makes me and she walked away feeling that things were not going as she intended to have them at all  i dont mind the thorns if i get the rose at last and i still hope i may some ten years hence said this persistent suitor quite undaunted by the prospect of a long wait  i think it is rather hard to be loved whether i like it or not objected rose at a loss how to make any headway against such indomitable hopefulness  but you cant help it nor can i so i must go on doing it with all my heart till you marry and then well then im afraid i may hate somebody instead and mac spoilt the pen by an involuntary slash of his knife  please dont mac  do which love or hate  dont do either go and care for someone else there are plenty of nice girls who will be glad to make you happy said rose intent upon ending her disquiet in some way  that is too easy i enjoy working for my blessings and the harder i have to work the more i value them when they come  then if i suddenly grew very kind would you stop caring about me asked rose wondering if that treatment would free her from a passion which both touched and tormented her  try and see but there was a traitorous glimmer in macs eyes which plainly showed what a failure it would be  no ill get something to do so absorbing i shall forget all about you  dont think about me if it troubles you he said tenderly  i cant help it rose tried to catch back the words but it was too late and she added hastily that is i cannot help wishing you would forget me it is a great disappointment to find i was mistaken when i hoped such fine things of you  yes you were very sure that it was love when it was poetry and now you want poetry when ive nothing on hand but love will both together please you  try and see  ill do my best anything else he asked forgetting the small task she had given him in his eagerness to attempt the greater  tell me one thing ive often wanted to know and now you speak of it ill venture to ask did you care about me when you read keats to me last summer  no  when did you begin asked rose smiling in spite of herself at his unflattering honesty  how can i tell perhaps it did begin up there though for that talk set us writing and the letters showed me what a beautiful soul you had i loved that first it was so quick to recognize good things to use them when they came and give them out again as unconsciously as a flower does its breath i longed for you to come home and wanted you to find me altered for the better in some way as i had found you and when you came it was very easy to see why i needed you to love you entirely and to tell you so thats all rose  a short story but it was enough the voice that told it with such simple truth made the few words so eloquent rose felt strongly tempted to add the sequel mac desired but her eyes had fallen as he spoke for she knew his were fixed upon her dark and dilated with the same repressed emotion that put such fervor into his quiet tones and just as she was about to look up they fell on a shabby little footstool trifles affect women curiously and often most irresistibly when some agitation sways them the sight of the old hassock vividly recalled charlie for he had kicked it on the night she never liked to remember like a spark it fired a long train of recollections and the thought went through her mind i fancied i loved him and let him see it but i deceived myself and he reproached me for a single look that said too much this feeling is very different but too new and sudden to be trusted ill neither look nor speak till i am quite sure for macs love is far deeper than poor charlies and i must be very true  not in words did the resolve shape itself but in a quick impulse which she obeyed certain that it was right since it was hard to yield to it only an instants silence followed macs answer as she stood looking down with fingers intertwined and color varying in her cheeks a foolish attitude but mac thought it a sweet picture of maiden hesitation and began to hope that a months wooing was about to end in winning for a lifetime he deceived himself however and cold water fell upon his flame subduing but by no means quenching it when rose looked up with an air of determination which could not escape eyes that were growing wonderfully farsighted lately  i came in here to beg uncle to advise you to go away soon you are very patient and forbearing and i feel it more than i can tell but it is not good for you to depend on anyone so much for your happiness i think and i know it is bad for me to feel that i have so much power over a fellow creature go away mac and see if this isnt all a mistake dont let a fancy for me change or delay your work because it may end as suddenly as it began and then we should both reproach ourselves and each other please do i respect and care for you so much i cant be happy to take all and give nothing i try to but im not sure i want to think it is too soon to know yet  rose began bravely but ended in a fluttered sort of way as she moved toward the door for macs face though it fell at first brightened as she went on and at the last word uttered almost involuntarily he actually laughed low to himself as if this order into exile pleased him much  dont say that you give nothing when youve just shown me that im getting on ill go ill go at once and see if absence wont help you to think to know and to be sure as it did me i wish i could do something more for you as i cant goodbye  are you going now and rose paused in her retreat to look back with a startled face as he offered her a badly made pen and opened the door for her just as dr alec always did for in spite of himself mac did resemble the best of uncles  not yet but you seem to be  rose turned as red as a poppy snatched the pen and flew upstairs to call herself hard names as she industriously spoiled all aunt plentys new pocket handkerchiefs by marking them amc  three days later mac said goodbye in earnest and no one was surprised that he left somewhat abruptly such being his way and a course of lectures by a famous physician the ostensible reason for a trip to l uncle alec deserted most shamefully at the last moment by sending word that he would be at the station to see the traveler off aunt plenty was still in her room so when mac came down from his farewell to her rose met him in the hall as if anxious not to delay him she was a little afraid of another teteatete as she fared so badly at the last and had assumed a calm and cousinly air which she flattered herself would plainly show on what terms she wished to part  mac apparently understood and not only took the hint but surpassed her in cheerful composure for merely saying goodbye cousin write when you feel like it he shook hands and walked out of the house as tranquilly as if only a day instead of three months were to pass before they met again rose felt as if a sudden shower bath had chilled her and was about to retire saying to herself with disdainful decision theres no love about it after all only one of the eccentricities of genius when a rush of cold air made her turn to find herself in what appeared to be the embrace of an impetuous overcoat which wrapped her close for an instant then vanished as suddenly as it had come leaving her to hide in the sanctum and confide to psyche with a tender sort of triumph in her breathless voice no no it isnt genius that must be love     chapter 19 behind the fountain  two days after christmas a young man of serious aspect might have been seen entering one of the large churches at l being shown to a seat he joined in the services with praiseworthy devotion especially the music to which he listened with such evident pleasure that a gentleman who sat nearby felt moved to address this appreciative stranger after church  fine sermon today ever heard our minister before sir he began as they went down the aisle together among the last for the young man had lingered as if admiring the ancient building  very fine no sir i have never had that pleasure ive often wished to see this old place and am not at all disappointed your choir too is unusually good answered the stranger glancing up at several bonnets bobbing about behind the halfdrawn curtains above  finest in the city sir we pride ourselves on our music and always have the best people often come for that alone and the old gentleman looked as satisfied as if a choir of cherubim and seraphim continually did cry in his organ loft  who is the contralto that solo was beautifully sung observed the younger man pausing to read a tablet on the wall  that is miss moore been here about a year and is universally admired excellent young lady couldnt do without her sings superbly in oratorios ever heard her  never she came from x i believe  yes highly recommended she was brought up by one of the first families there campbell is the name if you come from x you doubtless know them  i have met them good morning and with bows the gentlemen parted for at that instant the young man caught sight of a tall lady going down the church steps with a devout expression in her fine eyes and a prayerbook in her hand  hastening after her the seriousminded young man accosted her just as she turned into a quiet street  phebe  only a word but it wrought a marvelous change for the devout expression vanished in the drawing of a breath and the quiet face blossomed suddenly with color warmth and the light that never was on sea or land as she turned to meet her lover with an answering word as eloquent as his  archie  the year is out today i told you i should come have you forgotten  no i knew youd come  and are you glad  how can i help it  you cant dont try come into this little park and let us talk and drawing her hand through his arm archie led her into what to other eyes was a very dismal square with a boardedup fountain in the middle sodden grass plots and dead leaves dancing in the wintry wind  but to them it was a summery paradise and they walked to and fro in the pale sunshine quite unconscious that they were objects of interest to several ladies and gentlemen waiting anxiously for their dinner or yawning over the dull books kept for sunday reading are you ready to come home now phebe asked archie tenderly as he looked at the downcast face beside him and wondered why all women did not wear delightful little black velvet bonnets with one deep red flower against their hair  not yet i havent done enough began phebe finding it very hard to keep the resolution made a year ago  you have proved that you can support yourself make friends and earn a name if you choose no one can deny that and we are all getting proud of you what more can you ask my dearest  i dont quite know but i am very ambitious i want to be famous to do something for you all to make some sacrifice for rose and if i can to have something to give up for your sake let me wait and work longer i know i havent earned my welcome yet pleaded phebe so earnestly that her lover knew it would be in vain to try and turn her so wisely contented himself with half since he could not have the whole  such a proud woman yet i love you all the better for it and understand your feeling rose made me see how it seems to you and i dont wonder that you cannot forget the unkind things that were looked if not said by some of my amiable aunts ill try to be patient on one condition phebe  and what is that  you are to let me come sometimes while i wait and wear this lest you should forget me he said pulling a ring from his pocket and gently drawing a warm bare hand out of the muff where it lay hidden  yes archie but not here not now cried phebe glancing about her as if suddenly aware that they were not alone  no one can see us here i thought of that give me one happy minute after this long long year of waiting answered archie pausing just where the fountain hid them from all eyes for there were houses only on one side  phebe submitted and never did a plain gold ring slip more easily to its place than the one he put on in such a hurry that cold december day then one hand went back into the muff red with the grasp he gave it and the other to its old place on his arm with a confiding gesture as if it had a right there  now i feel sure of you said archie as they went on again and no one the wiser for that tender transaction behind the ugly pyramid of boards mac wrote me that you were much admired by your church people and that certain wealthy bachelors evidently had designs on the retiring miss moore i was horribly jealous but now i defy every man of them  phebe smiled with the air of proud humility that was so becoming and answered briefly there was no danger kings could not change me whether you ever came or not but mac should not have told you  you shall be revenged on him then for as he told secrets about you ill tell you one about him phebe he loves rose and archie looked as if he expected to make a great sensation with his news  i know it and phebe laughed at his sudden change of countenance as he added inquiringly she told you then  not a word i guessed it from her letters for lately she says nothing about mac and before there was a good deal so i suspected what the silence meant and asked no questions  wise girl then you think she does care for the dear old fellow  of course she does didnt he tell you so  no he only said when he went away take care of my rose and ill take care of your phebe and not another thing could i get out of him for i did ask questions he stood by me like a hero and kept aunt jane from driving me stark mad with her advice i dont forget that and burned to lend him a hand somewhere but he begged me to let him manage his wooing in his own way and from what i see i should say he knew how to do it added archie finding it very delightful to gossip about love affairs with his sweetheart  dear little mistress how does she behave asked phebe longing for news but too grateful to ask at headquarters remembering how generously rose had tried to help her even by silence the greatest sacrifice a woman can make at such interesting periods  very sweet and shy and charming i try not to watch but upon my word i cannot help it sometimes she is so cunning as you girls say when i carry her a letter from mac she tries so hard not to show how glad she is that i want to laugh and tell her i know all about it but i look as sober as a judge and as stupid as an owl by daylight and she enjoys her letters in peace and thinks im so absorbed in my own passion that im blind to hers  but why did mac come away he says lectures brought him and he goes but i am sure something else is in his mind he looks so happy at times i dont see him very often but when i do im conscious that he isnt the mac i left a year ago said phebe leading archie away for inexorable propriety forbade a longer stay even if prudence and duty had not given her a reminding nudge as it was very cold and afternoon church came in an hour  well you see mac was always peculiar and he cannot even grow up like other fellows i dont understand him yet and am sure hes got some plan in his head that no one suspects unless it is uncle alec love makes us all cut queer capers and ive an idea that the don will distinguish himself in some uncommon way so be prepared to applaud whatever it is we owe him that you know  indeed we do if rose ever speaks of him to you tell her i shall see that he comes to no harm and she must do the same for my archie  that unusual demonstration of tenderness from reserved phebe very naturally turned the conversation into a more personal channel and archie devoted himself to building castles in the air so successfully that they passed the material mansion without either being aware of it  will you come in asked phebe when the mistake was rectified and she stood on her own steps looking down at her escort who had discreetly released her before a pull at the bell caused five heads to pop up at five different windows  no thanks i shall be at church this afternoon and the oratorio this evening i must be off early in the morning so let me make the most of precious time and come home with you tonight as i did before answered archie making his best bow and quite sure of consent  you may and phebe vanished closing the door softly as if she found it hard to shut out so much love and happiness as that in the heart of the sedate young gentleman who went briskly down the street humming a verse of old clyde like a tuneful bass viol      oh let our mingling voices rise     in grateful rapture to the skies     where love has had its birth      let songs of joy this day declare     that spirits come their bliss to share     with all the sons of earth  that afternoon miss moore sang remarkably well and that evening quite electrified even her best friends by the skill and power with which she rendered inflammatus in the oratorio  if that is not genius i should like to know what it is said one young man to another as they went out just before the general crush at the end  some genius and a great deal of love they are a grand team and when well driven astonish the world by the time they make in the great race answered the second young man with the look of one inclined to try his hand at driving that immortal span  daresay you are right cant stop now shes waiting for me dont sit up mac  the gods go with you archie  and the cousins separated one to write till midnight the other to bid his phebe goodbye little dreaming how unexpectedly and successfully she was to earn her welcome home     chapter 20 what mac did  rose meantime was trying to find out what the sentiment was with which she regarded her cousin mac she could not seem to reconcile the character she had known so long with the new one lately shown her and the idea of loving the droll bookish absentminded mac of former times appeared quite impossible and absurd but the new mac wide awake full of talent ardent and highhanded was such a surprise to her she felt as if her heart was being won by a stranger and it became her to study him well before yielding to a charm which she could not deny  affection came naturally and had always been strong for the boy regard for the studious youth easily deepened to respect for the integrity of the young man and now something warmer was growing up within her but at first she could not decide whether it was admiration for the rapid unfolding of talent of some sort or love answering to love  as if to settle that point mac sent her on new years day a little book plainly bound and modestly entitled songs and sonnets after reading this with evergrowing surprise and delight rose never had another doubt about the writers being a poet for though she was no critic she had read the best authors and knew what was good unpretentious as it was this had the true ring and its very simplicity showed conscious power for unlike so many first attempts the book was not full of my lady neither did it indulge in swinburnian convulsions about      the lilies and languors of peace     the roses and raptures of love  or contain any of the highly colored medieval word pictures so much in vogue my book should smell of pines and resound with the hum of insects might have been its motto so sweet and wholesome was it with a springlike sort of freshness which plainly betrayed that the author had learned some of natures deepest secrets and possessed the skill to tell them in tuneful words the songs went ringing through ones memory long after they were read and the sonnets were full of the subtle beauty insight and halfunconscious wisdom which seem to prove that genius is divine when young  many faults it had but was so full of promise that it was evident mac had not kept good company read good books loved good things and cultivated soul and body as faithfully as he could in vain it all told now for truth and virtue had blossomed into character and had a language of their own more eloquent than the poetry to which they were what the fragrance is to the flower wiser critics than rose felt and admired this less partial ones could not deny their praise to a first effort which seemed as spontaneous and aspiring as a larks song and when one or two of these jupiters had given a nod of approval mac found himself not exactly famous but much talked about one set abused the other set praised and the little book was sadly mauled among them for it was too original to be ignored and too robust to be killed by hard usage so it came out of the fray none the worse but rather brighter if anything for the friction which proved the gold genuine  this took time however and rose could only sit at home reading all the notices she could get as well as the literary gossip phebe sent her for mac seldom wrote and never a word about himself so phebe skillfully extracted from him in their occasional meetings all the personal news her feminine wit could collect and faithfully reported it  it was a little singular that without a word of inquiry on either side the letters of the girls were principally filled with tidings of their respective lovers phebe wrote about mac rose answered with minute particulars about archie and both added hasty items concerning their own affairs as if these were of little consequence  phebe got the most satisfaction out of the correspondence for soon after the book appeared rose began to want mac home again and to be rather jealous of the new duties and delights that kept him she was immensely proud of her poet and had little jubilees over the beautiful fulfillment of her prophecies for even aunt plenty owned now with contrition that the boy was not a fool every word of praise was read aloud on the housetops so to speak by happy rose every adverse criticism was hotly disputed and the whole family was in a great state of pleasant excitement over this unexpectedly successful first flight of the ugly duckling now generally considered by his relatives as the most promising young swan of the flock  aunt jane was particularly funny in her new position of mother to a callow poet and conducted herself like a proud but bewildered hen when one of her brood takes to the water she pored over the poems trying to appreciate them but quite failing to do so for life was all prose to her and she vainly tried to discover where mac got his talent from it was pretty to see the new respect with which she treated his possessions now the old books were dusted with a sort of reverence scraps of paper were laid carefully by lest some immortal verse be lost and a certain shabby velvet jacket fondly smoothed when no one was by to smile at the maternal pride with filled her heart and caused her once severe countenance to shine with unwonted benignity  uncle mac talked about my son with illconcealed satisfaction and evidently began to feel as if his boy was going to confer distinction upon the whole race of campbell which had already possessed one poet steve exulted with irrepressible delight and went about quoting songs and sonnets till he bored his friends dreadfully by his fraternal raptures  archie took it more quietly and even suggested that it was too soon to crow yet for the dear old fellows first burst might be his last since it was impossible to predict what he would do next having proved that he could write poetry he might drop it for some new world to conquer quoting his favorite thoreau who having made a perfect pencil gave up the business and took to writing books with the sort of indelible ink which grows clearer with time  the aunts of course had their views and enjoyed much prophetic gossip as they wagged their caps over many social cups of tea the younger boys thought it very jolly and hoped the don would go ahead and come to glory as soon as possible which was all that could by expected of young america with whom poetry is not usually a passion  but dr alec was a sight for sair een so full of concentrated contentment was he no one but rose perhaps knew how proud and pleased the good man felt at this first small success of his godson for he had always had high hopes of the boy because in spite of his oddities he had such an upright nature and promising little did much with the quiet persistence which foretells a manly character all the romance of the doctors heart was stirred by this poetic bud of promise and the love that made it bloom so early for mac had confided his hopes to uncle finding great consolation and support in his sympathy and advice like a wise man dr alec left the young people to learn the great lesson in their own way counseling mac to work and rose to wait till both were quite certain that their love was built on a surer foundation than admiration or youthful romance  meantime he went about with a wellworn little book in his pocket humming bits from a new set of songs and repeating with great fervor certain sonnets which seemed to him quite equal if not superior to any that shakespeare ever wrote as rose was doing the same thing they often met for a private read and warble as they called it and while discussing the safe subject of macs poetry both arrived at a pretty clear idea of what macs reward was to be when he came home  he seemed in no hurry to do this however and continued to astonish his family by going into society and coming out brilliantly in that line it takes very little to make a lion as everyone knows who has seen what poor specimens are patted and petted every year in spite of their bad manners foolish vagaries and very feeble roaring mac did not want to be lionized and took it rather scornfully which only added to the charm that people suddenly discovered about the nineteenth cousin of thomas campbell the poet he desired to be distinguished in the best sense of the word as well as to look so and thought a little of the polish society gives would not be amiss remembering roses efforts in that line for her sake he came out of his shell and went about seeing and testing all sorts of people with those observing eyes of his which saw so much in spite of their nearsightedness what use he meant to make of these new experiences no one knew for he wrote short letters and when questioned answered with imperturbable patience wait till i get through then ill come home and talk about it  so everyone waited for the poet till something happened which produced a greater sensation in the family than if all the boys had simultaneously taken to rhyming  dr alec got very impatient and suddenly announced that he was going to l to see after those young people for phebe was rapidly singing herself into public favor with the sweet old ballads which she rendered so beautifully that hearers were touched as well as ears delighted and her prospects brightened every month  will you come with me rose and surprise this ambitious pair who are getting famous so fast theyll forget their homekeeping friends if we dont remind them of us now and then he said when he proposed the trip one wild march morning  no thank you sir ill stay with aunty that is all im fit for and i should only be in the way among those fine people answered rose snipping away at the plants blooming in the study window  there was a slight bitterness in her voice and a cloud on her face which her uncle heard and saw at once half guessed the meaning of and could not rest till he had found out  do you think phebe and mac would not care to see you he asked putting down a letter in which mac gave a glowing account of a concert at which phebe surpassed herself  no but they must be very busy began rose wishing she had held her tongue  then what is the matter persisted dr alec  rose did not speak for a moment and decapitated two fine geraniums with a reckless slash of her scissors as if pentup vexation of some kind must find a vent it did in words also for as if quite against her will she exclaimed impetuously the truth is im jealous of them both  bless my soul what now ejaculated the doctor in great surprise  rose put down her water pot and shears came and stood before him with her hands nervously twisted together and said just as she used to do when she was a little girl confessing some misdeed uncle i must tell you for ive been getting very envious discontented and bad lately no dont be good to me yet for you dont know how little i deserve it scold me well and make me see how wicked i am  i will as soon as i know what i am to scold about unburden yourself child and let me see all your iniquity for if you begin by being jealous of mac and phebe im prepared for anything said dr alec leaning back as if nothing could surprise him now  but i am not jealous in that way sir i mean i want to be or do something splendid as well as they i cant write poetry or sing like a bird but i should think i might have my share of glory in some way i thought perhaps i could paint and ive tried but i can only copy ive no power to invent lovely things and im so discouraged for that is my one accomplishment do you think i have any gift that could be cultivated and do me credit like theirs she asked so wistfully that her uncle felt for a moment as if he never could forgive the fairies who endow babies in their cradles for being so niggardly to his girl but one look into the sweet open face before him reminded him that the good elves had been very generous and he answered cheerfully yes i do for you have one of the best and noblest gifts a woman can possess music and poetry are fine things and i dont wonder you want them or that you envy the pleasant fame they bring ive felt just so and been ready to ask why it didnt please heaven to be more generous to some people so you neednt be ashamed to tell me all about it  i know i ought to be contented but im not my life is very comfortable but so quiet and uneventful i get tired of it and want to launch out as the others have and do something or at least try im glad you think it isnt very bad of me and id like to know what my gift is said rose looking less despondent already  the art of living for others so patiently and sweetly that we enjoy it as we do the sunshine and are not half grateful enough for the great blessing  it is very kind of you to say so but i think id like a little fun and fame nevertheless and rose did not look as thankful as she ought  very natural dear but the fun and the fame do not last while the memory of a real helper is kept green long after poetry is forgotten and music silent cant you believe that and be happy  but i do so little nobody sees or cares and i dont feel as if i was really of any use sighed rose thinking of the long dull winter full of efforts that seemed fruitless  sit here and let us see if you really do very little and if no one cares and drawing her to his knee dr alec went on telling off each item on one of the fingers of the soft hand he held  first an infirm old aunt is kept very happy by the patient cheerful care of this goodfornothing niece secondly a crotchety uncle for whom she reads runs writes and sews so willingly that he cannot get on without her thirdly various relations who are helped in various ways fourthly one dear friend never forgotten and a certain cousin cheered by praise which is more to him than the loudest blast fame could blow fifthly several young girls find her an example of many good works and ways sixthly a motherless baby is cared for as tenderly as if she were a little sister seventhly half a dozen poor ladies made comfortable and lastly some struggling boys and girls with artistic longings are put into a pleasant room furnished with casts studies easels and all manner of helpful things not to mention free lessons given by this same idle girl who now sits upon my knee owning to herself that her gift is worth having after all  indeed i am uncle id no idea i had done so many things to please you or that anyone guessed how hard i try to fill my place usefully ive learned to do without gratitude now ill learn not to care for praise but to be contented to do my best and have only god know  he knows and he rewards in his own good time i think a quiet life like this often makes itself felt in better ways than one that the world sees and applauds and some of the noblest are never known till they end leaving a void in many hearts yours may be one of these if you choose to make it so and no one will be prouder of this success than i unless it be mac  the clouds were quite gone now and rose was looking straight into her uncles face with a much happier expression when that last word made it color brightly and the eyes glance away for a second then they came back full of a tender sort of resolution as she said that will be the reward i work for and rose as if ready to be up and doing with renewed courage  but her uncle held her long enough to ask quite soberly though his eyes laughed shall i tell him that  no sir please dont when he is tired of other peoples praise he will come home and then ill see what i can do for him answered rose slipping away to her work with the shy happy look that sometimes came to give to her face the charm it needed  he is such a thorough fellow he never is in a hurry to go from one thing to another an excellent habit but a trifle trying to impatient people like me said the doctor and picking up dulce who sat upon the rug with her dolly he composed his feelings by tossing her till she crowed with delight  rose heartily echoed that last remark but said nothing aloud only helped her uncle off with dutiful alacrity and when he was gone began to count the days till his return wishing she had decided to go too  he wrote often giving excellent accounts of the great creatures as steve called phebe and mac and seemed to find so much to do in various ways that the second week of absence was nearly over before he set a day for his return promising to astonish them with the account of his adventures  rose felt as if something splendid was going to happen and set her affairs in order so that the approaching crisis might find her fully prepared she had found out now was quite sure and put away all doubts and fears to be ready to welcome home the cousin whom she was sure uncle would bring as her reward she was thinking of this one day as she got out her paper to write a long letter to poor aunt clara who pined for news far away there in calcutta  something in the task reminded her of that other lover whose wooing ended so tragically and opening a little drawer of keepsakes she took out the blue bracelet feeling that she owed charlie a tender thought in the midst of her new happiness for of late she had forgotten him  she had worn the trinket hidden under her black sleeve for a long time after his death with the regretful constancy one sometimes shows in doing some little kindness all too late but her arm had grown too round to hide the ornament the forgetmenots had fallen one by one the clasp had broken and that autumn she laid the bracelet away acknowledging that she had outgrown the souvenir as well as the sentiment that gave it  she looked at it in silence for a moment then put it softly back and shutting the drawer took up the little gray book which was her pride thinking as she contrasted the two men and their influence on her life the one sad and disturbing the other sweet and inspiring charlies was passion macs is love  rose rose called a shrill voice rudely breaking the pensive reverie and with a start she shut the desk exclaiming as she ran to the door they have come they have come     chapter 21 how phebe earned her welcome  dr alec had not arrived but bad tidings had as rose guessed the instant her eyes fell upon aunt plenty hobbling downstairs with her cap awry her face pale and a letter flapping wildly in her hand as she cried distractedly oh my boy my boy sick and i not there to nurse him malignant fever so far away what can those children do why did i let alec go  rose got her into the parlor and while the poor old lady lamented she read the letter which phebe had sent to her that she might break the news carefully to rose  dear miss plenty please read this to yourself first and tell my little mistress as you think best the dear doctor is very ill but i am with him and shall not leave him day or night till he is safe so trust me and do not be anxious for everything shall be done that care and skill and entire devotion can do he would not let us tell you before fearing you would try to come at the risk of your health indeed it would be useless for only one nurse is needed and i came first so do not let rose or anybody else rob me of my right to the danger and the duty mac has written to his father for dr alec is now too ill to know what we do and we both felt that you ought to be told without further delay he has a bad malignant fever caught no one can tell how unless among some poor emigrants whom he met wandering about quite forlorn in a strange city he understood portuguese and sent them to a proper place when they had told their story but i fear he has suffered for his kindness for this fever came on rapidly and before he knew what it was i was there and it was too late to send me away  now i can show you how grateful i am and if need be give my life so gladly for this friend who has been a father to me tell rose his last conscious word and thought were for her dont let her come keep my darling safe oh do obey him stay safely at home and god helping me ill bring uncle alec back in time mac does all i will let him we have the best physicians and everything is going as well as can be hoped till the fever turns  dear miss plenty pray for him and for me that i may do this one happy thing for those who have done so much for your ever dutiful and loving  phebe  as rose looked up from the letter half stunned by the sudden news and the great danger she found that the old lady had already stopped useless bewailing and was praying heartily like one who knew well where help was to be found rose went and knelt down at her knee laying her face on the clasped hands in her lap and for a few minutes neither wept nor spoke then a stifled sob broke from the girl and aunt plenty gathered the young head in her arms saying with the slow tears of age trickling down her own withered cheeks bear up my lamb bear up the good lord wont take him from us i am sure and that brave child will be allowed to pay her debt to him i feel she will  but i want to help i must go aunty i must no matter what the danger is cried rose full of a tender jealousy of phebe for being first to brave peril for the sake of him who had been a father to them both  you cant go dear its no use now and she is right to say keep away i know those fevers and the ones who nurse often take it and fare worse for the strain theyve been through good girl to stand by so bravely to be so sensible and not let mac go too near shes a grand nurse alec couldnt have a better and shell never leave him till hes safe said miss plenty excitedly  ah you begin to know her now and value her as you ought i think few would have done as she has and if she does get ill and die it will be our fault partly because shed go through fire and water to make us do her justice and receive her as we ought cried rose proud of an example which she longed to follow  if she brings my boy home ill never say another word she may marry every nephew ive got if she likes and ill give her my blessing exclaimed aunt plenty feeling that no price would be too much to pay for such a deed  rose was going to clap her hands but wrung them instead remembering with a sudden pang that the battle was not over yet and it was much too soon to award the honors  before she could speak uncle mac and aunt jane hurried in for macs letter had come with the other and dismay fell upon the family at the thought of danger to the wellbeloved uncle alec his brother decided to go at once and aunt jane insisted on accompanying him though all agreed that nothing could be done but wait and leave phebe at her post as long as she held out since it was too late to save her from danger now and mac reported her quite equal to the task  great was the hurry and confusion till the relief party was off aunt plenty was heartbroken that she could not go with them but felt that she was too infirm to be useful and like a sensible old soul tried to content herself with preparing all sorts of comforts for the invalid rose was less patient and at first had wild ideas of setting off alone and forcing her way to the spot where all her thoughts now centered but before she could carry out any rash project aunt myras palpitations set in so alarmingly that they did good service for once and kept rose busy taking her last directions and trying to soothe her dying bed for each attack was declared fatal till the patient demanded toast and tea when hope was again allowable and the rally began  the news flew fast as such tidings always do and aunt plenty was constantly employed in answering inquiries for her knocker kept up a steady tattoo for several days all sorts of people came gentlefolk and paupers children with anxious little faces old people full of sympathy pretty girls sobbing as they went away and young men who relieved their feelings by swearing at all emigrants in general and portuguese in particular it was touching and comforting to see how many loved the good man who was known only by his benefactions and now lay suffering far away quite unconscious how many unsuspected charities were brought to light by this grateful solicitude as hidden flowers spring up when warm rains fall  if rose had ever felt that the gift of living for others was a poor one she saw now how beautiful and blessed it was how rich the returns how wide the influence how much more precious the tender tie which knit so many hearts together than any breath of fame or brilliant talent that dazzled but did not win and warm in after years she found how true her uncles words had been and listening to eulogies of great men felt less moved and inspired by praises of their splendid gifts than by the sight of some good mans patient labor for the poorest of his kind her heroes ceased to be the worlds favorites and became such as garrison fighting for his chosen people howe restoring lost senses to the deaf the dumb and blind sumner unbribable when other men were bought and sold and many a largehearted woman working as quietly as abby gibbons who for thirty years had made christmas merry for two hundred little paupers in a city almshouse besides saving magdalens and teaching convicts  the lesson came to rose when she was ready for it and showed her what a noble profession philanthropy is made her glad of her choice and helped fit her for a long life full of the loving labor and sweet satisfaction unostentatious charity brings to those who ask no reward and are content if only god knows  several anxious weeks went by with wearing fluctuations of hope and fear for life and death fought over the prize each wanted and more than once death seemed to have won but phebe stood at her post defying both danger and death with the courage and devotion women often show all her soul and strength were in her work and when it seemed most hopeless she cried out with the passionate energy which seems to send such appeals straight up to heaven grant me this one boon dear lord and i will never ask another for myself  such prayers avail much and such entire devotion often seems to work miracles when other aids are in vain phebes cry was answered her selfforgetful task accomplished and her long vigil rewarded with a happy dawn dr alec always said that she kept him alive by the force of her will and that during the hours when he seemed to lie unconscious he felt a strong warm hand holding his as if keeping him away from the swift current trying to sweep him away the happiest hour of all her life was that in which he knew her looked up with the shadow of a smile in his hollow eyes and tried to say in his old cheery way tell rose ive turned the corner thanks to you my child  she answered very quietly smoothed the pillow and saw him drop asleep again before she stole away into the other room meaning to write the good news but could only throw herself down and find relief for a full heart in the first tears she had shed for weeks mac found her there and took such care of her that she was ready to go back to her place now indeed a post of honor while he ran off to send home a telegram which made many hearts sing for joy and caused jamie in his first burst of delight to propose to ring all the city bells and order out the cannon saved thanks to god and phebe  that was all but everyone was satisfied and everyone fell acrying as if hope needed much salty water to strengthen it that was soon over however and then people went about smiling and saying to one another with handshakes or embraces he is better no doubt of it now a general desire to rush away and assure themselves of the truth pervaded the family for some days and nothing but awful threats from mac stern mandates from the doctor and entreaties from phebe not to undo her work kept miss plenty rose and aunt jessie at home  as the only way in which they could ease their minds and bear the delay they set about spring cleaning with an energy which scared the spiders and drove charwomen distracted if the old house had been infected with smallpox it could not have been more vigorously scrubbed aired and refreshed early as it was every carpet was routed up curtains pulled down cushions banged and glory holes turned out till not a speck of dust a last years fly or stray straw could be found then they all sat down and rested in such an immaculate mansion that one hardly dared to move for fear of destroying the shining order everywhere visible  it was late in april before this was accomplished and the necessary quarantine of the absentees well over the first mild days seemed to come early so that dr alec might return with safety from the journey which had so nearly been his last it was perfectly impossible to keep any member of the family away on that great occasion they came from all quarters in spite of express directions to the contrary for the invalid was still very feeble and no excitement must be allowed as if the wind carried the glad news uncle jem came into port the night before will and geordie got a leave on their own responsibility steve would have defied the entire faculty had it been necessary and uncle mac and archie said simultaneously business be hanged today  of course the aunts arrived in all their best all cautioning everybody else to keep quiet and all gabbling excitedly at the least provocation jamie suffered the most during that day so divided was he between the desire to behave well and the frantic impulse to shout at the top of his voice turn somersaults and race all over the house occasional bolts into the barn where he let off steam by roaring and dancing jigs to the great dismay of the fat old horses and two sedate cows helped him to get through that trying period  but the heart that was fullest beat and fluttered in roses bosom as she went about putting spring flowers everywhere very silent but so radiant with happiness that the aunts watched her saying softly to one another could an angel look sweeter  if angels ever wore pale green gowns and snowdrops in their hair had countenances full of serenest joy and large eyes shining with an inward light that made them very lovely then rose did look like one but she felt like a woman and well she might for was not life very rich that day when uncle friend and lover were coming back to her together could she ask anything more except the power to be to all of them the creature they believed her and to return the love they gave her with one as faithful pure and deep among the portraits in the hall hung one of dr alec done soon after his return by charlie in one of his brief fits of inspiration only a crayon but wonderfully lifelike and carefully finished as few of the others were this had been handsomely framed and now held the place of honor garlanded with green wreaths while the great indian jar below blazed with a pyramid of hothouse flowers sent by kitty rose was giving these a last touch with dulce close by cooing over a handful of sweet daffydowndillies when the sound of wheels sent her flying to the door she meant to have spoken the first welcome and had the first embrace but when she saw the altered face in the carriage the feeble figure being borne up the steps by all the boys she stood motionless till phebe caught her in her arms whispering with a laugh and a cry struggling in her voice i did it for you my darling all for you  oh phebe never say again you owe me anything i never can repay you for this was all rose had time to answer as they stood one instant cheek to cheek heart to heart both too full of happiness for many words  aunt plenty had heard the wheels also and as everybody rose en masse had said as impressively as extreme agitation would allow while she put her glasses on upside down and seized a lace tidy instead of her handkerchief stop all stay here and let me receive alec remember his weak state and be calm quite calm as i am  yes aunt certainly was the general murmur of assent but it was as impossible to obey as it would have been to keep feathers still in a gale and one irresistible impulse carried the whole roomful into the hall to behold aunt plenty beautifully illustrating her own theory of composure by waving the tidy wildly rushing into dr alecs arms and laughing and crying with a hysterical abandonment which even aunt myra could not have surpassed  the tearful jubilee was soon over however and no one seemed the worse for it for the instant his arms were at liberty dr alec forgot himself and began to make other people happy by saying seriously though his thin face beamed paternally as he drew phebe forward aunt plenty but for this good daughter i never should have come back to be so welcomed love her for my sake  then the old lady came out splendidly and showed her mettle for turning to phebe she bowed her gray head as if saluting an equal and offering her hand answered with repentance admiration and tenderness trembling in her voice im proud to do it for her own sake i ask pardon for my silly prejudices and ill prove that im sincere by wheres that boy  there were six boys present but the right one was in exactly the right place at the right moment and seizing archies hand aunt plenty put phebes into it trying to say something appropriately solemn but could not so hugged them both and sobbed out if i had a dozen nephews id give them all to you my dear and dance at the wedding though i had rheumatism in every limb  that was better than any oration for it set them all to laughing and dr alec was floated to the sofa on a gentle wave of merriment once there everyone but rose and aunt plenty was ordered off by mac who was in command now and seemed to have sunk the poet in the physician  the house must be perfectly quiet and he must go to sleep as soon as possible after the journey so all say goodbye now and call again tomorrow he said watching his uncle anxiously as he leaned in the sofa corner with four women taking off his wraps three boys contending for his overshoes two brothers shaking hands at short intervals and aunt myra holding a bottle of strong salts under his devoted nose every time there was an opening anywhere  with difficulty the house was partially cleared and then while aunt plenty mounted guard over her boy rose stole away to see if mac had gone with the rest for as yet they had hardly spoken in the joyful flurry though eyes and hands had met     chapter 22 short and sweet  in the hall she found steve and kitty for he had hidden his little sweetheart behind the big couch feeling that she had a right there having supported his spirits during the late anxiety with great constancy and courage they seemed so cozy billing and cooing in the shadow of the gay vase that rose would have slipped silently away if they had not seen and called to her hes not gone i guess youll find him in the parlor said steve divining with a lovers instinct the meaning of the quick look she had cast at the hat rack as she shut the study door behind her  mercy no archie and phebe are there so hed have the sense to pop into the sanctum and wait unless youd like me to go and bring him out added kitty smoothing roses ruffled hair and settling the flowers on the bosom where uncle alecs head had lain until he fell asleep  no thank you ill go to him when ive seen my phebe she wont mind me answered rose moving on to the parlor  look here called steve do advise them to hurry up and all be married at once we were just ready when uncle fell ill and now we cannot wait a day later than the first of may  rather short notice laughed rose looking back with the doorknob in her hand  well give up all our splendor and do it as simply as you like if you will only come too think how lovely three weddings at once do fly round and settle things theres a dear implored kitty whose imagination was fired with this romantic idea  how can i when i have no bridegroom yet began rose with conscious color in her telltale face  sly creature you know youve only got to say a word and have a famous one una and her lion will be nothing to it cried steve bent on hastening his brothers affair which was much too dilatory and peculiar for his taste  he has been in no haste to come home and i am in no haste to leave it dont wait for me mr and mrs harry walmers jr i shall be a year at least making up my mind so you may lead off as splendidly as you like and ill profit by your experience and rose vanished into the parlor leaving steve to groan over the perversity of superior women and kitty to comfort him by promising to marry him on may day all alone  a very different couple occupied the drawing room but a happier one for they had known the pain of separation and were now enjoying the bliss of a reunion which was to last unbroken for their lives phebe sat in an easy chair resting from her labors pale and thin and worn but lovelier in archies eyes than ever before it was very evident that he was adoring his divinity for after placing a footstool at her feet he had forgotten to get up and knelt there with his elbow on the arm of her chair looking like a thirsty man drinking long drafts of the purest water  shall i disturb you if i pass through asked rose loath to spoil the pretty tableau  not if you stop a minute on the way and congratulate me cousin for she says yes at last cried archie springing up to go and bring her to the arms phebe opened as she appeared  i knew she would reward your patience and put away her pride when both had been duly tried said rose laying the tired head on her bosom with such tender admiration in her eyes that phebe had to shake some bright drops from her own before she could reply in a tone of grateful humility that showed how much her heart was touched how can i help it when they are all so kind to me any pride would melt away under such praise and thanks and loving wishes as ive had today for every member of the family has taken pains to welcome me to express far too much gratitude and to beg me to be one of you i needed very little urging but when archies father and mother came and called me daughter i would have promised anything to show my love for them  and him added rose but archie seemed quite satisfied and kissed the hand he held as if it had been that of a beloved princess while he said with all the pride phebe seemed to have lost think what she gives up for me fame and fortune and the admiration of many a better man you dont know what a splendid prospect she has of becoming one of the sweet singers who are loved and honored everywhere and all this she puts away for my sake content to sing for me alone with no reward but love  i am so glad to make a little sacrifice for a great happiness i never shall regret it or think my music lost if it makes home cheerful for my mate birds sing sweetest in their own nests you know and phebe bent toward him with a look and gesture which plainly showed how willingly she offered up all ambitious hopes upon the altar of a womans happy love  both seemed to forget that they were not alone and in a moment they were for a sudden impulse carried rose to the door of her sanctum as if the south wind which seemed to have set in was wafting this little ship also toward the islands of the blessed where the others were safely anchored now  the room was a blaze of sunshine and a bower of spring freshness and fragrance for here rose had let her fancy have free play and each garland fern and flower had its meaning mac seemed to have been reading this sweet language of symbols to have guessed why charlies little picture was framed in white roses why pansies hung about his own why psyche was half hidden among feathery sprays of maidenhair and a purple passion flower lay at cupids feet the last fancy evidently pleased him for he was smiling over it and humming to himself as if to beguile his patient waiting the burden of the air rose had so often sung to him  bonny lassie will ye gang will ye gang to the birks of aberfeldie  yes mac anywhere  he had not heard her enter and wheeling around looked at her with a radiant face as he said drawing a long breath at last you were so busy over the dear man i got no word but i can wait im used to it  rose stood quite still surveying him with a new sort of reverence in her eyes as she answered with a sweet solemnity that made him laugh and redden with the sensitive joy of one to whom praise from her lips was very precious you forget that you are not the mac who went away i should have run to meet my cousin but i did not dare to be familiar with the poet whom all begin to honor  you like the mixture then you know i said id try to give you love and poetry together  like it im so glad so proud i havent any words strong and beautiful enough to half express my wonder and my admiration how could you do it mac and a whole face full of smiles broke loose as rose clapped her hands looking as if she could dance with sheer delight  it did itself up there among the hills and here with you or out alone upon the sea i could write a heavenly poem this very minute and put you in as spring you look like her in that green gown with snowdrops in your bonny hair rose am i getting on a little does a hint of fame help me nearer to the prize im working for is your heart more willing to be won  he did not stir a step but looked at her with such intense longing that his glance seemed to draw her nearer like an irresistible appeal for she went and stood before him holding out both hands as if she offered all her little store as she said with simplest sincerity it is not worth so much beautiful endeavor but if you still want so poor a thing it is yours  he caught her hands in his and seemed about to take the rest of her but hesitated for an instant unable to believe that so much happiness was true  are you sure rose very sure dont let a momentary admiration blind you im not a poet yet and the best are but mortal men you know  it is not admiration mac  nor gratitude for the small share ive taken in saving uncle i had my debt to pay as well as phebe and was as glad to risk my life  no it is not gratitude  nor pity for my patience ive only done a little yet and i am as far as ever from being like your hero i can work and wait still longer if you are not sure for i must have all or nothing  oh mac why will you be so doubtful you said youd make me love you and youve done it will you believe me now and with a sort of desperation she threw herself into his arms clinging there in eloquent silence while he held her close feeling with a thrill of tender triumph that this was no longer little rose but a loving woman ready to live and die for him  now im satisfied he said presently when she lifted up her face full of maidenly shame at the sudden passion which had carried her out of herself for a moment no dont slip away so soon let me keep you for one blessed minute and feel that i have really found my psyche  and i my cupid answered rose laughing in spite of her emotion at the idea of mac in that sentimental character  he laughed too as only a happy lover could then said with sudden seriousness sweet soul lift up your lamp and look well before it is too late for im no god only a very faulty man  dear love i will but i have no fear except that you will fly too high for me to follow because i have no wings  you shall live the poetry and i will write it so my little gift will celebrate your greater one  no you shall have all the fame and ill be content to be known only as the poets wife  and ill be proud to own that my best inspiration comes from the beneficent life of a sweet and noble woman  oh mac well work together and try to make the world better by the music and the love we leave behind us when we go  please god we will he answered fervently and looking at her as she stood there in the spring sunshine glowing with the tender happiness high hopes and earnest purposes that make life beautiful and sacred he felt that now the last leaf had folded back the golden heart lay open to the light and his rose had bloomed
