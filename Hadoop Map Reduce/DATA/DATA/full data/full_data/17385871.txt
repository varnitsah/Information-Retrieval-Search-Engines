17385871	venetia  by the earl of beaconsfield kg  1905          is thy face like thy mothers my fair child    the child of love though born in bitterness   and nurtured in convulsion     to  lord lyndhurst  in happier hours when i first mentioned to you the idea of this work it was my intention while inscribing it with your name to have entered into some details as to the principles which had guided me in its composition and the feelings with which i had attempted to shadow forth though as in in a glass darkly two of the most renowned and refined spirits that have adorned these our latter days but now i will only express a hope that the time may come when in these pages you may find some relaxation from the cares and some distraction from the sorrows of existence and that you will then receive this dedication as a record of my respect and my affection  this work was first published in the year 1837     book i     chapter i   some ten years before the revolt of our american colonies there was situate in one of our midland counties on the borders of an extensive forest an ancient hall that belonged to the herberts but which though ever well preserved had not until that period been visited by any member of the family since the exile of the stuarts it was an edifice of considerable size built of grey stone much covered with ivy and placed upon the last gentle elevation of a long ridge of hills in the centre of a crescent of woods that far overtopped its clusters of tall chimneys and turreted gables although the principal chambers were on the first story you could nevertheless step forth from their windows on a broad terrace whence you descended into the gardens by a double flight of stone steps exactly in the middle of its length these gardens were of some extent and filled with evergreen shrubberies of remarkable overgrowth while occasionally turfy vistas cut in the distant woods came sloping down to the south as if they opened to receive the sunbeam that greeted the genial aspect of the mansion the groundfloor was principally occupied by the hall itself which was of great dimensions hung round with many a family portrait and rural picture furnished with long oaken seats covered with scarlet cushions and ornamented with a particoloured floor of alternate diamonds of black and white marble from the centre of the roof of the mansion which was always covered with pigeons rose the clocktower of the chapel surmounted by a vane and before the mansion itself was a large plot of grass with a fountain in the centre surrounded by a hedge of honeysuckle  this plot of grass was separated from an extensive park that opened in front of the hall by tall iron gates on each of the pillars of which was a lion rampant supporting the escutcheon of the family the deer wandered in this enclosed and wellwooded demesne and about a mile from the mansion in a direct line with the iron gates was an oldfashioned lodge which marked the limit of the park and from which you emerged into a fine avenue of limes bounded on both sides by fields at the termination of this avenue was a strong but simple gate and a woodmans cottage and then spread before you a vast landscape of open wild lands which seemed on one side interminable while on the other the eye rested on the dark heights of the neighbouring forest  this picturesque and secluded abode was the residence of lady annabel herbert and her daughter the young and beautiful venetia a child at the time when our history commences of very tender age it was nearly seven years since lady annabel and her infant daughter had sought the retired shades of cherbury which they had never since quitted they lived alone and for each other the mother educated her child and the child interested her mother by her affectionate disposition the development of a mind of no ordinary promise and a sort of captivating grace and charming playfulness of temper which were extremely delightful lady annabel was still young and lovely that she was wealthy her establishment clearly denoted and she was a daughter of one of the haughtiest houses in the kingdom it was strange then that with all the brilliant accidents of birth and beauty and fortune she should still as it were in the morning of her life have withdrawn to this secluded mansion in a county where she was personally unknown distant from the metropolis estranged from all her own relatives and connexions and without resource of even a single neighbour for the only place of importance in her vicinity was uninhabited the general impression of the villagers was that lady annabel was a widow and yet there were some speculators who would shrewdly remark that her ladyship had never worn weeds although her husband could not have been long dead when she first arrived at cherbury on the whole however these good people were not very inquisitive and it was fortunate for them for there was little chance and slight means of gratifying their curiosity the whole of the establishment had been formed at cherbury with the exception of her ladyships waitingwoman mistress pauncefort and she was by far too great a personage to condescend to reply to any question which was not made to her by lady annabel herself  the beauty of the young venetia was not the hereditary gift of her beautiful mother it was not from lady annabel that venetia herbert had derived those seraphic locks that fell over her shoulders and down her neck in golden streams nor that clear grey eye even whose childish glance might perplex the gaze of manhood nor that little aquiline nose that gave a haughty expression to a countenance that had never yet dreamed of pride nor that radiant complexion that dazzled with its brilliancy like some winged minister of raffael or correggio the peasants that passed the lady and her daughter in their walks and who blessed her as they passed for all her grace and goodness often marvelled why so fair a mother and so fair a child should be so dissimilar that one indeed might be compared to a starry night and the other to a sunny day     chapter ii   it was a bright and soft spring morning the dewy vistas of cherbury sparkled in the sun the cooing of the pigeons sounded around the peacocks strutted about the terrace and spread their tails with infinite enjoyment and conscious pride and lady annabel came forth with her little daughter to breathe the renovating odours of the season the air was scented with the violet tufts of daffodils were scattered all about and though the snowdrop had vanished and the primroses were fast disappearing their wild and shaggy leaves still looked picturesque and glad  mamma said the little venetia is this spring  this is spring my child replied lady annabel beautiful spring the year is young and happy like my little girl  if venetia be like the spring mamma is like the summer replied the child and the mother smiled and is not the summer young and happy resumed venetia  it is not quite so young as the spring said lady annabel looking down with fondness on her little companion and i fear not quite so happy  but it is as beautiful said venetia  it is not beauty that makes us happy said lady annabel to be happy my love we must be good  am i good said venetia  very good said lady annabel  i am very happy said venetia i wonder whether if i be always good i shall always be happy  you cannot be happy without being good my love but happiness depends upon the will of god if you be good he will guard over you  what can make me unhappy mamma inquired venetia  an evil conscience my love  conscience said venetia what is conscience  you are not yet quite old enough to understand said lady annabel but some day i will teach you mamma is now going to take a long walk and venetia shall walk with her  so saying the lady annabel summoned mistress pauncefort a gentlewoman of not more discreet years than might have been expected in the attendant of so young a mistress but one well qualified for her office very zealous and devoted somewhat consequential full of energy and decision capable of directing fond of giving advice and habituated to command the lady annabel leading her daughter and accompanied by her faithful bloodhound marmion ascended one of those sloping vistas that we have noticed mistress pauncefort following them about a pace behind and after her a groom at a respectful distance leading miss herberts donkey  they soon entered a winding path through the wood which was the background of their dwelling lady annabel was silent and lost in her reflections venetia plucked the beautiful wild hyacinths that then abounded in the wood in such profusion that their beds spread like patches of blue enamel and gave them to mistress pauncefort who as the collection increased handed them over to the groom who in turn deposited them in the wicker seat prepared for his young mistress the bright sun bursting through the tender foliage of the year the clear and genial air the singing of the birds and the wild and joyous exclamations of venetia as she gathered her flowers made it a cheerful party notwithstanding the silence of its mistress  when they emerged from the wood they found themselves on the brow of the hill a small down over which venetia ran exulting in the healthy breeze which at this exposed height was strong and fresh as they advanced to the opposite declivity to that which they had ascended a wide and peculiar landscape opened before them the extreme distance was formed by an undulating ridge of lofty and savage hills nearer than these were gentler elevations partially wooded and at their base was a rich valley its green meads fed by a clear and rapid stream which glittered in the sun as it coursed on losing itself at length in a wild and sedgy lake that formed the furthest limit of a widelyspreading park in the centre of this park and not very remote from the banks of the rivulet was an ancient gothic building that had once been an abbey of great repute and wealth and had not much suffered in its external character by having served for nearly two centuries and a half as the principal dwelling of an old baronial family  descending the downy hill that here and there was studded with fine old trees enriching by their presence the view from the abbey lady annabel and her party entered the meads and skirting the lake approached the venerable walls without crossing the stream  it was difficult to conceive a scene more silent and more desolate there was no sign of life and not a sound save the occasional cawing of a rook advancing towards the abbey they passed a pile of buildings that in the summer might be screened from sight by the foliage of a group of elms too scanty at present to veil their desolation wide gaps in the roof proved that the vast and dreary stables were no longer used there were empty granaries whose doors had fallen from their hinges the gate of the courtyard was prostrate on the ground and the silent clock that once adorned the cupola over the noble entrance arch had long lost its index even the litter of the yard appeared dusty and grey with age you felt sure no human foot could have disturbed it for years at the back of these buildings were nailed the trophies of the gamekeeper hundreds of wild cats dried to blackness stretched their downward heads and legs from the mouldering wall hawks magpies and jays hung in tattered remnants but all grey and even green with age and the heads of birds in plenteous rows nailed beak upward and so dried and shrivelled by the suns and winds and frosts of many seasons that their distinctive characters were lost  do you know my good pauncefort said lady annabel that i have an odd fancy today to force an entrance into the old abbey it is strange fond as i am of this walk that we have never yet entered it do you recollect our last vain efforts shall we be more fortunate this time think you  mistress pauncefort smiled and smirked and advancing to the old gloomy porch gave a determined ring at the bell its sound might be heard echoing through the old cloisters but a considerable time elapsed without any other effect being produced perhaps lady annabel would have now given up the attempt but the little venetia expressed so much regret at the disappointment that her mother directed the groom to reconnoitre in the neighbourhood and see if it were possible to discover any person connected with the mansion  i doubt our luck my lady said mistress pauncefort for they do say that the abbey is quite uninhabited  tis a pity said lady annabel for with all its desolation there is something about this spot which ever greatly interests me  mamma why does no one live here said venetia  the master of the abbey lives abroad my child  why does he mamma  never ask questions miss venetia said mistress pauncefort in a hushed and solemn tone it is not pretty lady annabel had moved away  the groom returned and said he had met an old man picking watercresses and he was the only person who lived in the abbey except his wife and she was bedridden the old man had promised to admit them when he had completed his task but not before and the groom feared it would be some time before he arrived  come pauncefort rest yourself on this bench said lady annabel seating herself in the porch and venetia my child come hither to me  mamma said venetia what is the name of the gentleman to whom this abbey belongs  lord cadurcis love  i should like to know why lord cadurcis lives abroad said venetia musingly  there are many reasons why persons may choose to quit their native country and dwell in another my love said lady annabel very quietly some change the climate for their health  did lord cadurcis mamma asked venetia  i do not know lord cadurcis dear or anything of him except that he is a very old man and has no family  at this moment there was a sound of bars and bolts withdrawn and the falling of a chain and at length the massy door slowly opened and the old man appeared and beckoned to them to enter  tis eight years come martinmas since i opened this door said the old man and it sticks a bit you must walk about by yourselves for i have no breath and my mistress is bedridden there straight down the cloister you cant miss your way there is not much to see  the interior of the abbey formed a quadrangle surrounded by the cloisters and in this inner court was a curious fountain carved with exquisite skill by some gothic artist in one of those capricious moods of sportive invention that produced those grotesque medleys for which the feudal sculptor was celebrated not a sound was heard except the fall of the fountain and the light echoes that its voice called up  the staircase led lady annabel and her party through several small rooms scantily garnished with ancient furniture in some of which were portraits of the family until they at length entered a noble saloon once the refectory of the abbey and not deficient in splendour though sadly soiled and wormeaten it was hung with tapestry representing the cartoons of raffael and their still vivid colours contrasted with the faded hangings and the dingy damask of the chairs and sofas a mass of cromwellian armour was huddled together in a corner of a long monkish gallery with a standard encrusted with dust and a couple of old drums one broken from one of the windows they had a good view of the old walled garden which did not tempt them to enter it it was a wilderness the walks no longer distinguishable from the rank vegetation of the once cultivated lawns the terraces choked up with the unchecked shrubberies and here and there a leaden statue a goddess or a satyr prostrate and covered with moss and lichen  it makes me melancholy said lady annabel let us return  mamma said venetia are there any ghosts in this abbey  you may well ask me love replied lady annabel it seems a spellbound place but venetia i have often told you there are no such things as ghosts  is it naughty to believe in ghosts mamma for i cannot help believing in them  when you are older and have more knowledge you will not believe in them venetia replied lady annabel  our friends left cadurcis abbey venetia mounted her donkey her mother walked by her side the sun was beginning to decline when they again reached cherbury and the air was brisk lady annabel was glad to find herself by her fireside in her little terraceroom and venetia fetching her book read to her mother until their dinner hour     chapter iii   two serene and innocent years had glided away at cherbury since this morning ramble to cadurcis abbey and venetia had grown in loveliness in goodness and intelligence her lively and somewhat precocious mind had become greatly developed and though she was only nine years of age it scarcely needed the affection of a mother to find in her an interesting and engaging companion although feminine education was little regarded in those days that of lady annabel had been an exception to the general practice of society she had been brought up with the consciousness of other objects of female attainment and accomplishment than embroidery the complete art of making pastry and reading the whole duty of man she had profited when a child by the guidance of her brothers tutor who had bestowed no unfruitful pains upon no ordinary capacity she was a good linguist a fine musician was well read in our elder poets and their italian originals was no unskilful artist and had acquired some knowledge of botany when wandering as a girl in her native woods since her retirement to cherbury reading had been her chief resource the hall contained a library whose shelves indeed were more full than choice but amid folios of theological controversy and civil law there might be found the first editions of most of the celebrated writers of the reign of anne which the contemporary proprietor of cherbury a man of wit and fashion in his day had duly collected in his yearly visits to the metropolis and finally deposited in the family bookroom  the education of her daughter was not only the principal duty of lady annabel but her chief delight to cultivate the nascent intelligence of a child in those days was not the mere piece of scientific mechanism that the admirable labours of so many ingenious writers have since permitted it comparatively to become in those days there was no mrs barbauld no madame de genlis no miss edgeworth no evenings at home no childrens friend no parents assistant venetia loved her book indeed she was never happier than when reading but she soon recoiled from the gilt and lilliputian volumes of the good mr newbury and her mind required some more substantial excitement than tom thumb or even goody twoshoes the seven champions was a great resource and a great favourite but it required all the vigilance of a mother to eradicate the false impressions which such studies were continually making on so tender a student and to disenchant by rational discussion the fascinated imagination of her child lady annabel endeavoured to find some substitute in the essays of addison and steele but they required more knowledge of the everyday world for their enjoyment than an infant bred in such seclusion could at present afford and at last venetia lost herself in the wildering pages of clelia and the arcadia which she pored over with a rapt and ecstatic spirit that would not comprehend the warning scepticism of her parent let us picture to ourselves the highbred lady annabel in the terraceroom of her ancient hall working at her tapestry and seated at her feet her little daughter venetia reading aloud the arcadia the peacocks have jumped up on the windowsill to look at their friends who love to feed them and by their pecking have aroused the bloodhound crouching at lady annabels feet and venetia looks up from her folio with a flushed and smiling face to catch the sympathy of her mother who rewards her daughters study with a kiss ah there are no such mothers and no such daughters now  thus it will be seen that the life and studies of venetia tended rather dangerously in spite of all the care of her mother to the development of her imagination in case indeed she possessed that terrible and fatal gift she passed her days in unbroken solitude or broken only by affections which softened her heart and in a scene which itself might well promote any predisposition of the kind beautiful and picturesque objects surrounded her on all sides she wandered at it were in an enchanted wilderness and watched the deer reposing under the green shadow of stately trees the old hall itself was calculated to excite mysterious curiosity one wing was uninhabited and shut up each morning and evening she repaired with her mother and the household through long galleries to the chapel where she knelt to her devotions illumined by a window blazoned with the arms of that illustrious family of which she was a member and of which she knew nothing she had an indefinite and painful consciousness that she had been early checked in the natural inquiries which occur to every child she had insensibly been trained to speak only of what she saw and when she listened at night to the long ivy rustling about the windows and the wild owls hooting about the mansion with their pining melancholy voices she might have been excused for believing in those spirits which her mother warned her to discredit or she forgot these mournful impressions in dreams caught from her romantic volumes of bright knights and beautiful damsels  only one event of importance had occurred at cherbury during these two years if indeed that be not too strong a phrase to use in reference to an occurrence which occasioned so slight and passing an interest lord cadurcis had died he had left his considerable property to his natural children but the abbey had descended with the title to a very distant relative the circle at cherbury had heard and that was all that the new lord was a minor a little boy indeed very little older than venetia herself but this information produced no impression the abbey was still deserted and desolate as ever     chapter iv   every sunday afternoon the rector of a neighbouring though still somewhat distant parish of which the rich living was in the gift of the herberts came to perform divine service at cherbury it was a subject of deep regret to lady annabel that herself and her family were debarred from the advantage of more frequent and convenient spiritual consolation but at this time the parochial discipline of the church of england was not so strict as it fortunately is at present cherbury though a vicarage possessed neither parish church nor a residence for the clergyman nor was there indeed a village the peasants on the estate or labourers as they are now styled a term whose introduction into our rural world is much to be lamented lived in the respective farmhouses on the lands which they cultivated these were scattered about at considerable distances and many of their inmates found it more convenient to attend the church of the contiguous parish than to repair to the hall chapel where the household and the dwellers in the few cottages scattered about the park and woods always assembled the lady annabel whose lot it had been in life to find her best consolation in religion and who was influenced by not only a sincere but even a severe piety had no other alternative therefore but engaging a chaplain but this after much consideration she had resolved not to do she was indeed her own chaplain herself performing each day such parts of our morning and evening service whose celebration becomes a laic and reading portions from the writings of those eminent divines who from the restoration to the conclusion of the last reign have so eminently distinguished the communion of our national church  each sunday after the performance of divine service the rev dr masham dined with the family and he was the only guest at cherbury venetia ever remembered seeing the doctor was a regular orthodox divine of the eighteenth century with a large cauliflower wig shovelhat and huge kneebuckles barely covered by his topboots learned jovial humorous and somewhat courtly truly pious but not enthusiastic not forgetful of his tithes but generous and charitable when they were once paid never neglecting the sick yet occasionally following a fox a fine scholar an active magistrate and a good shot dreading the pope and hating the presbyterians  the doctor was attached to the herbert family not merely because they had given him a good living he had a great reverence for an old english race and turned up his nose at the walpolian loanmongers lady annabel too so beautiful so dignified so amiable and highly bred and above all so pious had won his regard he was not a little proud too that he was the only person in the county who had the honour of her acquaintance and yet was disinterested enough to regret that he led so secluded a life and often lamented that nothing would induce her to show her elegant person on a racecourse or to attend an assize ball an assembly which was then becoming much the fashion the little venetia was a charming child and the kindhearted doctor though a bachelor loved children    o matre pulchrâ filia pulchrior  was the rev dr mashams apposite and favourite quotation after his weekly visit to cherbury  divine service was concluded the doctor had preached a capital sermon for he had been one of the shining lights of his university until his rich but isolating preferment had apparently closed the great career which it was once supposed awaited him the accustomed walk on the terrace was completed and dinner was announced this meal was always celebrated at cherbury where new fashions stole down with a lingering pace in the great hall itself an ample table was placed in the centre on a mat of rushes sheltered by a large screen covered with huge maps of the shire and the neighbouring counties the lady annabel and her good pastor seated themselves at each end of the table while venetia mounted on a high chair was waited on by mistress pauncefort who never condescended by any chance attention to notice the presence of any other individual but her little charge on whose chair she just leaned with an air of condescending devotion the butler stood behind his lady and two other servants watched the doctor rural bodies all but decked on this day in gorgeous livery coats of blue and silver which had been made originally for men of very different size and bearing simple as was the usual diet at cherbury the cook was permitted on sunday full play to her art which in the eighteenth century indulged in the production of dishes more numerous and substantial than our refined tastes could at present tolerate the doctor appreciated a good dinner and his countenance glistened with approbation as he surveyed the ample tureen of potage royal with a boned duck swimming in its centre before him still scowled in death the grim countenance of a huge roast pike flanked on one side by a leg of mutton àladaube and on the other by the tempting delicacies of bombarded veal to these succeeded that masterpiece of the culinary art a grand battalia pie in which the bodies of chickens pigeons and rabbits were embalmed in spices cocks combs and savoury balls and well bedewed with one of those rich sauces of claret anchovy and sweet herbs in which our greatgrandfathers delighted and which was technically termed a lear but the grand essay of skill was the cover of this pasty whereon the curious cook had contrived to represent all the onceliving forms that were now entombed in that gorgeous sepulchre a florentine tourte or tansy an old english custard a more refined blamango and a riband jelly of many colours offered a pleasant relief after these vaster inventions and the repast closed with a dish of oyster loaves and a pompetone of larks  notwithstanding the abstemiousness of his hostess the doctor was never deterred from doing justice to her hospitality few were the dishes that ever escaped him the demon dyspepsia had not waved its fell wings over the eighteenth century and wonderful were the feats then achieved by a country gentleman with the united aid of a good digestion and a good conscience  the servants had retired and dr masham had taken his last glass of port and then he rang a bell on the table and i trust my fair readers will not be frightened from proceeding with this history a servant brought him his pipe the pipe was well stuffed duly lighted and duly puffed and then taking it from his mouth the doctor spoke  and so my honoured lady you have got a neighbour at last  indeed exclaimed lady annabel  but the claims of the pipe prevented the good doctor from too quickly satisfying her natural curiosity another puff or two and he then continued  yes said he the old abbey has at last found a tenant  a tenant doctor  ay the best tenant in the world its proprietor  you quite surprise me when did this occur  they have been there these three days i have paid them a visit mrs cadurcis has come to live at the abbey with the little lord  this is indeed news to us said lady annabel and what kind of people are they  you know my dear madam said the doctor just touching the ash of his pipe with his tobaccostopper of chased silver that the present lord is a very distant relative of the late one  lady annabel bowed assent  the late lord continued the doctor who was as strange and wrongheaded a man as ever breathed though i trust he is in the kingdom of heaven for all that left all his property to his unlawful children with the exception of this estate entailed on the title as all estates should be tis a fine place but no great rental i doubt whether tis more than a clear twelve hundred ayear  and mrs cadurcis inquired lady annabel  was an heiress replied the doctor and the late mr cadurcis a spendrift he was a bad manager and worse a bad husband providence was pleased to summon him suddenly from this mortal scene but not before he had dissipated the greater part of his wifes means mrs cadurcis since she was a widow has lived in strict seclusion with her little boy as you may my dear lady with your dear little girl but i am afraid said the doctor shaking his head she has not been in the habit of dining so well as we have today a very limited income my dear madam a very limited income indeed and the guardians i am told will only allow the little lord a hundred ayear but on her own income whatever it may be and that addition she has resolved to live at the abbey and i believe i believe she has it rentfree but i dont know  poor woman said lady annabel and not without a sigh i trust her child is her consolation  venetia had not spoken during this conversation but she had listened to it very attentively at length she said mamma is not a widow a wife that has lost her husband  you are right my dear said lady annabel rather gravely  venetia mused a moment and then replied pray mamma are you a widow  my dear little girl said dr masham go and give that beautiful peacock a pretty piece of cake  lady annabel and the doctor rose from the table with venetia and took a turn in the park while the doctors horses were getting ready  i think my good lady said the doctor it would be but an act of christian charity to call upon mrs cadurcis  i was thinking the same said lady annabel i am interested by what you have told me of her history and fortunes we have some woes in common i hope some joys it seems that this case should indeed be an exception to my rule  i would not ask you to sacrifice your inclinations to the mere pleasures of the world said the doctor but duties my dear lady duties there are such things as duties to our neighbour and here is a case where believe me they might be fulfilled  the doctors horses now appeared both master and groom wore their pistols in their holsters the doctor shook hands warmly with lady annabel and patted venetia on her head as she ran up from a little distance with an eager countenance to receive her accustomed blessing then mounting his stout mare he once more waived his hand with an air of courtliness to his hostess and was soon out of sight lady annabel and venetia returned to the terraceroom     chapter v   and so i would my lady said mistress pauncefort when lady annabel communicated to her faithful attendant at night the news of the arrival of the cadurcis family at the abbey and her intention of paying mrs cadurcis a visit and so i would my lady said mistress pauncefort and it would be but an act of christian charity after all as the doctor says for although it is not for me to complain when my betters are satisfied and after all i am always content if your ladyship be still there is no denying the fact that this is a terrible lonesome life after all and i cannot help thinking your ladyship has not been looking so well of late and a little society would do your ladyship good and miss venetia too after all she wants a playfellow i am certain sure that i was as tired of playing at ball with her this morning as if i had never sat down in my born days and i dare say the little lord will play with her all day long  if i thought that this visit would lead to what is understood by the word society my good pauncefort i certainly should refrain from paying it said lady annabel very quietly  oh lord dear my lady i was not for a moment dreaming of any such thing replied mistress pauncefort society i know as well as any one means grand balls ranelagh and the masquerades i cant abide the thought of them i do assure your ladyship all i meant was that a quiet dinner now and then with a few friends a dance perhaps in the evening or a hand of whist or a game of romps at christmas when the abbey will of course be quite full a  i believe there is as little chance of the abbey being full at christmas or any other time as there is of cherbury said lady annabel mrs cadurcis is a widow with a very slender fortune her son will not enjoy his estate until he is of age and its rental is small i am led to believe that they will live quite as quietly as ourselves and when i spoke of christian charity i was thinking only of kindness towards them and not of amusement for ourselves  well my lady your laship knows best replied mistress pauncefort evidently very disappointed for she had indulged in momentary visions of noble visitors and noble valets i am always content you know when your laship is but i must say i think it is very odd for a lord to be so poor i never heard of such a thing i think they will turn out richer than you have an idea my lady your laship knows tis quite a saying as rich as a lord  lady annabel smiled but did not reply  the next morning the fawncoloured chariot which had rarely been used since lady annabels arrival at cherbury and four black longtailed coachhorses that from absolute necessity had been degraded in the interval to the service of the cart and the plough made their appearance after much bustle and effort before the halldoor although a mornings stroll from cherbury through the woods cadurcis was distant nearly ten miles by the road and that road was in great part impassable save in favourable seasons this visit therefore was an expedition and lady annabel fearing the fatigue for a child determined to leave venetia at home from whom she had actually never been separated one hour in her life venetia could not refrain from shedding a tear when her mother embraced and quitted her and begged as a last favour that she might accompany her through the park to the avenue lodge so pauncefort and herself entered the chariot that rocked like a ship in spite of all the skill of the coachman and the postilion  venetia walked home with mistress pauncefort but lady annabels little daughter was not in her usual lively spirits many a butterfly glanced around without attracting her pursuit and the deer trooped by without eliciting a single observation at length she said in a thoughtful tone mistress pauncefort i should have liked to have gone and seen the little boy  you shall go and see him another day miss replied her attendant  mistress pauncefort said venetia are you a widow  mistress pauncefort almost started had the inquiry been made by a man she would almost have supposed he was going to be very rude she was indeed much surprised  and pray miss venetia what could put it in your head to ask such an odd question exclaimed mistress pauncefort a widow miss venetia i have never yet changed my name and i shall not in a hurry that i can tell you  do widows change their names said venetia  all women change their names when they marry responded mistress pauncefort  is mamma married inquired venetia  la miss venetia well to be sure you do ask the strangest questions married to be sure she is married said mistress pauncefort exceedingly flustered  and whom is she married to pursued the unwearied venetia  your papa to be sure said mistress pauncefort blushing up to her eyes and looking very confused that is to say miss venetia you are never to ask questions about such subjects have not i often told you it is not pretty  why is it not pretty said venetia  because it is not proper said mistress pauncefort because your mamma does not like you to ask such questions and she will be very angry with me for answering them i can tell you that  i tell you what mistress pauncefort said venetia i think mamma is a widow  and what then miss venetia there is no shame in that  shame exclaimed venetia what is shame  look there is a pretty butterfly exclaimed mistress pauncefort did you ever see such a pretty butterfly miss  i do not care about butterflies today mistress pauncefort i like to talk about widows  was there ever such a child exclaimed mistress pauncefort with a wondering glance  i must have had a papa said venetia all the ladies i read about had papas and married husbands then whom did my mamma marry  lord miss venetia you know very well your mamma always tells you that all those books you read are a pack of stories observed mistress pauncefort with an air of triumphant art  there never were such persons perhaps said venetia but it is not true that there never were such things as papas and husbands for all people have papas you must have had a papa mistress pauncefort  to be sure i had said mistress pauncefort bridling up  and a mamma too said venetia  as honest a woman as ever lived said mistress pauncefort  then if i have no papa mamma must be a wife that has lost her husband and that mamma told me at dinner yesterday was a widow  was the like ever seen exclaimed mistress pauncefort and what then miss venetia  it seems to me so odd that only two people should live here and both be widows said venetia and both have a little child the only difference is that one is a little boy and i am a little girl  when ladies lose their husbands they do not like to have their names mentioned said mistress pauncefort and so you must never talk of your papa to my lady and that is the truth  i will not now said venetia  when they returned home mistress pauncefort brought her work and seated herself on the terrace that she might not lose sight of her charge venetia played about for some little time she made a castle behind a tree and fancied she was a knight and then a lady and conjured up an ogre in the neighbouring shrubbery but these daydreams did not amuse her as much as usual she went and fetched her book but even the seven champions could not interest her her eye was fixed upon the page and apparently she was absorbed in her pursuit but her mind wandered and the page was never turned she indulged in an unconscious reverie her fancy was with her mother on her visit the old abbey rose up before her she painted the scene without an effort the court with the fountain the grand room with the tapestry hangings that desolate garden with the fallen statues and that long gloomy gallery and in all these scenes appeared that little boy who somehow or other seemed wonderfully blended with her imaginings it was a very long day this venetia dined along with mistress pauncefort the time hung very heavy at length she fell asleep in mistress paunceforts lap a sound roused her the carriage had returned she ran to greet her mother but there was no news mrs cadurcis had been absent she had gone to a distant town to buy some furniture and after all lady annabel had not seen the little boy    chapter vi   a few days after the visit to cadurcis when lady annabel was sitting alone a postchaise drove up to the hall whence issued a short and stout woman with a rubicund countenance and dressed in a style which remarkably blended the shabby with the tawdry she was accompanied by a boy between eleven and twelve years of age whose appearance however much contrasted with that of his mother for he was pale and slender with long curling black hair and large black eyes which occasionally by their transient flashes agreeably relieved a face the general expression of which might be esteemed somewhat shy and sullen the lady of course was mrs cadurcis who was received by lady annabel with the greatest courtesy  a terrible journey exclaimed mrs cadurcis fanning herself as she took her seat and so very hot plantagenet my love make your bow have not i always told you to make a bow when you enter a room especially where there are strangers this is lady annabel herbert who was so kind as to call upon us make your bow to lady annabel  the boy gave a sort of sulky nod but lady annabel received it so graciously and expressed herself so kindly to him that his features relaxed a little though he was quite silent and sat on the edge of his chair the picture of dogged indifference  charming country lady annabel said mrs cadurcis but worse roads if possible than we had in northumberland where indeed there were no roads at all cherbury a delightful place very unlike the abbey dreadfully lonesome i assure you i find it lady annabel great change for us from a little town and all our kind neighbours very different from morpeth is it not plantagenet  i hate morpeth said the boy  hate morpeth exclaimed mrs cadurcis well i am sure that is very ungrateful with so many kind friends as we always found besides plantagenet have i not always told you that you are to hate nothing it is very wicked the trouble it costs me lady annabel to educate this dear child continued mrs cadurcis turning to lady annabel and speaking in a semitone i have done it all myself i assure you and when he likes he can be as good as any one cant you plantagenet  lord cadurcis gave a grim smile seated himself at the very back of the deep chair and swung his feet which no longer reached the ground to and fro  i am sure that lord cadurcis always behaves well said lady annabel  there plantagenet exclaimed mrs cadurcis only listen to that hear what lady annabel herbert says she is sure you always behave well now mind never give her ladyship cause to change her opinion  plantagenet curled his lip and half turned his back on his companions  i regretted so much that i was not at home when you did me the honour to call resumed mrs cadurcis but i had gone over for the day to southport buying furniture what a business it is to buy furniture lady annabel added mrs cadurcis with a piteous expression  it is indeed very troublesome said lady annabel  ah you have none of these cares continued mrs cadurcis surveying the pretty apartment what a difference between cherbury and the abbey i suppose you have never been there  indeed it is one of my favourite walks answered lady annabel and some two years ago i even took the liberty of walking through the house  was there ever such a place exclaimed mrs cadurcis i assure you my poor head turns whenever i try to find my way about it but the trustees offered it us and i thought it my duty to my son to reside there besides it was a great offer to a widow if poor mr cadurcis had been alive it would have been different i hardly know what i shall do there particularly in winter my spirits are always dreadfully low i only hope plantagenet will behave well if he goes into his tantarums at the abbey and particularly in winter i hardly know what will become of me  i am sure lord cadurcis will do everything to make the abbey comfortable to you besides it is but a short walk from cherbury and you must come often and see us  oh plantagenet can be good if he likes i can assure you lady annabel and behaves as properly as any little boy i know plantagenet my dear speak have not i always told you when you pay a visit that you should open your mouth now and then i dont like chattering children added mrs cadurcis but i like them to answer when they are spoken to  nobody has spoken to me said lord cadurcis in a sullen tone  plantagenet my love said his mother in a solemn voice  well mother what do you want  plantagenet my love you know you promised me to be good  well what have i done  lord cadurcis said lady annabel interfering do you like to look at pictures  thank you replied the little lord in a more courteous tone i like to be left alone  did you ever know such an odd child said mrs cadurcis and yet lady annabel you must not judge him by what you see i do assure you he can behave when he likes as pretty as possible  pretty muttered the little lord between his teeth  if you had only seen him at morpeth sometimes at a little tea party said mrs cadurcis he really was quite the ornament of the company  no i wasnt said lord cadurcis  plantagenet said his mother again in a solemn tone have i not always told you that you are never to contradict any one  the little lord indulged in a suppressed growl  there was a little play last christmas continued mrs cadurcis and he acted quite delightfully now you would not think that from the way he sits upon that chair plantagenet my dear i do insist upon your behaving yourself sit like a man  i am not a man said lord cadurcis very quietly i wish i were  plantagenet said the mother have not i always told you that you are never to answer me it is not proper for children to answer o lady annabel if you knew what it cost me to educate my son he never does anything i wish and it is so provoking because i know that he can behave as properly as possible if he likes he does it to provoke me you know you do it to provoke me you little brat now sit properly sir i do desire you to sit properly how vexatious that you should call at cherbury for the first time and behave in this manner plantagenet do you hear me exclaimed mrs cadurcis with a face reddening to scarlet and almost menacing a move from her seat  yes everybody hears you mrs cadurcis said the little lord  dont call me mrs cadurcis exclaimed the mother in a dreadful rage that is not the way to speak to your mother i will not be called mrs cadurcis by you dont answer me sir i desire you not to answer me i have half a mind to get up and give you a good shake that i have o lady annabel sighed mrs cadurcis while a tear trickled down her cheek if you only knew the life i lead and what trouble it costs me to educate that child  my dear madam said lady annabel i am sure that lord cadurcis has no other wish but to please you indeed you have misunderstood him  yes she always misunderstands me said lord cadurcis in a softer tone but with pouting lips and suffused eyes  now he is going on said his mother beginning herself to cry dreadfully he knows my weak heart he knows nobody in the world loves him like his mother and this is the way he treats me  my dear mrs cadurcis said lady annabel pray take luncheon after your long drive and lord cadurcis i am sure you must be fatigued  thank you i never eat my dear lady said mrs cadurcis except at my meals but one glass of mountain if you please i would just take the liberty of tasting for the weather is so dreadfully hot and plantagenet has so aggravated me i really do not feel myself  lady annabel sounded her silver handbell and the butler brought some cakes and the mountain mrs cadurcis revived by virtue of her single glass and the providential cooperation of a subsequent one or two even the cakes and the mountain however would not tempt her son to open his mouth and this in spite of her returning composure drove her to desperation a conviction that the mountain and the cakes were delicious an amiable desire that the palate of her spoiled child should be gratified some reasonable maternal anxiety that after so long and fatiguing a drive he in fact needed some refreshment and the agonising consciousness that all her own physical pleasure at the moment was destroyed by the mental sufferings she endured at having quarrelled with her son and that he was depriving himself of what was so agreeable only to pique her quite overwhelmed the illregulated mind of this fond mother between each sip and each mouthful she appealed to him to follow her example now with cajolery now with menace till at length worked up by the united stimulus of the mountain and her own ungovernable rage she dashed down the glass and unfinished slice of cake and before the astonished lady annabel rushed forward to give him what she had long threatened and what she in general ultimately had recourse to a good shake  her agile son experienced in these storms escaped in time and pushed his chair before his infuriated mother mrs cadurcis however rallied and chased him round the room once more she flattered herself she had captured him once more he evaded her in her despair she took up venetias seven champions and threw the volume at his head he laughed a fiendish laugh as ducking his head the book flew on and dashed through a pane of glass mrs cadurcis made a desperate charge and her son a little frightened at her almost maniacal passion saved himself by suddenly seizing lady annabels worktable and whirling it before her mrs cadurcis fell over the leg of the table and went into hysterics while the bloodhound who had long started from his repose looked at his mistress for instructions and in the meantime continued barking the astonished and agitated lady annabel assisted mrs cadurcis to rise and led her to a couch lord cadurcis pale and dogged stood in a corner and after all this uproar there was a comparative calm only broken by the sobs of the mother each instant growing fainter and fainter  at this moment the door opened and mistress pauncefort ushered in the little venetia she really looked like an angel of peace sent from heaven on a mission of concord with her long golden hair her bright face and smile of ineffable loveliness  mamma said venetia in the sweetest tone  hush darling said lady annabel this lady is not very well  mrs cadurcis opened her eyes and sighed she beheld venetia and stared at her with a feeling of wonder o lady annabel she faintly exclaimed what must you think of me but was there ever such an unfortunate mother and i have not a thought in the world but for that boy i have devoted my life to him and never would have buried myself in this abbey but for his sake and this is the way he treats me and his father before him treated me even worse am i not the most unfortunate woman you ever knew  my dear madam said the kind lady annabel in a soothing tone you will be very happy yet all will be quite right and quite happy  is this angel your child inquired mrs cadurcis in a low voice  this is my little girl venetia come hither venetia and speak to mrs cadurcis  how do you do mrs cadurcis said venetia i am so glad you have come to live at the abbey  the angel exclaimed mrs cadurcis the sweet seraph oh why did not my plantagenet speak to you lady annabel in the same tone and he can if he likes he can indeed it was his silence that so mortified me it was his silence that led to all i am so proud of him and then he comes here and never speaks a word o plantagenet i am sure you will break my heart  venetia went up to the little lord in the corner and gently stroked his dark cheek are you the little boy she said  cadurcis looked at her at first the glance was rather fierce but it instantly relaxed what is your name he said in a low but not unkind tone  venetia  i like you venetia said the boy do you live here  yes with my mamma  i like your mamma too but not so much as you i like your gold hair  oh how funny to like my gold hair  if you had come in sooner said cadurcis we should not have had this row  what is a row little boy said venetia  do not call me little boy he said but not in an unkind tone call me by my name  what is your name  lord cadurcis but you may call me by my christian name because i like you  what is your christian name  plantagenet  plantagenet what a long name said venetia tell me then plantagenet what is a row  what often takes place between me and my mother but which i am sorry now has happened here for i like this place and should like to come often a row is a quarrel  a quarrel what do you quarrel with your mamma  often  why then you are not a good boy  ah my mamma is not like yours said the little lord with a sigh it is not my fault but now i want to make it up how shall i do it  go and give her a kiss  poh that is not the way  shall i go and ask my mamma what is best to do said venetia and she stole away on tiptoe and whispered to lady annabel that plantagenet wanted her her mother came forward and invited lord cadurcis to walk on the terrace with her leaving venetia to amuse her other guest  lady annabel though kind was frank and firm in her unexpected confidential interview with her new friend she placed before him clearly the enormity of his conduct which no provocation could justify it was a violation of divine law as well as human propriety she found the little lord attentive tractable and repentant and what might not have been expected exceedingly ingenious and intelligent his observations indeed were distinguished by remarkable acuteness and though he could not and indeed did not even attempt to vindicate his conduct he incidentally introduced much that might be urged in its extenuation there was indeed in this his milder moment something very winning in his demeanour and lady annabel deeply regretted that a nature of so much promise and capacity should by the injudicious treatment of a parent at once fond and violent afford such slight hopes of future happiness it was arranged between lord cadurcis and lady annabel that she should lead him to his mother and that he should lament the past and ask her forgiveness so they reentered the room venetia was listening to a long story from mrs cadurcis who appeared to have entirely recovered herself but her countenance assumed a befitting expression of grief and gravity when she observed her son  my dear madam said lady annabel your son is unhappy that he should have offended you and he has asked my kind offices to effect a perfect reconciliation between a child who wishes to be dutiful to a parent who he feels has always been so affectionate  mrs cadurcis began crying  mother said her son i am sorry for what has occurred mine was the fault i shall not be happy till you pardon me  no yours was not the fault said poor mrs cadurcis crying bitterly oh no it was not i was in fault only i there lady annabel did i not tell you he was the sweetest dearest most generoushearted creature that ever lived oh if he would only always speak so i am sure i should be the happiest woman that ever breathed he puts me in mind quite of his poor dear father who was an angel upon earth he was indeed when he was not vexed o my dear plantagenet my only hope and joy you are the treasure and consolation of my life and always will be god bless you my darling child you shall have that pony you wanted i am sure i can manage it i did not think i could  as lady annabel thought it was as well that the mother and the son should not be immediately thrown together after this storm she kindly proposed that they should remain and pass the day at cherbury and as plantagenets eyes brightened at the proposal it did not require much trouble to persuade his mother to accede to it the day that had commenced so inauspiciously turned out one of the most agreeable both to mrs cadurcis and her child the two mothers conversed together and as mrs cadurcis was a great workwoman there was at least one bond of sympathy between her and the tapestry of her hostess then they all took a stroll in the park and as mrs cadurcis was not able to walk for any length of time the children were permitted to stroll about together attended by mistress pauncefort while mrs cadurcis chatting without ceasing detailed to lady annabel all the history of her life all the details of her various complaints and her economical arrangements and all the secrets of her husbands treatment of her that favourite subject on which she ever waxed most eloquent plantagenet equally indulging in confidence which with him however was unusual poured all his soul into the charmed ear of venetia he told her how he and his mother had lived at morpeth and how he hated it how poor they had been and how rich he should be how he loved the abbey and especially the old gallery and the drums and armour how he had been a dayscholar at a little school which he abhorred and how he was to go some day to eton of which he was very proud  at length they were obliged to return and when dinner was over the postchaise was announced mrs cadurcis parted from lady annabel with all the warm expressions of a heart naturally kind and generous and plantagenet embraced venetia and promised that the next day he would find his way alone from cadurcis through the wood and come and take another walk with her     chapter vii   this settlement of mrs cadurcis and her son in the neighbourhood was an event of no slight importance in the life of the family at cherbury venetia at length found a companion of her own age itself an incident which in its influence upon her character and pursuits was not to be disregarded there grew up between the little lord and the daughter of lady annabel that fond intimacy which not rarely occurs in childhood plantagenet and venetia quickly imbibed for each other a singular affection not displeasing to lady annabel who observed without dissatisfaction the increased happiness of her child and encouraged by her kindness the frequent visits of the boy who soon learnt the shortest road from the abbey and almost daily scaled the hill and traced his way through the woods to the hall there was much indeed in the character and the situation of lord cadurcis which interested lady annabel herbert his mild engaging and affectionate manners when he was removed from the injudicious influence of his mother won upon her feelings she felt for this lone child whom nature had gifted with so soft a heart and with a thoughtful mind whose outbreaks not unfrequently attracted her notice with none to guide him and with only one heart to look up to for fondness and that too one that had already contrived to forfeit the respect even of so young a child  yet lady annabel was too sensible of the paramount claims of a mother herself indeed too jealous of any encroachment on the full privileges of maternal love to sanction in the slightest degree by her behaviour any neglect of mrs cadurcis by her son for his sake therefore she courted the society of her new neighbour and although mrs cadurcis offered little to engage lady annabels attention as a companion though she was violent in her temper far from well informed and from the society in which in spite of her original good birth her later years had passed very far from being refined she was not without her good qualities she was generous kindhearted and grateful not insensible of her own deficiencies and respectable from her misfortunes lady annabel was one of those who always judged individuals rather by their good qualities than their bad with the exception of her violent temper which under the control of lady annabels presence and by the aid of all that kind persons skilful management mrs cadurcis generally contrived to bridle her principal faults were those of manner which from the force of habit every day became less painful mrs cadurcis who indeed was only a child of a larger growth became scarcely less attached to the herbert family than her son she felt that her life under their influence was happier and serener than of yore that there were less domestic broils than in old days that her son was more dutiful and as she could not help suspecting though she found it difficult to analyse the cause herself more amiable the truth was lady annabel always treated mrs cadurcis with studied respect and the children and especially venetia followed her example mrs cadurcis selfcomplacency was not only less shocked but more gratified than before and this was the secret of her happiness for no one was more mortified by her rages when they were past than mrs cadurcis herself she felt they compromised her dignity and had lost her all moral command over a child whom she loved at the bottom of her heart with a kind of wild passion though she would menace and strike him and who often precipitated these paroxysms by denying his mother that duty and affection which were after all the great charm and pride of her existence  as mrs cadurcis was unable to walk to cherbury and as plantagenet soon fell into the habit of passing every morning at the hall lady annabel was frequent in her visits to the mother and soon she persuaded mrs cadurcis to order the old postchaise regularly on saturday and remain at cherbury until the following monday by these means both families united together in the chapel at divine service while the presence of dr masham at their now increased sunday dinner was an incident in the monotonous life of mrs cadurcis far from displeasing to her the doctor gave her a little news of the neighbourhood and of the country in general amused her with an occasional anecdote of the queen and the young princesses and always lent her the last number of sylvanus urban  this weekly visit to cherbury the great personal attention which she always received there and the frequent morning walks of lady annabel to the abbey effectually repressed on the whole the jealousy which was a characteristic of mrs cadurcis nature and which the constant absence of her son from her in the mornings might otherwise have fatally developed but mrs cadurcis could not resist the conviction that the herberts were as much her friends as her childs her jealousy was balanced by her gratitude she was daily almost hourly sensible of some kindness of lady annabel for there were a thousand services in the power of the opulent and ample establishment of cherbury to afford the limited and desolate household at the abbey living in seclusion it is difficult to refrain from imbibing even a strong regard for our almost solitary companion however incompatible may be our pursuits and however our tastes may vary especially when that companion is grateful and duly sensible of the condescension of our intimacy and so it happened that before a year had elapsed that very mrs cadurcis whose first introduction at cherbury had been so unfavourable to her and from whose temper and manners the elegant demeanour and the disciplined mind of lady annabel herbert might have been excused for a moment recoiling had succeeded in establishing a strong hold upon the affections of her refined neighbour who sought on every occasion her society and omitted few opportunities of contributing to her comfort and welfare  in the meantime her son was the companion of venetia both in her pastimes and studies the education of lord cadurcis had received no further assistance than was afforded by the little grammarschool at morpeth where he had passed three or four years as a dayscholar and where his mother had invariably taken his part on every occasion that he had incurred the displeasure of his master there he had obtained some imperfect knowledge of latin yet the boy was fond of reading and had picked up in an odd way more knowledge than might have been supposed he had read bakers chronicle and the old universal history and plutarch and had turned over in the book room of an old gentleman at morpeth who had been attracted by his intelligence not a few curious old folios from which he had gleaned no contemptible store of curious instances of human nature his guardian whom he had never seen and who was a great nobleman and lived in london had signified to mrs cadurcis his intention of sending his ward to eton but that time had not yet arrived and mrs cadurcis who dreaded parting with her son determined to postpone it by every maternal artifice in her power at present it would have seemed that her sons intellect was to be left utterly uncultivated for there was no school in the neighbourhood which he could attend and no occasional assistance which could be obtained and to the constant presence of a tutor in the house mrs cadurcis was not less opposed than his lordship could have been himself  it was by degrees that lord cadurcis became the partner of venetia in her studies lady annabel had consulted dr masham about the poor little boy whose neglected state she deplored and the good doctor had offered to ride over to cherbury at least once a week besides sunday provided lady annabel would undertake that his directions in his absence should be attended to this her ladyship promised cheerfully nor had she any difficulty in persuading cadurcis to consent to the arrangement he listened with docility and patience to her representation of the fatal effects in his afterlife of his neglected education of the generous and advantageous offer of dr masham and how cheerfully she would exert herself to assist his endeavours if plantagenet would willingly submit to her supervision the little lord expressed to her his determination to do all that she desired and voluntarily promised her that she should never repent her goodness and he kept his word so every morning with the full concurrence of mrs cadurcis whose advice and opinion on the affair were most formally solicited by lady annabel plantagenet arrived early at the hall and took his writing and french lessons with venetia and then they alternately read aloud to lady annabel from the histories of hooke and echard when venetia repaired to her drawing cadurcis sat down to his latin exercise and in encouraging and assisting him lady annabel a proficient in italian began herself to learn the ancient language of the romans with such a charming mistress even these latin exercises were achieved in vain cadurcis after turning leaf over leaf would look round with a piteous air to his fair assistant o lady annabel i am sure the word is not in the dictionary lady annabel was in a moment at his side and by some magic of her fair fingers the word would somehow or other make its appearance after a little exposure of this kind plantagenet would labour with double energy until heaving a deep sigh of exhaustion and vexation he would burst forth o lady annabel indeed there is not a nominative case in this sentence and then lady annabel would quit her easel with her pencil in her hand and give all her intellect to the puzzling construction at length she would say i think plantagenet this must be our nominative case and so it always was  thus when wednesday came the longest and most laborious morning of all lord cadurcis studies and when he neither wrote nor read nor learnt french with venetia but gave up all his soul to dr masham he usually acquitted himself to that good persons satisfaction who left him in general with commendations that were not lost on the pupil and plenty of fresh exercises to occupy him and lady annabel until the next week when a year had thus passed away the happiest year yet in lord cadurcis life in spite of all his disadvantages he had contrived to make no inconsiderable progress almost deprived of a tutor he had advanced in classical acquirement more than during the whole of his preceding years of scholarship while his handwriting began to become intelligible he could read french with comparative facility and had turned over many a volume in the wellstored library at cherbury     chapter viii   when the hours of study were past the children with that zest for play which occupation can alone secure would go forth together and wander in the park here they had made a little world for themselves of which no one dreamed for venetia had poured forth all her arcadian lore into the ear of plantagenet and they acted together many of the adventures of the romance under the fond names of musidorus and philoclea cherbury was arcadia and cadurcis macedon while the intervening woods figured as the forests of thessaly and the breezy downs were the heights of pindus unwearied was the innocent sport of their virgin imaginations and it was a great treat if venetia attended by mistress pauncefort were permitted to accompany plantagenet some way on his return then they parted with an embrace in the woods of thessaly and musidorus strolled home with a heavy heart to his macedonian realm  parted from venetia the magic suddenly seemed to cease and musidorus was instantly transformed into the little lord cadurcis exhausted by the unconscious efforts of his fancy depressed by the separation from his sweet companion and shrinking from the unpoetical reception which at the best awaited him in his ungenial home often when thus alone would he loiter on his way and seat himself on the ridge and watch the setting sun as its dying glory illumined the turrets of his ancient house and burnished the waters of the lake until the tears stole down his cheek and yet he knew not why no thoughts of sorrow had flitted through his mind nor indeed had ideas of any description occurred to him it was a trance of unmeaning abstraction all that he felt was a mystical pleasure in watching the sunset and a conviction that if he were not with venetia that which he loved next best was to be alone  the little cadurcis in general returned home moody and silent and his mother too often irritated by his demeanour indulged in all the expressions of a quick and offended temper but since his intimacy with the herberts plantagenet had learnt to control his emotions and often successfully laboured to prevent those scenes of domestic recrimination once so painfully frequent there often too was a note from lady annabel to mrs cadurcis or some other slight memorial borne by her son which enlisted all the kind feelings of that lady in favour of her cherbury friends and then the evening was sure to pass over in peace and when plantagenet was not thus armed he exerted himself to be cordial and so on the whole with some skill in management and some trials of temper the mother and child contrived to live together with far greater comfort than they had of old  bedtime was always a great relief to plantagenet for it secured him solitude he would lie awake for hours indulging in sweet and unconscious reveries and brooding over the future morn that always brought happiness all that he used to sigh for was to be lady annabels son were he venetias brother then he was sure he never should be for a moment unhappy that parting from cherbury and the gloomy evenings at cadurcis would then be avoided in such a mood and lying awake upon his pillow he sought refuge from the painful reality that surrounded him in the creative solace of his imagination alone in his little bed cadurcis was venetias brother and he conjured up a thousand scenes in which they were never separated and wherein he always played an amiable and graceful part yet he loved the abbey his painful infancy was not associated with that scene it was not connected with any of those grovelling commonplaces of his life from which he had shrunk back with instinctive disgust even at a very tender age cadurcis was the spot to which in his most miserable moments at morpeth he had always looked forward as the only chance of emancipation from the distressing scene that surrounded him he had been brought up with a due sense of his future position and although he had ever affected a haughty indifference on the subject from his disrelish for the coarse acquaintances who were perpetually reminding him with chuckling selfcomplacency of his future greatness in secret he had ever brooded over his destiny as his only consolation he had imbibed from his own reflections at a very early period of life a due sense of the importance of his lot he was proud of his hereditary honours blended as they were with some glorious passages in the history of his country and prouder of his still more ancient line the eccentric exploits and the violent passions by which his race had been ever characterised were to him a source of secret exultation even the late lord who certainly had no claims to his gratitude for he had robbed the inheritance to the utmost of his power commanded from the wild decision of his life the savage respect of his successor in vain mrs cadurcis would pour forth upon this the favourite theme for her wrath and her lamentations all the bitter expressions of her rage and woe plantagenet had never imbibed her prejudices against the departed and had often irritated his mother by maintaining that the late lord was perfectly justified in his conduct  but in these almost daily separations between plantagenet and venetia how different was her lot to that of her companion she was the confidante of all his domestic sorrows and often he had requested her to exert her influence to obtain some pacifying missive from lady annabel which might secure him a quiet evening at cadurcis and whenever this had not been obtained the last words of venetia were ever not to loiter and to remember to speak to his mother as much as he possibly could venetia returned to a happy home welcomed by the smile of a soft and beautiful parent and with words of affection sweeter than music she found an engaging companion who had no thought but for her welfare her amusement and her instruction and often when the curtains were drawn the candles lit and venetia holding her mothers hand opened her book she thought of poor plantagenet so differently situated with no one to be kind to him with no one to sympathise with his thoughts and perhaps at the very moment goaded into some unhappy quarrel with his mother     chapter ix   the appearance of the cadurcis family on the limited stage of her life and the engrossing society of her companion had entirely distracted the thoughts of venetia from a subject to which in old days they were constantly recurring and that was her father by a process which had often perplexed her and which she could never succeed in analysing there had arisen in her mind without any ostensible agency on the part of her mother which she could distinctly recall a conviction that this was a topic on which she was never to speak this idea had once haunted her and she had seldom found herself alone without almost unconsciously musing over it notwithstanding the unvarying kindness of lady annabel she exercised over her child a complete and unquestioned control venetia was brought up with strictness which was only not felt to be severe because the system was founded on the most entire affection but fervent as her love was for her mother it was equalled by her profound respect which every word and action of lady annabel tended to maintain  in all the confidential effusions with plantagenet venetia had never dwelt upon this mysterious subject indeed in these conversations when they treated of their real and not ideal life venetia was a mere recipient all that she could communicate plantagenet could observe he it was who avenged himself at these moments for his habitual silence before third persons it was to venetia that he poured forth all his soul and she was never weary of hearing his stories about morpeth and all his sorrows disgusts and afflictions there was scarcely an individual in that little town with whom from his lively narratives she was not familiar and it was to her sympathising heart that he confided all his future hopes and prospects and confessed the strong pride he experienced in being a cadurcis which from all others was studiously concealed  it had happened that the first christmas day after the settlement of the cadurcis family at the abbey occurred in the middle of the week and as the weather was severe in order to prevent two journeys at such an inclement season lady annabel persuaded mrs cadurcis to pass the whole week at the hall this arrangement gave such pleasure to plantagenet that the walls of the abbey as the old postchaise was preparing for their journey quite resounded with his merriment in vain his mother harassed with all the mysteries of packing indulged in a thousand irritable expressions which at any other time might have produced a broil or even a fray cadurcis did nothing but laugh there was at the bottom of this boys heart with all his habitual gravity and reserve a fund of humour which would occasionally break out and which nothing could withstand when he was alone with venetia he would imitate the old maids of morpeth and all the ceremonies of a provincial tea party with so much life and genuine fun that venetia was often obliged to stop in their rambles to indulge her overwhelming mirth when they were alone and he was gloomy she was often accustomed to say now dear plantagenet tell me how the old ladies at morpeth drink tea  this morning at the abbey cadurcis was irresistible and the more excited his mother became with the difficulties which beset her the more gay and fluent were his quips and cranks puffing panting and perspiring now directing her waitingwoman now scolding her manservant and now ineffectually attempting to box her sons ears mrs cadurcis indeed offered a most ridiculous spectacle  john screamed mrs cadurcis in a voice of bewildered passion and stamping with rage is that the place for my capbox you do it on purpose that you do  john mimicked lord cadurcis how dare you do it on purpose  take that you brat shrieked the mother and she struck her own hand against the doorway oh ill give it you ill give it you she bellowed under the united influence of rage and pain and she pursued her agile child who dodged her on the other side of the postchaise which he persisted in calling the family carriage  oh maam my lady exclaimed the waitingwoman sallying forth from the abbey what is to be done with the parrot when we are away mrs brown says she wont see to it that she wont taynt her place  this rebellion of mrs brown was a diversion in favour of plantagenet mrs cadurcis waddled down the cloisters with precipitation rushed into the kitchen seized the surprised mrs brown by the shoulder and gave her a good shake and darting at the cage which held the parrot she bore it in triumph to the carriage i will take the bird with me said mrs cadurcis  we cannot take the bird inside madam said plantagenet for it will overhear all our conversation and repeat it we shall not be able to abuse our friends  mrs cadurcis threw the cage at her sons head who for the sake of the bird dexterously caught it but declared at the same time he would immediately throw it into the lake then mrs cadurcis began to cry with rage and seating herself on the open steps of the chaise sobbed hysterically plantagenet stole round on tiptoe and peeped in her face a merry christmas and a happy new year mrs cadurcis said her son  how can i be merry and happy treated as i am sobbed the mother you do not treat lady annabel so oh no it is only your mother whom you use in this manner go to cherbury go by all means but go by yourself i shall not go go to your friends lord cadurcis they are your friends not mine and i hope they are satisfied now that they have robbed me of the affections of my child i have seen what they have been after all this time i am not so blind as some people think no i see how it is i am nobody your poor mother who brought you up and educated you is nobody this is the end of all your latin and french and your fine lessons honour your father and your mother lord cadurcis thats a finer lesson than all oh oh oh  this allusion to the herberts suddenly calmed plantagenet he felt in an instant the injudiciousness of fostering by his conduct the latent jealousy which always lurked at the bottom of his mothers heart and which nothing but the united talent and goodness of lady annabel could have hitherto baffled so he rejoined in a kind yet playful tone if you will be good i will give you a kiss for a christmasbox mother and the parrot shall go inside if you like  the parrot may stay at home i do not care about it but i cannot bear quarrelling it is not my temper you naughty very naughty boy  my dear mother continued his lordship in a soothing tone these scenes always happen when people are going to travel i assure you it is quite a part of packing up  you will be the death of me that you will said the mother with all your violence you are worse than your father that you are  come mother said her son drawing nearer and just touching her shoulder with his hand will you not have my christmasbox  the mother extended her cheek which the son slightly touched with his lip and then mrs cadurcis jumped up as lively as ever called for a glass of mountain and began rating the footboy  at length the postchaise was packed they had a long journey before them because cadurcis would go round by southport to call upon a tradesman whom a month before he had commissioned to get a trinket made for him in london according to the newest fashion as a present for venetia the commission was executed mrs cadurcis who had been consulted in confidence by her son on the subject was charmed with the result of their united taste she had goodnaturedly contributed one of her own few but fine emeralds to the gift upon the back of the brooch was engraved      to venetia from her affectionate brother plantagenet  i hope she will be a sister and more than a sister to you said mrs cadurcis  why inquired her son rather confused  you may look farther and fare worse said mrs cadurcis plantagenet blushed and yet he wondered why he blushed he understood his mother but he could not pursue the conversation his heart fluttered  a most cordial greeting awaited them at cherbury dr masham was there and was to remain until monday mrs cadurcis would have opened about the present immediately but her son warned her on the threshold that if she said a word about it or seemed to be aware of its previous existence even when it was shown he would fling it instantly away into the snow and her horror of this catastrophe bridled her tongue mrs cadurcis however was happy and lady annabel was glad to see her so the doctor too paid her some charming compliments the good lady was in the highest spirits for she was always in extremes and at this moment she would willingly have laid down her life if she had thought the sacrifice could have contributed to the welfare of the herberts  cadurcis himself drew venetia aside and then holding the brooch reversed he said with rather a confused air read that venetia  oh plantagenet she said very much astonished  you see venetia he added leaving it in her hand it is yours  venetia turned the jewel her eye was dazzled with its brilliancy  it is too grand for a little girl plantagenet she exclaimed a little pale  no it is not said plantagenet firmly besides you will not always be a little girl and then if ever we do not live together as we do now you will always remember you have a brother  i must show it mamma i must ask her permission to take it plantagenet  venetia went up to her mother who was talking to mrs cadurcis she had not courage to speak before that lady and dr masham so she called her mother aside  mamma she said something has happened  what my dear said lady annabel somewhat surprised at the seriousness of her tone  look at this mamma said venetia giving her the brooch  lady annabel looked at the jewel and read the inscription it was a more precious offering than the mother would willingly have sanctioned but she was too highly bred and too thoughtful of the feelings of others to hesitate for a moment to admire it herself and authorise its acceptance by her daughter so she walked up to cadurcis and gave him a mothers embrace for his magnificent present to his sister placed the brooch itself near venetias heart and then led her daughter to mrs cadurcis that the gratified mother might admire the testimony of her sons taste and affection it was a most successful present and cadurcis felt grateful to his mother for her share in its production and the very proper manner in which she received the announcement of its offering     chapter x   this was christmas eve the snow was falling briskly after dinner they were glad to cluster round the large fire in the green drawingroom dr masham had promised to read the evening service in the chapel which was now lit up and the bell was sounding that the cottagers might have the opportunity of attending  plantagenet and venetia followed the elders to the chapel they walked handinhand down the long galleries  i should like to go all over this house said plantagenet to his companion have you ever been  never said venetia half of it is shut up nobody ever goes into it except mamma  in the night there was a violent snowstorm not only was the fall extremely heavy but the wind was so high that it carried the snow off the hills and all the roads were blocked up in many places ten or twelve feet deep all communication was stopped this was an adventure that amused the children though the rest looked rather grave plantagenet expressed to venetia his wish that the snow would never melt and that they might remain at cherbury for ever  the children were to have a holiday this week and they had planned some excursions in the park and neighbourhood but now they were all prisoners to the house they wandered about turning the staircase into mountains the great hall into an ocean and the different rooms into so many various regions they amused themselves with their adventures and went on endless voyages of discovery every moment plantagenet longed still more for the opportunity of exploring the uninhabited chambers but venetia shook her head because she was sure lady annabel would not grant them permission  did you ever live at any place before you came to cherbury inquired lord cadurcis of venetia  i know i was not born here said venetia but i was so young that i have no recollection of any other place  and did any one live here before you came said plantagenet  i do not know said venetia i never heard if anybody did i i she continued a little constrained i know nothing  do you remember your papa said plantagenet  no said venetia  then he must have died almost as soon as you were born said lord cadurcis  i suppose he must said venetia and her heart trembled  i wonder if he ever lived here said plantagenet  mamma does not like me to ask questions about my papa said venetia and i cannot tell you anything  ah your papa was different from mine venetia said cadurcis my mother talks of him often enough they did not agree very well and when we quarrel she always says i remind her of him i dare say lady annabel loved your papa very much  i am sure mamma did replied venetia  the children returned to the drawingroom and joined their friends mrs cadurcis was sitting on the sofa occasionally dozing over a sermon dr masham was standing with lady annabel in the recess of a distant window her ladyships countenance was averted she was reading a newspaper which the doctor had given her as the door opened lady annabel glanced round her countenance was agitated she folded up the newspaper rather hastily and gave it to the doctor  and what have you been doing little folks inquired the doctor of the new comers  we have been playing at the history of rome said venetia and now that we have conquered every place we do not know what to do  the usual result of conquest said the doctor smiling  this snowstorm is a great trial for you i begin to believe that after all you would be more pleased to take your holidays at another opportunity  we could amuse ourselves very well said plantagenet if lady annabel would be so kind as to permit us to explore the part of the house that is shut up  that would be a strange mode of diversion said lady annabel quietly and i do not think by any means a suitable one there cannot be much amusement in roaming over a number of dusty unfurnished rooms  and so nicely dressed as you are too said mrs cadurcis rousing herself i wonder how such an idea could enter your head  it snows harder than ever said venetia i think after all i shall learn my french vocabulary  if it snows tomorrow said plantagenet we will do our lessons as usual holidays i find are not so amusing as i supposed  the snow did continue and the next day the children voluntarily suggested that they should resume their usual course of life with their mornings occupied they found their sources of relaxation ample and in the evening they acted plays and lady annabel dressed them up in her shawls and dr masham read shakspeare to them  it was about the fourth day of the visit that plantagenet loitering in the hall with venetia said to her i saw your mamma go into the lockedup rooms last night i do so wish that she would let us go there  last night said venetia when could you have seen her last night  very late the fact is i could not sleep and i took it into my head to walk up and down the gallery i often do so at the abbey i like to walk up and down an old gallery alone at night i do not know why but i like it very much everything is so still and then you hear the owls i cannot make out why it is but nothing gives me more pleasure than to get up when everybody is asleep it seems as if one were the only living person in the world i sometimes think when i am a man i will always get up in the night and go to bed in the daytime is not that odd  but mamma said venetia how came you to see mamma  oh i am certain of it said the boy for to tell you the truth i was rather frightened at first only i thought it would not do for a cadurcis to be afraid so i stood against the wall in the shade and i was determined whatever happened not to cry out  oh you frighten me so plantagenet said venetia  ah you might well have been frightened if you had been there past midnight a tall white figure and a light however there is nothing to be alarmed about it was lady annabel nobody else i saw her as clearly as i see you now she walked along the gallery and went to the very door you showed me the other morning i marked the door i could not mistake it she unlocked it and she went in  and then inquired venetia eagerly  why then like a fool i went back to bed said plantagenet i thought it would seem so silly if i were caught and i might not have had the good fortune to escape twice i know no more  venetia could not reply she heard a laugh and then her mothers voice they were called with a gay summons to see a colossal snowball that some of the younger servants had made and rolled to the window of the terraceroom it was ornamented with a crown of holly and mistletoe and the particoloured berries looked bright in a straggling sunbeam which had fought its way through the stillloaded sky and fell upon the terrace  in the evening as they sat round the fire mrs cadurcis began telling venetia a long rambling ghost story which she declared was a real ghost story and had happened in her own family such communications were not very pleasing to lady annabel but she was too well bred to interrupt her guest when however the narrative was finished and venetia by her observations evidently indicated the effect that it had produced upon her mind her mother took the occasion of impressing upon her the little credibility which should be attached to such legends and the rational process by which many unquestionable apparitions might be accounted for dr masham following this train recounted a story of a ghost which had been generally received in a neighbouring village for a considerable period and attested by the most veracious witnesses but which was explained afterwards by turning out to be an instance of somnambulism venetia appeared to be extremely interested in the subject she inquired much about sleepwalkers and sleepwalking and a great many examples of the habit were cited at length she said mamma did you ever walk in your sleep  not to my knowledge said lady annabel smiling i should hope not  well do you know said plantagenet who had hitherto listened in silence it is very curious but i once dreamt that you did lady annabel  indeed said the lady  yes and i dreamt it last night too continued cadurcis i thought i was sleeping in the uninhabited rooms here and the door opened and you walked in with a light  no plantagenet said venetia who was seated by him and who spoke in a whisper it was not  hush said cadurcis in a low voice  well that was a strange dream said mrs cadurcis was it not doctor  now children i will tell you a very curious story said the doctor and it is quite a true one for it happened to myself  the doctor was soon embarked in his tale and his audience speedily became interested in the narrative but lady annabel for some time maintained complete silence     chapter xi   the spring returned the intimate relations between the two families were each day more confirmed lady annabel had presented her daughter and plantagenet each with a beautiful pony but their rides were at first to be confined to the park and to be ever attended by a groom in time however duly accompanied they were permitted to extend their progress so far as cadurcis mrs cadurcis had consented to the wishes of her son to restore the old garden and venetia was his principal adviser and assistant in the enterprise plantagenet was fond of the abbey and nothing but the agreeable society of cherbury on the one hand and the relief of escaping from his mother on the other could have induced him to pass so little of his time at home but with venetia for his companion his mornings at the abbey passed charmingly and as the days were now at their full length again there was abundance of time after their studies at cherbury to ride together through the woods to cadurcis spend several hours there and for venetia to return to the hall before sunset plantagenet always accompanied her to the limits of the cherbury grounds and then returned by himself solitary and full of fancies  lady annabel had promised the children that they should some day ride together to marringhurst the rectory of dr masham to eat strawberries and cream this was to be a great festival and was looked forward to with corresponding interest her ladyship had kindly offered to accompany mrs cadurcis in the carriage but that lady was an invalid and declined the journey so lady annabel who was herself a good horsewoman mounted her jennet with venetia and plantagenet  marringhurst was only five miles from cherbury by a crossroad which was scarcely passable for carriages the rectory house was a substantial squarebuilt red brick mansion shaded by gigantic elms but the southern front covered with a famous vine trained over it with elaborate care and of which and his espaliers the doctor was very proud the garden was thickly stocked with choice fruittrees there was not the slightest pretence to pleasure grounds but there was a capital bowlinggreen and above all a grotto where the doctor smoked his evening pipe and moralised in the midst of his cucumbers and cabbages on each side extended the meadows of his glebe where his kine ruminated at will it was altogether a scene as devoid of the picturesque as any that could be well imagined flat but not low and rich and green and still  his expected guests met as warm a reception as such a hearty friend might be expected to afford dr masham was scarcely less delighted at the excursion than the children themselves and rejoiced in the sunny day that made everything more glad and bright the garden the grotto the bowlinggreen and all the novelty of the spot greatly diverted his young companions they visited his farmyard were introduced to his poultry rambled over his meadows and admired his cows which he had collected with equal care and knowledge nor was the interior of this bachelors residence devoid of amusement every nook and corner was filled with objects of interest and everything was in admirable order the goddess of neatness and precision reigned supreme especially in his hall which though barely ten feet square was a cabinet of rural curiosities his guns his fishingtackle a cabinet of birds stuffed by himself a fox in a glasscase that seemed absolutely running and an otter with a real fish in its mouth in turn delighted them but chiefly perhaps his chimneycorner of dutch tiles all scriptural subjects which venetia and plantagenet emulated each other in discovering  then his library which was rare and splendid for the doctor was one of the most renowned scholars in the kingdom and his pictures his prints and his gold fish and his canary birds it seemed they never could exhaust such sources of endless amusement to say nothing of every other room in the house for from the garret to the dairy his guests encouraged him in introducing them to every thing every person and every place  and this is the way we old bachelors contrive to pass our lives said the good doctor and now my dear lady goody blount will give us some dinner  the doctors repast was a substantial one he seemed resolved at one ample swoop to repay lady annabel for all her hospitality and he really took such delight in their participation of it that his principal guest was constrained to check herself in more than one warning intimation that moderation was desirable were it only for the sake of the strawberries and cream all this time his housekeeper goody blount as he called her in her lace cap and ruffles as precise and starch as an old picture stood behind his chair with pleased solemnity directing with unruffled composure the movements of the liveried bumpkin who this day was promoted to the honour of waiting at table  come said the doctor as the cloth was cleared i must bargain for one toast lady annabel church and state  what is church and state said venetia  as good things miss venetia as strawberries and cream said the doctor laughing and like them always best united  after their repast the children went into the garden to amuse themselves they strolled about some time until plantagenet at length took it into his head that he should like to learn to play at bowls and he said if venetia would wait in the grotto where they then were talking he would run back and ask the doctor if the servant might teach him he was not long absent but appeared on his return a little agitated venetia inquired if he had been successful but he shook his head and said he had not asked  why did you not said venetia  i did not like he replied looking very serious something happened  what could have happened said venetia  something strange was his answer  oh do tell me plantagenet  why said he in a low voice your mamma is crying  crying exclaimed venetia my dear mamma crying i must go to her directly  hush said plantagenet shaking his head you must not go  i must  no you must not go venetia was his reply i am sure she does not want us to know she is crying  what did she say to you  she did not see me the doctor did and he gave me a nod to go away  i never saw mamma cry said venetia  dont you say anything about it venetia said plantagenet with a manly air listen to what i say  i do plantagenet always but still i should like to know what mamma can be crying about do tell me all about it  why i came to the room by the open windows and your mamma was standing up with her back to me and leaning on the mantelpiece with her face in her handkerchief and the doctor was standing up too only his back was to the fireplace and when he saw me he made me a sign to go away and i went directly  are you sure mamma was crying  i heard her sob  i think i shall cry said venetia  you must not you must know nothing about it if you let your mamma know that i saw her crying i shall never tell you anything again  what do you think she was crying about plantagenet  i cannot say perhaps she had been talking about your papa i do not want to play at bowls now added plantagenet let us go and see the cows  in the course of half an hour the servant summoned the children to the house the horses were ready and they were now to return lady annabel received them with her usual cheerfulness  well dear children said she have you been very much amused  venetia ran forward and embraced her mother with even unusual fondness she was mindful of plantagenets injunctions and was resolved not to revive her mothers grief by any allusion that could recall the past but her heart was nevertheless full of sympathy and she could not have rode home had she not thus expressed her love for her mother  with the exception of this strange incident over which afterwards venetia often pondered and which made her rather serious the whole of the ride home this expedition to marringhurst was a very happy day     chapter xii   this happy summer was succeeded by a singularly wet autumn weeks of continuous rain rendered it difficult even for the little cadurcis who defied the elements to be so constant as heretofore in his daily visits to cherbury his mother too grew daily a greater invalid and with increasing sufferings and infirmities the natural captiousness of her temper proportionally exhibited itself she insisted upon the companionship of her son and that he should not leave the house in such unseasonable weather if he resisted she fell into one of her jealous rages and taunted him with loving strangers better than his own mother cadurcis on the whole behaved very well he thought of lady annabels injunctions and restrained his passion yet he was not repaid for the sacrifice his mother made no effort to render their joint society agreeable or even endurable she was rarely in an amiable mood and generally either irritable or sullen if the weather held up a little and he ventured to pay a visit to cherbury he was sure to be welcomed back with a fit of passion either mrs cadurcis was angered for being left alone or had fermented herself into fury by the certainty of his catching a fever if plantagenet remained at the abbey she was generally sullen and as he himself was naturally silent under any circumstances his mother would indulge in that charming monologue so conducive to domestic serenity termed talking at a person and was continually insinuating that she supposed he found it very dull to pass his day with her and that she dared say that somebody could be lively enough if he were somewhere else  cadurcis would turn pale and bite his lip and then leave the room and whole days would sometimes pass with barely a monosyllable being exchanged between this parent and child cadurcis had found some opportunities of pouring forth his griefs and mortification into the ear of venetia and they had reached her mother but lady annabel though she sympathised with this interesting boy invariably counselled duty the morning studies were abandoned but a quantity of books were sent over from cherbury for plantagenet and lady annabel seized every opportunity of conciliating mrs cadurcis temper in favour of her child by the attention which she paid the mother the weather however prevented either herself or venetia from visiting the abbey and on the whole the communications between the two establishments and their inmates had become rare  though now a continual inmate of the abbey cadurcis was seldom the companion of his mother they met at their meals and that was all he entered the room every day with an intention of conciliating but the mutual tempers of the mother and the son were so quick and sensitive that he always failed in his purpose and could only avoid a storm by dogged silence this enraged mrs cadurcis more even than his impertinence she had no conduct she lost all command over herself and did not hesitate to address to her child terms of reproach and abuse which a vulgar mind could only conceive and a coarse tongue alone express what a contrast to cherbury to the mild maternal elegance and provident kindness of lady annabel and the sweet tones of venetias eversympathising voice cadurcis though so young was gifted with an innate fastidiousness that made him shrink from a rude woman his feelings were different in regard to men he sympathised at a very early age with the bold and the energetic his favourites among the peasantry were ever those who excelled in athletic sports and though he never expressed the opinion he did not look upon the poacher with the evil eye of his class but a coarse and violent woman jarred even his young nerves and this woman was his mother his only parent almost his only relation for he had no near relative except a cousin whom he had never even seen the penniless orphan of a penniless brother of his father and who had been sent to sea so that after all his mother was the only natural friend he had this poor little boy would fly from that mother with a sullen brow or perhaps even with a harsh and cutting repartee and then he would lock himself up in his room and weep but he allowed no witnesses of this weakness the lad was very proud if any of the household passed by as he quitted the saloon and stared for a moment at his pale and agitated face he would coin a smile for the instant and say even a kind word for he was very courteous to his inferiors and all the servants loved him and then take refuge in his solitary woe  relieved by this indulgence of his mortified heart cadurcis looked about him for resources the rain was pouring in torrents and the plash of the troubled and swollen lake might be heard even at the abbey at night the rising gusts of wind for the nights were always clear and stormy echoed down the cloisters with a wild moan to which he loved to listen in the morning he beheld with interest the savage spoils of the tempest mighty branches of trees strewn about and sometimes a vast trunk uprooted from its ancient settlement irresistibly the conviction impressed itself upon his mind that if he were alone in this old abbey with no mother to break that strange fountain of fancies that seemed always to bubble up in his solitude he might be happy he wanted no companions he loved to be alone to listen to the winds and gaze upon the trees and waters and wander in those dim cloisters and that gloomy gallery  from the first hour of his arrival he had loved the venerable hall of his fathers its appearance harmonised with all the associations of his race power and pomp ancestral fame the legendary respect of ages all that was great exciting and heroic all that was marked out from the commonplace current of human events hovered round him in the halls of cadurcis he was the cadurcis though a child he was keenly sensible of his high race his whole being sympathised with their glory he was capable of dying sooner than of disgracing them and then came the memory of his mothers sharp voice and harsh vulgar words and he shivered with disgust  forced into solitude forced to feed upon his own mind cadurcis found in that solitude each day a dearer charm and in that mind a richer treasure of interest and curiosity he loved to wander about dream of the past and conjure up a future as glorious what was he to be what should be his career whither should he wend his course even at this early age dreams of far lands flitted over his mind and schemes of fantastic and adventurous life but now he was a boy a wretched boy controlled by a vulgar and narrowminded woman and this servitude must last for years yes years must elapse before he was his own master oh if he could only pass them alone without a human voice to disturb his musings a single form to distract his vision  under the influence of such feelings even cherbury figured to his fancy in somewhat faded colours there indeed he was loved and cherished there indeed no sound was ever heard no sight ever seen that could annoy or mortify the high pitch of his unconscious ideal but still even at cherbury he was a child under the influence of daily intercourse his tender heart had balanced perhaps even outweighed his fiery imagination that constant yet delicate affection had softened all his soul he had no time but to be grateful and to love he returned home only to muse over their sweet society and contrast their refined and gentle life with the harsh rude hearth that awaited him whatever might be his reception at home he was thrown back for solace on their memory not upon his own heart and he felt the delightful conviction that tomorrow would renew the spell whose enchantment had enabled him to endure the present vexation but now the magic of that intercourse had ceased after a few days of restlessness and repining he discovered that he must find in his desolation sterner sources of support than the memory of venetia and the recollections of the domestic joys of cherbury it astonishing with what rapidity the character of cadurcis developed itself in solitude and strange was the contrast between the gentle child who a few weeks before had looked forward with so much interest to accompanying venetia to a childish festival and the stern and moody being who paced the solitary cloisters of cadurcis and then would withdraw to his lonely chamber and the amusement of a book he was at this time deeply interested in purchass pilgrimage one of the few books of which the late lord had not despoiled him narratives of travels and voyages always particularly pleased him he had an idea that he was laying up information which might be useful to him hereafter the cherbury collection was rich in this class of volumes and lady annabel encouraged their perusal  in this way many weeks elapsed at the abbey during which the visits of plantagenet to cherbury were very few sometimes if the weather cleared for an hour during the morning he would mount his pony and gallop without stopping to the hall the rapidity of the motion excited his mind he fancied himself as he embraced venetia some chieftain who had escaped for a moment from his castle to visit his mistress his imagination conjured up a war between the opposing towers of cadurcis and cherbury and when his mother fell into a passion on his return it passed with him only according to its length and spirit as a brisk skirmish or a general engagement     chapter xiii   one afternoon on his return from cherbury plantagenet found the fire extinguished in the little room which he had appropriated to himself and where he kept his books as he had expressed his wish to the servant that the fire should be kept up he complained to him of the neglect but was informed in reply that the fire had been allowed to go out by his mothers orders and that she desired in future that he would always read in the saloon plantagenet had sufficient selfcontrol to make no observation before the servant and soon after joined his mother who looked very sullen as if she were conscious that she had laid a train for an explosion  dinner was now served a short and silent meal lord cadurcis did not choose to speak because he felt aggrieved and his mother because she was husbanding her energies for the contest which she believed impending at length when the table was cleared and the servant departed cadurcis said in a quiet tone i think i shall write to my guardian tomorrow about my going to eton  you shall do no such thing said mrs cadurcis bristling up i never heard such a ridiculous idea in my life as a boy like you writing letters on such subjects to a person you have never yet seen when i think it proper that you should go to eton i shall write  i wish you would think it proper now then maam  i wont be dictated to said mrs cadurcis fiercely  i was not dictating replied her son calmly  you would if you could said his mother  time enough to find fault with me when i do maam  there is enough to find fault about at all times sir  on which side mrs cadurcis inquired plantagenet with a sneer  dont aggravate me lord cadurcis said his mother  how am i aggravating you maam  i wont be answered said the mother  i prefer silence myself said the son  i wont be insulted in my own room sir said mrs cadurcis  i am not insulting you mrs cadurcis said plantagenet rather fiercely and as for your own room i never wish to enter it indeed i should not be here at this moment had you not ordered my fire to be put out and particularly requested that i should sit in the saloon  oh you are a vastly obedient person i dare say replied mrs cadurcis very pettishly how long i should like to know have my requests received such particular attention pooh  well then i will order my fire to be lighted again said plantagenet  you shall do no such thing said the mother i am mistress in this house no one shall give orders here but me and you may write to your guardian and tell him that if you like  i shall certainly not write to my guardian for the first time said lord cadurcis about any such nonsense  nonsense sir nonsense you said did you your mother nonsense this is the way to treat a parent is it i am nonsense am i i will teach you what nonsense is nonsense shall be very good sense you shall find that sir that you shall nonsense indeed ill write to your guardian that i will you call your mother nonsense do you and where did you learn that i should like to know nonsense indeed this comes of your going to cherbury so your mother is nonsense a pretty lesson for lady annabel to teach you oh ill speak my mind to her that i will  what has lady annabel to do with it inquired cadurcis in a loud tone  dont threaten me sir said mrs cadurcis with violent gesture i wont be menaced i wont be menaced by my son pretty goings on indeed but i will put a stop to them will i not that is all nonsense indeed your mother nonsense  well you do talk nonsense and the greatest said plantagenet doggedly you are talking nonsense now you are always talking nonsense and you never open your mouth about lady annabel without talking nonsense  if i was not very ill i would give it you said his mother grinding her teeth o you brat you wicked brat you is this the way to address me i have half a mind to shake your viciousness out of you that i have  you are worse than your father that you are and here she wept with rage  i dare say my father was not so bad after all said cadurcis  what should you know about your father sir said mrs cadurcis how dare you speak about your father  who should speak about a father but a son  hold your impudence sir  i am not impudent maam  you aggravating brat exclaimed the enraged woman i wish i had something to throw at you  did you throw things at my father asked his lordship  mrs cadurcis went into an hysterical rage then suddenly jumping up she rushed at her son lord cadurcis took up a position behind the table but the sportive and mocking air which he generally instinctively assumed on these occasions and which while it irritated his mother more was in reality affected by the boy from a sort of nervous desire of preventing these dreadful exposures from assuming a too tragic tone did not characterise his countenance on the present occasion on the contrary it was pale but composed and very serious mrs cadurcis after one or two ineffectual attempts to catch him paused and panted for breath he took advantage of this momentary cessation and spoke thus mother i am in no humour for frolics i moved out of your way that you might not strike me because i have made up my mind that if you ever strike me again i will live with you no longer now i have given you warning do what you please i shall sit down in this chair and not move if you strike me you know the consequences so saying his lordship resumed his chair  mrs cadurcis simultaneously sprang forward and boxed his ears and then her son rose without the slightest expression of any kind and slowly quitted the chamber  mrs cadurcis remained alone in a savage sulk hours passed away and her son never made his appearance then she rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell lord cadurcis that tea was ready but the servant returned and reported that his lordship had locked himself up in his room and would not reply to his inquiries determined not to give in mrs cadurcis at length retired for the night rather regretting her violence but still sullen having well scolded her waitingwoman she at length fell asleep  the morning brought breakfast but no lord cadurcis in vain were all the messages of his mother her son would make no reply to them mrs cadurcis at length personally repaired to his room and knocked at the door but she was as unsuccessful as the servants she began to think he would starve and desired the servant to offer from himself to bring his meal still silence indignant at his treatment of these overtures of conciliation mrs cadurcis returned to the saloon confident that hunger if no other impulse would bring her wild cub out of his lair but just before dinner her waitingwoman came running into the room  oh maam maam i dont know where lord cadurcis has gone but i have just seen john and he says there was no pony in the stable this morning  mrs cadurcis sprang up rushed to her sons chamber found the door still locked ordered it to be burst open and then it turned out that his lordship had never been there at all for the bed was unused mrs cadurcis was frightened out of her life the servants to console her assured her that plantagenet must be at cherbury and while she believed their representations which were probable she became not only more composed but resumed her jealousy and sullenness gone to cherbury indeed no doubt of it let him remain at cherbury execrating lady annabel she flung herself into an easy chair and dined alone preparing herself to speak her mind on her sons return  the night however did not bring him and mrs cadurcis began to recur to her alarm much as she now disliked lady annabel she could not resist the conviction that her ladyship would not permit plantagenet to remain at cherbury nevertheless jealous passionate and obstinate she stifled her fears vented her spleen on her unhappy domestics and finally exhausting herself by a storm of passion about some very unimportant subject again sought refuge in sleep  she awoke early in a fright and inquired immediately for her son he had not been seen she ordered the abbey bell to be sounded sent messengers throughout the demesne and directed all the offices to be searched at first she thought he must have returned and slept perhaps in a barn then she adopted the more probable conclusion that he had drowned himself in the lake then she went into hysterics called plantagenet her lost darling declared he was the best and most dutiful of sons and the image of his poor father then abused all the servants and then abused herself  about noon she grew quite distracted and rushed about the house with her hair dishevelled and in a dressinggown looked in all the closets behind the screens under the chairs into her workbox but strange to say with no success then she went off into a swoon and her servants alike frightened about master and mistress mother and son dispatched a messenger immediately to cherbury for intelligence advice and assistance in less than an hours time the messenger returned and informed them that lord cadurcis had not been at cherbury since two days back but that lady annabel was very sorry to hear that their mistress was so ill and would come on to see her immediately in the meantime lady annabel added that she had sent to dr masham and had great hopes that lord cadurcis was at marringhurst mrs cadurcis who had now come to as her waitingwoman described the returning consciousness of her mistress eagerly embraced the hope held out of plantagenet being at marringhurst poured forth a thousand expressions of gratitude admiration and affection for lady annabel who she declared was her best her only friend and the being in the world whom she loved most next to her unhappy and injured child  after another hour of suspense lady annabel arrived and her entrance was the signal for a renewed burst of hysterics from mrs cadurcis so wild and terrible that they must have been contagious to any female of less disciplined emotions than her guest     chapter xiv   towards evening dr masham arrived at cadurcis he could give no intelligence of plantagenet who had not called at marringhurst but he offered and was prepared to undertake his pursuit the good doctor had his saddlebags well stocked and was now on his way to southport that being the nearest town and where he doubted not to gain some tidings of the fugitive mrs cadurcis he found so indisposed that he anticipated the charitable intentions of lady annabel not to quit her and after having bid them place their confidence in providence and his humble exertions he at once departed on his researches  in the meantime let us return to the little lord himself having secured the advantage of a long start by the device of turning the key of his chamber he repaired to the stables and finding no one to observe him saddled his pony and galloped away without plan or purpose an instinctive love of novelty and adventure induced him to direct his course by a road which he had never before pursued and after two or three miles progress through a wild open country of brushwood he found that he had entered that considerable forest which formed the boundary of many of the views from cadurcis the afternoon was clear and still the sun shining in the light blue sky and the wind altogether hushed on each side of the winding road spread the bright green turf occasionally shaded by picturesque groups of doddered oaks the calm beauty of the sylvan scene wonderfully touched the fancy of the youthful fugitive it soothed and gratified him he pulled up his pony patted its lively neck as if in gratitude for its good service and confident that he could not be successfully pursued indulged in a thousand dreams of robin hood and his merry men as for his own position and prospects he gave himself no anxiety about them satisfied with his escape from a revolting thraldom his mind seemed to take a bound from the difficulty of his situation and the wildness of the scene and he felt himself a man and one too whom nothing could daunt or appal  soon the road itself quite disappeared and vanished in a complete turfy track but the continuing marks of cartwheels assured him that it was a thoroughfare although he was now indeed journeying in the heart of a forest of oaks and he doubted not it would lead to some town or village or at any rate to some farmhouse towards sunset he determined to make use of the remaining light and pushed on apace but it soon grew so dark that he found it necessary to resume his walking pace from fear of the overhanging branches and the trunks of felled trees which occasionally crossed his way  notwithstanding the probable prospect of passing his night in the forest our little adventurer did not lose heart cadurcis was an intrepid child and when in the company of those with whom he was not familiar and free from those puerile associations to which those who had known and lived with him long were necessarily subject he would assume a staid and firm demeanour unusual with one of such tender years a light in the distance was now not only a signal that the shelter he desired was at hand but reminded him that it was necessary by his assured port to prove that he was not unused to travel alone and that he was perfectly competent and qualified to be his own master  as he drew nearer the lights multiplied and the moon which now rose over the forest showed to him that the trees retiring on both sides to some little distance left a circular plot of ground on which were not only the lights which had at first attracted his attention but the red flames of a watchfire round which some dark figures had hitherto been clustered the sound of horses feet had disturbed them and the fire was now more and more visible as cadurcis approached he observed some low tents and in a few minutes he was in the centre of an encampment of gipsies he was for a moment somewhat dismayed for he had been brought up with the usual terror of these wild people nevertheless he was not unequal to the occasion he was surrounded in an instant but only with women and children for the gipsymen never immediately appear they smiled with their bright eyes and the flames of the watchfire threw a lurid glow over their dark and flashing countenances they held out their practised hands they uttered unintelligible but not unfriendly sounds the heart of cadurcis faltered but his voice did not betray him  i am cold good people said the undaunted boy will you let me warm myself by your fire  a beautiful girl with significant gestures pressed her hand to her heart then pointed in the direction of the tents and then rushed away soon reappearing with a short thin man inclining to middle age but of a compact and apparently powerful frame lithe supple and sinewy his complexion was dark but clear his eye large liquid and black but his other features small though precisely moulded he wore a green jacket and a pair of black velvet breeches his legs and feet being bare with the exception of slippers round his head was twisted a red handkerchief which perhaps might not have looked like a turban on a countenance less oriental  what would the young master inquired the gipsyman in a voice far from disagreeable and with a gesture of courtesy but at the same time he shot a scrutinising glance first at plantagenet and then at his pony  i would remain with you said cadurcis that is if you will let me  the gipsyman made a sign to the women and plantagenet was lifted by them off his pony before he could be aware of their purpose the children led the pony away and the gipsyman conducted plantagenet to the fire where an old woman sat presiding over the mysteries of an enormous fleshpot immediately his fellows who had originally been clustered around it reappeared fresh blocks and branches were thrown on the flames crackled and rose the men seated themselves around and plantagenet excited by the adventure rubbed his hands before the fire and determined to fear nothing  a savoury steam exuded from the fleshpot  that smells well said plantagenet  tis a dimber covea whispered one of the younger men to a companion  footnote a tis a lively lad  our supper has but rough seasoning for such as you said the man who had first saluted him and who was apparently the leader but the welcome is hearty  the woman and girls now came with wooden bowls and platters and after serving the men seated themselves in an exterior circle the children playing round them  come old mort said the leader in a very different tone to the one in which he addressed his young guest tout the cobblecolter are we to have darkmans upon us and beruna flick the panama  footnote a come old woman took after the turkey are we to wait till night and beruna cut the bread  upon this that beautiful girl who had at first attracted the notice of cadurcis called out in a sweet lively voice ay ay morgana and in a moment handed over the heads of the women a pannier of bread which the leader took and offered its contents to our fugitive cadurcis helped himself with a bold but gracious air the pannier was then passed round and the old woman opening the pot drew out with a huge iron fork a fine turkey which she tossed into a large wooden platter and cut up with great quickness first she helped morgana but only gained a reproof for her pains who immediately yielded his portion to plantagenet each man was provided with his knife but the guest had none morgana immediately gave up his own  beruna he shouted gibel a chiv for the gentry covea  footnote a bring a knife for the gentleman  ay ay morgana said the girl and she brought the knife to plantagenet himself saying at the same time with sparkling eyes yam yam gentry covea  footnote a eat eat gentleman  cadurcis really thought it was the most delightful meal he had ever made in his life the fleshpot held something besides turkeys rough as was the fare it was good and plentiful as for beverage they drank humptydumpty which is ale boiled with brandy and which is not one of the slightest charms of a gipsys life when the men were satisfied their platters were filled and given to the women and children and beruna with her portion came and seated herself by plantagenet looking at him with a blended glance of delight and astonishment like a beautiful young savage and then turning to her female companions to stifle a laugh the fleshpot was carried away the men lit their pipes the fire was replenished its red shadow mingled with the silver beams of the moon around were the glittering tents and the silent woods on all sides flashing eyes and picturesque forms cadurcis glanced at his companions and gazed upon the scene with feelings of ravishing excitement and then almost unconscious of what he was saying exclaimed at length i have found the life that suits me  indeed squire said morgana would you be one of us  from this moment said cadurcis if you will admit me to your band but what can i do and i have nothing to give you you must teach me to earn my right to our supper  well make a turkey merchanta of you yet said an old gipsy never fear that  footnote a ie we will teach you to steal a turkey  bah peter said morgana with an angry look your red rag will never be still and what was the purpose of your present travel he continued to plantagenet  none i was sick of silly home  the gentry cove will be romboyled by his dam said a third gipsy queer cuffin will be the word yet if we dont touta  footnote a his mother will make a hue and cry after the gentleman yet justice of the peace will be the word if we dont look sharp  well you shall see a little more of us before you decide said morgana thoughtfully and turning the conversation beruna  ay ay morgana  tip me the clank like a dimber mort as you are trim a ken for the gentry cove he is no lanspresado or i am a kinchina  footnote a give me the tankard like a pretty girl get a bed ready for the gentleman he is no informer or i am an infant  ay ay morgana gaily exclaimed the girl and she ran off to prepare a bed for the lord of cadurcis     chapter xv   dr masham could gain no tidings of the object of his pursuit at southport here however he ascertained that plantagenet could not have fled to london for in those days public conveyances were rare there was only one coach that ran or rather jogged along this road and it went but once a week it being expected that very night while the innkeeper was confident that so far as southport was concerned his little lordship had not sought refuge in the waggon which was more frequent though somewhat slower in its progress to the metropolis unwilling to return home although the evening was now drawing in the doctor resolved to proceed to a considerable town about twelve miles further which cadurcis might have reached by a cross road so drawing his cloak around him looking to his pistols and desiring his servant to follow his example the stouthearted rector of marringhurst pursued his way  it was dark when the doctor entered the town and he proceeded immediately to the inn where the coach was expected with some faint hope that the fugitive might be discovered abiding within its walls but to all his inquiries about young gentlemen and ponies he received very unsatisfactory answers so reconciling himself as well as he could to the disagreeable posture of affairs he settled himself in the parlour of the inn with a good fire and lighting his pipe desired his servant to keep a sharp lookout  in due time a great uproar in the innyard announced the arrival of the stage an unwieldy machine carrying six inside and dragged by as many horses the doctor opening the door of his apartment which led on to a gallery that ran round the innyard leaned over the balustrade with his pipe in his mouth and watched proceedings it so happened that the stage was to discharge one of its passengers at this town who had come from the north and the doctor recognised in him a neighbour and brother magistrate one squire mountmeadow an important personage in his way the terror of poachers and somewhat of an oracle on the bench as it was said that he could take a deposition without the assistance of his clerk although in spite of the ostlers lanterns it was very dark it was impossible ever to be unaware of the arrival of squire mountmeadow for he was one of those great men who take care to remind the world of their dignity by the attention which they require on every occasion  coachman said the authoritative voice of the squire where is the coachman oh you are there sir are you postilion where is the postilion oh you are there sir are you host where is the host oh you are there sir are you waiter where is the waiter i say where is the waiter  coming please your worship  how long am i to wait oh you are there sir are you coachman  your worship  postilion  yes your worship  host  your worships servant  waiter  your worships honours humble servant  i am going to alight  all four attendants immediately bowed and extended their arms to assist this very great man but squire mountmeadow scarcely deigning to avail himself of their proffered assistance and pausing on each step looking around him with his long lean solemn visage finally reached terra firma in safety and slowly stretched his tall ungainly figure it was at this moment that dr mashams servant approached him and informed his worship that his master was at the inn and would be happy to see him the countenance of the great mountmeadow relaxed at the mention of the name of a brother magistrate and in an audible voice he bade the groom tell my worthy friend his worship your worthy master that i shall be rejoiced to pay my respects to an esteemed neighbour and a brother magistrate  with slow and solemn steps preceded by the host and followed by the waiter squire mountmeadow ascended the staircase of the external gallery pausing occasionally and looking around him with thoughtful importance and making an occasional inquiry as to the state of the town and neighbourhood during his absence in this fashion stop where are you host oh you are there sir are you well mr host and how have we been orderly eh  quite orderly your worship  hoh orderly hem well very well never easy if absent only fourandtwenty hours the law must be obeyed  yes your worship  lead on sir and waiter where are you waiter oh you are there sir are you and so my brother magistrate is here  yes your honours worship  hem what can he want something in the wind wants my advice i dare say shall have it soldiers ruly kings servants must be obeyed  yes your worship quite ruly your worship said the host  as obliging and obstreperous as can be said the waiter  well very well and here the squire had gained the gallery where the doctor was ready to receive him  it always gives me pleasure to meet a brother magistrate said squire mountmeadow bowing with cordial condescension and a gentleman of your cloth too the clergy must be respected i stand or fall by the church after you doctor after you so saying the two magistrates entered the room  an unexpected pleasure doctor said the squire and what brings your worship to town  a somewhat strange business said the doctor and indeed i am not a little glad to have the advantage of your advice and assistance  hem i thought so said the squire your worship is very complimentary what is the case larceny  nay my good sir tis a singular affair and if you please we will order supper first and discuss it afterwards tis for your private ear  oh ho said the squire looking very mysterious and important with your worships permission he added filling a pipe  the host was no laggard in waiting on two such important guests the brother magistrates despatched their rumpsteak the foaming tankard was replenished the fire renovated at length the table and the room being alike clear squire mountmeadow drew a long puff and said now for business doctor  his companion then informed him of the exact object of his visit and narrated to him so much of the preceding incidents as was necessary the squire listened in solemn silence elevating his eyebrows nodding his head trimming his pipe with profound interjections and finally being appealed to for his opinion by the doctor delivered himself of a most portentous hem  i question doctor said the squire whether we should not communicate with the secretary of state tis no ordinary business tis a spiriting away of a peer of the realm it smacks of treason  egad said the doctor suppressing a smile i think we can hardly make a truant boy a cabinet question  the squire glanced a look of pity at his companion prove the truancy doctor prove it tis a case of disappearance and how do we know that there is not a jesuit at the bottom of it  there is something in that said the doctor  there is everything in it said the squire triumphantly we must offer rewards we must raise the posse comitatus  for the sake of the family i would make as little stir as necessary said dr masham  for the sake of the family said the squire think of the nation sir for the sake of the nation we must make as much stir as possible tis a secretary of states business tis a case for a general warrant  he is a wellmeaning lad enough said the doctor  ay and therefore more easily played upon said the squire rome is at the bottom of it brother masham and i am surprised that a good protestant like yourself one of the kings justices of the peace and a doctor of divinity to boot should doubt the fact for an instant  we have not heard much of the jesuits of late years said the doctor  the very reason that they are more active said the squire  an only child said dr masham  a peer of the realm said squire mountmeadow  i should think he must be in the neighbourhood  more likely at st omers  they would scarely take him to the plantations with this war  let us drink confusion to the rebels said the squire any news  howe sails this week said the doctor  may he burn boston said the squire  i would rather he would reduce it without such extremities said dr masham  nothing is to be done without extremities said squire mountmeadow  but this poor child said the doctor leading back the conversation what can we do  the law of the case is clear said the squire we must move a habeas corpus  but shall we be nearer getting him for that inquired the doctor  perhaps not sir but tis the regular way we must proceed by rule  i am sadly distressed said dr masham the worst is he has gained such a start upon us and yet he can hardly have gone to london he would have been recognised here or at southport  with his hair cropped and in a jesuits cap inquired the squire with a slight sneer ah doctor doctor you know not the gentry you have to deal with  we must hope said dr masham tomorrow we must organise some general search  i fear it will be of no use said the squire replenishing his pipe these jesuits are deep fellows  but we are not sure about the jesuits squire  i am said the squire the case is clear and the sooner you break it to his mother the better you asked me for my advice and i give it you     chapter xvi   it was on the following morning as the doctor was under the operation of the barber that his groom ran into the room with a pale face and agitated air and exclaimed  oh master master what do you think here is a man in the yard with my lords pony  stop him peter exclaimed the doctor no watch him watch him send for a constable are you certain tis the pony  i could swear to it out of a thousand said peter  there never mind my beard my good man said the doctor there is no time for appearances here is a robbery at least god grant no worse peter my boots so saying the doctor half equipped and followed by peter and the barber went forth on the gallery where is he said the doctor  he is down below talking to the ostler and trying to sell the pony said peter  there is no time to lose said the doctor follow me like true men and the doctor ran downstairs in his silk nightcap for his wig was not yet prepared  there he is said peter and true enough there was a man in a smockfrock and mounted on the very pony which lady annabel had presented to plantagenet  seize this man in the kings name said the doctor hastily advancing to him ostler do your duty peter be firm i charge you all i am a justice of the peace i charge you arrest this man  the man seemed very much astonished but he was composed and offered no resistance he was dressed like a small farmer in topboots and a smockfrock his hat was rather jauntily placed on his curly red hair  why am i seized at length said the man  where did you get that pony said the doctor  i bought it was the reply  of whom  a stranger at market  you are accused of robbery and suspected of murder said dr masham mr constable said the doctor turning to that functionary who had now arrived handcuff this man and keep him in strict custody until further orders  the report that a man was arrested for robbery and suspected of murder at the red dragon spread like wildfire through the town and the innyard was soon crowded with the curious and excited inhabitants  peter and the barber to whom he had communicated everything were well qualified to do justice to the important information of which they were the sole depositaries the tale lost nothing by their telling and a circumstantial narrative of the robbery and murder of no less a personage than lord cadurcis of cadurcis abbey was soon generally prevalent  the stranger was secured in a stable before which the constable kept guard mine host and the waiter and the ostlers acted as a sort of supernumerary police to repress the multitude while peter held the real pony by the bridle whose identity which he frequently attested was considered by all present as an incontrovertible evidence of the commission of the crime  in the meantime dr masham really agitated roused his brother magistrate and communicated to his worship the important discovery the squire fell into a solemn flutter we must be regular brother masham we must proceed by rule we are a bench in ourselves would that my clerk were here we must send for signsealer forthwith i will not decide without the statutes the law must be consulted and it must be obeyed the fellow hath not brought my wig tis a case of murder no doubt a peer of the realm murdered you must break the intelligence to his surviving parent and i will communicate to the secretary of state can the body be found that will prove the murder unless the body be found the murder will not be proved save the villain confess which he will not do unless he hath sudden compunctions i have known sudden compunctions go a great way we had a case before our bench last month there was no evidence it was not a case of murder it was of woodcutting there was no evidence but the defendant had compunctions oh here is my wig we must send for signsealer he is clerk to our bench and he must bring the statutes tis not simple murder this it involves petty treason  by this time his worship had completed his toilet and he and his colleague took their way to the parlour they had inhabited the preceding evening mr signsealer was in attendance much to the real though concealed satisfaction of squire mountmeadow their worships were seated like two consuls before the table which mr signsealer had duly arranged with writing materials and various piles of calfbound volumes squire mountmeadow then arranging his countenance announced that the bench was prepared and mine host was instructed forthwith to summon the constable and his charge together with peter and the ostler as witnesses there was a rush among some of the crowd who were nighest the scene to follow the prisoner into the room and sooth to say the great mountmeadow was much too enamoured of his own selfimportance to be by any means a patron of close courts and private hearings but then though he loved his power to be witnessed he was equally desirous that his person should be reverenced it was his boast that he could keep a court of quarter sessions as quiet as a church and now when the crowd rushed in with all those sounds of tumult incidental to such a movement it required only mountmeadow slowly to rise and drawing himself up to the full height of his gaunt figure to knit his severe brow and throw one of his peculiar looks around the chamber to insure a most awful stillness instantly everything was so hushed that you might have heard signsealer nib his pen  the witnesses were sworn peter proved that the pony belonged to lord cadurcis and that his lordship had been missing from home for several days and was believed to have quitted the abbey on this identical pony dr masham was ready if necessary to confirm this evidence the accused adhered to his first account that he had purchased the animal the day before at a neighbouring fair and doggedly declined to answer any crossexamination squire mountmeadow looked alike pompous and puzzled whispered to the doctor and then shook his head at mr signsealer  i doubt whether there be satisfactory evidence of the murder brother masham said the squire what shall be our next step  there is enough evidence to keep this fellow in custody said the doctor we must remand him and make inquiries at the market town i shall proceed there immediately he is a strangelooking fellow added the doctor were it not for his carroty locks i should scarcely take him for a native  hem said the squire i have my suspicions fellow continued his worship in an awful tone you say that you are a stranger and that your name is morgan very suspicious all this you have no one to speak to your character or station and you are found in possession of stolen goods the bench will remand you for the present and will at any rate commit you for trial for the robbery but here is a peer of the realm missing fellow and you are most grievously suspected of being concerned in his spiriting away or even murder you are upon tender ground prisoner tis a case verging on petty treason if not petty treason itself eh mr signsealer thus runs the law as i take it prisoner it would be well for you to consider your situation have you no compunctions compunctions might save you if not a principal offender it is your duty to assist the bench in executing justice the crown is merciful you may be kings evidence  mr signsealer whispered the bench he proposed that the prisoners hat should be examined as the name of its maker might afford a clue to his residence  true true mr clerk said squire mountmeadow i am coming to that tis a sound practice i have known such a circumstance lead to great disclosures but we must proceed in order order is everything constable take the prisoners hat off  the constable took the hat off somewhat rudely so rudely indeed that the carroty locks came off in company with it and revealed a profusion of long plaited hair which had been adroitly twisted under the wig more in character with the countenance than its previous covering  a jesuit after all exclaimed the squire  a gipsy as it seems to me whispered the doctor  still worse said the squire  silence in the court exclaimed the awful voice of squire mountmeadow for the excitement of the audience was considerable the disguise was generally esteemed as incontestable evidence of the murder silence or i will order the court to be cleared constable proclaim silence this is an awful business added the squire with a very long face brother masham we must do our duty but this is an awful business at any rate we must try to discover the body a peer of the realm must not be suffered to lie murdered in a ditch he must have christian burial if possible in the vaults of his ancestors  when morgana for it was indeed he observed the course affairs were taking and ascertained that his detention under present circumstances was inevitable he relaxed from his doggedness and expressed a willingness to make a communication to the bench squire mountmeadow lifted up his eyes to heaven as if entreating the interposition of providence to guide him in his course then turned to his brother magistrate and then nodded to the clerk  he has compunctions brother masham said his worship i told you so he has compunctions trust me to deal with these fellows he knew not his perilous situation the hint of petty treason staggered him mr clerk take down the prisoners confession the court must be cleared constable clear the court let a stout man stand on each side of the prisoner to protect the bench the magistracy of england will never shrink from doing their duty but they must be protected now prisoner the bench is ready to hear your confession conceal nothing and if you were not a principal in the murder or an accessory before the fact eh mr clerk thus runs the law as i take it there may be mercy at any rate if you be hanged you will have the satisfaction of having cheerfully made the only atonement to society in your power  hanging be damned said morgana  squire mountmeadow started from his seat his cheeks distended with rage his dull eyes for once flashing fire did you ever witness such atrocity brother masham exclaimed his worship did you hear the villain ill teach him to respect the bench ill fine him before he is executed that i will  the young gentleman to whom this pony belongs continued the gipsy may or may not be a lord i never asked him his name and he never told it me but he sought hospitality of me and my people and we gave it him and he lives with us of his own free choice the pony is of no use to him now and so i came to sell it for our common good  a peer of the realm turned gipsy exclaimed the squire a very likely tale ill teach you to come here and tell your cockandbull stories to two of his majestys justices of the peace tis a flat case of robbery and murder and i venture to say something else you shall go to gaol directly and the lord have mercy on your soul  nay said the gipsy appealing to dr marsham you sir appear to be a friend of this youth you will not regain him by sending me to gaol load me if you will with irons surround me with armed men but at least give me the opportunity of proving the truth of what i say i offer in two hours to produce to you the youth and you shall find he is living with my people in content and peace  content and fiddlestick said the squire in a rage  brother mountmeadow said the doctor in a low tone to his colleague i have private duties to perform to this family pardon me if with all deference to your sounder judgment and greater experience i myself accept the prisoners offer  brother masham you are one of his majestys justices of the peace you are a brother magistrate and you are a doctor of divinity you owe a duty to your country and you owe a duty to yourself is it wise is it decorous that one of the quorum should go agipsying is it possible that you can credit this preposterous tale brother masham there will be a rescue or my name is not mountmeadow  in spite however of all these solemn warnings the good doctor who was not altogether unaware of the character of his pupil and could comprehend that it was very possible the statement of the gipsy might be genuine continued without very much offending his colleague who looked upon his conduct indeed rather with pity than resentment to accept the offer of morgana and consequently wellsecured and guarded and preceding the doctor who rode behind the cart with his servant the gipsy soon sallied forth from the innyard and requested the driver to guide his course in the direction of the forest     chapter xvii   it was the afternoon of the third day after the arrival of cadurcis at the gipsy encampment and nothing had yet occurred to make him repent his flight from the abbey and the choice of life he had made he had experienced nothing but kindness and hospitality while the beautiful beruna seemed quite content to pass her life in studying his amusement the weather too had been extremely favourable to his new mode of existence and stretched at his length upon the rich turf with his head on berunas lap and his eyes fixed upon the rich forest foliage glowing in the autumnal sunset plantagenet only wondered that he could have endured for so many years the shackles of his commonplace home  his companions were awaiting the return of their leader morgana who had been absent since the preceding day and who had departed on plantagenets pony most of them were lounging or strolling in the vicinity of their tents the children were playing the old woman was cooking at the fire and altogether save that the hour was not so late the scene presented much the same aspect as when cadurcis had first beheld it as for his present occupation beruna was giving him a lesson in the gipsy language which he was acquiring with a rapid facility which quite exceeded all his previous efforts in such acquisitions  suddenly a scout sang out that a party was in sight the men instantly disappeared the women were on the alert and one ran forward as a spy on pretence of telling fortunes this brighteyed professor of palmistry soon however returned running and out of breath yet chatting all the time with inconceivable rapidity and accompanying the startling communication she was evidently making with the most animated gestures beruna started up and leaving the astonished cadurcis joined them she seemed alarmed cadurcis was soon convinced there was consternation in the camp  suddenly a horseman galloped up and was immediately followed by a companion they called out as if encouraging followers and one of them immediately galloped away again as if to detail the results of their reconnaissance before cadurcis could well rise and make inquiries as to what was going on a light cart containing several men drove up and in it a prisoner he detected morgana the branches of the trees concealed for a moment two other horsemen who followed the cart but cadurcis to his infinite alarm and mortification soon recognised dr masham and peter  when the gipsies found their leader was captive they no longer attempted to conceal themselves they all came forward and would have clustered round the cart had not the riders as well as those who more immediately guarded the prisoner prevented them morgana spoke some words in a loud voice to the gipsies and they immediately appeared less agitated then turning to dr masham he said in english behold your child  instantly two gipsy men seized cadurcis and led him to the doctor  how now my lord said the worthy rector in a stern voice is this your duty to your mother and your friends  cadurcis looked down but rather dogged than ashamed  you have brought an innocent man into great peril continued the doctor this person no longer a prisoner has been arrested on suspicion of robbery and even murder through your freak morgana or whatever your name may be here is some reward for your treatment of this child and some compensation for your detention mount your pony lord cadurcis and return to your home with me  this is my home sir said plantagenet  lord cadurcis this childish nonsense must cease it has already endangered the life of your mother nor can i answer for her safety if you lose a moment in returning  child you must return said morgana  child said plantagenet and he walked some steps away and leant against a tree you promised that i should remain said he addressing himself reproachfully to morgana  you are not your own master said the gipsy your remaining here will only endanger and disturb us fortunately we have nothing to fear from laws we have never outraged but had there been a judge less wise and gentle than the master here our peaceful family might have been all harassed and hunted to the very death  he waved his hand and addressed some words to his tribe whereupon two brawny fellows seized cadurcis and placed him again in spite of his struggling upon his pony with the same irresistible facility with which they had a few nights before dismounted him the little lord looked very sulky but his position was beginning to get ludicrous morgana pocketing his five guineas leaped over the side of the cart and offered to guide the doctor and his attendants through the forest they moved on accordingly it was the work of an instant and cadurcis suddenly found himself returning home between the rector and peter not a word however escaped his lips once only he moved the light branch of a tree aimed with delicate precision touched his back he looked round it was beruna she kissed her hand to him and a tear stole down his pale sullen cheek as taking from his breast his handkerchief he threw it behind him unperceived that she might pick it up and keep it for his sake  after proceeding two or three miles under the guidance of morgana the equestrians gained the road though it still ran through the forest here the doctor dismissed the gipsyman with whom he had occasionally conversed during their progress but not a sound ever escaped from the mouth of cadurcis or rather the captive who was now substituted in morganas stead the doctor now addressing himself to plantagenet informed him that it was of importance that they should make the best of their way and so he put spurs to his mare and cadurcis sullenly complied with the intimation at this rate in the course of little more than another hour they arrived in sight of the demesne of cadurcis where they pulled up their steeds  they entered the park they approached the portal of the abbey at length they dismounted their coming was announced by a servant who had recognised his lord at a distance and had ran on before with the tidings when they entered the abbey they were met by lady annabel in the cloisters her countenance was very serious she shook hands with dr masham but did not speak and immediately led him aside cadurcis remained standing in the very spot where doctor masham left him as if he were quite a stranger in the place and was no longer master of his own conduct suddenly doctor masham who was at the end of the cloister while lady annabel was mounting the staircase looked round with a pale face and said in an agitated voice lord cadurcis lady annabel wishes to speak to you in the saloon  cadurcis immediately but slowly repaired to the saloon lady annabel was walking up and down in it she seemed greatly disturbed when she saw him she put her arm round his neck affectionately and said in a low voice my dearest plantagenet it has devolved upon me to communicate to you some distressing intelligence her voice faltered and the tears stole down her cheek  my mother then is dangerously ill he inquired in a calm but softened tone  it is even sadder news than that dear child  cadurcis looked about him wildly and then with an inquiring glance at lady annabel  there can be but one thing worse than that he at length said  what if it have happened said lady annabel  he threw himself into a chair and covered his face with his hands after a few minutes he looked up and said in a low but distinct voice it is too terrible to think of it is too terrible to mention but if it have happened let me be alone  lady annabel approached him with a light step she embraced him and whispering that she should be found in the next room she quitted the apartment  cadurcis remained seated for more than half an hour without changing in the slightest degree his position the twilight died away it grew quite dark he looked up with a slight shiver and then quitted the apartment  in the adjoining room lady annabel was seated with doctor masham and giving him the details of the fatal event it had occurred that morning mrs cadurcis who had never slept a wink since her knowledge of her sons undoubted departure and scarcely for an hour been free from violent epileptic fits had fallen early in the morning into a doze which lasted about half an hour and from which her medical attendant who with pauncefort had sat up with her during the night augured the most favourable consequences about halfpast six oclock she woke and inquired whether plantagenet had returned they answered her that doctor masham had not yet arrived but would probably be at the abbey in the course of the morning she said it would be too late they endeavoured to encourage her but she asked to see lady annabel who was immediately called and lost no time in repairing to her when mrs cadurcis recognised her she held out her hand and said in a dying tone it was my fault it was ever my fault it is too late now let him find a mother in you she never spoke again and in the course of an hour expired  while lady annabel and the doctor were dwelling on these sad circumstances and debating whether he should venture to approach plantagenet and attempt to console him for the evening was now far advanced and nearly three hours had elapsed since the fatal communication had been made to him it happened that mistress pauncefort chanced to pass mrs cadurcis room and as she did so she heard some one violently sobbing she listened and hearing the sounds frequently repeated she entered the room which but for her candle would have been quite dark and there she found lord cadurcis kneeling and weeping by his mothers bedside he seemed annoyed at being seen and disturbed but his spirit was too broken to murmur la my lord said mistress pauncefort you must not take on so you must not indeed i am sure this dark room is enough to put any one in low spirits now do go downstairs and sit with my lady and the doctor and try to be cheerful that is a dear good young gentleman i wish miss venetia were here and then she would amuse you but you must not take on because there is no use in it you must exert yourself for what is done cannot be undone and as the doctor told us last sunday we must all die and well for those who die with a good conscience and i am sure the poor dear lady that is gone must have had a good conscience because she had a good heart and i never heard any one say the contrary now do exert yourself my dear lord and try to be cheerful do for there is nothing like a little exertion in these cases for gods will must be done and it is not for us to say yea or nay and taking on is a murmuring against gods providence and so mistress pauncefort would have continued urging the usual topics of coarse and commonplace consolation but cadurcis only answered with a sigh that came from the bottom of his heart and said with streaming eyes ah mrs pauncefort god had only given me one friend in this world and there she lies     chapter xviii   the first conviction that there is death in the house is perhaps the most awful moment of youth when we are young we think that not only ourselves but that all about us are immortal until the arrow has struck a victim round our own hearth death is merely an unmeaning word until then its casual mention has stamped no idea upon our brain there are few even among those least susceptible of thought and emotion in whose hearts and minds the first death in the family does not act as a powerful revelation of the mysteries of life and of their own being there are few who after such a catastrophe do not look upon the world and the worlds ways at least for a time with changed and tempered feelings it recalls the past it makes us ponder over the future and youth gay and lighthearted youth is taught for the first time to regret and to fear  on cadurcis a child of pensive temperament and in whose strange and yet undeveloped character there was amid lighter elements a constitutional principle of melancholy the sudden decease of his mother produced a profound effect all was forgotten of his parent except the intimate and natural tie and her warm and genuine affection he was now alone in the world for reflection impressed upon him at this moment what the course of existence too generally teaches to us all that mournful truth that after all we have no friends that we can depend upon in this life but our parents all other intimacies however ardent are liable to cool all other confidence however unlimited to be violated in the phantasmagoria of life the friend with whom we have cultivated mutual trust for years is often suddenly or gradually estranged from us or becomes from painful yet irresistible circumstances even our deadliest foe as for women as for the mistresses of our hearts who has not learnt that the links of passion are fragile as they are glittering and that the bosom on which we have reposed with idolatry all our secret sorrows and sanguine hopes eventually becomes the very heart that exults in our misery and baffles our welfare where is the enamoured face that smiled upon our early love and was to shed tears over our grave where are the choice companions of our youth with whom we were to breast the difficulties and share the triumphs of existence even in this inconstant world what changes like the heart love is a dream and friendship a delusion no wonder we grow callous for how few have the opportunity of returning to the hearth which they quitted in levity or thoughtless weariness yet which alone is faithful to them whose sweet affections require not the stimulus of prosperity or fame the lure of accomplishments or the tribute of flattery but which are constant to us in distress and console us even in disgrace  before she retired for the night lady annabel was anxious to see plantagenet mistress pauncefort had informed her of his visit to his mothers room lady annabel found cadurcis in the gallery now partially lighted by the moon which had recently risen she entered with her light as if she were on her way to her own room and not seeking him  dear plantagenet she said will you not go to bed  i do not intend to go to bed tonight he replied  she approached him and took him by the hand which he did not withdraw from her and they walked together once or twice up and down the gallery  i think dear child said lady annabel you had better come and sit with us  i like to be alone was his answer but not in a sullen voice low and faltering  but in sorrow we should be with our friends said lady annabel  i have no friends he answered i only had one  i am your friend dear child i am your mother now and you shall find me one if you like and venetia have you forgotten your sister is she not your friend and dr masham surely you cannot doubt his friendship  cadurcis tried to stifle a sob ay lady annabel he said you are my friend now and so are you all and you know i love you much but you were not my friends two years ago and things will change again they will indeed a mother is your friend as long as she lives she cannot help being your friend  you shall come to cherbury and live with us said lady annabel you know you love cherbury and you shall find it a home a real home  he pressed her hand to his lips the hand was covered with his tears  we will go to cherbury tomorrow dear plantagenet remaining here will only make you sad  i will never leave cadurcis again while my mother is in this house he said in a firm and serious voice and then after a moments pause he added i wish to know when the burial is to take place  we will ask dr masham replied lady annabel come let us go to him come my own child  he permitted himself to be led away they descended to the small apartment where lady annabel had been previously sitting they found the doctor there he rose and pressed plantagenets hand with great emotion they made room for him at the fire between them he sat in silence with his gaze intently fixed upon the decaying embers yet did not quit his hold of lady annabels hand he found it a consolation to him it linked him to a being who seemed to love him as long as he held her hand he did not seem quite alone in the world  now nobody spoke for lady annabel felt that cadurcis was in some degree solaced and she thought it unwise to interrupt the more composed train of his thoughts it was indeed plantagenet himself who first broke silence  i do not think i can go to bed lady annabel he said the thought of this night is terrible to me i do not think it ever can end i would much sooner sit up in this room  nay my child sleep is a great consoler try to go to bed love  i should like to sleep in my mothers room was his strange reply it seems to me that i could sleep there and if i woke in the night i should like to see her  lady annabel and the doctor exchanged looks  i think said the doctor you had better sleep in my room and then if you wake in the night you will have some one to speak to you will find that a comfort  yes that you will said lady annabel i will go and have the sofa bed made up in the doctors room for you indeed that will be the very best plan  so at last but not without a struggle they persuaded cadurcis to retire lady annabel embraced him tenderly when she bade him good night and indeed he felt consoled by her affection  as nothing could persuade plantagenet to leave the abbey until his mother was buried lady annabel resolved to take up her abode there and she sent the next morning for venetia there were a great many arrangements to make about the burial and the mourning and lady annabel and dr masham were obliged in consequence to go the next morning to southport but they delayed their departure until the arrival of venetia that cadurcis might not be left alone  the meeting between himself and venetia was a very sad one and yet her companionship was a great solace venetia urged every topic that she fancied could reassure his spirits and upon the happy home he would find at cherbury  ah said cadurcis they will not leave me here i am sure of that i think our happy days are over venetia  what mourner has not felt the magic of time before the funeral could take place cadurcis had recovered somewhat of his usual cheerfulness and would indulge with venetia in plans of their future life and living as they all were under the same roof sharing the same sorrows participating in the same cares and all about to wear the same mournful emblems of their domestic calamity it was difficult for him to believe that he was indeed that desolate being he had at first correctly estimated himself here were true friends if such could exist here were fine sympathies pure affections innocent and disinterested hearts every domestic tie yet remained perfect except the spellbound tie of blood that wanting all was a bright and happy vision that might vanish in an instant and for ever that perfect even the least graceful the most repulsive home had its irresistible charms and its loss when once experienced might be mourned for ever and could never be restored     chapter xix   after the funeral of mrs cadurcis the family returned to cherbury with plantagenet who was hereafter to consider it his home all that the most tender solicitude could devise to reconcile him to the change in his life was fulfilled by lady annabel and her daughter and under their benignant influence he soon regained his usual demeanour his days were now spent as in the earlier period of their acquaintance with the exception of those painful returns to home which had once been a source to him of so much gloom and unhappiness he pursued his studies as of old and shared the amusements of venetia his allotted room was ornamented by her drawings and in the evenings they read aloud by turns to lady annabel the volume which she selected the abbey he never visited again after his mothers funeral  some weeks had passed in this quiet and contented manner when one day doctor masham who since the death of his mother had been in correspondence with his guardian received a letter from that nobleman to announce that he had made arrangements for sending his ward to eton and to request that he would accordingly instantly proceed to the metropolis this announcement occasioned both cadurcis and venetia poignant affliction the idea of separation was to both of them most painful and although lady annabel herself was in some degree prepared for an arrangement which sooner or later she considered inevitable she was herself scarcely less distressed the good doctor in some degree to break the bitterness of parting proposed accompanying plantagenet to london and himself personally delivering the charge in whose welfare they were so much interested to his guardian nevertheless it was a very sad affair and the week which was to intervene before his departure found both himself and venetia often in tears they no longer took any delight in their mutual studies but passed the day walking about and visiting old haunts and endeavouring to console each other for what they both deemed a great calamity and which was indeed the only serious misfortune venetia had herself experienced in the whole course of her serene career  but if i were really your brother said plantagenet i must have quitted you the same venetia boys always go to school and then we shall be so happy when i return  oh but we are so happy now plantagenet i cannot believe that we are going to part and are you sure that you will return perhaps your guardian will not let you and will wish you to spend your holidays at his house his house will be your home now  it was impossible for a moment to forget the sorrow that was impending over them there were so many preparations to be made for his departure that every instant something occurred to remind them of their sorrow venetia sat with tears in her eyes marking his new pockethandkerchiefs which they had all gone to southport to purchase for plantagenet asked as a particular favour that no one should mark them but venetia then lady annabel gave plantagenet a writingcase and venetia filled it with pens and paper that he might never want means to communicate with them and her evenings were passed in working him a purse which lady annabel took care should be well stocked all day long there seemed something going on to remind them of what was about to happen and as for pauncefort she flounced in and out the room fifty times a day with what is to be done about my lords shirts my lady i think his lordship had better have another dozen your laship better too much than too little i always say or o my lady your laship cannot form an idea of what a state my lords stockings are in my lady i think i had better go over to southport with john my lady and buy him some or please my lady did i understand your laship spoke to the tailor on thursday about my lords things i suppose your laship knows my lord has got no greatcoat  every one of these inquiries made venetias heart tremble then there was the sad habit of dating every coming day by its distance from the fatal one there was the last day but four and the last day but three and the last day but two the last day but one at length arrived and at length too though it seemed incredible the last day itself  plantagenet and venetia both rose very early that they might make it as long as possible they sighed involuntarily when they met and then they went about to pay last visits to every creature and object of which they had been so long fond plantagenet went to bid farewell to the horses and adieu to the cows and then walked down to the woodmans cottage and then to shake hands with the keeper he would not say goodbye to the household until the very last moment and as for marmion the bloodhound he accompanied both of them so faithfully in this melancholy ramble and kept so close to both that it was useless to break the sad intelligence to him yet  i think now venetia we have been to see everything said plantagenet i shall see the peacocks at breakfast time i wish eton was near cherbury and then i could come home on sunday i cannot bear going to cadurcis again but i should like you to go once a week and try to keep up our garden and look after everything though there is not much that will not take care of itself except the garden we made that together and i could not bear its being neglected  venetia could not assure him that no wish of his should be neglected because she was weeping  i am glad the doctor he continued is going to take me to town i should be very wretched by myself but he will put me in mind of cherbury and we can talk together of lady annabel and you hark the bell rings we must go to breakfast the last breakfast but one  lady annabel endeavoured by unusual good spirits to cheer up her little friends she spoke of plantagenets speedy return so much as a matter of course and the pleasant things they were to do when he came back that she really succeeded in exciting a smile in venetias april face for she was smiling amid tears  although it was the last day time hung heavily on their hands after breakfast they went over the house together and cadurcis half with genuine feeling and half in a spirit of mockery of their sorrow made a speech to the inanimate walls as if they were aware of his intended departure at length in their progress they passed the door of the closed apartments and here holding venetias hand he stopped and with an expression of irresistible humour making a low bow to them he said very gravely and goodbye rooms that i have never entered perhaps before i come back venetia will find out what is locked up in you  dr masham arrived for dinner and in a postchaise the unusual conveyance reminded them of the morrow very keenly venetia could not bear to see the doctors portmanteau taken out and carried into the hall she had hopes until then that something would happen and prevent all this misery cadurcis whispered her i say venetia do not you wish this was winter  why plantagenet  because then we might have a good snowstorm and be blocked up again for a week  venetia looked at the sky but not a cloud was to be seen  the doctor was glad to warm himself at the hallfire for it was a fresh autumnal afternoon  are you cold sir said venetia approaching him  i am my little maiden said the doctor  do you think there is any chance of its snowing doctor masham  snowing my little maiden what can you be thinking of  the dinner was rather gayer than might have been expected the doctor was jocular lady annabel lively and plantagenet excited by an extraordinary glass of wine venetia alone remained dispirited the doctor made mock speeches and proposed toasts and told plantagenet that he must learn to make speeches too or what would he do when he was in the house of lords and then plantagenet tried to make a speech and proposed venetias health and then venetia who could not bear to hear herself praised by him on such a day the last day burst into tears her mother called her to her side and consoled her and plantagenet jumped up and wiped her eyes with one of those very pockethandkerchiefs on which she had embroidered his cipher and coronet with her own beautiful hair towards evening plantagenet began to experience the reaction of his artificial spirits the doctor had fallen into a gentle slumber lady annabel had quitted the room venetia sat with her hand in plantagenets on a stool by the fireside both were sad and silent at last venetia said o plantagenet i wish i were your real sister perhaps when i see you again you will forget this and she turned the jewel that was suspended round her neck and showed him the inscription  i am sure when i see youagain venetia he replied the only difference will be that i shall love you more than ever  i hope so said venetia  i am sure of it now remember what we are talking about when we meet again we shall see which of us two will love each other the most  o plantagenet i hope they will be kind to you at eton  i will make them  and whenever you are the least unhappy you will write to us  i shall never be unhappy about anything but being away from you as for the rest i will make people respect me i know what i am  because if they do not behave well to you mamma could ask dr masham to go and see you and they will attend to him and i would ask him too i wonder she continued after a moments pause if you have everything you want i am quite sure the instant you are gone we shall remember something you ought to have and then i shall be quite brokenhearted  i have got everything  you said you wanted a large knife  yes but i am going to buy one in london dr masham says he will take me to a place where the finest knives in the world are to be bought it is a great thing to go to london with dr masham  i have never written your name in your bible and prayerbook i will do it this evening  lady annabel is to write it in the bible and you are to write it in the prayerbook  you are to write to us from london by dr masham if only a line  i shall not fail  never mind about your handwriting but mind you write  at this moment lady annabels step was heard and plantagenet said give me a kiss venetia for i do not mean to bid goodbye tonight  but you will not go tomorrow before we are up  yes we shall  now plantagenet i shall be up to bid you goodbye mind that  lady annabel entered the doctor woke lights followed the servant made up the fire and the room looked cheerful again after tea the names were duly written in the bible and prayerbook the last arrangements were made all the baggage was brought down into the hall all ransacked their memory and fancy to see if it were possible that anything that plantagenet could require was either forgotten or had been omitted the clock struck ten lady annabel rose the travellers were to part at an early hour she shook hands with dr masham but cadurcis was to bid her farewell in her dressingroom and then with heavy hearts and glistening eyes they all separated and thus ended the last day     chapter xx   venetia passed a restless night she was so resolved to be awake in time for plantagenets departure that she could not sleep and at length towards morning fell from exhaustion into a light slumber from which she sprang up convulsively roused by the sound of the wheels of the postchaise she looked out of her window and saw the servant strapping on the portmanteaus shortly after this she heard plantagenets step in the vestibule he passed her room and proceeded to her mothers dressingroom at the door of which she heard him knock and then there was silence  you are in good time said lady annabel who was seated in an easy chair when plantagenet entered her room is the doctor up  he is breakfasting  and have you breakfasted  i have no appetite  you should take something my child before you go now come hither my dear plantagenet she said extending her hand listen to me one word when you arrive in london you will go to your guardians he is a great man and i believe a very good one and the law and your fathers will have placed him in the position of a parent to you you must therefore love honour and obey him and i doubt not he will deserve all your affection respect and duty whatever he desires or counsels you will perform and follow so long as you act according to his wishes you cannot be wrong but my dear plantagenet if by any chance it ever happens for strange things sometimes happen in this world that you are in trouble and require a friend remember that cherbury is also your home the home of your heart if not of the law and that not merely from my own love for you but because i promised your poor mother on her deathbed i esteem myself morally although not legally in the light of a parent to you you will find eton a great change you will experience many trials and temptations but you will triumph over and withstand them all if you will attend to these few directions fear god morning and night let nothing induce you ever to omit your prayers to him you will find that praying will make you happy obey your superiors always treat your masters with respect ever speak the truth so long as you adhere to this rule you never can be involved in any serious misfortune a deviation from truth is in general the foundation of all misery be kind to your companions but be firm do not be laughed into doing that which you know to be wrong be modest and humble but ever respect yourself remember who you are and also that it is your duty to excel providence has given you a great lot think ever that you are born to perform great duties  god bless you plantagenet she continued after a slight pause with a faltering voice god bless you my sweet child and god will bless you if you remember him try also to remember us she added as she embraced him and placed in his hand venetias welllined purse do not forget cherbury and all it contains hearts that love you dearly and will pray ever for your welfare  plantagenet leant upon her bosom he had entered the room resolved to be composed with an air even of cheerfulness but his tender heart yielded to the first appeal to his affections he could only murmur out some broken syllables of devotion and almost unconsciously found that he had quitted the chamber  with streaming eyes and hesitating steps he was proceeding along the vestibule when he heard his name called by a low sweet voice he looked around it was venetia never had he beheld such a beautiful vision she was muffled up in her dressinggown her small white feet only guarded from the cold by her slippers her golden hair seemed to reach her waist her cheek was flushed her large blue eyes glittered with tears  plantagenet she said  neither of them could speak they embraced they mingled their tears together and every instant they wept more plenteously at length a footstep was heard venetia murmured a blessing and vanished  cadurcis lingered on the stairs a moment to compose himself he wiped his eyes he tried to look undisturbed all the servants were in the hall from mistress pauncefort to the scullion there was not a dry eye all loved the little lord he was so gracious and so gentle every one asked leave to touch his hand before he went he tried to smile and say something kind to all he recognised the gamekeeper and told him to do what he liked at cadurcis said something to the coachman about his pony and begged mistress pauncefort quite aloud to take great care of her young mistress as he was speaking he felt something rubbing against his hand it was marmion the old bloodhound he also came to bid his adieus cadurcis patted him with affection and said ah my old fellow we shall yet meet again  the doctor appeared smiling as usual made his inquiries whether all were right nodded to the weeping household called plantagenet his brave boy and patted him on the back and bade him jump into the chaise another moment and dr masham had also entered the door was closed the fatal all right sung out and lord cadurcis was whirled away from that cherbury where he was so loved     book ii     chapter i   life is not dated merely by years events are sometimes the best calendars there are epochs in our existence which cannot be ascertained by a formal appeal to the registry the arrival of the cadurcis family at their old abbey their consequent intimacy at cherbury the death of the mother and the departure of the son these were events which had been crowded into a space of less than two years but those two years were not only the most eventful in the life of venetia herbert but in their influence upon the development of her mind and the formation of her character far exceeded the effects of all her previous existence  venetia once more found herself with no companion but her mother but in vain she attempted to recall the feelings she had before experienced under such circumstances and to revert to the resources she had before commanded no longer could she wander in imaginary kingdoms or transform the limited world of her experience into a boundless region of enchanted amusement her playpleasure hours were fled for ever she sighed for her faithful and sympathising companion the empire of fancy yielded without a struggle to the conquering sway of memory  for the first few weeks venetia was restless and dispirited and when she was alone she often wept a mysterious instinct prompted her however not to exhibit such emotion before her mother yet she loved to hear lady annabel talk of plantagenet and a visit to the abbey was ever her favourite walk sometimes too a letter arrived from lord cadurcis and this was great joy but such communications were rare nothing is more difficult than for a junior boy at a public school to maintain a correspondence yet his letters were most affectionate and always dwelt upon the prospect of his return the period for this hopedfor return at length arrived but it brought no plantagenet his guardian wished that the holidays should be spent under his roof still at intervals cadurcis wrote to cherbury to which as time flew on it seemed destined he never was to return vacation followed vacation alike passed with his guardian either in london or at a country seat still more remote from cherbury until at length it became so much a matter of course that his guardians house should be esteemed his home that plantagenet ceased to allude even to the prospect of return in time his letters became rarer and rarer until at length they altogether ceased meanwhile venetia had overcome the original pang of separation if not as gay as in old days she was serene and very studious delighting less in her flowers and birds but much more in her books and pursuing her studies with an earnestness and assiduity which her mother was rather fain to check than to encourage venetia herbert indeed promised to become a most accomplished woman she had a fine ear for music a ready tongue for languages already she emulated her mothers skill in the arts while the library of cherbury afforded welcome and inexhaustible resources to a girl whose genius deserved the richest and most sedulous cultivation and whose peculiar situation independent of her studious predisposition rendered reading a pastime to her rather than a task lady annabel watched the progress of her daughter with lively interest and spared no efforts to assist the formation of her principles and her taste that deep religious feeling which was the characteristic of the mother had been carefully and early cherished in the heart of the child and in time the unrivalled writings of the great divines of our church became a principal portion of her reading order method severe study strict religious exercise with no amusement or relaxation but of the most simple and natural character and with a complete seclusion from society altogether formed a system which acting upon a singularly susceptible and gifted nature secured the promise in venetia herbert at fourteen years of age of an extraordinary woman a system however against which her lively and somewhat restless mind might probably have rebelled had not that system been so thoroughly imbued with all the melting spell of maternal affection it was the inspiration of this sacred love that hovered like a guardian angel over the life of venetia it roused her from her morning slumbers with an embrace it sanctified her evening pillow with a blessing it anticipated the difficulty of the students page and guided the faltering hand of the hesitating artist it refreshed her memory it modulated her voice it accompanied her in the cottage and knelt by her at the altar marvellous and beautiful is a mothers love and when venetia with her strong feelings and enthusiastic spirit would look around and mark that a graceful form and a bright eye were for ever watching over her wants and wishes instructing with sweetness and soft even with advice her whole soul rose to her mother all thoughts and feelings were concentrated in that sole existence and she desired no happier destiny than to pass through life living in the light of her mothers smiles and clinging with passionate trust to that beneficent and guardian form  but with all her quick and profound feelings venetia was thoughtful and even shrewd and when she was alone her very love for her mother and her gratitude for such an ineffable treasure as parental affection would force her mind to a subject which at intervals had haunted her even from her earliest childhood why had she only one parent what mystery was this that enveloped that great tie for that there was a mystery venetia felt as assured as that she was a daughter by a process which she could not analyse her father had become a forbidden subject true lady annabel had placed no formal prohibition upon its mention nor at her present age was venetia one who would be influenced in her conduct by the bygone and arbitrary intimations of a menial nevertheless that the mention of her father would afford pain to the being she loved best in the world was a conviction which had grown with her years and strengthened with her strength pardonable natural even laudable as was the anxiety of the daughter upon such a subject an instinct with which she could not struggle closed the lips of venetia for ever upon this topic his name was never mentioned his past existence was never alluded to who was he that he was of noble family and great position her name betokened and the state in which they lived he must have died very early perhaps even before her mother gave her birth a dreadful lot indeed and yet was the grief that even such a dispensation might occasion so keen so overwhelming that after fourteen long years his name might not be permitted even for an instant to pass the lips of his bereaved wife was his child to be deprived of the only solace for his loss the consolation of cherishing his memory strange passing strange indeed and bitter at cherbury the family of herbert were honoured only from tradition until the arrival of lady annabel as we have before mentioned they had not resided at the hall for more than half a century there were no old retainers there from whom venetia might glean without suspicion the information for which she panted slight too as was venetias experience of society there were times when she could not resist the impression that her mother was not happy that there was some secret sorrow that weighed upon her spirit some grief that gnawed at her heart could it be still the recollection of her lost sire could one so religious so resigned so assured of meeting the lost one in a better world brood with a repining soul over the will of her creator such conduct was entirely at variance with all the tenets of lady annabel it was not thus she consoled the bereaved that she comforted the widow and solaced the orphan venetia too observed everything and forgot nothing not an incident of her earliest childhood that was not as fresh in her memory as if it had occurred yesterday her memory was naturally keen living in solitude with nothing to distract it its impressions never faded away she had never forgotten her mothers tears the day that she and plantagenet had visited marringhurst somehow or other dr masham seemed connected with this sorrow whenever lady annabel was most dispirited it was after an interview with that gentleman yet the presence of the doctor always gave her pleasure and he was the most kindhearted and cheerful of men perhaps after all it was only her illusion perhaps after all it was the memory of her father to which her mother was devoted and which occasionally overcame her perhaps she ventured to speak of him to dr masham though not to her daughter and this might account for that occasional agitation which venetia had observed at his visits and yet and yet and yet in vain she reasoned there is a strange sympathy which whispers convictions that no evidence can authorise and no arguments dispel venetia herbert particularly as she grew older could not refrain at times from yielding to the irresistible belief that her existence was enveloped in some mystery mystery too often presupposes the idea of guilt guilt who was guilty venetia shuddered at the current of her own thoughts she started from the garden seat in which she had fallen into this dangerous and painful reverie flew to her mother who received her with smiles and buried her face in the bosom of lady annabel     chapter ii   we have indicated in a few pages the progress of three years how differently passed to the two preceding ones when the cadurcis family were settled at the abbey for during this latter period it seemed that not a single incident had occurred they had glided away in one unbroken course of study religion and domestic love the enjoyment of nature and the pursuits of charity like a long summer sabbathday sweet and serene and still undisturbed by a single passion hallowed and hallowing  if the cadurcis family were now not absolutely forgotten at cherbury they were at least only occasionally remembered these last three years so completely harmonised with the life of venetia before their arrival that taking a general view of her existence their residence at the abbey figured only as an episode in her career active indeed and stirring and one that had left some impressions not easily discarded but on the whole mellowed by the magic of time venetia looked back to her youthful friendship as an event that was only an exception in her lot and she viewed herself as a being born and bred up in a seclusion which she was never to quit with no aspirations beyond the little world in which she moved and where she was to die in peace as she had lived in purity  one sunday the conversation after dinner fell upon lord cadurcis doctor masham had recently met a young etonian and had made some inquiries about their friend of old days the information he had obtained was not very satisfactory it seemed that cadurcis was a more popular boy with his companions than his tutors he had been rather unruly and had only escaped expulsion by the influence of his guardian who was not only a great noble but a powerful minister  this conversation recalled old times they talked over the arrival of mrs cadurcis at the abbey her strange character her untimely end lady annabel expressed her conviction of the natural excellence of plantagenets disposition and her regret of the many disadvantages under which he laboured it gratified venetia to listen to his praise  he has quite forgotten us mamma said venetia  my love he was very young when he quitted us replied lady annabel and you must remember the influence of a change of life at so tender an age he lives now in a busy world  i wish that he had not forgotten to write to us sometimes said venetia  writing a letter is a great achievement for a schoolboy said the doctor it is a duty which even grownup persons too often forget to fulfil and when postponed it is generally deferred for ever however i agree with lady annabel cadurcis was a fine fellow and had he been properly brought up i cannot help thinking might have turned out something  poor plantagenet said venetia how i pity him his was a terrible lot to lose both his parents whatever were the errors of mrs cadurcis she was his mother and in spite of every mortification he clung to her ah i shall never forget when pauncefort met him coming out of her room the night before the burial when he said with streaming eyes i only had one friend in the world and now she is gone i could not love mrs cadurcis and yet when i heard of these words i cried as much as he  poor fellow said the doctor filling his glass  if there be any person in the world whom i pity said venetia tis an orphan oh what should i be without mamma and plantagenet poor plantagenet he has no mother no father venetia added with a faltering voice i can sympathise with him in some degree i i i know i feel the misfortune the misery her face became crimson yet she could not restrain the irresistible words the misery of never having known a father she added  there was a dead pause a most solemn silence in vain venetia struggled to look calm and unconcerned every instant she felt the blood mantling in her cheek with a more lively and spreading agitation she dared not look up it was not possible to utter a word to turn the conversation she felt utterly confounded and absolutely mute at length lady annabel spoke her tone was severe and choking very different to her usual silvery voice  i am sorry that my daughter should feel so keenly the want of a parents love said her ladyship  what would not venetia have given for the power or speech but it seemed to have deserted her for ever there she sat mute and motionless with her eyes fixed on the table and with a burning cheek as if she were conscious of having committed some act of shame as if she had been detected in some base and degrading deed yet what had she done a daughter had delicately alluded to her grief at the loss of a parent and expressed her keen sense of the deprivation  it was an autumnal afternoon doctor masham looked at the sky and after a long pause made an observation about the weather and then requested permission to order his horses as the evening came on apace and he had some distance to ride lady annabel rose the doctor with a countenance unusually serious offered her his arm and venetia followed them like a criminal in a few minutes the horses appeared lady annabel bid adieu to her friend in her usual kind tone and with her usual sweet smile and then without noticing venetia instantly retired to her own chamber  and this was her mother her mother who never before quitted her for an instant without some sign and symbol of affection some playful word of love a winning smile a passing embrace that seemed to acknowledge that the pang of even momentary separation could only be alleviated by this graceful homage to the heart what had she done venetia was about to follow lady annabel but she checked herself agony at having offended her mother and for the first time was blended with a strange curiosity as to the cause and some hesitating indignation at her treatment venetia remained anxiously awaiting the return of lady annabel but her ladyship did not reappear every instant the astonishment and the grief of venetia increased it was the first domestic difference that had occurred between them it shocked her much she thought of plantagenet and mrs cadurcis there was a mortifying resemblance however slight between the respective situations of the two families venetia too had quarrelled with her mother that mother who for fourteen years had only looked upon her with fondness and joy who had been ever kind without being ever weak and had rendered her child happy by making her good that mother whose beneficent wisdom had transformed duty into delight that superior yet gentle being so indulgent yet so just so gifted yet so condescending who dedicated all her knowledge and time and care and intellect to her daughter  venetia threw herself upon a couch and wept they were the first tears of unmixed pain that she had ever shed it was said by the household of venetia when a child that she had never cried not a single tear had ever sullied that sunny face surrounded by scenes of innocence and images of happiness and content venetia smiled on a world that smiled on her the radiant heroine of a golden age she had indeed wept over the sorrows and the departure of cadurcis but those were soft showers of sympathy and affection sent from a warm heart like drops from a summer sky but now this grief was agony her brow throbbed her hand was clenched her heart beat with tumultuous palpitation the streaming torrent came scalding down her cheek like fire rather than tears and instead of assuaging her emotion seemed on the contrary to increase its fierce and fervid power  the sun had set the red autumnal twilight had died away the shadows of night were brooding over the halls of cherbury the moan of the rising wind might be distinctly heard and ever and anon the branches of neighbouring trees swung with a sudden yet melancholy sound against the windows of the apartment of which the curtains had remained undrawn venetia looked up the room would have been in perfect darkness but for a glimmer which just indicated the site of the expiring fire and an uncertain light or rather modified darkness that seemed the sky alone and desolate alone and desolate and unhappy alone and desolate and unhappy and for the first time was it a sigh or a groan that issued from the stifling heart of venetia herbert that child of innocence that bright emanation of love and beauty that airy creature of grace and gentleness who had never said an unkind word or done an unkind thing in her whole career but had glanced and glided through existence scattering happiness and joy and receiving the pleasure which she herself imparted how overwhelming was her first struggle with that dark stranger sorrow  some one entered the room it was mistress pauncefort she held a taper in her hand and came tripping gingerly in with a new cap streaming with ribands and scarcely as it were condescending to execute the mission with which she was intrusted which was no greater than fetching her ladys reticule she glanced at the table but it was not there she turned up her nose at a chair or two which she even condescended to propel a little with a saucy foot as if the reticule might be hid under the hanging drapery and then unable to find the object of her search mistress pauncefort settled herself before the glass elevating the taper above her head that she might observe what indeed she had been examining the whole day the effect of her new cap with a complacent simper mistress pauncefort then turned from pleasure to business and approaching the couch gave a faint shriek half genuine half affected as she recognised the recumbent form of her young mistress well to be sure exclaimed mistress pauncefort was the like ever seen miss venetia as i live la miss venetia what can be the matter i declare i am all of a palpitation  venetia affecting composure said she was rather unwell that she had a headache and rising murmured that she would go to bed a headache exclaimed mistress pauncefort i hope no worse for there is my lady and she is as out of sorts as possible she has a headache too and when i shut the door just now i am sure as quiet as a lamb she told me not to make so much noise when i left the room noise says i why really my lady i dont pretend to be a spirit but if it comes to noise never answer me pauncefort says my lady no my lady says i i never do and i am sure when i have a headache myself i dont like to be answered but to be sure if you have a headache and my lady has a headache too i only hope we have not got the epidemy i vow miss venetia that your eyes are as red as if you had been running against the wind well to be sure if you have not been crying i must go and tell my lady immediately  light me to my room said venetia i will not disturb my mother as she is unwell  venetia rose and mistress pauncefort followed her to her chamber and lit her candles venetia desired her not to remain and when she had quitted the chamber venetia threw herself in her chair and sighed  to sleep it was impossible it seemed to venetia that she could never rest again she wept no more but her distress was very great she felt it impossible to exist through the night without being reconciled to her mother but she refrained from going to her room from the fear of again meeting her troublesome attendant she resolved therefore to wait until she heard mistress pauncefort retire for the night and she listened with restless anxiety for the sign of her departure in the sound of her footsteps along the vestibule on which the doors of lady annabels and her daughters apartments opened  an hour elapsed and at length the sound was heard convinced that pauncefort had now quitted her mother for the night venetia ventured forth and stopping before the door of her mothers room she knocked gently there was no reply and in a few minutes venetia knocked again and rather louder still no answer mamma said venetia in a faltering tone but no sound replied venetia then tried the door and found it fastened then she gave up the effort in despair and retreating to her own chamber she threw herself on her bed and wept bitterly  some time elapsed before she looked up again the candles were flaring in their sockets it was a wild windy night venetia rose and withdrew the curtain of her window the black clouds were scudding along the sky revealing in their occasional but transient rifts some glimpses of the moon that seemed unusually bright or of a star that trembled with supernatural brilliancy she stood a while gazing on the outward scene that harmonised with her own internal agitation her grief was like the storm her love like the light of that bright moon and star there came over her a desire to see her mother which she felt irresistible she was resolved that no difficulty no impediment should prevent her instantly from throwing herself on her bosom it seemed to her that her brain would burn that this awful night could never end without such an interview she opened her door went forth again into the vestibule and approached with a nervous but desperate step her mothers chamber to her astonishment the door was ajar but there was a light within with trembling step and downcast eyes venetia entered the chamber scarcely daring to advance or to look up  mother she said but no one answered she heard the tick of the clock it was the only sound mother she repeated and she dared to look up but the bed was empty there was no mother lady annabel was not in the room following an irresistible impulse venetia knelt by the side of her mothers bed and prayed she addressed in audible and agitated tones that almighty and beneficent being of whom she was so faithful and pure a follower with sanctified simplicity she communicated to her creator and her saviour all her distress all her sorrow all the agony of her perplexed and wounded spirit if she had sinned she prayed for forgiveness and declared in solitude to one whom she could not deceive how unintentional was the trespass if she were only misapprehended she supplicated for comfort and consolation for support under the heaviest visitation she had yet experienced the displeasure of that earthly parent whom she revered only second to her heavenly father  for thou art my father said venetia i have no other father but thee o god forgive me then my heavenly parent if in my wilfulness if in my thoughtless and sinful blindness i have sighed for a father on earth as well as in heaven great have thy mercies been to me o god in a mothers love turn then again to me the heart of that mother whom i have offended let her look upon her child as before let her continue to me a double parent and let me pay to her the duty and the devotion that might otherwise have been divided  amen said a sweet and solemn voice and venetia was clasped in her mothers arms     chapter iii   if the love of lady annabel for her child were capable of increase it might have been believed that it absolutely became more profound and ardent after that shortlived but painful estrangement which we have related in the last chapter with all lady annabels fascinating qualities and noble virtues a fine observer of human nature enjoying opportunities of intimately studying her character might have suspected that an occasion only was wanted to display or develop in that ladys conduct no trifling evidence of a haughty proud and even inexorable spirit circumstanced as she was at cherbury with no one capable or desirous of disputing her will the more gracious and exalted qualities of her nature were alone apparent entertaining a severe even a sublime sense of the paramount claims of duty in all conditions and circumstances of life her own conduct afforded an invariable and consistent example of her tenet from those around her she required little and that was cheerfully granted while on the other hand her more eminent situation alike multiplied her own obligations and enabled her to fulfil them she appeared therefore to pass her life in conferring happiness and in receiving gratitude strictly religious of immaculate reputation rigidly just systematically charitable dignified in her manners yet more than courteous to her inferiors and gifted at the same time with great selfcontrol and great decision she was looked up to by all within her sphere with a sentiment of affectionate veneration perhaps there was only one person within her little world who both by disposition and relative situation was qualified in any way to question her undoubted sway or to cross by independence of opinion the tenour of the discipline she had established and this was her child venetia with one of the most affectionate and benevolent natures in the world was gifted with a shrewd inquiring mind and a restless imagination she was capable of forming her own opinions and had both reason and feeling at command to gauge their worth but to gain an influence over this child had been the sole object of lady annabels life and she had hitherto met that success which usually awaits in this world the strong purpose of a determined spirit lady annabel herself was far too acute a person not to have detected early in life the talents of her child and she was proud of them she had cultivated them with exemplary devotion and with admirable profit but lady annabel had not less discovered that in the ardent and susceptible temperament of venetia means were offered by which the heart might be trained not only to cope with but overpower the intellect with great powers of pleasing beauty accomplishments a sweet voice a soft manner a sympathetic heart lady annabel was qualified to charm the world she had contrived to fascinate her daughter she had inspired venetia with the most romantic attachment for her such as rather subsists between two female friends of the same age and hearts than between individuals in the relative situations which they bore to each other yet while venetia thus loved her mother she could not but also respect and revere the superior being whose knowledge was her guide on all subjects and whose various accomplishments deprived her secluded education of all its disadvantages and when she felt that one so gifted had devoted her life to the benefit of her child and that this beautiful and peerless lady had no other ambition but to be her guardian and attendant spirit gratitude fervent and profound mingled with admiring reverence and passionate affection and together formed a spell that encircled the mind of venetia with talismanic sway  under the despotic influence of these enchanted feelings venetia was fast growing into womanhood without a single cloud having ever disturbed or sullied the pure and splendid heaven of her domestic life suddenly the horizon had become clouded a storm had gathered and burst and an eclipse could scarcely have occasioned more terror to the untutored roamer of the wilderness than this unexpected catastrophe to one so inexperienced in the power of the passions as our heroine her heaven was again serene but such was the effect of this ebullition on her character so keen was her dread of again encountering the agony of another misunderstanding with her mother that she recoiled with trembling from that subject which had so often and so deeply engaged her secret thoughts and the idea of her father associated as it now was with pain mortification and misery never rose to her imagination but instantly to be shunned as some unhallowed image of which the bitter contemplation was fraught with not less disastrous consequences than the denounced idolatry of the holy people  whatever therefore might be the secret reasons which impelled lady annabel to shroud the memory of the lost parent of her child in such inviolate gloom it is certain that the hitherto restless though concealed curiosity of venetia upon the subject the rash demonstration to which it led and the consequence of her boldness instead of threatening to destroy in an instant the deep and matured system of her mother had on the whole greatly contributed to the fulfilment of the very purpose for which lady annabel had so long laboured that lady spared no pains in following up the advantage which her acuteness and knowledge of her daughters character assured her that she had secured she hovered round her child more like an enamoured lover than a fond mother she hung upon her looks she read her thoughts she anticipated every want and wish her dulcet tones seemed even sweeter than before her soft and elegant manners even more tender and refined though even in her childhood lady annabel had rather guided than commanded venetia now she rather consulted than guided her she seized advantage of the advanced character and mature appearance of venetia to treat her as a woman rather than a child and as a friend rather than a daughter venetia yielded herself up to this flattering and fascinating condescension her love for her mother amounted to passion she had no other earthly object or desire but to pass her entire life in her sole and sweet society she could conceive no sympathy deeper or more delightful the only unhappiness she had ever known had been occasioned by a moment trenching upon its exclusive privilege venetia could not picture to herself that such a pure and entrancing existence could ever experience a change  and this mother this devoted yet mysterious mother jealous of her childs regret for a father that she had lost and whom she had never known shall we ever penetrate the secret of her heart      chapter iv   it was in the enjoyment of these exquisite feelings that a year and more than another year elapsed at our lone hall of cherbury happiness and content seemed at least the blessed destiny of the herberts venetia grew in years and grace and loveliness each day apparently more her mothers joy and each day bound to that mother by if possible more ardent love she had never again experienced those uneasy thoughts which at times had haunted her from her infancy separated from her mother indeed scarcely for an hour together she had no time to muse her studies each day becoming more various and interesting and pursued with so gifted and charming a companion entirely engrossed her even the exercise that was her relaxation was participated by lady annabel and the mother and daughter bounding together on their steeds were fanned by the same breeze and freshened by the same graceful and healthy exertion  one day the post that seldom arrived at cherbury brought a letter to lady annabel the perusal of which evidently greatly agitated her her countenance changed as her eye glanced over the pages her hand trembled as she held it but she made no remark and succeeded in subduing her emotion so quickly that venetia although she watched her mother with anxiety did not feel justified in interfering with inquiring sympathy but while lady annabel resumed her usual calm demeanour she relapsed into unaccustomed silence and soon rising from the breakfast table moved to the window and continued apparently gazing on the garden with her face averted from venetia for some time at length she turned to her and said i think venetia of calling on the doctor today there is business on which i wish to consult him but i will not trouble you dearest to accompany me i must take the carriage and it is a long and tiring drive  there was a tone of decision even in the slightest observations of lady annabel which however sweet might be the voice in which they were uttered scarcely encouraged their propriety to be canvassed now venetia was far from desirous of being separated from her mother this morning it was not a vain and idle curiosity prompted by the receipt of the letter and its consequent effects both in the emotion of her mother and the visit which it had rendered necessary that swayed her breast the native dignity of a welldisciplined mind exempted venetia from such feminine weakness but some consideration might be due to the quick sympathy of an affectionate spirit that had witnessed with corresponding feeling the disturbance of the being to whom she was devoted why this occasional and painful mystery that ever and anon clouded the heaven of their love and flung a frigid shadow over the path of a sunshiny life why was not venetia to share the sorrow or the care of her only friend as well as participate in her joy and her content there were other claims too to this confidence besides those of the heart lady annabel was not merely her only friend she was her parent her only parent almost for aught she had ever heard or learnt her only relative for her mothers family though she was aware of their existence by the freedom with which lady annabel ever mentioned them and though venetia was conscious that an occasional correspondence was maintained between them and cherbury occupied no station in venetias heart scarcely in her memory that noble family were nullities to her far distant apparently estranged from her hearth except in form she had never seen them they were associated in her recollection with none of the sweet ties of kindred her grandfather was dead without her ever having received his blessing his successor her uncle was an ambassador long absent from his country her only aunt married to a soldier and established at a foreign station venetia envied dr masham the confidence which was extended to him it seemed to her even leaving out of sight the intimate feelings that subsisted between her and her mother that the claims of blood to this confidence were at least as strong as those of friendship but venetia stifled these emotions she parted from her mother with a kind yet somewhat mournful expression lady annabel might have read a slight sentiment of affectionate reproach in the demeanour of her daughter when she bade her farewell whatever might be the consciousness of the mother she was successful in concealing her impression very kind but calm and inscrutable lady annabel having given directions for postponing the dinnerhour embraced her child and entered the chariot  venetia from the terrace watched her mothers progress through the park after gazing for some minutes a tear stole down her cheek she started as if surprised at her own emotion and now the carriage was out of sight and venetia would have recurred to some of those resources which were ever at hand for the employment or amusement of her secluded life but the favourite volume ceased to interest this morning and almost fell from her hand she tried her spinet but her ear seemed to have lost its music she looked at her easel but the cunning had fled from her touch  restless and disquieted she knew not why venetia went forth again into the garden all nature smiled around her the flitting birds were throwing their soft shadows over the sunny lawns and rustling amid the blossoms of the variegated groves the golden wreaths of the laburnum and the silver knots of the chestnut streamed and glittered around the bees were as busy as the birds and the whole scene was suffused and penetrated with brilliancy and odour it still was spring and yet the gorgeous approach of summer like the advancing procession of some triumphant king might almost be detected amid the lingering freshness of the year a lively and yet magnificent period blending as it were attic grace with roman splendour a time when hope and fruition for once meet when existence is most full of delight alike delicate and voluptuous and when the human frame is most sensible to the gaiety and grandeur of nature  and why was not the spirit of the beautiful and innocent venetia as bright as the surrounding scene there are moods of mind that baffle analysis that arise from a mysterious sympathy we cannot penetrate at this moment the idea of her father irresistibly recurred to the imagination of venetia she could not withstand the conviction that the receipt of the mysterious letter and her mothers agitation were by some inexplicable connexion linked with that forbidden subject strange incidents of her life flitted across her memory her mother weeping on the day they visited marringhurst the mysterious chambers the nocturnal visit of lady annabel that cadurcis had witnessed her unexpected absence from her apartment when venetia in her despair had visited her some months ago what was the secret that enveloped her existence alone which was unusual dispirited she knew not why and brooding over thoughts which haunted her like evil spirits venetia at length yielded to a degree of nervous excitement which amazed her she looked up to the uninhabited wing of the mansion with an almost fierce desire to penetrate its mysteries it seemed to her that a strange voice came whispering on the breeze urging her to the fulfilment of a mystical mission with a vague yet wild purpose she entered the house and took her way to her mothers chamber mistress pauncefort was there venetia endeavoured to assume her accustomed serenity the waitingwoman bustled about arranging the toilettable which had been for a moment discomposed putting away a cap folding up a shawl and indulging in a multitude of inane observations which little harmonised with the highstrung tension of venetias mind mistress pauncefort opened a casket with a spring lock in which she placed some trinkets of her mistress venetia stood by her in silence her eye vacant and wandering beheld the interior of the casket there must have been something in it the sight of which greatly agitated her for venetia turned pale and in a moment left the chamber and retired to her own room  she locked her door threw herself in a chair almost gasping for breath she covered her face with her hands it was some minutes before she recovered comparative composure she rose and looked in the mirror her face was quite white but her eyes glittering with excitement she walked up and down her room with a troubled step and a scarlet flush alternately returned to and retired from her changing cheek then she leaned against a cabinet in thought she was disturbed from her musings by the sound of paunceforts step along the vestibule as she quitted her mothers chamber in a few minutes venetia herself stepped forth into the vestibule and listened all was silent the golden morning had summoned the whole household to its enjoyment not a voice not a domestic sound broke the complete stillness venetia again repaired to the apartment of lady annabel her step was light but agitated it seemed that she scarcely dared to breathe she opened the door rushed to the cabinet pressed the spring lock caught at something that it contained and hurried again to her own chamber  and what is this prize that the trembling venetia holds almost convulsively in her grasp apparently without daring even to examine it is this the serene and lighthearted girl whose face was like the cloudless splendour of a sunny day why is she so pallid and perturbed what strong impulse fills her frame she clutches in her hand a key  on that tempestuous night of passionate sorrow which succeeded the first misunderstanding between venetia and her mother when the voice of lady annabel had suddenly blended with that of her kneeling child and had ratified with her devotional concurrence her wailing supplications even at the moment when venetia in a rapture of love and duty felt herself pressed to her mothers reconciled heart it had not escaped her that lady annabel held in her hand a key and though the feelings which that night had so forcibly developed and which the subsequent conduct of lady annabel had so carefully and skilfully cherished had impelled venetia to banish and erase from her thought and memory all the associations which that spectacle however slight was calculated to awaken still in her present mood the unexpected vision of the same instrument identical she could not doubt had triumphed in an instant over all the long discipline of her mind and conduct in an instant had baffled and dispersed her selfcontrol and been hailed as the providential means by which she might at length penetrate that mystery which she now felt no longer supportable  the clock of the belfry of cherbury at this moment struck and venetia instantly sprang from her seat it reminded her of the preciousness of the present morning her mother was indeed absent but her mother would return before that event a great fulfilment was to occur venetia still grasping the key as if it were the talisman of her existence looked up to heaven as if she required for her allotted task an immediate and special protection her lips seemed to move and then she again quitted her apartment as she passed through an oriel in her way towards the gallery she observed pauncefort in the avenue of the park moving in the direction of the keepers lodge this emboldened her with a hurried step she advanced along the gallery and at length stood before the longsealed door that had so often excited her strange curiosity once she looked around but no one was near not a sound was heard with a faltering hand she touched the lock but her powers deserted her for a minute she believed that the key after all would not solve the mystery and yet the difficulty arose only from her own agitation she rallied her courage once more she made the trial the key fitted with completeness and the lock opened with ease and venetia found herself in a small and scantilyfurnished antechamber closing the door with noiseless care venetia stood trembling in the mysterious chamber where apparently there was nothing to excite wonder the chamber into which the anteroom opened was still closed and it was some minutes before the adventurous daughter of lady annabel could summon courage for the enterprise which awaited her  the door yielded without an effort venetia stepped into a spacious and lofty chamber for a moment she paused almost upon the threshold and looked around her with a vague and misty vision anon she distinguished something of the character of the apartment in the recess of a large oriel window that looked upon the park and of which the blinds were nearly drawn was an oldfashioned yet sumptuous toilettable of considerable size arranged as if for use opposite this window in a corresponding recess was what might be deemed a bridal bed its furniture being of white satin richly embroidered the curtains half closed and suspended from the canopy was a wreath of roses that had once emulated or rather excelled the lustrous purity of the hangings but now were wan and withered the centre of the inlaid and polished floor of the apartment was covered with a tournay carpet of brilliant yet tasteful decoration an old cabinet of fanciful workmanship some chairs of ebony and some girandoles of silver completed the furniture of the room save that at its extreme end exactly opposite to the door by which venetia entered covered with a curtain of green velvet was what she concluded must be a picture  an awful stillness pervaded the apartment venetia herself with a face paler even than the hangings of the mysterious bed stood motionless with suppressed breath gazing on the distant curtain with a painful glance of agitated fascination at length summoning her energies as if for the achievement of some terrible yet inevitable enterprise she crossed the room and averting her face and closing her eyes in a paroxysm of nervous excitement she stretched forth her arm and with a rapid motion withdrew the curtain the harsh sound of the brass rings drawn quickly over the rod the only noise that had yet met her ear in this mystical chamber made her start and tremble she looked up she beheld in a broad and massy frame the fulllength portrait of a man  a man in the very spring of sunny youth and of radiant beauty above the middle height yet with a form that displayed exquisite grace he was habited in a green tunic that enveloped his figure to advantage and became the scene in which he was placed a park with a castle in the distance while a groom at hand held a noble steed that seemed impatient for the chase the countenance of its intended rider met fully the gaze of the spectator it was a countenance of singular loveliness and power the lips and the moulding of the chin resembled the eager and impassioned tenderness of the shape of antinous but instead of the effeminate sullenness of the eye and the narrow smoothness of the forehead shone an expression of profound and piercing thought on each side of the clear and open brow descended even to the shoulders the clustering locks of golden hair while the eyes large and yet deep beamed with a spiritual energy and shone like two wells of crystalline water that reflect the allbeholding heavens  now when venetia herbert beheld this countenance a change came over her it seemed that when her eyes met the eyes of the portrait some mutual interchange of sympathy occurred between them she freed herself in an instant from the apprehension and timidity that before oppressed her whatever might ensue a vague conviction of having achieved a great object pervaded as it were her being some great end vast though indefinite had been fulfilled abstract and fearless she gazed upon the dazzling visage with a prophetic heart her soul was in a tumult oppressed with thickcoming fancies too big for words panting for expression there was a word which must be spoken it trembled on her convulsive lip and would not sound she looked around her with an eye glittering with unnatural fire as if to supplicate some invisible and hovering spirit to her rescue or that some floating and angelic chorus might warble the thrilling word whose expression seemed absolutely necessary to her existence her cheek is flushed her eye wild and tremulous the broad blue veins of her immaculate brow quivering and distended her waving hair falls back over her forehead and rustles like a wood before the storm she seems a priestess in the convulsive throes of inspiration and about to breathe the oracle the picture as we have mentioned was hung in a broad and massy frame in the centre of its base was worked an escutcheon and beneath the shield this inscription      marmion herbert aet xx  yet there needed not these letters to guide the agitated spirit of venetia for before her eye had reached them the word was spoken and falling on her knees before the portrait the daughter of lady annabel had exclaimed my father     chapter v   the daughter still kneels before the form of the father of whom she had heard for the first time in her life he is at length discovered it was then an irresistible destiny that after the wild musings and baffled aspirations of so many years had guided her to this chamber she is the child of marmion herbert she beholds her lost parent that being of supernatural beauty on whom she gazes with a look of blended reverence and love is her father what a revelation its reality exceeded the wildest dreams of her romance her brightest visions of grace and loveliness and genius seemed personified in this form the form of one to whom she was bound by the strongest of all earthly ties of one on whose heart she had a claim second only to that of the being by whose lips his name was never mentioned was he then no more ah could she doubt that bitterest calamity ah was it was it any longer a marvel that one who had lived in the light of those seraphic eyes and had watched them until their terrestrial splendour had been for ever extinguished should shrink from the converse that could remind her of the catastrophe of all her earthly hopes this chamber then was the temple of her mothers woe the tomb of her baffled affections and bleeding heart no wonder that lady annabel the desolate lady annabel that almost the same spring must have witnessed the most favoured and the most disconsolate of women should have fled from the world that had awarded her at the same time a lot so dazzling and so full of despair venetia felt that the existence of her mothers child her own fragile being could have been that mothers sole link to life the heart of the young widow of marmion herbert must have broken but for venetia and the consciousness of that remaining tie and the duties that it involved could alone have sustained the victim under a lot of such unparalleled bitterness the tears streamed down her cheek as she thought of her mothers misery and her mothers gentle love the misery that she had been so cautious her child should never share the vigilant affection that with all her own hopes blighted had still laboured to compensate to her child for a deprivation the fulness of which venetia could only now comprehend  when where why did he die oh that she might talk of him to her mother for ever it seemed that life might pass away in listening to his praises marmion herbert and who was marmion herbert young as he was command and genius the pride of noble passions all the glory of a creative mind seemed stamped upon his brow with all his marvellous beauty he seemed a being born for greatness dead in the very burst of his spring a spring so sweet and splendid could he be dead why then was he ever born it seemed to her that he could not be dead there was an animated look about the form that seemed as if it could not die without leaving mankind a prodigal legacy of fame  venetia turned and looked upon her parents bridal bed now that she had discovered her fathers portrait every article in the room interested her for her imagination connected everything with him she touched the wreath of withered roses and one instantly broke away from the circle and fell she knelt down and gathered up the scattered leaves and placed them in her bosom she approached the table in the oriel in its centre was a volume on which reposed a dagger of curious workmanship the volume bound in velvet and the word annabel embroidered upon it in gold venetia unclasped it the volume was his in a flyleaf were written these words      to the lady of my love from her marmion herbert  with a fluttering heart yet sparkling eye venetia sank into a chair which was placed before the table with all her soul concentred in the contents of this volume leaning on her right hand which shaded her agitated brow she turned a page of the volume with a trembling hand it contained a sonnet delineating the feelings of a lover at the first sight of his beloved a being to him yet unknown venetia perused with breathless interest the graceful and passionate picture of her mothers beauty a series of similar compositions detailed the history of the poets heart and all the thrilling adventures of his enchanted life not an incident not a word not a glance in that spellbound prime of existence that was not commemorated by his lyre in strains as sweet and as witching now he poured forth his passion now his doubts now his hopes now came the glowing hour when he was first assured of his felicity the next page celebrated her visit to the castle of his fathers and another led her to the altar  with a flushed cheek and an excited eye venetia had rapidly pored over these ardent annals of the heart from whose blood she had sprung she turns the page she starts the colour deserts her countenance a mist glides over her vision she clasps her hands with convulsive energy she sinks back in her chair in a few moments she extends one hand as if fearful again to touch the book that had excited so much emotion raises herself in her seat looks around her with a vacant and perplexed gaze apparently succeeds in collecting herself and then seizes with an eager grasp the volume and throwing herself on her knees before the chair her long locks hanging on each side over a cheek crimson as the sunset loses her whole soul in the lines which the next page reveals    on the night our daughter was born    i    within our heaven of love the newborn star   we long devoutly watched like shepherd kings   steals into light and floating from afar   methinks some bright transcendent seraph sings   waving with flashing light her radiant wings   immortal welcome to the stranger fair   to us a child is born with transport clings   the mother to the babe she sighed to bear   of all our treasured loves the longexpected heir    ii    my daughter can it be a daughter now   shall greet my being with her infant smile   and shall i press that fair and taintless brow   with my fond lips and tempt with many a wile   of playful love those features to beguile   a parent with their mirth in the wild sea   of this dark life behold a little isle   rises amid the waters bright and free   a haven for my hopes of fond security    iii    and thou shalt bear a name my line has loved   and their fair daughters owned for many an age   since first our fiery blood a wanderer roved   and made in sunnier lands his pilgrimage   where proud defiance with the waters wage   the seaborn citys walls the graceful towers   loved by the bard and honoured by the sage   my own venetia now shall gild our bowers   and with her spell enchain our lifes enchanted hours    iv    oh if the blessing of a fathers heart   hath aught of sacred in its deepbreathd prayer   skilled to thy gentle being to impart   as thy bright form itself a fate as fair   on thee i breathe that blessing let me share   o god her joys and if the dark behest   of woe resistless and avoidless care   hath not gone forth oh spare this gentle guest   and wreak thy needful wrath on my resigned breast  an hour elapsed and venetia did not move over and over again she conned the only address from the lips of her father that had ever reached her ear a strange inspiration seconded the exertion of an exercised memory the duty was fulfilled the task completed then a sound was heard without the thought that her mother had returned occurred to her she looked up the big tears streaming down her face she listened like a young hind just roused by the stilldistant huntsman quivering and wild she listened and she sprang up replaced the volume arranged the chair cast one long lingering feverish glance at the portrait skimmed through the room hesitated one moment in the antechamber opened as all was silent the no longer mysterious door turned the noiseless lock tripped lightly along the vestibule glided into her mothers empty apartment reposited the key that had opened so many wonders in the casket and then having hurried to her own chamber threw herself on her bed in a paroxysm of contending emotions that left her no power of pondering over the strange discovery that had already given a new colour to her existence     chapter vi   her mother had not returned it was a false alarm but venetia could not quit her bed there she remained repeating to herself her fathers verses then one thought alone filled her being was he dead was this fond father who had breathed this fervent blessing over her birth and invoked on his own head all the woe and misfortunes of her destiny was he indeed no more how swiftly must the arrow have sped after he received the announcement that a child was given to him    of all his treasured loves the longexpected heir  he could scarcely have embraced her ere the great being to whom he had offered his prayer summoned him to his presence of that father she had not the slightest recollection she had ascertained that she had reached cherbury a child even in arms and she knew that her father had never lived under the roof what an awful bereavement was it wonderful that her mother was inconsolable was it wonderful that she could not endure even his name to be mentioned in her presence that not the slightest allusion to his existence could be tolerated by a wife who had been united to such a peerless being only to behold him torn away from her embraces oh could he indeed be dead that inspired countenance that seemed immortal had it in a moment been dimmed and all the symmetry of that matchless form had it indeed been long mouldering in the dust why should she doubt it ah why indeed how could she doubt it why ever and anon amid the tumult of her excited mind came there an unearthly whisper to her ear mocking her with the belief that he still lived but he was dead he must be dead and why did she live could she survive what she had seen and learnt this day did she wish to survive it but her mother her mother with all her sealedup sorrows had survived him why for her sake for her child for his own venetia his own  she clenched her feverish hand her temples beat with violent palpitations her brow was burning hot time flew on and every minute venetia was more sensible of the impossibility of rising to welcome her mother that mother at length returned venetia could not again mistake the wheels of the returning carriage some minutes passed and there was a knock at her door with a choking voice venetia bade them enter it was pauncefort  well miss she exclaimed if you aynt here after all i told my lady my lady says i i am sure miss venetia must be in the park for i saw her go out myself and i have never seen her come home and after all you are here my lady has come home you know miss and has been inquiring for you several times  tell mamma that i am not very well said venetia in a low voice and that i have been obliged to lie down  not well miss exclaimed pauncefort and what can be the matter with you i am afraid you have walked too much overdone it i dare say or mayhap you have caught cold it is an easterly wind for i was saying to john this morning john says i if miss venetia will walk about with only a handkerchief tied round her head why what can be expected  i have only a headache a very bad headache pauncefort i wish to be quiet said venetia  pauncefort left the room accordingly and straightway proceeded to lady annabel when she communicated the information that miss venetia was in the house after all though she had never seen her return and that she was lying down because she had a very bad headache lady annabel of course did not lose a moment in visiting her darling she entered the room softly so softly that she was not heard venetia was lying on her bed with her back to the door lady annabel stood by her bedside for some moments unnoticed at length venetia heaved a deep sigh her mother then said in a soft voice are you in pain darling  is that mamma said venetia turning with quickness  you are ill dear said lady annabel taking her hand your hand is hot you are feverish how long has my venetia felt ill  venetia could not answer she did nothing but sigh her strange manner excited her mothers wonder lady annabel sat by the bedside still holding her daughters hand in hers watching her with a glance of great anxiety  answer me my love she repeated in a voice of tenderness what do you feel  my head my head murmured venetia  her mother pressed her own hand to her daughters brow it was very hot does that pain you inquired lady annabel but venetia did not reply her look was wild and abstracted her mother gently withdrew her hand and then summoned pauncefort with whom she communicated without permitting her to enter the room  miss herbert is very ill said lady annabel pale but in a firm tone i am alarmed about her she appears to me to have fever send instantly to southport for mr hawkins and let the messenger use and urge all possible expedition be in attendance in the vestibule pauncefort i shall not quit her room but she must be kept perfectly quiet  lady annabel then drew her chair to the bedside of her daughter and bathed her temples at intervals with rosewater but none of these attentions apparently attracted the notice of the sufferer she was it would seem utterly unconscious of all that was occurring she now lay with her face turned towards her mother but did not exchange even looks with her she was restless and occasionally she sighed deeply  once by way of experiment lady annabel again addressed her but venetia gave no answer then the mother concluded what indeed had before attracted her suspicion that venetias head was affected but then what was this strange this sudden attack which appeared to have prostrated her daughters faculties in an instant a few hours back and lady annabel had parted from venetia in all the glow of health and beauty the season was most genial her exercise had doubtless been moderate as for her general health so complete was her constitution and so calm the tenour of her life that venetia had scarcely experienced in her whole career a single hour of indisposition it was an anxious period of suspense until the medical attendant arrived from southport fortunately he was one in whom from reputation lady annabel was disposed to place great trust and his matured years his thoughtful manner and acute inquiries confirmed her favourable opinion of him all that mr hawkins could say however was that miss herbert had a great deal of fever but the cause was concealed and the suddenness of the attack perplexed him he administered one of the usual remedies and after an hour had elapsed and no favourable change occurring he blooded her he quitted cherbury with the promise of returning late in the evening having several patients whom he was obliged to visit  the night drew on the chamber was now quite closed but lady annabel never quitted it she sat reading removed from her daughter that her presence might not disturb her for venetia seemed inclined to sleep suddenly venetia spoke but she said only one word father  lady annabel started her book nearly fell from her hand she grew very pale quite breathless she listened and again venetia spoke and again called upon her father now with a great effort lady annabel stole on tiptoe to the bedside of her daughter venetia was lying on her back her eyes were closed her lips still as it were quivering with the strange word they had dared to pronounce again her voice sounded she chanted in an unearthly voice verses the perspiration stood in large drops on the pallid forehead of the mother as she listened still venetia proceeded and lady annabel throwing herself on her knees held up her hands to heaven in an agony of astonishment terror and devotion  now there was again silence but her mother remained apparently buried in prayer again venetia spoke again she repeated the mysterious stanzas with convulsive agony her mother listened to every fatal line that she unconsciously pronounced  the secret was then discovered yes venetia must have penetrated the longclosed chamber all the labours of years had in a moment been subverted venetia had discovered her parent and the effects of the discovery might perhaps be her death then it was that lady annabel in the torture of her mind poured forth her supplications that the life or the heart of her child might never be lost to her grant o merciful god she exclaimed that this sole hope of my being may be spared to me grant if she be spared that she may never desert her mother and for him of whom she has heard this day for the first time let him be to her as if he were no more may she never learn that he lives may she never comprehend the secret agony of her mothers life save her o god save her from his fatal his irresistible influence may she remain pure and virtuous as she has yet lived may she remain true to thee and true to thy servant who now bows before thee look down upon me at this moment with gracious mercy turn to me my daughters heart and if it be my dark doom to be in this world a widow though a wife add not to this bitterness that i shall prove a mother without a child  at this moment the surgeon returned it was absolutely necessary that lady annabel should compose herself she exerted all that strength of character for which she was remarkable from this moment she resolved if her life were the forfeit not to quit for an instant the bedside of venetia until she was declared out of danger and feeling conscious that if she once indulged her own feelings she might herself soon be in a situation scarcely less hazardous than her daughters she controlled herself with a mighty effort calm as a statue she received the medical attendant who took the hand of the unconscious venetia with apprehension too visibly impressed upon his grave countenance as he took her hand venetia opened her eyes stared at her mother and her attendant and then immediately closed them  she has slept inquired lady annabel  no said the surgeon no this is not sleep it is a feverish trance that brings her no refreshment he took out his watch and marked her pulse with great attention then he placed his hand on her brow and shook his head these beautiful curls must come off he said lady annabel glided to the table and instantly brought the scissors as if the delay of an instant might be fatal the surgeon cut off those long golden locks venetia raised her hand to her head and said in a low voice they are for my father lady annabel leant upon the surgeons arm and shook  now he led the mother to the window and spoke in a hushed tone  is it possible that there is anything on your daughters mind lady annabel he inquired  the agitated mother looked at the inquirer and then at her daughter and then for a moment she raised her hand to her eyes then she replied in a low but firm voice yes  your ladyship must judge whether you wish me to be acquainted with it said mr hawkins calmly  my daughter has suddenly become acquainted sir with some family incidents of a painful nature and the knowledge of which i have hitherto spared her they are events long past and their consequences are now beyond all control  she knows then the worst  without her mind i cannot answer that question said lady annabel  it is my duty to tell you that miss herbert is in imminent danger she has every appearance of a fever of a malignant character i cannot answer for her life  o god exclaimed lady annabel  yet you must compose yourself my dear lady her chance of recovery greatly depends upon the vigilance of her attendants i shall bleed her again and place leeches on her temples there is inflammation on the brain there are other remedies also not less powerful we must not despair we have no cause to despair until we find these fail i shall not leave her again and for your satisfaction not for my own i shall call in additional advice the aid of a physician  a messenger accordingly was instantly despatched for the physician who resided at a town more distant than southport the very town bythebye where morgana the gipsy was arrested they contrived with the aid of pauncefort to undress venetia and place her in her bed for hitherto they had refrained from this exertion at this moment the withered leaves of a white rose fell from venetias dress a sofabed was then made for lady annabel of which however she did not avail herself the whole night she sat by her daughters side watching every movement of venetia refreshing her hot brow and parched lips or arranging at every opportunity her disordered pillows about an hour past midnight the surgeon retired to rest for a few hours in the apartment prepared for him and pauncefort by the desire of her mistress also withdrew lady annabel was alone with her child and with those agitated thoughts which the strange occurrences of the day were well calculated to excite     chapter vii   early in the morning the physician arrived at cherbury it remained for him only to approve of the remedies which had been pursued no material change however had occurred in the state of venetia she had not slept and still she seemed unconscious of what was occurring the gracious interposition of nature seemed the only hope when the medical men had withdrawn to consult in the terraceroom lady annabel beckoned to pauncefort and led her to the window of venetias apartment which she would not quit  pauncefort said lady annabel venetia has been in her fathers room  oh impossible my lady burst forth mistress pauncefort but lady annabel placed her finger on her lip and checked her there is no doubt of it there can be no doubt of it pauncefort she entered it yesterday she must have passed the morning there when you believed she was in the park  but my lady said pauncefort how could it be for i scarcely left your laships room a second and miss venetia i am sure never was near it and the key my lady the key is in the casket i saw it half an hour ago with my own eyes  there is no use arguing about it pauncefort said lady annabel with decision it is as i say i fear great misfortunes are about to commence at cherbury  oh my lady dont think of such things said pauncefort herself not a little alarmed what can happen  i fear more than i know said lady annabel but i do fear much at present i can only think of her  well my lady said poor mistress pauncefort looking bewildered only to think of such a thing and after all the pains i have taken i am sure i have not opened my lips on the subject these fifteen years and the many questions i have been asked too i am sure there is not a servant in the house  hush hush said lady annabel i do not blame you and therefore you need not defend yourself go pauncefort i must be alone pauncefort withdrew and lady annabel resumed her seat by her daughters side  on the fourth day of her attack the medical attendants observed a favourable change in their patient and were not of course slow in communicating this joyful intelligence to her mother the crisis had occurred and was past venetia had at length sunk into slumber how different was her countenance from the still yet settled features they had before watched with such anxiety she breathed lightly the tension of the eyelids had disappeared her mouth was slightly open the physician and his colleague declared that immediate danger was past and they counselled lady annabel to take repose on condition that one of them should remain by the side of her daughter the devoted yet miserable mother quitted for the first time her childs apartment pauncefort followed her to her room  oh my lady said pauncefort i am so glad your laship is going to lie down a bit  i am not going to lie down pauncefort give me the key  and lady annabel proceeded alone to the forbidden chamber that chamber which after what has occurred we may now enter with her and where with so much labour she had created a room exactly imitative of their bridal apartment at her husbands castle with a slow but resolved step she entered the apartment and proceeding immediately to the table took up the book it opened at the stanzas to venetia the pages had recently been bedewed with tears lady annabel then looked at the bridal bed and marked the missing rose in the garland it was as she expected she seated herself then in the chair opposite the portrait on which she gazed with a glance rather stern than fond  marmion she exclaimed for fifteen years a solitary votary i have mourned over in this temple of baffled affections the inevitable past the daughter of our love has found her way perhaps by an irresistible destiny to a spot sacred to my longconcealed sorrows at length she knows her father may she never know more may she never learn that the being whose pictured form has commanded her adoration is unworthy of those glorious gifts that a gracious creator has bestowed upon him marmion you seem to smile upon me you seem to exult in your triumph over the heart of your child but there is a power in a mothers love that yet shall baffle you hitherto i have come here to deplore the past hitherto i have come here to dwell upon the form that in spite of all that has happened i still was perhaps weak enough to love those feelings are past for ever yes you would rob me of my child you would tear from my heart the only consolation you have left me but venetia shall still be mine and i i am no longer yours our love our still lingering love has vanished you have been my enemy now i am yours i gaze upon your portrait for the last time and thus i prevent the magical fascination of that face again appealing to the sympathies of my child thus and thus she seized the ancient dagger that we have mentioned as lying on the volume and springing on the chair she plunged it into the canvas then tearing with unflinching resolution the severed parts she scattered the fragments over the chamber shook into a thousand leaves the melancholy garland tore up the volume of his enamoured muse and then quitting the chamber and locking and double locking the door she descended the staircase and proceeding to the great well of cherbury hurled into it the fatal key  oh my lady said mistress pauncefort as she met lady annabel returning in the vestibule doctor masham is here  is he said lady annabel as calm as usual i will see him before i lie down do not go into venetias room she sleeps and mr hawkins has promised me to let me know when she wakes     chapter viii   as lady annabel entered the terraceroom doctor masham came forward and grasped her hand  you have heard of our sorrow said her ladyship in a faint voice  but this instant replied the doctor in a tone of great anxiety immediate danger  is past she sleeps replied lady annabel  a most sudden and unaccountable attack said the doctor  it is difficult to describe the contending emotions of the mother as her companion made this observation at length she replied sudden certainly sudden but not unaccountable oh my friend she added after a moments pause they will not be content until they have torn my daughter from me  they tear your daughter from you exclaimed doctor masham who  he he muttered lady annabel her speech was incoherent her manner very disturbed  my dear lady said the doctor gazing on her with extreme anxiety you are yourself unwell  lady annabel heaved a deep sigh the doctor bore her to a seat shall i send for any one anything  no one no one quickly answered lady annabel with you at least there is no concealment necessary  she leant back in her chair the doctor holding her hand and standing by her side  still lady annabel continued sighing deeply at length she looked up and said does she love me do you think after all she loves me  venetia inquired the doctor in a low and doubtful voice for he was greatly perplexed  she has seen him she loves him she has forgotten her mother  my dear lady you require rest said doctor masham you are overcome with strange fancies whom has your daughter seen  marmion  impossible you forget he is  here also he has spoken to her she loves him she will recover she will fly to him sooner let us both die  dear lady  she knows everything fate has baffled me we cannot struggle with fate she is his child she is like him she is not like her mother oh she hates me i know she hates me  hush hush hush said the doctor himself very agitated venetia loves you only you why should she love any one else  who can help it i loved him i saw him i loved him his voice was music he has spoken to her and she yielded she yielded in a moment i stood by her bedside she would not speak to me she would not know me she shrank from me her heart is with her father only with him  where did she see him how  his room his picture she knows all i was away with you and she entered his chamber  ah  oh doctor you have influence with her speak to her make her love me tell her she has no father tell her he is dead  we will do that which is well and wise replied doctor masham at present let us be calm if you give way her life may be the forfeit now is the moment for a mothers love  you are right i should not have left her for an instant i would not have her wake and find her mother not watching over her but i was tempted she slept i left her for a moment i went to destroy the spell she cannot see him again no one shall see him again it was my weakness the weakness of long years and now i am its victim  nay nay my sweet lady all will be quite well be but calm venetia will recover  but will she love me oh no no no she will think only of him she will not love her mother she will yearn for her father now she has seen him and she will not rest until she is in his arms she will desert me i know it  and i know the contrary said the doctor attempting to reassure her i will answer for venetias devotion to you indeed she has no thought but your happiness and can love only you when there is a fitting time i will speak to her but now now is the time for repose and you must rest you must indeed  rest i cannot i slumbered in the chair last night by her bedside and a voice roused me it was her own she was speaking to her father she told him how she loved him how long how much she thought of him that she would join him when she was well for she knew he was not dead and if he were dead she would die also she never mentioned me  nay the light meaning of a delirious brain truth truth bitter inevitable truth oh doctor i could bear all but this but my child my beautiful fond child that made up for all my sorrows my joy my hope my life i knew it would be so i knew he would have her heart he said she never could be alienated from him he said she never could be taught to hate him i did not teach her to hate him i said nothing i deemed fond foolish mother that the devotion of my life might bind her to me but what is a mothers love i cannot contend with him he gained the mother he will gain the daughter too  god will guard over you said masham with streaming eyes god will not desert a pious and virtuous woman  i must go said lady annabel attempting to rise but the doctor gently controlled her perhaps she is awake and i am not at her side she will not ask for me she will ask for him but i will be there she will desert me but she shall not say i ever deserted her  she will never desert you said the doctor my life on her pure heart she has been a child of unbroken love and duty still she will remain so her mind is for a moment overpowered by a marvellous discovery she will recover and be to you as she was before  well tell her he is dead said lady annabel eagerly you must tell her she will believe you i cannot speak to her of him no not to secure her heart never never never can i speak to venetia of her father  i will speak replied the doctor at the just time now let us think of her recovery she is no longer in danger we should be grateful we should be glad  let us pray to god let us humble ourselves said lady annabel let us beseech him not to desert this house we have been faithful to him we have struggled to be faithful to him let us supplicate him to favour and support us  he will favour and support you said the doctor in a solemn tone he has upheld you in many trials he will uphold you still  ah why did i love him why did i continue to love him how weak how foolish how mad i have been i have alone been the cause of all this misery yes i have destroyed my child  she lives she will live nay nay you must reassure yourself come let me send for your servant and for a moment repose nay take my arm all depends upon you we have great cares now let us not conjure up fantastic fears  i must go to my daughters room perhaps by her side i might rest nowhere else you will attend me to the door my friend yes it is something in this life to have a friend  lady annabel took the arm of the good masham they stopped at her daughters door  rest here a moment she said as she entered the room without a sound in a moment she returned she still sleeps said the mother i shall remain with her and you  i will not leave you said the doctor but think not of me nay i will not leave you i will remain under this roof i have shared its serenity and joy let me not avoid it in this time of trouble and tribulation     chapter ix   venetia still slept her mother alone in the chamber watched by her side some hours had elapsed since her interview with dr masham the medical attendant had departed for a few hours  suddenly venetia moved opened her eyes and said in a faint voice mamma  the blood rushed to lady annabels heart that single word afforded her the most exquisite happiness  i am here dearest she replied  mamma what is all this inquired venetia  you have not been well my own but now you are much better  i thought i had been dreaming replied venetia and that all was not right somebody i thought struck me on my head but all is right now because you are here my dear mamma  but lady annabel could not speak for weeping  are you sure mamma that nothing has been done to my head continued venetia why what is this and she touched a light bandage on her brow  my darling you have been ill and you have lost blood but now you are getting quite well i have been very unhappy about you but now i am quite happy my sweet sweet child  how long have i been ill  you have been very ill indeed for four or five days you have had a fever venetia but now the fever is gone and you are only a little weak and you will soon be well  a fever and how did i get the fever  perhaps you caught cold my child but we must not talk too much  a fever i never had a fever before a fever is like a dream  hush sweet love indeed you must not speak  give me your hand mamma i will not speak if you will let me hold your hand i thought in the fever that we were parted  i have never left your side my child day or night said lady annabel not without agitation  all this time all these days and nights no one would do that but you mamma you think only of me  you repay me by your love venetia said lady annabel feeling that her daughter ought not to speak yet irresistibly impelled to lead out her thoughts  how can i help loving you my dear mamma  you do love me you do love me very much do you not sweet child  better than all the world replied venetia to her enraptured parent and yet in the fever i seemed to love some one else but fevers are like dreams they are not true  lady annabel pressed her lips gently to her daughters and whispered her that she must speak no more  when mr hawkins returned he gave a favourable report of venetia he said that all danger was now past and that all that was required for her recovery were time care and repose he repeated to lady annabel alone that the attack was solely to be ascribed to some great mental shock which her daughter had received and which suddenly had affected her circulation leaving it after this formal intimation entirely to the mother to take those steps in reference to the cause whatever it might be which she should deem expedient  in the evening lady annabel stole down for a few moments to dr masham laden with joyful intelligence assured of the safety of her child and what was still more precious of her heart and even voluntarily promising her friend that she should herself sleep this night in her daughters chamber on the sofabed the doctor therefore now bade her adieu and said that he should ride over from marringhurst every day to hear how their patient was proceeding  from this time the recovery of venetia though slow was gradual she experienced no relapse and in a few weeks quitted her bed she was rather surprised at her altered appearance when it first met her glance in the mirror but scarcely made any observation on the loss of her locks during this interval the mind of venetia had been quite dormant the rage of the fever and the violent remedies to which it had been necessary to have recourse had so exhausted her that she had not energy enough to think all that she felt was a strange indefinite conviction that some occurrence had taken place with which her memory could not grapple but as her strength returned and as she gradually resumed her usual health by proportionate though almost invisible degrees her memory returned to her and her intelligence she clearly recollected and comprehended what had taken place she recalled the past compared incidents weighed circumstances sifted and balanced the impressions that now crowded upon her consciousness it is difficult to describe each link in the metaphysical chain which at length connected the mind of venetia herbert with her actual experience and precise situation it was however at length perfect and gradually formed as she sat in an invalid chair apparently listless not yet venturing on any occupation or occasionally amused for a moment by her mother reading to her but when her mind had thus resumed its natural tone and in time its accustomed vigour the past demanded all her solicitude at length the mystery of her birth was revealed to her she was the daughter of marmion herbert and who was marmion herbert the portrait rose before her how distinct was the form how definite the countenance no common personage was marmion herbert even had he not won his wife and celebrated his daughter in such witching strains genius was stamped on his lofty brow and spoke in his brilliant eye nobility was in all his form this chivalric poet was her father she had read she had dreamed of such beings she had never seen them if she quitted the solitude in which she lived would she see men like her father no other could ever satisfy her imagination all beneath that standard would rank but as imperfect creations in her fancy and this father he was dead no doubt ah was there indeed no doubt eager as was her curiosity on this allabsorbing subject venetia could never summon courage to speak upon it to her mother her first disobedience or rather her first deception of her mother in reference to this very subject had brought and brought so swiftly on its retributive wings such disastrous consequences that any allusion to lady annabel was restrained by a species of superstitious fear against which venetia could not contend then her father was either dead or living that was certain if dead it was clear that his memory however cherished by his relict was associated with feelings too keen to admit of any other but solitary indulgence if living there was a mystery connected with her parents a mystery evidently of a painful character and one which it was a prime object with her mother to conceal and to suppress could venetia then in defiance of that mother that fond devoted mother that mother who had watched through long days and long nights over her sick bed and who now without a murmur was a prisoner to this very room only to comfort and console her child could venetia take any step which might occasion this matchless parent even a transient pang no it was impossible to her mother she could never speak and yet to remain enveloped in the present mystery she was sensible was equally insufferable all she asked all she wanted to know was he alive if he were alive then although she could not see him though she might never see him she could exist upon his idea she could conjure up romances of future existence with him she could live upon the fond hope of some day calling him father and receiving from his hands the fervid blessing he had already breathed to her in song  in the meantime her remaining parent commanded all her affections even if he were no more blessed was her lot with such a mother lady annabel seemed only to exist to attend upon her daughter no lover ever watched with such devotion the wants or even the caprices of his mistress a thousand times every day venetia found herself expressing her fondness and her gratitude it seemed that the late dreadful contingency of losing her daughter had developed in lady annabels heart even additional powers of maternal devotion and venetia the fond and grateful venetia ignorant of the strange past which she believed she so perfectly comprehended returned thanks to heaven that her mother was at least spared the mortification of knowing that her daughter in her absence had surreptitiously invaded the sanctuary of her secret sorrow     chapter x   when venetia had so far recovered that leaning on her mothers arm she could resume her walks upon the terrace doctor masham persuaded his friends as a slight and not unpleasant change of scene to pay him a visit at marringhurst since the chamber scene indeed lady annabels tie to cherbury was much weakened there were certain feelings of pain and fear and mortification now associated with that place which she could not bear to dwell upon and which greatly balanced those sentiments of refuge and repose of peace and love with which the old hall in her mind was heretofore connected venetia ever adopted the slightest intimations of a wish on the part of her mother and so she readily agreed to fall into the arrangement  it was rather a long and rough journey to marringhurst for they were obliged to use the old chariot but venetia forgot her fatigues in the cordial welcome of their host whose sparkling countenance well expressed the extreme gratification their arrival occasioned him all that the tenderest solicitude could devise for the agreeable accommodation of the invalid had been zealously concerted and the constant influence of dr mashams cheerful mind was as beneficial to lady annabel as to her daughter the season was gay the place was pleasant and although they were only a few miles from home in a house with which they were familiar and their companion one whom they had known intimately all their lives and of late almost daily seen yet such is the magic of a change in our habits however slight and of the usual theatre of their custom that this visit to marringhurst assumed quite the air of an adventure and seemed at first almost invested with the charm and novelty of travel  the surrounding country which though verdant was flat was well adapted to the limited exertions and still feeble footsteps of an invalid and venetia began to study botany with the doctor who indeed was not very profound in his attainments in this respect but knew quite enough to amuse his scholar by degrees also as her strength daily increased they extended their walks and at length she even mounted her pony and was fast recovering her elasticity both of body and mind there were also many pleasant books with which she was unacquainted a cabinet of classic coins prints and pictures she became too interested in the doctors rural pursuits would watch him with his angle and already meditated a revolution in his garden so time on the whole flew cheerfully on certainly without any weariness and the day seldom passed that they did not all congratulate themselves on the pleasant and profitable change  in the meantime venetia when alone still recurred to that idea that was now so firmly rooted in her mind that it was quite out of the power of any social discipline to divert her attention from it she was often the sole companion of the doctor and she had long resolved to seize a favourable opportunity to appeal to him on the subject of her father it so happened that she was walking alone with him one morning in the neighbourhood of marringhurst having gone to visit the remains of a roman encampment in the immediate vicinity when they had arrived at the spot and the doctor had delivered his usual lecture on the locality they sat down together on a mound that venetia might rest herself  were you ever in italy doctor masham said venetia  i never was out of my native country said the doctor i once indeed was about making the grand tour with a pupil of mine at oxford but circumstances interfered which changed his plans and so i remain a regular john bull  was my father at oxford said venetia quietly  he was replied the doctor looking confused  i should like to see oxford much said venetia  it is a most interesting seat of learning said the doctor quite delighted to change the subject whether we consider its antiquity its learning the influence it has exercised upon the history of the country its magnificent endowments its splendid buildings its great colleges libraries and museums or that it is one of the principal headquarters of all the hope of england our youth it is not too much to affirm that there is scarcely a spot on the face of the globe of equal interest and importance  it is not for its colleges or libraries or museums or all its splendid buildings observed venetia that i should wish to see it i wish to see it because my father was once there i should like to see a place where i was quite certain my father had been  still harping of her father thought the doctor to himself and growing uneasy yet from his very anxiety to turn the subject quite incapable of saying an appropriate word  do you remember my father at oxford doctor masham said venetia  yes no yes said the doctor rather colouring that he must have been there in my time i rather think  but you do not recollect him said venetia pressing question  why rejoined the doctor a little more collected when you remember that there are between two and three thousand young men at the university you must not consider it very surprising that i might not recollect your father  no said venetia perhaps not and yet i cannot help thinking that he must always have been a person who if once seen would not easily have been forgotten  here is an erica vagans said the doctor picking a flower it is rather uncommon about here and handing it at the same time to venetia  my father must have been very young when he died said venetia scarcely looking at the flower  yes your father was very young he replied  where did he die  i cannot answer that question  where was he buried  you know my dear young lady that the subject is too tender for any one to converse with your poor mother upon it it is not in my power to give you the information you desire be satisfied my dear miss herbert that a gracious providence has spared to you one parent and one so inestimable  i trust i know how to appreciate so great a blessing replied venetia but i should be sorry if the natural interest which all children must take in those who have given them birth should be looked upon as idle and unjustifiable curiosity  my dear young lady you misapprehend me  no doctor masham indeed i do not replied venetia with firmness i can easily conceive that the mention of my father may for various reasons be insupportable to my mother it is enough for me that i am convinced such is the case my lips are sealed to her for ever upon the subject but i cannot recognise the necessity of this constraint to others for a long time i was kept in ignorance whether i had a father or not i have discovered no matter how who he was i believe pardon me my dearest friend i cannot help believing that you were acquainted or at least that you know something of him and i entreat you yes repeated venetia with great emphasis laying her hand upon his arm and looking with earnestness in his face i entreat you by all your kind feelings to my mother and myself by all that friendship we so prize by the urgent solicitation of a daughter who is influenced in her curiosity by no light or unworthy feeling yes by all the claims of a child to information which ought not to be withheld from her tell me tell me all tell me something speak dr masham do speak  my dear young lady said the doctor with a glistening eye it is better that we should both be silent  no indeed replied venetia it is not better it is not well that we should be silent candour is a great virtue there is a charm a healthy charm in frankness why this mystery why these secrets have they worked good have they benefited us o my friend i would not say so to my mother i would not be tempted by any sufferings to pain for an instant her pure and affectionate heart but indeed doctor masham indeed indeed what i tell you is true all my late illness my present state all all are attributable but to one cause this mystery about my father  what can i tell you said the unhappy masham  tell me only one fact i ask no more yes i promise you solemnly i promise you i will ask no more tell me does he live  he does said the doctor venetia sank upon his shoulder  my dear young lady my darling young lady said the doctor she has fainted what can i do the unfortunate doctor placed venetia in a reclining posture and hurried to a brook that was nigh and brought water in his hand to sprinkle on her she revived she made a struggle to restore herself  it is nothing she said i am resolved to be well i am well i am myself again he lives my father lives i was confident of it i will ask no more i am true to my word o doctor masham you have always been my kind friend but you have never yet conferred on me a favour like the one you have just bestowed  but it is well said the doctor as you know so much that you should know more  yes yes  as we walk along he continued we will converse or at another time there is no lack of opportunity  no now now eagerly exclaimed venetia i am quite well it was not pain or illness that overcame me now let us walk now let us talk of these things he lives  i have little to add said dr masham after a moments thought but this however painful it is necessary for you to know that your father is unworthy of your mother utterly they are separated they never can be reunited  never said venetia  never replied dr masham and i now warn you if indeed as i cannot doubt you love your mother if her peace of mind and happiness are as i hesitate not to believe the principal objects of your life upon this subject with her be for ever silent seek to penetrate no mysteries spare all allusions banish if possible the idea of your father from your memory enough you know he lives we know no more your mother labours to forget him her only consolation for sorrows such as few women ever experienced is her child yourself your love now be no niggard with it cling to this unrivalled parent who has dedicated her life to you soothe her sufferings endeavour to make her share your happiness but of this be certain that if you raise up the name and memory of your father between your mother and yourself her life will be the forfeit  his name shall never pass my lips said venetia solemnly i vow it that his image shall be banished from my heart is too much to ask and more than it is in my power to grant but i am my mothers child i will exist only for her and if my love can console her she shall never be without solace i thank you doctor for all your kindness we will never talk again upon the subject yet believe me you have acted wisely you have done good     chapter xi   venetia observed her promise to doctor masham with strictness she never alluded to her father and his name never escaped her mothers lips whether doctor masham apprised lady annabel of the conversation that had taken place between himself and her daughter it is not in our power to mention the visit to marringhurst was not a short one it was a relief both to lady annabel and venetia after all that had occurred to enjoy the constant society of their friend and this change of life though apparently so slight proved highly beneficial to venetia she daily recovered her health and a degree of mental composure which she had not for some time enjoyed on the whole she was greatly satisfied with the discoveries which she had made she had ascertained the name and the existence of her father his very form and appearance were now no longer matter for conjecture and in a degree she had even communicated with him time she still believed would develope even further wonders she clung to an irresistible conviction that she should yet see him that he might even again be united to her mother she indulged in dreams as to his present pursuits and position she repeated to herself his verses and remembered his genius with pride and consolation  they returned to cherbury they resumed the accustomed tenour of their lives as if nothing had occurred to disturb it the fondness between the mother and her daughter was unbroken and undiminished they shared again the same studies and the same amusements lady annabel perhaps indulged the conviction that venetia had imbibed the belief that her father was no more and yet in truth that father was the sole idea on which her child ever brooded venetia had her secret now and often as she looked up at the windows of the uninhabited portion of the building she remembered with concealed but not less keen exultation that she had penetrated their mystery she could muse for hours over all that chamber had revealed to her and indulge in a thousand visions of which her father was the centre she was his own venetia thus he had hailed her at her birth and thus he might yet again acknowledge her if she could only ascertain where he existed what if she could and she were to communicate with him he must love her her heart assured her he must love her she could not believe if they were to meet that his breast could resist the silent appeal which the sight merely of his only child would suffice to make oh why had her parents parted what could have been his fault he was so young but a few few years older than herself when her mother must have seen him for the last time yes for the last time beheld that beautiful form and that countenance that seemed breathing only with genius and love he might have been imprudent rash violent but she would not credit for an instant that a stain could attach to the honour or the spirit of marmion herbert  the summer wore away one morning as lady annabel and venetia were sitting together mistress pauncefort bustled into the room with a countenance radiant with smiles and wonderment her ostensible business was to place upon the table a vase of flowers but it was evident that her presence was occasioned by affairs of far greater urgency the vase was safely deposited mistress pauncefort gave the last touch to the arrangement of the flowers she lingered about lady annabel at length she said i suppose you have heard the news my lady  indeed pauncefort i have not replied lady annabel what news  my lord is coming to the abbey  indeed  oh yes my lady said mistress pauncefort i am not at all surprised your ladyship should be so astonished never to write too well i must say he might have given us a line but he is coming i am certain sure of that my lady my lords gentleman has been down these two days and all his dogs and guns too my lady and the keeper is ordered to be quite ready my lady for the first i wonder if there is going to be a party i should not be at all surprised  plantagenet returned said lady annabel well i shall be very glad to see him again  so shall i my lady said mistress pauncefort but i dare say we shall hardly know him again he must be so grown trimmer has been over to the abbey my lady and saw my lords valet quite the fine gentleman trimmer says i was thinking of walking over myself this afternoon to see poor mrs quin my lady i dare say we might be of use and neighbours should be handy as they say she is a very respectable woman poor mrs quin and i am sure for my part if your ladyship has no objection i should be very glad to be of service to her  i have of course no objection pauncefort to your being of service to the housekeeper but has she required your assistance  why no my lady but poor mrs quin would hardly like to ask for anything my lady but i am sure we might be of very great use for my lords gentleman seems very dissatisfied at his reception trimmer says he has his hot breakfast every morning my lady and poor mrs quin says  well pauncefort that will do said lady annabel and the functionary disappeared  we have almost forgotten plantagenet venetia added lady annabel addressing herself to her daughter  he has forgotten us i think mamma said venetia  end of book ii     book iii     chapter i   five years had elapsed since lord cadurcis had quitted the seat of his fathers nor did the fair inhabitants of cherbury hear of his return without emotion although the intercourse between them during this interval had from the first been too slightly maintained and of late years had entirely died off his return was nevertheless an event which recalled old times and revived old associations his visit to the hall was looked forward to with interest he did not long keep his former friends in suspense for although he was not uninfluenced by some degree of embarrassment from the consciousness of neglect on his side rendered more keen now that he again found himself in the scene endeared by the remembrance of their kindness he was nevertheless both too well bred and too warmhearted to procrastinate the performance of a duty which the regulations of society and natural impulse alike assured him was indispensable on the very morning therefore after his arrival having sauntered awhile over the old abbey and strolled over the park mused over his mothers tomb with emotion not the less deep because there was no outward and visible sign of its influence he ordered his horses and directed his way through the accustomed woods to cherbury  five years had not passed away without their effects at least upon the exterior being of cadurcis although still a youth his appearance was manly a thoughtful air had become habitual to a countenance melancholy even in his childhood nor was its early promise of beauty unfulfilled although its expression was peculiar and less pleasing than impressive his long dark locks shaded a pale and lofty brow that well became a cast of features delicately moulded yet reserved and haughty and perhaps even somewhat scornful his figure had set into a form of remarkable slightness and elegance and distinguished for its symmetry altogether his general mien was calculated to attract attention and to excite interest  his vacations while at eton had been spent by lord cadurcis in the family of his noble guardian one of the kings ministers here he had been gradually initiated in the habits and manners of luxurious and refined society since he had quitted eton he had passed a season previous to his impending residence at cambridge in the same sphere the opportunities thus offered had not been lost upon a disposition which with all its native reserve was singularly susceptible cadurcis had quickly imbibed the tone and adopted the usages of the circle in which he moved naturally impatient of control he endeavoured by his precocious manhood to secure the respect and independence which would scarcely have been paid or permitted to his years from an early period he never permitted himself to be treated as a boy and his guardian a man whose whole soul was concentred in the world humoured a bent which he approved and from which he augured the most complete success attracted by the promising talents and the premature character of his ward he had spared more time to assist the development of his mind and the formation of his manners than might have been expected from a minister of state his hopes indeed rested with confidence on his youthful relative and he looked forward with no common emotion to the moment when he should have the honour of introducing to public life one calculated to confer so much credit on his tutor and shed so much lustre on his party the reader will therefore not be surprised if at this then unrivalled period of political excitement when the existence of our colonial empire was at stake cadurcis with his impetuous feelings had imbibed to their fullest extent all the plans prejudices and passions of his political connections he was indeed what the circumstances of the times and his extreme youth might well excuse if not justify a most violent partisan bold sanguine resolute and intolerant it was difficult to persuade him that any opinions could be just which were opposed to those of the circle in which he lived and out of that pale it must be owned he was as little inclined to recognise the existence of ability as of truth  as lord cadurcis slowly directed his way through the woods and park of cherbury past years recurred to him like a faint yet pleasing dream among these meads and bowers had glided away the only happy years of his boyhood the only period of his early life to which he could look back without disgust he recalled the secret exultation with which in company with his poor mother he had first repaired to cadurcis about to take possession of what to his inexperienced imagination then appeared a vast and noble inheritance and for the first time in his life to occupy a position not unworthy of his rank for how many domestic mortifications did the first sight of that old abbey compensate how often in pacing its venerable galleries and solemn cloisters and musing over the memory of an ancient and illustrious ancestry had he forgotten those bitter passages of daily existence so humbling to his vanity and so harassing to his heart ho had beheld that morn after an integral of many years the tomb of his mother that simple and solitary monument had revived and impressed upon him a conviction that too easily escaped in the various life and busy scenes in which he had since moved the conviction of his worldly desolation and utter loneliness he had no parents no relations now that he was for a moment free from the artificial life in which he had of late mingled he felt that he had no friends the image of his mother came back to him softened by the magical tint of years after all she was his mother and a deep sharer in all his joys and woes transported to the old haunts of his innocent and warmhearted childhood he sighed for a finer and a sweeter sympathy than was ever yielded by the roof which he had lately quitted a habitation but not a home he conjured up the picture of his guardian existing in a whirl of official bustle and social excitement a dreamy reminiscence of finer impulses stole over the heart of cadurcis the dazzling pageant of metropolitan splendour faded away before the bright scene of nature that surrounded him he felt the freshness of the fragrant breeze he gazed with admiration on the still and ancient woods and his pure and lively blood bubbled beneath the influence of the golden sunbeams before him rose the halls of cherbury that roof where he had been so happy that roof to which he had appeared so ungrateful the memory of a thousand acts of kindness of a thousand soft and soothing traits of affection recurred to him with a freshness which startled as much as it pleased him not to him only but to his mother that mother whose loss he had lived to deplore had the inmates of cherbury been ministering angels of peace and joy oh that indeed had been a home there indeed had been days of happiness there indeed he had found sympathy and solace and succour and now he was returning to them a stranger to fulfil one of the formal duties of society in paying them his cold respects an attention which he could scarcely have avoided offering had he been to them the merest acquaintance instead of having found within those walls a home not merely in words but friendship the most delicate and love the most pure a second parent and the only being whom he had ever styled sister  the sight of cadurcis became dim with emotion as the associations of old scenes and his impending interview with venetia brought back the past with a power which he had rarely experienced in the playingfields of eton or the saloons of london five years it was an awful chasm in their acquaintance  he despaired of reviving the kindness which had been broken by such a dreary interval and broken on his side so wilfully and yet he began to feel that unless met with that kindness he should be very miserable sooth to say he was not a little embarrassed and scarcely knew which contingency he most desired to meet or to escape from her he almost repented his return to cadurcis and yet to see venetia again he felt must be exquisite pleasure influenced by these feelings he arrived at the hall steps and so dismounting and giving his horse to his groom cadurcis with a palpitating heart and faltering hand formally rang the bell of that hall which in old days he entered at all seasons without ceremony  never perhaps did a man feel more nervous he grew pale paler even than usual and his whole frame trembled as the approaching footstep of the servant assured him the door was about to open he longed now that the family might not be at home that he might at least gain fourandtwenty hours to prepare himself but the family were at home and he was obliged to enter he stopped for a moment in the hall under the pretence of examining the old familiar scene but it was merely to collect himself for his sight was clouded spoke to the old servant to reassure himself by the sound of his own voice but the husky words seemed to stick in his throat ascended the staircase with tottering steps and leant against the banister as he heard his name announced the effort however must be made it was too late to recede and lord cadurcis entering the terraceroom extended his hand to lady annabel herbert she was not in the least changed but looked as beautiful and serene as usual her salutation though far from deficient in warmth was a little more dignified than that which plantagenet remembered but still her presence reassured him and while he pressed her hand with earnestness he contrived to murmur forth with pleasing emotion his delight at again meeting her strange to say in the absorbing agitation of the moment all thought of venetia had vanished and it was when he had turned and beheld a maiden of the most exquisite beauty that his vision had ever lighted on who had just risen from her seat and was at the moment saluting him that he entirely lost his presence of mind he turned scarlet was quite silent made an awkward bow and then stood perfectly fixed  my daughter said lady annabel slightly pointing to venetia will not you be seated  cadurcis fell into a chair in absolute confusion the rare and surpassing beauty of venetia his own stupidity his admiration of her his contempt for himself the sight of the old chamber the recollection of the past the minutest incidents of which seemed all suddenly to crowd upon his memory the painful consciousness of the revolution which had occurred in his position in the family proved by his first being obliged to be introduced to venetia and then being addressed so formally by his title by her mother all these impressions united overcame him he could not speak he sat silent and confounded and had it not been for the imperturbable selfcomposure and delicate and amiable consideration of lady annabel it would have been impossible for him to have remained in a room where he experienced agonising embarrassment  under cover however of a discharge of discreet inquiries as to when he arrived how long he meant to stay whether he found cadurcis altered and similar interrogations which required no extraordinary exertion of his lordships intellect to answer but to which he nevertheless contrived to give inconsistent and contradictory responses cadurcis in time recovered himself sufficiently to maintain a fair though not very brilliant conversation and even ventured occasionally to address an observation to venetia who was seated at her work perfectly composed but who replied to all his remarks with the same sweet voice and artless simplicity which had characterised her childhood though time and thought had by their blended influence perhaps somewhat deprived her of that wild grace and sparkling gaiety for which she was once so eminent  these great disenchanters of humanity if indeed they had stolen away some of the fascinating qualities of infancy had amply recompensed venetia herbert for the loss by the additional and commanding charms which they had conferred on her from a beautiful child she had expanded into a most beautiful woman she had now entirely recovered from her illness of which the only visible effect was the addition that it had made to her stature already slightly above the middle height but of exquisite symmetry like her mother she did not wear powder then usual in society but her auburn hair of the finest texture descended in long and luxuriant tresses far over her shoulders braided with ribands perfectly exposing her pellucid brow here and there tinted with an undulating vein for she had retained if possible with increased lustre the dazzling complexion of her infancy if the rose upon the cheek were less vivid than of yore the dimples were certainly more developed the clear grey eye was shadowed by long dark lashes and every smile and movement of those ruby lips revealed teeth exquisitely small and regular and fresh and brilliant as pearls just plucked by a diver  conversation proceeded and improved cadurcis became more easy and more fluent his memory which seemed suddenly to have returned to him with unusual vigour wonderfully served him there was scarcely an individual of whom he did not contrive to inquire from dr masham to mistress pauncefort he was resolved to show that if he had neglected he had at least not forgotten them nor did he exhibit the slightest indication of terminating his visit so that lady annabel aware that he was alone at the abbey and that he could have no engagement in the neighbourhood could not refrain from inviting him to remain and dine with them the invitation was accepted without hesitation in due course of time cadurcis attended the ladies in their walk it was a delightful stroll in the park though he felt some slight emotion when he found himself addressing venetia by the title of miss herbert when he had exhausted all the topics of local interest he had a great deal to say about himself in answer to the inquiries of lady annabel he spoke with so much feeling and simplicity of his first days at eton and the misery he experienced on first quitting cherbury that his details could not fail of being agreeable to those whose natural selfesteem they so agreeably mattered then he dwelt upon his casual acquaintance with london society and lady annabel was gratified to observe from many incidental observations that his principles were in every respect of the right tone and that he had zealously enlisted himself in the ranks of that national party who opposed themselves to the disorganising opinions then afloat he spoke of his impending residence at the university with the affectionate anticipations which might have been expected from a devoted child of the ancient and orthodox institutions of his country and seemed perfectly impressed with the responsible duties for which he was destined as an hereditary legislator of england on the whole his carriage and conversation afforded a delightful evidence of a pure and earnest and frank and gifted mind that had acquired at an early age much of the mature and fixed character of manhood without losing anything of that boyish sincerity and simplicity too often the penalty of experience  the dinner passed in pleasant conversation and if they were no longer familiar they were at least cordial cadurcis spoke of dr masham with affectionate respect and mentioned his intention of visiting marringhurst on the following day he ventured to hope that lady annabel and miss herbert might accompany him and it was arranged that his wish should be gratified the evening drew on apace and lady annabel was greatly pleased when lord cadurcis expressed his wish to remain for their evening prayers he was indeed sincerely religious and as he knelt in the old chapel that had been the hallowed scene of his boyish devotions he offered his ardent thanksgivings to his creator who had mercifully kept his soul pure and true and allowed him after so long an estrangement from the sweet spot of his childhood once more to mingle his supplications with his kind and virtuous friends  influenced by the solemn sounds still lingering in his ear cadurcis bade them farewell for the night with an earnestness of manner and depth of feeling which he would scarcely have ventured to exhibit at their first meeting good night dear lady annabel he said as he pressed her hand you know not how happy how grateful i feel to be once more at cherbury good night venetia  that last word lingered on his lips it was uttered in a tone at once mournful and sweet and her hand was unconsciously retained for a moment in his but for a moment and yet in that brief instant a thousand thoughts seemed to course through his brain  before venetia retired to rest she remained for a few minutes in her mothers room what do you think of him mamma she said is he not very changed  he is my love replied lady annabel what i sometimes thought he might what i always hoped he would be  he really seemed happy to meet us again and yet how strange that for years he should never have communicated with us  not so very strange my love he was but a child when we parted and he has felt embarrassment in resuming connections which for a long interval had been inevitably severed remember what a change his life had to endure few after such an interval would have returned with feelings so kind and so pure  he was always a favourite of yours mamma  i always fancied that i observed in him the seeds of great virtues and great talents but i was not so sanguine that they would have flourished as they appear to have done  in the meantime the subject of their observations strolled home on foot for he had dismissed his horses to the abbey it was a brilliant night and the white beams of the moon fell full upon the old monastic pile of which massy portions were in dark shade while the light gracefully rested on the projecting ornaments of the building and played as it were with the fretted and fantastic pinnacles behind were the savage hills softened by the hour and on the right extended the still and luminous lake cadurcis rested for a moment and gazed upon the fair yet solemn scene the dreams of ambition that occasionally distracted him were dead the surrounding scene harmonised with the thoughts of purity repose and beauty that filled his soul why should he ever leave this spot sacred to him by the finest emotions of his nature why should he not at once quit that world which he had just entered while he could quit it without remorse if ever there existed a being who was his own master who might mould his destiny at his will it seemed to be cadurcis his lone yet independent situation his impetuous yet firm volition alike qualified him to achieve the career most grateful to his disposition let him then achieve it here here let him find that solitude he had ever loved softened by that affection for which he had ever sighed and which here only he had ever found it seemed to him that there was only one being in the world whom he had ever loved and that was venetia herbert it seemed to him that there was only one thing in this world worth living for and that was the enjoyment of her sweet heart the pureminded the rare the gracious creature why should she ever quit these immaculate bowers wherein she had been so mystically and delicately bred why should she ever quit the fond roof of cherbury but to shed grace and love amid the cloisters of cadurcis her life hitherto had been an enchanted tale why should the spell ever break why should she enter that world where care disappointment mortification misery must await her he for a season had left the magic circle of her life and perhaps it was well he was a man and so he should know all but he had returned thank heaven he had returned and never again would he quit her fool that he had been ever to have neglected her and for a reason that ought to have made him doubly her friend her solace her protector oh to think of the sneers or the taunts of the world calling for a moment the colour from that bright cheek or dusking for an instant the radiance of that brilliant eye his heart ached at the thought of her unhappiness and he longed to press her to it and cherish her like some innocent dove that had flown from the terrors of a pursuing hawk     chapter ii   well pauncefort said lord cadurcis smiling as he renewed his acquaintance with his old friend i hope you have not forgotten my last words and have taken care of your young lady  oh dear my lord said mistress pauncefort blushing and simpering well to be sure how your lordship has surprised us all i thought we were never going to see you again  you know i told you i should return and now i mean never to leave you again  never is a long word my lord said mistress pauncefort looking very archly  ah but i mean to settle regularly to settle here said lord cadurcis  marry and settle my lord said mistress pauncefort still more arch  and why not inquired lord cadurcis laughing  that is just what i said last night exclaimed mistress pauncefort eagerly and why not for i said says i his lordship must marry sooner or later and the sooner the better say i and to be sure he is very young but what of that for says i no one can say he does not look quite a man and really my lord saving your presence you are grown indeed  pish said lord cadurcis turning away and laughing i have left off growing pauncefort and all those sort of things  you have not forgotten our last visit to marringhurst said lord cadurcis to venetia as the comfortable mansion of the worthy doctor appeared in sight  i have forgotten nothing replied venetia with a faint smile i do not know what it is to forget my life has been so uneventful that every past incident however slight is as fresh in my memory as if it occurred yesterday  then you remember the strawberries and cream said lord cadurcis  and other circumstances less agreeable he fancied venetia observed but her voice was low  do you know lady annabel said lord cadurcis that i was very nearly riding my pony today i wish to bring back old times with the utmost possible completeness i wish for a moment to believe that i have never quitted cherbury  let us think only of the present now said lady annabel in a cheerful voice for it is very agreeable i see the good doctor he has discovered us  i wonder whom he fancies lord cadurcis to be said venetia  have you no occasional cavalier for whom at a distance i may be mistaken inquired his lordship in a tone of affected carelessness though in truth it was an inquiry that he made not without anxiety  everything remains here exactly as you left it replied lady annabel with some quickness yet in a lively tone  happy cherbury exclaimed lord cadurcis may it indeed never change  they rode briskly on the doctor was standing at his gate he saluted lady annabel and venetia with his accustomed cordiality and then stared at their companion as if waiting for an introduction  you forget an old friend my dear doctor said cadurcis  lord cadurcis exclaimed dr masham his lordship had by this time dismounted and eagerly extended his hand to his old tutor  having quitted their horses they all entered the house nor was there naturally any want of conversation cadurcis had much information to give and many questions to answer he was in the highest spirits and the most amiable mood gay amusing and overflowing with kindheartedness the doctor seldom required any inspiration to be joyous and lady annabel was unusually animated venetia alone though cheerful was calmer than pleased cadurcis time he sorrowfully observed had occasioned a greater change in her manner than he could have expected youthful as she still was indeed but on the threshold of womanhood and exempted as it seemed she had been from anything to disturb the clearness of her mind that enchanting play of fancy which had once characterised her and which he recalled with a sigh appeared in a great degree to have deserted her he watched her countenance with emotion and supremely beautiful as it undeniably was there was a cast of thoughtfulness or suffering impressed upon the features which rendered him mournful he knew not why and caused him to feel as if a cloud had stolen unexpectedly over the sun and made him shiver  but there was no time or opportunity for sad reflections he had to renew his acquaintance with all the sights and curiosities of the rectory to sing to the canaries and visit the gold fish admire the stuffed fox and wonder that in the space of five years the voracious otter had not yet contrived to devour its prey then they refreshed themselves after their ride with a stroll in the doctors garden cadurcis persisted in attaching himself to venetia as in old days and nothing would prevent him from leading her to the grotto lady annabel walked behind leaning on the doctors arm narrating with no fear of being heard all the history of their friends return  i never was so surprised in my life said the doctor he is vastly improved he is quite a man his carriage is very finished  and his principles said lady annabel you have no idea my dear doctor how right his opinions seem to be on every subject he has been brought up in a good school he does his guardian great credit he is quite loyal and orthodox in all his opinions ready to risk his life for our blessed constitution in church and state he requested as a favour that he might remain at our prayers last night it is delightful for me to see him turn out so well  in the meantime cadurcis and venetia entered the grotto  the dear doctor said cadurcis five years have brought no visible change even to him perhaps he may be a degree less agile but i will not believe it and lady annabel it seems to me your mother is more youthful and beautiful than ever there is a spell in our air continued his lordship with a laughing eye for if we have changed venetia ours is at least an alteration that bears no sign of decay we are advancing but they have not declined we are all enchanted  i feel changed said venetia gravely  i left you a child and i find you a woman said lord cadurcis a change which who can regret  i would i were a child again said venetia  we were happy said lord cadurcis in a thoughtful tone and then in an inquiring voice he added and so we are now  venetia shook her head  can you be unhappy  to be unhappy would be wicked said venetia but my mind has lost its spring  ah say not so venetia or you will make even me gloomy i am happy positively happy there must not be a cloud upon your brow  you are joyous said venetia because you are excited it is the novelty of return that animates you it will wear off you will grow weary and when you go to the university you will think yourself happy again  i do not intend to go to the university said cadurcis  i understood from you that you were going there immediately  my plans are changed said cadurcis i do not intend ever to leave home again  when you go to cambridge said dr masham who just then reached them i shall trouble you with a letter to an old friend of mine whose acquaintance you may find valuable  venetia smiled cadurcis bowed expressed his thanks and muttered something about talking over the subject with the doctor  after this the conversation became general and at length they all returned to the house to partake of the doctors hospitality who promised to dine at the hall on the morrow the ride home was agreeable and animated but the conversation on the part of the ladies was principally maintained by lady annabel who seemed every moment more delighted with the society of lord cadurcis and to sympathise every instant more completely with his frank exposition of his opinions on all subjects when they returned to cherbury cadurcis remained with them as a matter of course an invitation was neither expected nor given not an allusion was made to the sports of the field to enjoy which was the original purpose of his visit to the abbey and he spoke of tomorrow as of a period which as usual was to be spent entirely in their society he remained with them as on the previous night to the latest possible moment although reserved in society no one could be more fluent with those with whom he was perfectly unembarrassed he was indeed exceedingly entertaining and lady annabel relaxed into conversation beyond her custom as for venetia she did not speak often but she listened with interest and was evidently amused when cadurcis bade them goodnight lady annabel begged him to breakfast with them while venetia serene though kind neither seconded the invitation nor seemed interested one way or the other in its result     chapter iii   except returning to sleep at the abbey lord cadurcis was now as much an habitual inmate of cherbury hall as in the days of his childhood he was there almost with the lark and never quitted its roof until its inmates were about to retire for the night his guns and dogs which had been sent down from london with so much pomp of preparation were unused and unnoticed and he passed his days in reading richardsons novels which he had brought with him from town to the ladies and then in riding with them about the country for he loved to visit all his old haunts and trace even the very green sward where he first met the gipsies and fancied that he had achieved his emancipation from all the coming cares and annoyances of the world in this pleasant life several weeks had glided away cadurcis had entirely resumed his old footing in the family nor did he attempt to conceal the homage he was paying to the charms of venetia she indeed seemed utterly unconscious that such projects had entered or indeed could enter the brain of her old playfellow with whom now that she was habituated to his presence and revived by his inspiriting society she had resumed all her old familiar intimacy addressing him by his christian name as if he had never ceased to be her brother but lady annabel was not so blind as her daughter and had indeed her vision been as clouded her faithful minister mistress pauncefort would have taken care quickly to couch it for a very short time had elapsed before that vigilant gentlewoman resolved to convince her mistress that nothing could escape her sleepless scrutiny and that it was equally in vain for her mistress to hope to possess any secrets without her participation seized a convenient opportunity before she bid her lady good night just to inquire when it might be expected to take place and in reply to the very evident astonishment which lady annabel testified at this question and the expression of her extreme displeasure at any conversation on a circumstance for which there was not the slightest foundation mistress pauncefort after duly flouncing about with every possible symbol of pettish agitation and mortified curiosity her cheek pale with hesitating impertinence and her nose quivering with inquisitiveness condescended to admit with a sceptical sneer that of course no doubt her ladyship knew more of such a subject than she could it was not her place to know anything of such business for her part she said nothing it was not her place but if it were she certainly must say that she could not help believing that my lord was looking remarkably sweet on miss venetia and what was more everybody in the house thought the same though for her part whenever they mentioned the circumstance to her she said nothing or bid them hold their tongues for what was it to them it was not their business and they could know nothing and that nothing would displease her ladyship more than chattering on such subjects and manys the match as good as finished thats gone off by no worse means than the chitterchatter of those who should hold their tongues therefore she should say no more but if her ladyship wished her to contradict it why she could and the sooner perhaps the better  lady annabel observed to her that she wished no such thing but she desired that pauncefort would make no more observations on the subject either to her or to any one else and then pauncefort bade her ladyship good night in a huff catching up her candle with a rather impertinent jerk and gently slamming the door as if she had meant to close it quietly only it had escaped out of her fingers  whatever might be the tone whether of surprise or displeasure which lady annabel thought fit to assume to her attendant on her noticing lord cadurcis attentions to her daughter there is no doubt that his conduct had early and long engaged her ladyships remark her consideration and her approval without meditating indeed an immediate union between cadurcis and venetia lady annabel pleased herself with the prospect of her daughters eventual marriage with one whom she had known so early and so intimately who was by nature of a gentle sincere and affectionate disposition and in whom education had carefully instilled the most sound and laudable principles and opinions one apparently with simple tastes moderate desires fair talents a mind intelligent if not brilliant and passions which at the worst had been rather illregulated than violent attached also to venetia from her childhood and always visibly affected by her influence all these moral considerations seemed to offer a fair security for happiness and the material ones were neither less promising nor altogether disregarded by the mother it was an union which would join broad lands and fair estates which would place on the brow of her daughter one of the most ancient coronets in england and which indeed was the chief of these considerations would without exposing venetia to that contaminating contact with the world from which lady annabel recoiled establish her without this initiatory and sorrowful experience in a position superior to which even the blood of the herberts though it might flow in so fair and gifted a form as that of venetia need not aspire  lord cadurcis had not returned to cherbury a week before this scheme entered into the head of lady annabel she had always liked him had always given him credit for good qualities had always believed that his early defects were the consequence of his mothers injudicious treatment and that at heart he was an amiable generous and trustworthy being one who might be depended on with a naturally good judgment and substantial and sufficient talents which only required cultivation when she met him again after so long an interval and found her early prognostics so fairly so completely fulfilled and watched his conduct and conversation exhibiting alike a wellinformed mind an obliging temper and what lady annabel valued even above all gifts and blessings a profound conviction of the truth of all her own opinions moral political and religious she was quite charmed she was moved to unusual animation she grew excited in his praise his presence delighted her she entertained for him the warmest affection and reposed in him unbounded confidence all her hopes became concentred in the wish of seeing him her soninlaw and she detected with lively satisfaction the immediate impression which venetia had made upon his heart for indeed it should not be forgotten that although lady annabel was still young and although her frame and temperament were alike promising of a long life it was natural when she reflected upon the otherwise lone condition of her daughter that she should tremble at the thought of quitting this world without leaving her child a protector to doctor masham from whom lady annabel had no secrets she confided in time these happy but covert hopes and he was not less anxious than herself for their fulfilment since the return of cadurcis the doctor contrived to be a more frequent visitor at the hall than usual and he lost no opportunity of silently advancing the object of his friend  as for cadurcis himself it was impossible for him not quickly to discover that no obstacle to his hearts dearest wish would arise on the part of the parent the demeanour of the daughter somewhat more perplexed him venetia indeed had entirely fallen into her old habits of intimacy and frankness with plantagenet she was as affectionate and as unembarrassed as in former days and almost as gay for his presence and companionship had in a great degree insensibly removed that stillness and gravity which had gradually influenced her mind and conduct but in that conduct there was and he observed it with some degree of mortification a total absence of the consciousness of being the object of the passionate admiration of another she treated lord cadurcis as a brother she much loved who had returned to his home after a long absence she liked to listen to his conversation to hear of his adventures to consult over his plans his arrival called a smile to her face and his departure for the night was always alleviated by some allusion to their meeting on the morrow but many an ardent gaze on the part of cadurcis and many a phrase of emotion passed unnoticed and unappreciated his gallantry was entirely thrown away or if observed only occasioned a pretty stare at the unnecessary trouble he gave himself or the strange ceremony which she supposed an acquaintance with society had taught him cadurcis attributed this reception of his veiled and delicate overtures to her ignorance of the world and though he sighed for as passionate a return to his strong feelings as the sentiments which animated himself he was on the whole not displeased but rather interested by these indications of a pure and unsophisticated spirit     chapter iv   cadurcis had proposed and lady annabel had seconded the proposition with eager satisfaction that they should seek some day at the abbey whatever hospitality it might offer dr masham was to be of the party which was indeed one of those fanciful expeditions where the same companions though they meet at all times without restraint and with every convenience of life seek increased amusement in the novelty of a slight change of habits with the aid of the neighbouring town of southport cadurcis had made preparations for his friends not entirely unworthy of them though he affected to the last all the air of a conductor of a wild expedition of discovery and laughingly impressed upon them the necessity of steeling their minds and bodies to the experience and endurance of the roughest treatment and the most severe hardships  the morning of this eventful day broke as beautifully as the preceding ones autumn had seldom been more gorgeous than this year although he was to play the host cadurcis would not deprive himself of his usual visit to the hall and he appeared there at an early hour to accompany his guests who were to ride over to the abbey to husband all their energies for their long rambles through the demesne  cadurcis was in high spirits and lady annabel scarcely less joyous venetia smiled with her usual sweetness and serenity they congratulated each other on the charming season and mistress pauncefort received a formal invitation to join the party and go anutting with one of her fellowservants and his lordships valet the good doctor was rather late but he arrived at last on his stout steed in his accustomed cheerful mood here was a party of pleasure which all agreed must be pleasant no strangers to amuse or to be amusing but formed merely of four human beings who spent every day of their lives in each others society between whom there was the most complete sympathy and the most cordial goodwill  by noon they were all mounted on their steeds and though the air was warmed by a meridian sun shining in a clear sky there was a gentle breeze abroad sweet and grateful and moreover they soon entered the wood and enjoyed the shelter of its verdant shade the abbey looked most picturesque when they first burst upon it the nearer and wooded hills which formed its immediate background just tinted by the golden pencil of autumn while the meads of the valley were still emerald green and the stream now lost now winding glittered here and there in the sun and gave a life and sprightliness to the landscape which exceeded even the effect of the more distant and expansive lake  they were received at the abbey by mistress pauncefort who had preceded them and who welcomed them with a complacent smile cadurcis hastened to assist lady annabel to dismount and was a little confused but very pleased when she assured him she needed no assistance but requested him to take care of venetia he was just in time to receive her in his arms where she found herself without the slightest embarrassment the coolness of the cloisters was grateful after their ride and they lingered and looked upon the old fountain and felt the freshness of its fall with satisfaction which all alike expressed lady annabel and venetia then retired for a while to free themselves from their riding habits and cadurcis affectionately taking the arm of dr masham led him a few paces and then almost involuntarily exclaimed my dear doctor i think i am the happiest fellow that ever lived  that i trust you may always be my dear boy said dr masham but what has called forth this particular exclamation  to feel that i am once more at cadurcis to feel that i am here once more with you all to feel that i never shall leave you again  not again  never said cadurcis the experience of these last few weeks which yet have seemed an age in my existence has made me resolve never to quit a society where i am persuaded i may obtain a degree of happiness which what is called the world can never afford me  what will your guardian say  what care i  a dutiful ward  poh the relations between us were formed only to secure my welfare it is secured it will be secured by my own resolution  and what is that inquired dr masham  to marry venetia if she will accept me  and that you do not doubt  we doubt everything when everything is at stake replied lord cadurcis i know that her consent would ensure my happiness and when i reflect i cannot help being equally persuaded that it would secure hers her mother i think would not be adverse to our union and you my dear sir what do you think  i think said dr masham that whoever marries venetia will marry the most beautiful and the most gifted of gods creatures i hope you may marry her i wish you to marry her i believe you will marry her but not yet you are too young lord cadurcis  oh no my dear doctor not too young to marry venetia remember i have known her all my life at least so long as i have been able to form an opinion how few are the men my dear doctor who are so fortunate as to unite themselves with women whom they have known as i have known venetia for more than seven long years  during five of which you have never seen or heard of her  mine was the fault and yet i cannot help thinking as it may probably turn out as you yourself believe it will turn out that it is as well that we have been separated for this interval it has afforded me opportunities for observation which i should never have enjoyed at cadurcis and although my lot either way could not have altered the nature of things i might have been discontented i might have sighed for a world which now i do not value it is true i have not seen venetia for five years but i find her the same or changed only by nature and fulfilling all the rich promise which her childhood intimated no my dear doctor i respect your opinion more than that of any man living but nobody nothing can persuade me that i am not as intimately acquainted with venetias character with all her rare virtues as if we had never separated  i do not doubt it said the doctor high as you may pitch your estimate you cannot overvalue her  then why should we not marry  because my dear friend although you may be perfectly acquainted with venetia you cannot be perfectly acquainted with yourself  how so exclaimed lord cadurcis in a tone of surprise perhaps a little indignant  because it is impossible no young man of eighteen ever possessed such precious knowledge i esteem and admire you i give you every credit for a good heart and a sound head but it is impossible at your time of life that your character can be formed and until it be you may marry venetia and yet be a very miserable man  it is formed said his lordship firmly there is not a subject important to a human being on which my opinions are not settled  you may live to change them all said the doctor and that very speedily  impossible said lord cadurcis my dear doctor i cannot understand you you say that you hope that you wish even that you believe that i shall marry venetia and yet you permit me to infer that our union will only make us miserable what do you wish me to do  go to college for a term or two  without venetia i should die  well if you be in a dying state you can return  you joke my dear doctor  my dear boy i am perfectly serious  but she may marry somebody else  i am your only rival said the doctor with a smile and though even friends can scarcely be trusted under such circumstances i promise you not to betray you  your advice is not very pleasant said his lordship  good advice seldom is said the doctor  my dear doctor i have made up my mind to marry her and marry her at once i know her well you admit that yourself i do not believe that there ever was a woman like her that there ever will be a woman like her nature has marked her out from other women and her education has not been less peculiar her mystic breeding pleases me it is something to marry a wife so fair so pure so refined so accomplished who is nevertheless perfectly ignorant of the world i have dreamt of such things i have paced these old cloisters when a boy and when i was miserable at home and i have had visions and this was one i have sighed to live alone with a fair spirit for my minister venetia has descended from heaven for me and for me alone i am resolved i will pluck this flower with the dew upon its leaves  i did not know i was reasoning with a poet said the doctor with a smile had i been conscious of it i would not have been so rash  i have not a grain of poetry in my composition said his lordship i never could write a verse i was notorious at eton for begging all their old manuscripts from boys when they left school to crib from but i have a heart and i can feel i love venetia i have always loved her and if possible i will marry her and marry her at once     chapter v   the reappearance of the ladies at the end of the cloister terminated this conversation the result of which was rather to confirm lord cadurcis in his resolution of instantly urging his suit than the reverse he ran forward to greet his friends with a smile and took his place by the side of venetia whom a little to her surprise he congratulated in glowing phrase on her charming costume indeed she looked very captivating with a pastoral hat then much in fashion and a dress as simple and as sylvan both showing to admirable advantage her long descending hair and her agile and springy figure  cadurcis proposed that they should ramble over the abbey he talked of projected alterations as if he really had the power immediately to effect them and was desirous of obtaining their opinions before any change was made so they ascended the staircase which many years before venetia had mounted for the first time with her mother and entered that series of small and illfurnished rooms in which mrs cadurcis had principally resided and which had undergone no change the old pictures were examined these all agreed never must move and the new furniture it was settled must be in character with the building lady annabel entered into all the details with an interest and animation which rather amused dr masham venetia listened and suggested and responded to the frequent appeals of cadurcis to her judgment with an unconscious equanimity not less diverting  now here we really can do something said his lordship as they entered the saloon or rather refectory here i think we may effect wonders the tapestry must always remain is it not magnificent venetia but what hangings shall we have we must keep the old chairs i think do you approve of the old chairs venetia and what shall we cover them with shall it be damask what do you think venetia do you like damask and what colour shall it be shall it be crimson shall it be crimson damask lady annabel do you think venetia would like crimson damask now venetia do give us the benefit of your opinion  then they entered the old gallery here was to be a great transformation marvels were to be effected in the old gallery and many and multiplied were the appeals to the taste and fancy of venetia  i think said lord cadurcis i shall leave the gallery to be arranged when i am settled the rooms and the saloon shall be done at once i shall give orders for them to begin instantly whom do you recommend lady annabel do you think there is any person at southport who could manage to do it superintended by our taste venetia what do you think  venetia was standing at the window rather apart from her companions looking at the old garden lord cadurcis joined her ah it has been sadly neglected since my poor mothers time we could not do much in those days but still she loved this garden i must depend upon you entirely to arrange my garden venetia this spot is sacred to you you have not forgotten our labours here have you venetia ah those were happy days and these shall be more happy still this is your garden it shall always be called venetias garden  i would have taken care of it when you were away but  but what inquired lord cadurcis anxiously  we hardly felt authorised replied venetia calmly we came at first when you left cadurcis but at last it did not seem that our presence was very acceptable  the brutes exclaimed lord cadurcis  no no good simple people they were unused to orders from strange masters and they were perplexed besides we had no right to interfere  no right to interfere venetia my little fellowlabourer no right to interfere why all is yours fancy your having no right to interfere at cadurcis  then they proceeded to the park and wandered to the margin of the lake there was not a spot not an object which did not recall some adventure or incident of childhood every moment lord cadurcis exclaimed venetia do you remember this venetia have you forgotten that and every time venetia smiled and proved how faithful was her memory by adding some little unmentioned trait to the lively reminiscences of her companion  well after all said lord cadurcis with a sigh my poor mother was a strange woman and god bless her used sometimes to worry me out of my senses but still she always loved you no one can deny that cherbury was a magic name with her she loved lady annabel and she loved you venetia it ran in the blood you see she would be happy quite happy if she saw us all here together and if she knew  plantagenet said lady annabel you must build a lodge at this end of the park i cannot conceive anything more effective than an entrance from the southport road in this quarter  certainly lady annabel certainly we must build a lodge do not you think so venetia  indeed i think it would be a great improvement replied venetia but you must take care to have a lodge in character with the abbey  you shall make a drawing for it said lord cadurcis it shall be built directly and it shall be called venetia lodge  the hours flew away loitering in the park roaming in the woods they met mistress pauncefort and her friends loaded with plunder and they offered to venetia a trophy of their success but when venetia merely to please their kind hearts accepted their tribute with cordiality and declared there was nothing she liked better lord cadurcis would not be satisfied unless he immediately commenced nutting and each moment he bore to venetia the produce of his sport till in time she could scarcely sustain the rich and increasing burden at length they bent their steps towards home sufficiently wearied to look forward with welcome to rest and their repast yet not fatigued and exhilarated by the atmosphere for the sun was now in its decline though in this favoured season there were yet hours enough remaining of enchanting light  in the refectory they found to the surprise of all but their host a banquet it was just one of those occasions when nothing is expected and everything is welcome and surprising when from the unpremeditated air generally assumed all preparation startles and pleases when even ladies are not ashamed to eat and formality appears quite banished game of all kinds teal from the lake and piles of beautiful fruit made the table alike tempting and picturesque then there were stray bottles of rare wine disinterred from venerable cellars and more inspiriting even than the choice wine a host under the influence of every emotion and swayed by every circumstance that can make a man happy and delightful oh they were very gay and it seemed difficult to believe that care or sorrow or the dominion of dark or ungracious passions could ever disturb sympathies so complete and countenances so radiant  at the urgent request of cadurcis venetia sang to them and while she sang the expression of her countenance and voice harmonising with the arch hilarity of the subject plantagenet for a moment believed that he beheld the little venetia of his youth that sunny child so full of mirth and grace the very recollection of whose lively and bright existence might enliven the gloomiest hour and lighten the heaviest heart  enchanted by all that surrounded him full of hope and joy and plans of future felicity emboldened by the kindness of the daughter cadurcis now ventured to urge a request to lady annabel and the request was granted for all seemed to feel that it was a day on which nothing was to be refused to their friend happy cadurcis the child had a holiday and it fancied itself a man enjoying a triumph in compliance therefore with his wish it was settled that they should all walk back to the hall even dr masham declared he was competent to the exertion but perhaps was half entrapped into the declaration by the promise of a bed at cherbury this consent enchanted cadurcis who looked forward with exquisite pleasure to the evening walk with venetia     chapter vi   although the sun had not set it had sunk behind the hills leading to cherbury when our friends quitted the abbey cadurcis without hesitation offered his arm to venetia and whether from a secret sympathy with his wishes or merely from some fortunate accident lady annabel and dr masham strolled on before without busying themselves too earnestly with their companions  and how do you think our expedition to cadurcis has turned out inquired the young lord of venetia has it been successful  it has been one of the most agreeable days i ever passed was the reply  then it has been successful rejoined his lordship for my only wish was to amuse you  i think we have all been equally amused said venetia i never knew mamma in such good spirits i think ever since you returned she has been unusually lighthearted  and you has my return lightened only her heart venetia  indeed it has contributed to the happiness of every one  and yet when i first returned i heard you utter a complaint the first that to my knowledge ever escaped your lips  ah we cannot be always equally gay  once you were dear venetia  i was a child then  and i i too was a child yet i am happy at least now that i am with you  well we are both happy now  oh say that again say that again venetia for indeed you made me miserable when you told me that you had changed i cannot bear that you venetia should ever change  it is the course of nature plantagenet we all change everything changes this day that was so bright is changing fast  the stars are as beautiful as the sun venetia  and what do you infer  that venetia a woman is as beautiful as venetia a little girl and should be as happy  is beauty happiness plantagenet  it makes others happy venetia and when we make others happy we should be happy ourselves  few depend upon my influence and i trust all of them are happy  no one depends upon your influence more than i do  well then be happy always  would that i might ah venetia can i ever forget old days you were the solace of my dark childhood you were the charm that first taught me existence was enjoyment before i came to cherbury i never was happy and since that hourah venetia dear dearest venetia who is like to you  dear plantagenet you were always too kind to me would we were children once more  nay my own venetia you tell me everything changes and we must not murmur at the course of nature i would not have our childhood back again even with all its joys for there are others yet in store for us not less pure not less beautiful we loved each other then venetia and we love each other now  my feelings towards you have never changed plantagenet i heard of you always with interest and i met you again with heartfelt pleasure  oh that morning have you forgotten that morning do you know you will smile very much but i really believe that i expected to see my venetia still a little girl the very same who greeted me when i first arrived with my mother and behaved so naughtily and when i saw you and found what you had become and what i ought always to have known you must become i was so confused i entirely lost my presence of mind you must have thought me very awkward very stupid  indeed i was rather gratified by observing that you could not meet us again without emotion i thought it told well for your heart which i always believed to be most kind at least i am sure to us  kind oh venetia that word but ill describes what my heart ever was what it now is to you venetia dearest sweetest venetia can you doubt for a moment my feelings towards your home and what influence must principally impel them am i so dull or you so blind venetia can i not express can you not discover how much how ardently how fondly how devotedly i i i love you  i am sure we always loved each other plantagenet  yes but not with this love not as i love you now  venetia stared  i thought we could not love each other more than we did plantagenet at length she said do you remember the jewel that you gave me i always wore it until you seemed to forget us and then i thought it looked so foolish you remember what is inscribed on it to venetia from her affectionate brother plantagenet and as a brother i always loved you had i indeed been your sister i could not have loved you more warmly and more truly  i am not your brother venetia i wish not to be loved as a brother and yet i must be loved by you or i shall die  what then do you wish inquired venetia with great simplicity  i wish you to marry me replied lord cadurcis  marry exclaimed venetia with a face of wonder marry marry you marry you plantagenet  ay is that so wonderful i love you and if you love me why should we not marry  venetia was silent and looked upon the ground not from agitation for she was quite calm but in thought and then she said i never thought of marriage in my life plantagenet i have no intention no wish to marry i mean to live always with mamma  and you shall always live with mamma but that need not prevent you from marrying me he replied do not we all live together now what will it signify if you dwell at cadurcis and lady annabel at cherbury is it not one home but at any rate this point shall not be an obstacle for if it please you we will all live at cherbury  you say that we are happy now plantagenet oh let us remain as we are  my own sweet girl my sister if you please any title so it be one of fondness your sweet simplicity charms me but believe me it cannot be as you wish we cannot remain as we are unless we marry  why not  because i shall be wretched and must live elsewhere if indeed i can live at all  oh plantagenet indeed i thought you were my brother when i found you after so long a separation as kind as in old days and kinder still i was so glad i was so sure you loved me i thought i had the kindest brother in the world let us not talk of any other love it will indeed it will make mamma so miserable  i am greatly mistaken replied lord cadurcis who saw no obstacles to his hopes in their conversation hitherto if on the contrary our union would not prove far from disagreeable to your mother venetia i will say our mother for indeed to me she has been one  plantagenet said venetia in a very earnest tone i love you very much but if you love me press me on this subject no more at present you have surprised indeed you have bewildered me there are thoughts there are feelings there are considerations that must be respected that must influence me nay do not look so sorrowful plantagenet let us be happy now tomorrow only tomorrow and tomorrow we are sure to meet we will speak further of all this but now now for a moment let us forget it if we can forget anything so strange nay you shall smile  he did who could resist that mild and winning glance and indeed lord cadurcis was scarcely disappointed and not at all mortified at his reception or as he esteemed it the progress of his suit the conduct of venetia he attributed entirely to her unsophisticated nature and the timidity of a virgin soul it made him prize even more dearly the treasure that he believed awaited him silent then though for a time they both struggled to speak on different subjects silent and almost content cadurcis proceeded with the arm of venetia locked in his and ever and anon unconsciously pressing it to his heart the rosy twilight had faded away the stars were stealing forth and the moon again glittered with a soul softer than the tinted shades of eve and glowing like the heavens cadurcis joined his companions as they entered the gardens of cherbury when they had arrived at home it seemed that exhaustion had suddenly succeeded all the excitement of the day the doctor who was wearied retired immediately lady annabel pressed cadurcis to remain and take tea or at least to ride home but his lordship protesting that he was not in the slightest degree fatigued and anticipating their speedy union on the morrow bade her good night and pressing with fondness the hand of venetia retraced his steps to the now solitary abbey     chapter vii   cadurcis returned to the abbey but not to slumber that love of loneliness which had haunted him from his boyhood and which ever asserted its sway when under the influence of his passions came over him now with irresistible power a day of enjoyment had terminated and it left him melancholy hour after hour he paced the moonlit cloisters of his abbey where not a sound disturbed him save the monotonous fall of the fountain that seems by some inexplicable association always to blend with and never to disturb our feelings gay when we are joyful and sad amid our sorrow  yet was he sorrowful he was gloomy and fell into a reverie about himself a subject to him ever perplexing and distressing his conversation of the morning with doctor masham recurred to him what did the doctor mean by his character not being formed and that he might yet live to change all his opinions character what was character it must be will and his will was violent and firm young as he was he had early habituated himself to reflection and the result of his musings had been a desire to live away from the world with those he loved the world as other men viewed it had no charms for him its pursuits and passions seemed to him on the whole paltry and faint he could sympathise with great deeds but not with bustling life that which was common did not please him he loved things that were rare and strange and the spell that bound him so strongly to venetia herbert was her unusual life and the singular circumstances of her destiny that were not unknown to him true he was young but lord of himself youth was associated with none of those mortifications which make the juvenile pant for manhood cadurcis valued his youth and treasured it he could not conceive love and the romantic life that love should lead without the circumambient charm of youth adding fresh lustre to all that was bright and fair and a keener relish to every combination of enjoyment the moonbeam fell upon his mothers monument a tablet on the cloister wall that recorded the birth and death of katherine cadurcis his thoughts flew to his ancestry they had conquered in france and palestine and left a memorable name to the annalist of his country those days were past and yet cadurcis felt within him the desire perhaps the power of emulating them but what remained what career was open in this mechanical age to the chivalric genius of his race was he misplaced then in life the applause of nations there was something grand and exciting in such a possession to be the marvel of mankind what would he not hazard dreams dreams if his ancestors were valiant and celebrated it remained for him to rival to excel them at least in one respect their coronet had never rested on a brow fairer than the one for which he destined it venetia then independently of his passionate love was the only apparent object worth his pursuit the only thing in this world that had realised his dreams dreams sacred to his own musing soul that even she had never shared or guessed and she she was to be his he could not doubt it but tomorrow would decide tomorrow would seal his triumph  his sleep was short and restless he had almost outwatched the stars and yet he rose with the early morn his first thought was of venetia he was impatient for the interview the interview she promised and even proposed the fresh air was grateful to him he bounded along to cherbury and brushed the dew in his progress from the tall grass and shrubs in sight of the hall he for a moment paused he was before his accustomed hour and yet he was always too soon not today though not today suddenly he rushes forward and springs down the green vista for venetia is on the terrace and alone  always kind this morning she greeted him with unusual affection never had she seemed to him so exquisitely beautiful perhaps her countenance today was more pale than wont there seemed a softness in her eyes usually so brilliant and even dazzling the accents of her salutation were suppressed and tender  i thought you would be here early she remarked and therefore i rose to meet you  was he to infer from this artless confession that his image had haunted her in her dreams or only that she would not delay the conversation on which his happiness depended he could scarcely doubt which version to adopt when she took his arm and led him from the terrace to walk where they could not be disturbed  dear plantagenet she said for indeed you are very dear to me i told you last night that i would speak to you today on your wishes that are so kind to me and so much intended for my happiness i do not love suspense but indeed last night i was too much surprised too much overcome by what occurred that exhausted as i naturally was by all our pleasure i could not tell you what i wished indeed i could not dear plantagenet  my own venetia  so i hope you will always deem me for i should be very unhappy if you did not love me plantagenet more unhappy than i have even been these last two years and i have been very unhappy very unhappy indeed plantagenet  unhappy venetia my venetia unhappy  listen i will not weep i can control my feelings i have learnt to do this it is very sad and very different to what my life once was but i can do it  you amaze me  venetia sighed and then resumed but in a tone mournful and low and yet to a degree firm  you have been away five years plantagenet  but you have pardoned that  i never blamed you i had nothing to pardon it was well for you to be away and i rejoice your absence has been so profitable to you  but it was wicked to have been so silent  oh no no no such ideas never entered into my head nor even mammas you were very young you did as all would as all must do harbour not such thoughts enough you have returned and love us yet  love adore  five years are a long space of time plantagenet events will happen in five years even at cherbury i told you i was changed  yes said lord cadurcis in a voice of some anxiety with a scrutinising eye  you left me a happy child you find me a woman and a miserable one  good god venetia this suspense is awful be brief i pray you has any one  venetia looked at him with an air of perplexity she could not comprehend the idea that impelled his interruption  go on lord cadurcis added after a short pause i am indeed all anxiety  you remember that christmas which you passed at the hall and walking at night in the gallery and  well your mother i shall never forget it  you found her weeping when you were once at marringhurst you told me of it  ay ay  there is a wing of our house shut up we often talked of it  often venetia it was a mystery  i have penetrated it replied venetia in a solemn tone and never have i known what happiness is since  yes yes said lord cadurcis very pale and in a whisper  plantagenet i have a father  lord cadurcis started and for an instant his arm quitted venetias at length he said in a gloomy voice i know it  know it exclaimed venetia with astonishment who could have told you the secret  it is no secret replied cadurcis would that it were  would that it were how strange you speak how strange you look plantagenet if it be no secret that i have a father why this concealment then i know that i am not the child of shame she added after a moments pause with an air of pride a tear stole down the cheek of cadurcis  plantagenet dear good plantagenet my brother my own brother see i kneel to you venetia kneels to you your own venetia venetia that you love oh if you knew the load that is on my spirit bearing me down to a grave which i would almost welcome you would speak to me you would tell me all i have sighed for this i have longed for this i have prayed for this to meet some one who would speak to me of my father who had heard of him who knew him has been for years the only thought of my being the only object for which i existed and now here comes plantagenet my brother my own brother and he knows all and he will tell me yes that he will he will tell his venetia all all  is there not your mother said lord cadurcis in a broken tone  forbidden utterly forbidden if i speak they tell me her heart will break and therefore mine is breaking  have you no friend  are not you my friend  doctor masham  i have applied to him he tells me that he lives and then he shakes his head  you never saw your father think not of him  not think of him exclaimed venetia with extraordinary energy of what else for what do i live but to think of him what object have i in life but to see him i have seen him once  ah  i know his form by heart and yet it was but a shade oh what a shade what a glorious what an immortal shade if gods were upon earth they would be like my father  his deeds at least are not godlike observed lord cadurcis dryly and with some bitterness  i deny it said venetia her eyes sparkling with fire her form dilated with enthusiasm and involuntarily withdrawing her arm from her companion lord cadurcis looked exceedingly astonished  you deny it he exclaimed and what should you know about it  nature whispers to me that nothing but what is grand and noble could be breathed by those lips or fulfilled by that form  i am glad you have not read his works said lord cadurcis with increased bitterness as for his conduct your mother is a living evidence of his honour his generosity and his virtue  my mother said venetia in a softened voice and yet he loved my mother  she was his victim as a thousand others may have been  she is his wife replied venetia with some anxiety  yes a deserted wife is that preferable to being a cherished mistress more honourable but scarcely less humiliating  she must have misunderstood him said venetia i have perused the secret vows of his passion i have read his praises of her beauty i have pored over the music of his emotions when he first became a father yes he has gazed on me even though but for a moment with love over me he has breathed forth the hallowed blessing of a parent that transcendent form has pressed his lips to mine and held me with fondness to his heart and shall i credit aught to his dishonour is there a being in existence who can persuade me he is heartless or abandoned no i love him i adore him i am devoted to him with all the energies of my being i live only on the memory that he lives and were he to die i should pray to my god that i might join him without delay in a world where it cannot be justice to separate a child from a father  and this was venetia the fair the serene venetia the young the inexperienced venetia pausing as it were on the parting threshold of girlhood whom but a few hours since he had fancied could scarcely have proved a passion who appeared to him barely to comprehend the meaning of his advances for whose calmness or whose coldness he had consoled himself by the flattering conviction of her unknowing innocence before him stood a beautiful and inspired moenad her eye flashing supernatural fire her form elevated above her accustomed stature defiance on her swelling brow and passion on her quivering lip  gentle and sensitive as cadurcis ever appeared to those he loved there was in his soul a deep and unfathomed well of passions that had been never stirred and a bitter and mocking spirit in his brain of which he was himself unconscious he had repaired this hopeful morn to cherbury to receive as he believed the plighted faith of a simple and affectionate perhaps grateful girl that her unsophisticated and untutored spirit might not receive the advances of his heart with an equal and corresponding ardour he was prepared it pleased him that he should watch the gradual development of this bud of sweet affections waiting with proud anxiety her fragrant and her fullblown love but now it appeared that her coldness or her indifference might be ascribed to any other cause than the one to which he had attributed it the innocence of an inexperienced mind this girl was no stranger to powerful passions she could love and love with fervency with devotion with enthusiasm this child of joy was a woman of deep and thoughtful sorrows brooding in solitude over high resolves and passionate aspirations why were not the emotions of such a tumultuous soul excited by himself to him she was calm and imperturbable she called him brother she treated him as a child but a picture a fantastic shade could raise in her a tempestuous swell of sentiment that transformed her whole mind and changed the colour of all her hopes and thoughts deeply prejudiced against her father cadurcis now hated him and with a fell and ferocious earnestness that few bosoms but his could prove pale with rage he ground his teeth and watched her with a glance of sarcastic aversion  you led me here to listen to a communication which interested me he at length said have i heard it  his altered tone the air of haughtiness which he assumed were not lost upon venetia she endeavoured to collect herself but she hesitated to reply  i repeat my inquiry said cadurcis have you brought me here only to inform me that you have a father and that you adore him or his picture  i led you here replied venetia in a subdued tone and looking on the ground to thank you for your love and to confess to you that i love another  love another exclaimed cadurcis in a tone of derision simpleton the best thing your mother can do is to lock you up in the chamber with the picture that has produced such marvellous effects  i am no simpleton plantagenet rejoined venetia quietly but one who is acting as she thinks right and not only as her mind but as her heart prompts her  they had stopped in the earlier part of this conversation on a little plot of turf surrounded by shrubs cadurcis walked up and down this area with angry steps occasionally glancing at venetia with a look of mortification and displeasure  i tell you venetia he at length said that you are a little fool what do you mean by saying that you cannot marry me because you love another is not that other by your own account your father love him as much as you like is that to prevent you from loving your husband also  plantagenet you are rude and unnecessarily so said venetia i repeat to you again and for the last time that all my heart is my fathers it would be wicked in me to marry you because i cannot love you as a husband should be loved i can never love you as i love my father however it is useless to talk upon this subject i have not even the power of marrying you if i wished for i have dedicated myself to my father in the name of god and i have offered a vow to be registered in heaven that thenceforth i would exist only for the purpose of being restored to his heart  i congratulate you on your parent miss herbert  i feel that i ought to be proud of him though alas i can only feel it but whatever your opinion may be of my father i beg you to remember that you are speaking to his child  i shall state my opinion respecting your father madam with the most perfect unreserve wherever and whenever i choose quite convinced that however you esteem that opinion it will not be widely different from the real sentiments of the only parent whom you ought to respect and whom you are bound to obey  and i can tell you sir that whatever your opinion is on any subject it will never influence mine if indeed i were the mistress of my own destiny which i am not it would have been equally out of my power to have acted as you have so singularly proposed i do not wish to marry and marry i never will but were it in my power or in accordance with my wish to unite my fate for ever with anothers it should at least be with one to whom i could look up with reverence and even with admiration he should be at least a man and a great man one with whose name the world rung perhaps like my father a genius and a poet  a genius and a poet exclaimed lord cadurcis in a fury stamping with passion are these fit terms to use when speaking of the most abandoned profligate of his age a man whose name is synonymous with infamy and which no one dares to breathe in civilised life whose very blood is pollution as you will some day feel who has violated every tie and derided every principle by which society is maintained whose life is a living illustration of his own shameless doctrines who is at the same time a traitor to his king and an apostate from his god  curiosity overpowering even indignation had permitted venetia to listen even to this tirade pale as her companion but with a glance of withering scorn she exclaimed passionate and illmannered boy words cannot express the disgust and the contempt with which you inspire me she spoke and she disappeared cadurcis was neither able nor desirous to arrest her flight he remained rooted to the ground muttering to himself the word boy suddenly raising his arm and looking up to the sky he exclaimed the illusion is vanished farewell cherbury farewell cadurcis a wider theatre awaits me i have been too long the slave of soft affections i root them out of my heart for ever and fitting the action to the phrase it seemed that he hurled upon the earth all the tender emotions of his soul woman henceforth you shall be my sport i have now no feeling but for myself when she spoke i might have been a boy i am a boy no longer what i shall do i know not but this i know the world shall ring with my name i will be a man and a great man     chapter viii   the agitation of venetia on her return was not unnoticed by her mother but lady annabel ascribed it to a far different cause than the real one she was rather surprised when the breakfast passed and lord cadurcis did not appear somewhat perplexed when her daughter seized the earliest opportunity of retiring to her own chamber but with that selfrestraint of which she was so complete a mistress lady annabel uttered no remark  once more alone venetia could only repeat to herself the wild words that had burst from plantagenets lips in reference to her father what could they mean his morals might be misrepresented his opinions might be misunderstood stupidity might not comprehend his doctrines malignity might torture them the purest sages have been accused of immorality the most pious philosophers have been denounced as blasphemous but a traitor to his king that was a tangible an intelligible proposition one with which all might grapple which could be easily disproved if false scarcely propounded were it not true false to his god how false where when what mystery involved her life unhappy girl in vain she struggled with the overwhelming burden of her sorrows now she regretted that she had quarrelled with cadurcis it was evident that he knew everything and would have told her all and then she blamed him for his harsh and unfeeling demeanour and his total want of sympathy with her cruel and perplexing situation she had intended she had struggled to be so kind to him she thought she had such a plain tale to tell that he would have listened to it in considerate silence and bowed to her necessary and inevitable decision without a murmur amid all these harassing emotions her mind tossed about like a ship without a rudder until in her despair she almost resolved to confess everything to her mother and to request her to soothe and enlighten her agitated and confounded mind but what hope was there of solace or information from such a quarter lady annabels was not a mind to be diverted from her purpose whatever might have been the conduct of her husband it was evident that lady annabel had traced out a course from which she had resolved not to depart she remembered the earnest and repeated advice of dr masham that virtuous and intelligent man who never advised anything but for their benefit how solemnly had he enjoined upon her never to speak to her mother upon the subject unless she wished to produce misery and distress and what could her mother tell her her father lived he had abandoned her he was looked upon as a criminal and shunned by the society whose laws and prejudices he had alike outraged why should she revive amid the comparative happiness and serenity in which her mother now lived the bitter recollection of the almost intolerable misfortune of her existence no venetia was resolved to be a solitary victim in spite of her passionate and romantic devotion to her father she loved her mother with perfect affection the mother who had dedicated her life to her child and at least hoped she had spared her any share in their common unhappiness and this father whoso image haunted her dreams whose unknown voice seemed sometimes to float to her quick ear upon the wind could he be that abandoned being that cadurcis had described and that all around her and all the circumstances of her life would seem to indicate alas it might be truth alas it seemed like truth and for one so lost so utterly irredeemable was she to murmur against that pure and benevolent parent who had cherished her with such devotion and snatched her perhaps from disgrace dishonour and despair  and cadurcis would he return with all his violence the kind cadurcis never did she need a brother more than now and now he was absent and she had parted with him in anger deep almost deadly she too who had never before uttered a harsh word to a human being who had been involved in only one quarrel in her life and that almost unconsciously and which had nearly broken her heart she wept bitterly she wept this poor venetia  by one of those mental efforts which her strange lot often forced her to practise venetia at length composed herself and returned to the room where she believed she would meet her mother and hoped she should see cadurcis he was not there but lady annabel was seated as calm and busied as usual the doctor had departed even his presence would have proved a relief however slight to venetia who dreaded at this moment to be alone with her mother she had no cause however for alarm lord cadurcis never appeared and was absent even from dinner the day died away and still he was wanting and at length venetia bade her usual good night to lady annabel and received her usual blessing and embrace without his name having been even mentioned  venetia passed a disturbed night haunted by painful dreams in which her father and cadurcis were both mixed up and with images of pain confusion disgrace and misery but the morrow at least did not prolong her suspense for just as she had joined her mother at breakfast mistress pauncefort who had been despatched on some domestic mission by her mistress entered with a face of wonder and began as usual only think my lady well to be sure who have thought it i am quite confident for my own part i was quite taken aback when i heard it and i could not have believed my ears if john had not told me himself and he had it from his lordships own man  well pauncefort what have you to say inquired lady annabel very calmly  and never to send no note my lady at least i have not seen one come up that makes it so very strange  makes what pauncefort  why my lady doesnt your laship know his lordship left the abbey yesterday and never said nothing to nobody rode off without a word by your leave or with your leave to be sure he always was the oddest young gentleman as ever i met with and as i said to john john says i i hope his lordship has not gone to join the gipsies again  venetia looked into a teacup and then touched an egg and then twirled a spoon but lady annabel seemed quite imperturbable and only observed probably his guardian is ill and he has been suddenly summoned to town i wish you would bring my knittingneedles pauncefort  the autumn passed and lord cadurcis never returned to the abbey and never wrote to any of his late companions lady annabel never mentioned his name and although she seemed to have no other object in life but the pleasure and happiness of her child this strange mother never once consulted venetia on the probable occasion of his sudden departure and his strange conduct     book iv     chapter i   party feeling perhaps never ran higher in england than during the period immediately subsequent to the expulsion of the coalition ministry after the indefatigable faction of the american war and the flagrant union with lord north the whig party and especially charles fox then in the full vigour of his bold and ready mind were stung to the quick that all their remorseless efforts to obtain and preserve the government of the country should terminate in the preferment and apparent permanent power of a mere boy  next to charles fox perhaps the most eminent and influential member of the whig party was lady monteagle the daughter of one of the oldest and most powerful peers in the kingdom possessing lively talents and many fascinating accomplishments the mistress of a great establishment very beautiful and although she had been married some years still young the celebrated wife of lord monteagle found herself the centre of a circle alike powerful brilliant and refined she was the muse of the whig party at whose shrine every man of wit and fashion was proud to offer his flattering incense and her house became not merely the favourite scene of their social pleasures but the sacred temple of their political rites here many a manoeuvre was planned and many a scheme suggested many a convert enrolled and many a votary initiated  reclining on a couch in a boudoir which she was assured was the exact facsimile of that of marie antoinette lady monteagle with an eye sparkling with excitement and a cheek flushed with emotion appeared deeply interested in a volume from which she raised her hand as her husband entered the room  gertrude my love said his lordship i have asked the new bishop to dine with us today  my dear henry replied her ladyship what could induce you to do anything so strange  i suppose i have made a mistake as usual said his lordship shrugging his shoulders with a smile  my dear henry you know you may ask whomever you like to your house i never find fault with what you do but what could induce you to ask a tory bishop to meet a dozen of our own people  i thought i had done wrong directly i had asked him rejoined his lordship and yet he would not have come if i had not made such a point of it i think i will put him off  no my love that would be wrong you cannot do that  i cannot think how it came into my head the fact is i lost my presence of mind you know he was my tutor at christchurch when poor dear herbert and i were such friends and very kind he was to us both and so the moment i saw him i walked across the house introduced myself and asked him to dinner  well never mind said lady monteagle smiling it is rather ridiculous but i hope nothing will be said to offend him  oh do not be alarmed about that he is quite a man of the world and although he has his opinions not at all a partisan i assure you poor dear herbert loved him to the last and to this very moment has the greatest respect and affection for him  how very strange that not only your tutor but herberts should be a bishop remarked the lady smiling  it is very strange said his lordship and it only shows that it is quite useless in this world to lay plans or reckon on anything you know how it happened  not i indeed i have never given a thought to the business i only remember being very vexed that that stupid old bangerford should not have died when we were in office and then at any rate we should have got another vote  well you know said his lordship dear old masham that is his name was at weymouth this year with whom do you think of all people in the world  how should i know why should i think about it henry  why with herberts wife  what that horrid woman  yes lady annabel  and where was his daughter was she there  of course she has grown up and a most beautiful creature they say she is exactly like her father  ah i shall always regret i never saw him said her ladyship  well the daughter is in bad health and so after keeping her shut up all her life the mother was obliged to take her to weymouth and masham who has a living in their neighbourhood which bythebye herbert gave him and is their chaplain and counsellor and friend of the family and all that sort of thing though i really believe he has always acted for the best he was with them well the king took the greatest fancy to these herberts and the queen too quite singled them out and in short they were always with the royal family it ended by his majesty making masham his chaplain and now he has made him a bishop  very droll indeed said her ladyship and the drollest thing of all is that he is now coming to dine here  have you seen cadurcis today said lord monteagle  of course said her ladyship  he dines here  to be sure i am reading his new poem it will not be published till tomorrow  is it good  good what crude questions you do always ask henry exclaimed lady monteagle good of course it is good it is something better than good  but i mean is it as good as his other things will it make as much noise as his last thing  thing now henry you know very well that if there be anything i dislike in the world it is calling a poem a thing  well my dear you know i am no judge of poetry but if you are pleased i am quite content there is a knock some of your friends i am off i say gertrude be kind to old masham that is a dear creature  her ladyship extended her hand to which his lordship pressed his lips and just effected his escape as the servant announced a visitor in the person of mr horace pole  oh my dear mr pole i am quite exhausted said her ladyship i am reading cadurcis new poem it will not he published till tomorrow and it really has destroyed my nerves i have got people to dinner today and i am sure i shall not be able to encounter them  something outrageous i suppose said mr pole with a sneer i wish cadurcis would study pope  study pope my dear mr pole you have no imagination  no i have not thank heaven drawled out mr pole  well do not let us have a quarrel about cadurcis said lady monteagle all you men are jealous of him  and some of you women i think too said mr pole  lady monteagle faintly smiled  poor cadurcis she exclaimed he has a very hard life of it he complains bitterly that so many women are in love with him but then he is such an interesting creature what can he expect  interesting exclaimed mr pole now i hold he is the most conceited affected fellow that i ever met he continued with unusual energy  ah you men do not understand him said lady monteagle shaking her head you cannot she added with a look of pity  i cannot certainly said mr pole or his writings either for my part i think the town has gone mad  well you must confess said her ladyship with a glance of triumph that it was very lucky for us that i made him a whig  i cannot agree with you at all on that head said mr pole we certainly are not very popular at this moment and i feel convinced that a connection with a person who attracts so much notice as cadurcis unfortunately does and whose opinions on morals and religion must be so offensive to the vast majority of the english public must ultimately prove anything but advantageous to our party  oh my dear mr pole said her ladyship in a tone of affected deprecation think what a genius he is  we have very different ideas of genius lady monteagle i suspect said her visitor  you cannot deny replied her ladyship rising from her recumbent posture with some animation that he is a poet  it is difficult to decide upon our contemporaries said mr pole dryly  charles fox thinks he is the greatest poet that ever existed said her ladyship as if she were determined to settle the question  because he has written a lampoon on the royal family rejoined mr pole  you are a very provoking person said lady monteagle but you do not provoke me do not flatter yourself you do  that i feel to be an achievement alike beyond my power and my ambition replied mr pole slightly bowing but with a sneer  well read this said lady monteagle and then decide upon the merits of cadurcis  mr pole took the extended volume but with no great willingness and turned over a page or two and read a passage here and there  much the same as his last effusion i think he observed as far as i can judge from so cursory a review exaggerated passion bombastic language egotism to excess and which perhaps is the only portion that is genuine mixed with commonplace scepticism and impossible morals and a sort of vague dreamy philosophy which if it mean anything means atheism borrowed from his idol herbert and which he himself evidently does not comprehend  monster exclaimed lady monteagle with a mock assumption of indignation and you are going to dine with him here today you do not deserve it  it is a reward which is unfortunately too often obtained by me replied mr pole one of the most annoying consequences of your friends popularity lady monteagle is that there is not a dinner party where one can escape him i met him yesterday at fanshawes he amused himself by eating only biscuits and calling for soda water while we quaffed our burgundy how very original what a thing it is to be a great poet  perverse provoking mortal exclaimed lady monteagle and on what should a poet live on coarse food like you coarse mortals cadurcis is all spirit and in my opinion his diet only makes him more interesting  i understand said mr pole that he cannot endure a woman to eat at all but you are all spirit lady monteagle and therefore of course are not in the least inconvenienced bythebye do you mean to give us any of those charming little suppers this season  i shall not invite you replied her ladyship none but admirers of lord cadurcis enter this house  your menace effects my instant conversion replied mr pole i will admire him as much as you desire only do not insist upon my reading his works  i have not the slightest doubt you know them by heart rejoined her ladyship  mr pole smiled bowed and disappeared and lady monteagle sat down to write a billet to lord cadurcis to entreat him to be with her at five oclock which was at least half an hour before the other guests were expected the monteagles were considered to dine ridiculously late     chapter ii   marmion herbert sprung from one of the most illustrious families in england became at an early age the inheritor of a great estate to which however he did not succeed with the prejudices or opinions usually imbibed or professed by the class to which he belonged while yet a boy marmion herbert afforded many indications of possessing a mind alike visionary and inquisitive and both although not in an equal degree sceptical and creative nature had gifted him with precocious talents and with a temperament essentially poetic he was nevertheless a great student his early reading originally by accident and afterwards by an irresistible inclination had fallen among the works of the english freethinkers with all their errors a profound and vigorous race and much superior to the french philosophers who were after all only their pupils and their imitators while his juvenile studies and in some degree the predisposition of his mind had thus prepared him to doubt and finally to challenge the propriety of all that was established and received the poetical and stronger bias of his mind enabled him quickly to supply the place of everything he would remove and destroy and far from being the victim of those frigid and indifferent feelings which must ever be the portion of the mere doubter herbert on the contrary looked forward with ardent and sanguine enthusiasm to a glorious and ameliorating future which should amply compensate and console a misguided and unhappy race for the miserable past and the painful and dreary present to those therefore who could not sympathise with his views it will be seen that herbert in attempting to fulfil them became not merely passively noxious from his example but actively mischievous from his exertions a mere sceptic he would have been perhaps merely pitied a sceptic with a peculiar faith of his own which he was resolved to promulgate herbert became odious a solitary votary of obnoxious opinions herbert would have been looked upon only as a madman but the moment he attempted to make proselytes he rose into a conspirator against society  young irresistibly prepossessing in his appearance with great eloquence crude but considerable knowledge an ardent imagination and a subtle mind and a generous and passionate soul under any circumstances he must have obtained and exercised influence even if his creator had not also bestowed upon him a spirit of indomitable courage but these great gifts of nature being combined with accidents of fortune scarcely less qualified to move mankind high rank vast wealth and a name of traditionary glory it will not be esteemed surprising that marmion herbert at an early period should have attracted around him many enthusiastic disciples  at christchurch whither he repaired at an unusually early age his tutor was doctor masham and the profound respect and singular affection with which that able learned and amiable man early inspired his pupil for a time controlled the spirit of herbert or rather confined its workings to so limited a sphere that the results were neither dangerous to society nor himself perfectly comprehending and appreciating the genius of the youth entrusted to his charge deeply interested in his spiritual as well as worldly welfare and strongly impressed with the importance of enlisting his pupils energies in favour of that existing order both moral and religious in the truth and indispensableness of which he was a sincere believer doctor masham omitted no opportunity of combating the heresies of the young inquirer and as the tutor equally by talent experience and learning was a competent champion of the great cause to which he was devoted his zeal and ability for a time checked the development of those opinions of which he witnessed the menacing influence over herbert with so much fear and anxiety the college life of marmion herbert therefore passed in ceaseless controversy with his tutor and as he possessed among many other noble qualities a high and philosophic sense of justice he did not consider himself authorised while a doubt remained on his own mind actively to promulgate those opinions of the propriety and necessity of which he scarcely ever ceased to be persuaded to this cause it must be mainly attributed that herbert was not expelled the university for had he pursued there the course of which his cruder career at eton had given promise there can be little doubt that some flagrant outrage of the opinions held sacred in that great seat of orthodoxy would have quickly removed him from the salutary sphere of their control  herbert quitted oxford in his nineteenth year yet inferior to few that he left there even among the most eminent in classical attainments and with a mind naturally profound practised in all the arts of ratiocination his general knowledge also was considerable and he was a proficient in those scientific pursuits which were then rare notwithstanding his great fortune and position his departure from the university was not a signal with him for that abandonment to the world and that unbounded selfenjoyment naturally so tempting to youth on the contrary herbert shut himself up in his magnificent castle devoted to solitude and study in his splendid library he consulted the sages of antiquity and conferred with them on the nature of existence and of the social duties while in his laboratory or his dissectingroom he occasionally flattered himself he might discover the great secret which had perplexed generations the consequence of a year passed in this severe discipline was unfortunately a complete recurrence to those opinions that he had early imbibed and which now seemed fixed in his conviction beyond the hope or chance of again faltering in politics a violent republican and an advocate certainly a disinterested one of a complete equality of property and conditions utterly objecting to the very foundation of our moral system and especially a strenuous antagonist of marriage which he taught himself to esteem not only as an unnatural tie but as eminently unjust towards that softer sex who had been so long the victims of man discarding as a mockery the received revelation of the divine will and if no longer an atheist substituting merely for such an outrageous dogma a subtle and shadowy platonism doctrines however which herbert at least had acquired by a profound study of the works of their great founder the pupil of doctor masham at length deemed himself qualified to enter that world which he was resolved to regenerate prepared for persecution and steeled even to martyrdom  but while the doctrines of the philosopher had been forming the spirit of the poet had not been inactive loneliness after all the best of muses had stimulated the creative faculty of his being wandering amid his solitary woods and glades at all hours and seasons the wild and beautiful apparitions of nature had appealed to a sympathetic soul the stars and winds the pensive sunset and the sanguine break of morn the sweet solemnity of night the ancient trees and the light and evanescent flowers all signs and sights and sounds of loveliness and power fell on a ready eye and a responsive ear gazing on the beautiful he longed to create it then it was that the two passions which seemed to share the being of herbert appeared simultaneously to assert their sway and he resolved to call in his muse to the assistance of his philosophy  herbert celebrated that fond world of his imagination which he wished to teach men to love in stanzas glittering with refined images and resonant with subtle symphony he called into creation that society of immaculate purity and unbounded enjoyment which he believed was the natural inheritance of unshackled man in the hero he pictured a philosopher young and gifted as himself in the heroine his idea of a perfect woman although all those peculiar doctrines of herbert which undisguised must have excited so much odium were more or less developed and inculcated in this work nevertheless they were necessarily so veiled by the highly spiritual and metaphorical language of the poet that it required some previous acquaintance with the system enforced to be able to detect and recognise the esoteric spirit of his muse the public read only the history of an ideal world and of creatures of exquisite beauty told in language that alike dazzled their fancy and captivated their ear they were lost in a delicious maze of metaphor and music and were proud to acknowledge an addition to the glorious catalogue of their poets in a young and interesting member of their aristocracy  in the meanwhile herbert entered that great world that had long expected him and hailed his advent with triumph how long might have elapsed before they were roused by the conduct of herbert to the error under which they were labouring as to his character it is not difficult to conjecture but before he could commence those philanthropic exertions which apparently absorbed him he encountered an individual who most unconsciously put his philosophy not merely to the test but partially even to the rout and this was lady annabel sidney almost as new to the world as himself and not less admired her unrivalled beauty her unusual accomplishments and her pure and dignified mind combined it must be confessed with the flattering admiration of his genius entirely captivated the philosophical antagonist of marriage it is not surprising that marmion herbert scarcely of age and with a heart of extreme susceptibility resolved after a struggle to be the first exception to his system and as he faintly flattered himself the last victim of prejudice he wooed and won the lady annabel  the marriage ceremony was performed by doctor masham who had read his pupils poem and had been a little frightened by its indications but this happy union had dissipated all his fears he would not believe in any other than a future career for him alike honourable and happy and he trusted that if any wild thoughts still lingered in herberts mind that they would clear off by the same literary process so that the utmost ill consequences of his immature opinions might be an occasional line that the wise would have liked to blot and yet which the unlettered might scarcely be competent to comprehend mr and lady annabel herbert departed after the ceremony to his castle and doctor masham to marringhurst a valuable living in another county to which his pupil had just presented him  some months after this memorable event rumours reached the ear of the good doctor that all was not as satisfactory as he could desire in that establishment in the welfare of which he naturally took so lively an interest herbert was in the habit of corresponding with the rector of marringhurst and his first letters were full of details as to his happy life and his perfect consent but gradually these details had been considerably abridged and the correspondence assumed chiefly a literary or philosophical character lady annabel however was always mentioned with regard and an intimation had been duly given to the doctor that she was in a delicate and promising situation and that they were both alike anxious that he should christen their child it did not seem very surprising to the good doctor who was a man of the world that a husband six months after marriage should not speak of the memorable event with all the fulness and fondness of the honeymoon and being one of those happy tempers that always anticipate the best he dismissed from his mind as vain gossip and idle exaggerations the ominous whispers that occasionally reached him  immediately after the christmas ensuing his marriage the herberts returned to london and the doctor who happened to be a short time in the metropolis paid them a visit his observations were far from unsatisfactory it was certainly too evident that marmion was no longer enamoured of lady annabel but he treated her apparently with courtesy and even cordiality the presence of dr masham tended perhaps a little to revive old feelings for he was as much a favourite with the wife as with the husband but on the whole the doctor quitted them with an easy heart and sanguine that the interesting and impending event would in all probability revive affection on the part of herbert or at least afford lady annabel the only substitute for a husbands heart  in due time the doctor heard from herbert that his wife had gone down into the country but was sorry to observe that herbert did not accompany her even this disagreeable impression was removed by a letter shortly after received from herbert dated from the castle and written in high spirits informing him that annabel had made him the happy father of the most beautiful little girl in the world during the ensuing three months mr herbert though he resumed his residence in london paid frequent visits to the castle where lady annabel remained and his occasional correspondence though couched in a careless vein still on the whole indicated a cheerful spirit though ever and anon were sarcastic observations as to the felicity of the married state which he said was an undoubted blessing as it kept a man out of all scrapes though unfortunately under the penalty of his total idleness and inutility in life on the whole however the reader may judge of the astonishment of doctor masham when in common with the world very shortly after the receipt of this letter mr herbert having previously proceeded to london and awaiting as was said the daily arrival of his wife and child his former tutor learned that lady annabel accompanied only by pauncefort and venetia had sought her fathers roof declaring that circumstances had occurred which rendered it quite impossible that she could live with mr herbert any longer and entreating his succour and parental protection  never was such a hubbub in the world in vain herbert claimed his wife and expressed his astonishment declaring that he had parted from her with the expression of perfect kind feeling on both sides no answer was given to his letter and no explanation of any kind conceded him the world universally declared lady annabel an injured woman and trusted that she would eventually have the good sense and kindness to gratify them by revealing the mystery while herbert on the contrary was universally abused and shunned avoided by his acquaintances and denounced as the most depraved of men  in this extraordinary state of affairs herbert acted in a manner the best calculated to secure his happiness and the very worst to preserve his character having ostentatiously shown himself in every public place and courted notice and inquiry by every means in his power to prove that he was not anxious to conceal himself or avoid any inquiry he left the country free at last to pursue that career to which he had always aspired and in which he had been checked by a blunder from the consequences of which he little expected that he should so speedily and strangely emancipate himself it was in a beautiful villa on the lake of geneva that he finally established himself and there for many years he employed himself in the publication of a series of works which whether they were poetry or prose imaginative or investigative all tended to the same consistent purpose namely the fearless and unqualified promulgation of those opinions on the adoption of which he sincerely believed the happiness of mankind depended and the opposite principles to which in his own case had been productive of so much mortification and misery his works which were published in england were little read and universally decried the critics were always hard at work proving that he was no poet and demonstrating in the most logical manner that he was quite incapable of reasoning on the commonest topic in addition to all this his ignorance was selfevident and though he was very fond of quoting greek they doubted whether he was capable of reading the original authors the general impression of the english public after the lapse of some years was that herbert was an abandoned being of profligate habits opposed to all the institutions of society that kept his infamy in check and an avowed atheist and as scarcely any one but a sympathetic spirit ever read a line he wrote for indeed the very sight of his works was pollution it is not very wonderful that this opinion was so generally prevalent a calm inquirer might perhaps have suspected that abandoned profligacy is not very compatible with severe study and that an author is seldom loose in his life even if he be licentious in his writings a calm inquirer might perhaps have been of opinion that a solitary sage may be the antagonist of a priesthood without absolutely denying the existence of a god but there never are calm inquirers the world on every subject however unequally is divided into parties and even in the case of herbert and his writings those who admired his genius and the generosity of his soul were not content without advocating principally out of pique to his adversaries his extreme opinions on every subject moral political and religious  besides it must be confessed there was another circumstance which was almost as fatal to herberts character in england as his loose and heretical opinions the travelling english during their visits to geneva found out that their countryman solaced or enlivened his solitude by unhallowed ties it is a habit to which very young men who are separated from or deserted by their wives occasionally have recourse wrong no doubt as most things are but it is to be hoped venial at least in the case of any man who is not also an atheist this unfortunate mistress of herbert was magnified into a seraglio the most extraordinary tales of the voluptuous life of one who generally at his studies outwatched the stars were rife in english society and    hoary marquises and stripling dukes  who were either protecting opera dancers or still worse making love to their neighbours wives either looked grave when the name of herbert was mentioned in female society or affectedly confused as if they could a tale unfold were they not convinced that the sense of propriety among all present was infinitely superior to their sense of curiosity  the only person to whom herbert communicated in england was doctor masham he wrote to him immediately on his establishment at geneva in a calm yet sincere and serious tone as if it were useless to dwell too fully on the past yet he declared although now that it was all over he avowed his joy at the interposition of his destiny and the opportunity which he at length possessed of pursuing the career for which he was adapted that he had to his knowledge given his wife no cause of offence which could authorise her conduct as for his daughter he said he should not be so cruel as to tear her from her mothers breast though if anything could induce him to such behaviour it would be the malignant and ungenerous menace of his wifes relatives that they would oppose his preferred claim to the guardianship of his child on the plea of his immoral life and atheistical opinions with reference to pecuniary arrangements as his chief seat was entailed on male heirs he proposed that his wife should take up her abode at cherbury an estate which had been settled on her and her children at her marriage and which therefore would descend to venetia finally he expressed his satisfaction that the neighbourhood of marringhurst would permit his good and still faithful friend to cultivate the society and guard over the welfare of his wife and daughter  during the first ten years of herberts exile for such indeed it might be considered the doctor maintained with him a rare yet regular correspondence but after that time a public event occurred and a revolution took place in herberts life which terminated all communication between them a termination occasioned however by such a simultaneous conviction of its absolute necessity that it was not attended by any of those painful communications which are too often the harrowing forerunners of a formal disruption of ancient ties  this event was the revolt of the american colonies and this revolution in herberts career his junction with the rebels against his native country doubtless it was not without a struggle perhaps a pang that herbert resolved upon a line of conduct to which it must assuredly have required the strongest throb of his cosmopolitan sympathy and his amplest definition of philanthropy to have impelled him but without any vindictive feelings towards england for he ever professed and exercised charity towards his enemies attributing their conduct entirely to their ignorance and prejudice upon this step he nevertheless felt it his duty to decide there seemed in the opening prospects of america in a world still new which had borrowed from the old as it were only so much civilisation as was necessary to create and to maintain order there seemed in the circumstances of its boundless territory and the total absence of feudal institutions and prejudices so fair a field for the practical introduction of those regenerating principles to which herbert had devoted all the thought and labour of his life that he resolved after long and perhaps painful meditation to sacrifice every feeling and future interest to its fulfilment all idea of ever returning to his native country even were it only to mix his ashes with the generations of his ancestors all hope of reconciliation with his wife or of pressing to his heart that daughter often present to his tender fancy and to whose affections he had feelingly appealed in an outburst of passionate poetry all these chances chances which in spite of his philosophy had yet a lingering charm must be discarded for ever they were discarded assigning his estate to his heir upon conditions in order to prevent its forfeiture with such resources as he could command and which were considerable marmion herbert arrived at boston where his rank his wealth his distinguished name his great talents and his undoubted zeal for the cause of liberty procured him an eminent and gratifying reception he offered to raise a regiment for the republic and the offer was accepted and he was enrolled among the citizens all this occurred about the time that the cadurcis family first settled at the abbey and this narrative will probably throw light upon several slight incidents which heretofore may have attracted the perplexed attention of the reader such as the newspaper brought by dr masham at the christmas visit the tears shed at a subsequent period at marringhurst when he related to her the last intelligence that had been received from america for indeed it is impossible to express the misery and mortification which this last conduct of her husband occasioned lady annabel brought up as she had been with feelings of romantic loyalty and unswerving patriotism to be a traitor seemed the only blot that remained for his sullied scutcheon and she had never dreamed of that an infidel a profligate a deserter from his home an apostate from his god one infamy alone remained and now he had attained it a traitor to his king why every peasant would despise him  general herbert however for such he speedily became at the head of his division soon arrested the attention and commanded the respect of europe to his exertions the successful result of the struggle was in a great measure attributed and he received the thanks of congress of which he became a member his military and political reputation exercised a beneficial influence upon his literary fame his works were reprinted in america and translated into french and published at geneva and basle whence they were surreptitiously introduced into france the whigs who had become very factious and nearly revolutionary during the american war suddenly became proud of their countryman whom a new world hailed as a deliverer and paris declared to be a great poet and an illustrious philosopher his writings became fashionable especially among the young numerous editions of them appeared and in time it was discovered that herbert was now not only openly read and enthusiastically admired but had founded a school  the struggle with america ceased about the time of lord cadurcis last visit to cherbury when from his indignant lips venetia first learnt the enormities of her fathers career since that period some three years had elapsed until we introduced our readers to the boudoir of lady monteagle during this period among the whigs and their partisans the literary fame of herbert had arisen and become established how they have passed in regard to lady annabel herbert and her daughter on the one hand and lord cadurcis himself on the other we will endeavour to ascertain in the following chapter     chapter iii   from the last departure of lord cadurcis from cherbury the health of venetia again declined the truth is she brooded in solitude over her strange lot until her nerves became relaxed by intense reverie and suppressed feeling the attention of a mother so wrapt up in her child as lady annabel was soon attracted to the increasing languor of our heroine whose eye each day seemed to grow less bright and her graceful form less lithe and active no longer fond of the sun and breeze as a beautiful bird was venetia seen as heretofore glancing in the garden or bounding over the lawns too often might she be found reclining on the couch in spite of all the temptations of the spring while her temper once so singularly sweet that it seemed there was not in the world a word that could ruffle it and which required so keenly and responded so quickly to sympathy became reserved if not absolutely sullen or at times even captious and fretful  this change in the appearance and demeanour of her daughter filled lady annabel with anxiety and alarm in vain she expressed to venetia her conviction of her indisposition but venetia though her altered habits confirmed the suspicion and authorised the inquiry of her parent persisted ever in asserting that she had no ailment her old medical attendant was however consulted and being perplexed with the case he recommended change of air lady annabel then consulted dr masham and he gave his opinion in favour of change of air for one reason and that was that it would bring with it what he had long considered venetia to stand in need of and that was change of life  dr masham was right but then to guide him in forming his judgment he had the advantage of some psychological knowledge of the case which in a greet degree was a sealed book to the poor puzzled physician we laugh very often at the errors of medical men but if we would only when we consult them have strength of mind enough to extend to them something better than a halfconfidence we might be cured the sooner how often when the unhappy disciple of esculapius is perplexing himself about the state of our bodies we might throw light upon his obscure labours by simply detailing to him the state of our minds  the result of these consultations in the herbert family was a final resolution on the part of lady annabel to quit cherbury for a while as the sea air was especially recommended to venetia and as lady annabel shrank with a morbid apprehension from society to which nothing could persuade her she was not an object either of odium or impertinent curiosity she finally resolved to visit weymouth then a small and secluded wateringplace and whither she arrived and settled herself it not being even the season when its few customary visitors were in the habit of gathering  this residence at weymouth quite repaid lady annabel for all the trouble of her new settlement and for the change in her life very painful to her confirmed habits which she experienced in leaving for the first time for such a long series of years her old hall for the rose returned to the cheek of her daughter and the western breezes joined with the influence of the new objects that surrounded her and especially of that ocean and its strange and inexhaustible variety on which she gazed for the first time gradually but surely completed the restoration of venetia to health and with it to much of her old vivacity  when lady annabel had resided about a year at weymouth in the society of which she had invariably made the indisposition of venetia a reason for not entering a great revolution suddenly occurred at this little quiet wateringplace for it was fixed upon as the summer residence of the english court the celebrated name the distinguished appearance and the secluded habits of lady annabel and her daughter had rendered them the objects of general interest occasionally they were met in a seaside walk by some fellowwanderer over the sands or toiler over the shingles and romantic reports of the dignity of the mother and the daughters beauty were repeated by the fortunate observers to the lounging circle of the public library or the baths  the moment that lady annabel was assured that the royal family had positively fixed upon weymouth for their residence and were even daily expected she resolved instantly to retire her stern sense of duty assured her that it was neither delicate nor loyal to obtrude before the presence of an outraged monarch the wife and daughter of a traitor her haughty though wounded spirit shrank from the revival of her husbands history which must be the consequence of such a conjunction and from the startling and painful remarks which might reach the shrouded ear of her daughter with her characteristic decision and with her usual stern volition lady annabel quitted weymouth instantly but she was in some degree consoled for the regret and apprehensiveness which she felt at thus leaving a place that had otherwise so happily fulfilled all her hopes and wishes and that seemed to agree so entirely with venetia by finding unexpectedly a marine villa some few miles further up the coast which was untenanted and which offered to lady annabel all the accommodation she could desire  it so happened this summer that dr masham paid the herberts a visit and it was his habit occasionally to ride into weymouth to read the newspaper or pass an hour in that easy lounging chat which is perhaps one of the principal diversions of a wateringplace a great dignitary of the church who was about the king and to whom dr masham was known not merely by reputation mentioned his presence to his majesty and the king who was fond of the society of eminent divines desired that dr masham should be presented to him now so favourable was the impression that the rector of marringhurst made upon his sovereign that from that moment the king was scarcely ever content unless he was in attendance his majesty who was happy in asking questions and much too acute to be baffled when he sought information finally elicited from the doctor all that in order to please lady annabel he long struggled to conceal but when the king found that the deserted wife and daughter of herbert were really living in the neighbourhood and that they had quitted weymouth on his arrival from a feeling of delicate loyalty nothing would satisfy the kindhearted monarch but personally assuring them of the interest he took in their welfare and accordingly the next day without giving lady annabel even the preparation of a notice his majesty and his royal consort attended only by a lord in waiting called at the marine villa and fairly introduced themselves  an acquaintance occasioned by a sentiment of generous and condescending sympathy was established and strengthened into intimacy by the personal qualities of those thus delicately honoured the king and queen were equally delighted with the wife and daughter of the terrible rebel and although of course not an allusion was made to his existence lady annabel felt not the less acutely the cause to which she was indebted for a notice so gratifying but which she afterwards ensured by her own merits how strange are the accidents of life venetia herbert who had been bred up in unbroken solitude and whose converse had been confined to two or three beings suddenly found herself the guest of a king and the visitor to a court she stepped at once from solitude into the most august circle of society yet though she had enjoyed none of that initiatory experience which is usually held so indispensable to the votaries of fashion her happy nature qualified her to play her part without effort and with success serene and graceful she mingled in the strange and novel scene as if it had been for ever her lot to dazzle and to charm ere the royal family returned to london they extracted from lady annabel a compliance with their earnest wishes that she should fix her residence during the ensuing season in the metropolis and that she should herself present venetia at st jamess the wishes of kings are commands and lady annabel who thus unexpectedly perceived some of the most painful anticipations of her solitude at once dissipated and that her child instead of being subjected on her entrance into life to all the mortifications she had imagined would on the contrary find her first introduction under auspices the most flattering and advantageous bowed a dutiful assent to the condescending injunctions  such were the memorable consequences of this visit to weymouth the return of lady annabel to the world and her intended residence in the metropolis while the good masham preceded their arrival to receive a mitre strange events and yet not improbable  in the meantime lord cadurcis had repaired to the university where his rank and his eccentric qualities quickly gathered round him a choice circle of intimates chiefly culled from his old schoolfellows of these the great majority were his seniors for whose society the maturity of his mind qualified him it so happened that these companions were in general influenced by those liberal opinions which had become in vogue during the american war and from which lord cadurcis had hitherto been preserved by the society in which he had previously mingled in the house of his guardian with the characteristic caprice and impetuosity of youth cadurcis rapidly and ardently imbibed all these doctrines captivated alike by their boldness and their novelty hitherto the child of prejudice he flattered himself that he was now the creature of reason and determined to take nothing for granted he soon learned to question everything that was received a friend introduced him to the writings of herbert that very herbert whom he had been taught to look upon with so much terror and odium their perusal operated a complete revolution of his mind and in little more than a year from his flight from cherbury he had become an enthusiastic votary of the great master for his violent abuse of whom he had been banished from those happy bowers the courage the boldness the eloquence the imagination the strange and romantic career of herbert carried the spirit of cadurcis captive the sympathetic companions studied his works and smiled with scorn at the prejudice of which their great model had been the victim and of which they had been so long the dupes as for cadurcis he resolved to emulate him and he commenced his noble rivalship by a systematic neglect of all the duties and the studies of his college life his irregular habits procured him constant reprimands in which he gloried he revenged himself on the authorities by writing epigrams and by keeping a bear which he declared should stand for a fellowship at length having wilfully outraged the most important regulations he was expelled and he made his expulsion the subject of a satire equally personal and philosophic and which obtained applause for the great talent which it displayed even from those who lamented its want of judgment and the misconduct of its writer flushed with success cadurcis at length found to his astonishment that nature had intended him for a poet he repaired to london where he was received with open arms by the whigs whose party he immediately embraced and where he published a poem in which he painted his own character as the hero and of which in spite of all the exaggeration and extravagance of youth the genius was undeniable society sympathised with a young and a noble poet his poem was read by all parties with enthusiasm cadurcis became the fashion to use his own expression one morning he awoke and found himself famous young singularly handsome with every gift of nature and fortune and with an inordinate vanity that raged in his soul cadurcis soon forgot the high philosophy that had for a moment attracted him and delivered himself up to the absorbing egotism which had ever been latent in his passionate and ambitious mind gifted with energies that few have ever equalled and fooled to the bent by the excited sympathies of society he poured forth his creative and daring spirit with a license that conquered all obstacles from the very audacity with which he assailed them in a word the young the reserved and unknown cadurcis who but three years back was to have lived in the domestic solitude for which he alone felt himself fitted filled every heart and glittered in every eye the men envied the women loved all admired him his life was a perpetual triumph a brilliant and applauding stage on which he ever played a dazzling and heroic part so sudden and so startling had been his apparition so vigorous and unceasing the efforts by which he had maintained his first overwhelming impression and not merely by his writings but by his unusual manners and eccentric life that no one had yet found time to draw his breath to observe to inquire and to criticise he had risen and still flamed like a comet as wild as it was beautiful and strange is it was brilliant     chapter iv   we must now return to the dinner party at lord monteagles when the bishop of  entered the room he found nearly all the expected guests assembled and was immediately presented by his host to the lady of the house who received him with all that fascinating address for which she was celebrated expressing the extreme delight which she felt at thus becoming formally acquainted with one whom her husband had long taught her to admire and reverence utterly unconscious who had just joined the circle while lord monteagle was introducing his newlyarrived guest to many present and to all of whom he was unknown except by reputation lord cadurcis was standing apart apparently wrapt in his own thoughts but the truth is in spite of all the excitement in which he lived he had difficulty in overcoming the natural reserve of his disposition  watch cadurcis said mr horace pole to a fine lady does not he look sublime  show me him said the lady eagerly i have never seen him yet i am actually dying to know him you know we have just come to town  and have caught the raging epidemic i see said mr pole with a sneer however there is the marvellous young gentleman alone in a crowd as he says in his last poem very interesting  wonderful creature exclaimed the dame  charming said mr pole if you ask lady monteagle she will introduce him to you and then perhaps you will be fortunate enough to be handed to dinner by him  oh how i should like it  you must take care however not to eat he cannot endure a woman who eats  i never do said the lady simply at least at dinner  ah then you will quite suit him i dare say he will write a sonnet to you and call you thyrza  i wish i could get him to write some lines in my book said the lady charles fox has written some he was staying with us in the autumn and he has written an ode to my little dog  how amiable said mr pole i dare say they are as good as his elegy on mrs crewes cat but you must not talk of cats and dogs to cadurcis he is too exalted to commemorate any animal less sublime than a tiger or a barb  you forget his beautiful lines on his newfoundland said the lady  very complimentary to us all said mr horace pole the interesting misanthrope  he looks unhappy  very said mr pole evidently something on his conscience  they do whisper very odd things said the lady with great curiosity do you think there is anything in them  oh no doubt said mr pole look at him you can detect crime in every glance  dear me how shocking i think he must be the most interesting person that ever lived i should so like to know him they say he is so very odd  very said mr pole he must be a man of genius he is so unlike everybody the very tie of his cravat proves it and his hair so savage and dishevelled none but a man of genius would not wear powder watch him today and you will observe that he will not condescend to perform the slightest act like an ordinary mortal i met him at dinner yesterday at fanshawes and he touched nothing but biscuits and sodawater fanshawe you know is famous for his cook complimentary and gratifying was it not  dear me said the lady i am delighted to see him and yet i hope i shall not sit by him at dinner i am quite afraid of him  he is really awful said mr pole  in the meantime the subject of these observations slowly withdrew to the further end of the saloon apart from every one and threw himself upon a couch with a somewhat discontented air lady monteagle whose eye had never left him for a moment although her attentions had been necessarily commanded by her guests and who dreaded the silent rages in which cadurcis constantly indulged and which when once assumed for the day were with difficulty dissipated seized the first opportunity to join and soothe him  dear cadurcis she said why do you sit here you know i am obliged to speak to all these odious people and it is very cruel of you  you seemed to me to be extremely happy replied his lordship in a sarcastic tone  now cadurcis for heavens sake do not play with my feelings exclaimed lady monteagle in a deprecating tone pray be amiable if i think you are in one of your dark humours it is quite impossible for me to attend to these people and you know it is the only point on which monteagle ever has an opinion he insists upon my attending to his guests  if you prefer his guests to me attend to them  now cadurcis i ask you as a favour a favour to me only for today be kind be amiable you can if you like no person can be more amiable now do  i am amiable said his lordship i am perfectly satisfied if you are you made me dine here  now cadurcis  have i not dined here to satisfy you  yes it was very kind  but really that i should be wearied with all the commonplaces of these creatures who come to eat your husbands cutlets is too much said his lordship and you gertrude what necessity can there be in your troubling yourself to amuse people whom you meet every day of your life and who from the vulgar perversity of society value you in exact proportion as you neglect them  yes but today i must be attentive for henry with his usual thoughtlessness has asked this new bishop to dine with us  the bishop of inquired lord cadurcis eagerly is he coming  he has been in the room this quarter of an hour  what masham doctor masham continued lord cadurcis  assuredly  lord cadurcis changed colour and even sighed he rose rather quickly and said i must go and speak to him  so quitting lady monteagle he crossed the room and with all the simplicity of old days which instantly returned on him those melancholy eyes sparkling with animation and that languid form quick with excitement he caught the doctors glance and shook his extended hand with a heartiness which astonished the surrounding spectators accustomed to the elaborate listlessness of his usual manner  my dear doctor my dear lord i am glad to say said cadurcis this is the greatest and the most unexpected pleasure i ever received of all persons in the world you are the one whom i was most anxious to meet  the good bishop appeared not less gratified with the rencounter than cadurcis himself but in the midst of their mutual congratulations dinner was announced and served and in due order lord cadurcis found himself attending that fine lady whom mr horace pole had in jest suggested should be the object of his services while mr pole himself was seated opposite to him at table  the lady remembering all mr poles intimations was really much frightened she at first could scarcely reply to the casual observations of her neighbour and quite resolved not to eat anything but his lively and voluble conversation his perfectly unaffected manner and the nonchalance with which he helped himself to every dish that was offered him soon reassured her her voice became a little firmer her manner less embarrassed and she even began meditating a delicate assault upon a fricassee  are you going to ranelagh tonight inquired lord cadurcis i think i shall take a round there is nothing like amusement it is the only thing worth living for and i thank my destiny i am easily amused we must persuade lady monteagle to go with us let us make a party and return and sup i like a supper nothing in the world more charming than a supper    a lobster salad and champagne and chat  that is life and delightful why really my dear madam you eat nothing you will never be able to endure the fatigues of a ranelagh campaign on the sustenance of a pâté pole my good fellow will you take a glass of wine we had a pleasant party yesterday at fanshawes and apparently a capital dinner i was sorry that i could not play my part but i have led rather a raking life lately we must go and dine with him again  lord cadurcis neighbour and mr pole exchanged looks and the lady emboldened by the unexpected conduct of her cavalier and the exceeding good friends which he seemed resolved to be with her and every one else began to flatter herself that she might yet obtain the muchdesired inscription in her volume so after making the usual approaches of having a great favour to request which however she could not flatter herself would be granted and which she even was afraid to mention encouraged by the ready declaration of lord cadurcis that he should think it would be quite impossible for any one to deny her anything the lady ventured to state that mr fox had written something in her book and she should be the most honoured and happiest lady in the land if  oh i shall be most happy said lord cadurcis i really esteem your request quite an honour you know i am only a literary amateur and cannot pretend to vie with your real authors if you want them you must go to mrs montagu i would not write a line for her and no the blues have quite excommunicated me never mind i leave them to miss hannah more but you you are quite a different sort of person what shall i write  i must leave the subject to you said his gratified friend  well then said his lordship i dare say you have got a lapdog or a broken fan i dont think i could soar above them i think that is about my tether  this lady though a great person was not a beauty and very little of a wit and not calculated in any respect to excite the jealousy of lady monteagle in the meantime that lady was quite delighted with the unusual animation of lord cadurcis who was much the most entertaining member of the party every one present would circulate throughout the world that it was only at the monteagles that lord cadurcis condescended to be amusing as the bishop was seated on her right hand lady monteagle seized the opportunity of making inquiries as to their acquaintance but she only obtained from the good masham that he had once resided in his lordships neighbourhood and had known him as a child and was greatly attached to him her ladyship was anxious to obtain some juvenile anecdotes of her hero but the bishop contrived to be amusing without degenerating into gossip she did not glean much except that all his early friends were more astonished at his present career than the bishop himself who was about to add that he always had some misgivings but recollecting where he was he converted the word into a more gracious term but if lady monteagle were not so successful as she could wish in her inquiries she contrived still to speak on the to her everinteresting subject and consoled herself by the communications which she poured into a guarded yet not unwilling ear respecting the present life and conduct of the bishops former pupil the worthy dignitary had been prepared by public fame for much that was dazzling and eccentric but it must be confessed he was not a little astonished by a great deal to which he listened one thing however was clear that whatever might be the demeanour of cadurcis to the circle in which he now moved time and the strange revolutions of his life had not affected his carriage to his old friend it gratified the bishop while he listened to lady monteagles details of the haughty reserved and melancholy demeanour of cadurcis which impressed every one with an idea that some superior being had as a punishment been obliged to visit their humble globe to recall the apparently heartfelt cordiality with which he had resumed his old acquaintance with the former rector of marringhurst  and indeed to speak truth the amiable and unpretending behaviour of cadurcis this day was entirely attributable to the unexpected meeting with this old friend in the hurry of society he could scarcely dwell upon the associations which it was calculated to call up yet more than once he found himself quite absent dwelling on sweet recollections of that cherbury that he had so loved and ever and anon the tones of a familiar voice caught his ear so that they almost made him start they were not the less striking because as masham was seated on the same side of the table as cadurcis his eye had not become habituated to the bishops presence which sometimes he almost doubted  he seized the first opportunity after dinner of engaging his old tutor in conversation he took him affectionately by the arm and led him as if unintentionally to a sofa apart from the rest of the company and seated himself by his side cadurcis was agitated for he was about to inquire of some whom he could not mention without emotion  is it long since you have seen our friends said his lordship if indeed i may call them mine  lady annabel herbert said the bishop  cadurcis bowed  i parted from her about two months back continued the bishop  and cherbury dear cherbury is it unchanged  they have not resided there for more than two years  indeed  they have lived of late at weymouth for the benefit of the sea air  i hope neither lady annabel nor her daughter needs it said lord cadurcis in a tone of much feeling  neither now god be praised replied masham but miss herbert has been a great invalid  there was a rather awkward silence at length lord cadurcis said we meet rather unexpectedly my dear sir  why you have become a great man said the bishop with a smile and one must expect to meet you  ah my dear friend exclaimed lord cadurcis with a sigh i would willingly give a whole existence of a life like this for one year of happiness at cherbury  nay said the bishop with a look of goodnatured mockery this melancholy is all very well in poetry but i always halfsuspected and i am quite sure now that cherbury was not particularly adapted to you  you mistake me said cadurcis mournfully shaking his head  hitherto i have not been so very wrong in my judgment respecting lord cadurcis that i am inclined very easily to give up my opinion replied the bishop  i have often thought of the conversation to which you allude replied lord cadurcis nevertheless there is one opinion i never changed one sentiment that still reigns paramount in my heart  you think so said his companion but perhaps were it more than a sentiment it would cease to flourish  no said lord cadurcis firmly the only circumstance in the world of which i venture to feel certain is my love for venetia  it raged certainly during your last visit to cherbury said the bishop after an interval of five years it has been revived slightly today after an interval of three more by the sight of a mutual acquaintance who has reminded you of her but what have been your feelings in the meantime confess the truth and admit you have very rarely spared a thought to the person to whom you fancy yourself at this moment so passionately devoted  you do not do me justice said lord cadurcis you are prejudiced against me  nay prejudice is not my humour my good lord i decide only from what i myself observe i give my opinion to you at this moment as freely as i did when you last conversed with me at the abbey and when i a little displeased you by speaking what you will acknowledge has since turned out to be the truth  you mean then to say said his lordship with some excitement that you do not believe that i love venetia  i think you do at this moment replied masham and i think he continued smiling that you may probably continue very much in love with her even during the rest of the week  you mock me  nay i am sincerely serious  what then do you mean  i mean that your imagination my lord dwelling for the moment with great power upon the idea of venetia becomes inflamed and your whole mind is filled with her image  a metaphysical description of being in love said lord cadurcis rather dryly  nay said masham i think the heart has something to do with that  but the imagination acts upon the heart rejoined his companion  but it is in the nature of its influence not to endure at this moment i repeat your lordship may perhaps love miss herbert you may go home and muse over her memory and even deplore in passionate verses your misery in being separated from her but in the course of a few days she will be again forgotten  but were she mine urged lord cadurcis eagerly  why you would probably part from her in a year as her father parted from lady annabel  impossible for my imagination could not conceive anything more exquisite than she is  then it would conceive something less exquisite said the bishop it is a restless quality and is ever creative either of good or of evil  ah my dear doctor excuse me for again calling you doctor it is so natural said cadurcis in a tone of affection  call me what you will my dear lord said the good bishop whose heart was moved i can never forget old days  believe me then continued cadurcis that you misjudge me in respect of venetia i feel assured that had we married three years ago i should have been a much happier man  why you have everything to make you happy said the bishop if you are not happy who should be you are young and you are famous all that is now wanted is to be wise  lord cadurcis shrugged his shoulders i am tired of this life he said i am wearied of the same hollow bustle and the same false glitter day after day ah my dear friend when i remember the happy hours when i used to roam through the woods of cherbury with venetia and ramble in that delicious park both young both innocent lit by the sunset and guided by the stars and then remember that it has all ended in this and that this is success glory fame or whatever be the proper title to baptize the bubble the burthen of existence is too great for me  hush hush said his friend rising from the sofa you will be happy if you be wise  but what is wisdom said lord cadurcis  one quality of it in your situation my lord is to keep your head as calm as you can now i must bid you good night  the bishop disappeared and lord cadurcis was immediately surrounded by several fine ladies who were encouraged by the flattering bulletin that his neighbour at dinner who was among them had given of his lordships temper they were rather disappointed to find him sullen sarcastic and even morose as for going to ranelagh he declared that if he had the power of awarding the punishment of his bitterest enemy it would be to consign him for an hour to the barbarous infliction of a promenade in that temple of ennui and as for the owner of the album who anxious about her verses ventured to express a hope that his lordship would call upon her the contemptuous bard gave her what he was in the habit of styling a look and quitted the room without deigning otherwise to acknowledge her hopes and her courtesy     chapter v   we must now return to our friends the herberts who having quitted weymouth without even revisiting cherbury are now on their journey to the metropolis it was not without considerable emotion that lady annabel after an absence of nearly nineteen years contemplated her return to the scene of some of the most extraordinary and painful occurrences of her life as for venetia who knew nothing of towns and cities save from the hasty observations she had made in travelling the idea of london formed only from books and her imagination was invested with even awful attributes mistress pauncefort alone looked forward to their future residence simply with feelings of selfcongratulation at her return after so long an interval to the theatre of former triumphs and pleasures and where she conceived herself so eminently qualified to shine and to enjoy  the travellers entered town towards nightfall by hyde park corner and proceeded to an hotel in st jamess street where lady annabels man of business had engaged them apartments london with its pallid parish lamps scattered at long intervals would have presented but a gloomy appearance to the modern eye habituated to all the splendour of gas but to venetia it seemed difficult to conceive a scene of more brilliant bustle and she leant back in the carriage distracted with the lights and the confusion of the crowded streets when they were once safely lodged in their new residence the tumult of unpacking the carriages had subsided and the ceaseless tongue of pauncefort had in some degree refrained from its wearying and worrying chatter a feeling of loneliness after all this agitation and excitement simultaneously came over the feelings of both mother and daughter though they alike repressed its expression lady annabel was lost in many sad thoughts and venetia felt mournful though she could scarcely define the cause both were silent and they soon sought refuge from fatigue and melancholy in sleep  the next morning it being now april was fortunately bright and clear it certainly was a happy fortune that the fair venetia was not greeted with a fog she rose refreshed and cheerful and joined her mother who was however not a little agitated by an impending visit of which venetia had been long apprised this was from lady annabels brother the former ambassador who had of late returned to his native country the brother and sister had been warmly attached in youth but the awful interval of time that had elapsed since they parted filled venetias mother with many sad and serious reflections the earl and his family had been duly informed of lady annabels visit to the metropolis and had hastened to offer her the hospitality of their home but the offer had been declined with feelings however not a little gratified by the earnestness with which it had been proffered  venetia was now for the first time in her life to see a relative the anticipated meeting excited in her mind rather curiosity than sentiment she could not share the agitation of her mother and yet she looked forward to the arrival of her uncle with extreme inquisitiveness she was not long kept in suspense their breakfast was scarcely finished when he was announced lady annabel turned rather pale and venetia who felt herself as it were a stranger to her blood would have retired had not her mother requested her to remain so she only withdrew to the back of the apartment  her uncle was ten years the senior of his sister but not unlike her tall graceful with those bland and sympathising manners that easily win hearts he entered the room with a smile of affection yet with a composure of deportment that expressed at the same time how sincerely delighted he was at the meeting and how considerately determined at the same time not to indulge in a scene he embraced his sister with tenderness assured her that she looked as young as ever softly chided her for not making his house her home and hoped that they should never part again and he then turned to his niece a fine observer one less interested in the scene than the only witnesses might have detected in the earl notwithstanding his experienced breeding no ordinary surprise and gratification at the sight of the individual whose relationship he was now to claim for the first time  i must claim an uncles privilege he said in a tone of sweetness and some emotion as he pressed with his own the beautiful lips of venetia i ought to be proud of my niece why annabel if only for the honour of our family you should not have kept this jewel so long enshrined in the casket of cherbury  the earl remained with them some hours and his visit was really prolonged by the unexpected pleasure which he found in the society of his relations he would not leave them until they promised to dine with him that day and mentioned that he had prevented his wife from calling with him that morning because he thought after so long a separation it might be better to meet thus quietly then they parted with affectionate cordiality on both sides the earl enchanted to find delightful companions where he was half afraid he might only meet tiresome relatives lady annabel proud of her brother and gratified by his kindness and venetia anxious to ascertain whether all her relations were as charming as her uncle     chapter vi   when lady annabel and her daughter returned from their morning drive they found the visiting ticket of the countess on the table who had also left a note with which she had provided herself in case she was not so fortunate as to meet her relations the note was affectionate and expressed the great delight of the writer at again meeting her dear sister and forming an acquaintance with her charming niece  more relations said venetia with a somewhat droll expression of countenance  at this moment the bishop of who had already called twice upon them unsuccessfully entered the room the sight of this old and dear friend gave great joy he came to engage them to dine with him the next day having already ineffectually endeavoured to obtain them for permanent guests they sat chatting so long with him that they were obliged at last to bid him an abrupt adieu and hasten and make their toilettes for their dinner  their hostess received her relations with a warmth which her husbands praises of her sisterinlaw and niece had originally prompted but which their appearance and manners instantly confirmed as all the earls children were married their party consisted today only of themselves but it was a happy and agreeable meeting for every one was desirous of being amiable to be sure they had not many recollections or associations in common and no one recurred to the past but london and the history of its fleeting hours was an inexhaustible source of amusing conversation and the countess seemed resolved that venetia should have a brilliant season that she should be much amused and much admired lady annabel however put in a plea for moderation at least until venetia was presented but that the countess declared must be at the next drawingroom which was early in the ensuing week venetia listened to glittering narratives of balls and routs operas and theatres breakfasts and masquerades ranelagh and the pantheon with the same smiling composure as if she had been accustomed to them all her life instead of having been shut up in a garden with no livelier or brighter companions than birds and flowers  after dinner as her aunt and uncle and lady annabel sat round the fire talking of her maternal grandfather a subject which did not at all interest her venetia stole from her chair to a table in a distant part of the room and turned over some books and music that were lying upon it among these was a literary journal which she touched almost by accident and which opened with the name of lord cadurcis on the top of its page this of course instantly attracted her attention her eye passed hastily over some sentences which greatly astonished her and extending her arm for a chair without quitting the book she was soon deeply absorbed by the marvels which rapidly unfolded themselves to her the article in question was an elaborate criticism as well of the career as the works of the noble poet for indeed as venetia now learnt they were inseparably blended she gathered from these pages a faint and hasty yet not altogether unfaithful conception of the strange revolution that had occurred in the character pursuits and position of her former companion in that mighty metropolis whose wealth and luxury and power had that morning so vividly impressed themselves upon her consciousness and to the history of whose pleasures and brilliant and fantastic dissipation she had recently been listening with a lively and diverted ear it seemed that by some rapid and magical vicissitude her little plantagenet the faithful and affectionate companion of her childhood whose sorrows she had so often soothed and who in her pure and devoted love had always found consolation and happiness had become the observed of all observers the most remarkable where all was striking and dazzling where all were brilliant  his last visit to cherbury and its strange consequences then occurred to her his passionate addresses and their bitter parting here was surely matter enough for a maidens reverie and into a reverie venetia certainly fell from which she was roused by the voice of her uncle who could not conceive what book his charming niece could find so interesting and led her to feel what an ill compliment she was paying to all present venetia hastily closed the volume and rose rather confused from her seat her radiant smile was the best apology to her uncle and she compensated for her previous inattention by playing to him on the harpsichord all the time however the image of cadurcis flitted across her vision and she was glad when her mother moved to retire that she might enjoy the opportunity of pondering in silence and unobserved over the strange history that she had read  london is a wonderful place fourandtwenty hours back with a feeling of loneliness and depression amounting to pain venetia had fled to sleep as her only refuge now only a day had passed and she had both seen and heard many things that had alike startled and pleased her had found powerful and charming friends and laid her head upon her pillow in a tumult of emotion that long banished slumber from her beautiful eyes     chapter vii   venetia soon found that she must bid adieu for ever in london to her old habits of solitude she soon discovered that she was never to be alone her aunt called upon them early in the morning and said that the whole day must be devoted to their court dresses and in a few minutes they were all whirled off to a celebrated milliners after innumerable consultations and experiments the dress of venetia was decided on her aunt and lady annabel were both assured that it would exceed in splendour and propriety any dress at the drawingroom indeed as the great artist added with such a model to work from it would reflect but little credit on the establishment if any approached miss herbert in the effect she must inevitably produce  while her mother was undergoing some of those attentions to which venetia had recently submitted and had retired for a few minutes into an adjoining apartment our little lady of cherbury strolled about the saloon in which she had been left until her attention was attracted by a portrait of a young man in an oriental dress standing very sublimely amid the ruins of some desert city a palm tree in the distance and by his side a crouching camel and some recumbent followers slumbering amid the fallen columns  that is lord cadurcis my love said her aunt who at the moment joined her the famous poet all the young ladies are in love with him i dare say you know his works by heart  no indeed aunt said venetia i have never even read them but i should like very much  not read lord cadurcis poems oh we must go and get them directly for you everybody reads them you will be looked upon quite as a little barbarian we will stop the carriage at stockdales and get them for you  at this moment lady annabel rejoined them and having made all their arrangements they reentered the carriage  stop at stockdales said her ladyship to the servant i must get cadurcis last poem for venetia she will be quite back in her learning annabel  cadurcis last poem said lady annabel do you mean lord cadurcis is he a poet  to he sure well you are countrified not to know lord cadurcis  i know him very well said lady annabel gravely but i did not know he was a poet  the countess laughed the carriage stopped the book was brought lady annabel looked uneasy and tried to catch her daughters countenance but strange to say for the first time in her life was quite unsuccessful the countess took the book and immediately gave it venetia there my dear said her aunt there never was anything so charming i am so provoked that cadurcis is a whig  a whig said lady annabel he was not a whig when i knew him  oh my dear i am afraid he is worse than a whig he is almost a rebel but then he is such a genius everything is allowed you know to a genius said the thoughtless sisterinlaw  lady annabel was silent but the stillness of her emotion must not be judged from the stillness of her tongue her astonishment at all she had heard was only equalled by what we may justly term her horror it was impossible that she could have listened to any communication at the same time so astounding and to her so fearful  we knew lord cadurcis when he was very young aunt said venetia in a quiet tone he lived near mamma in the country  oh my dear annabel if you see him in town bring him to me he is the most difficult person in the world to get to ones house and i would give anything if he would come and dine with me  the countess at last set her relations down at their hotel when lady annabel was once more alone with her daughter she said venetia dearest give me that book your aunt lent you  venetia immediately handed it to her but her mother did not open it but saying the bishop dines at four darling i think it is time for us to dress lady annabel left the room  to say the truth venetia was less surprised than disappointed by this conduct of her mothers but she was not apt to murmur and she tried to dismiss the subject from her thoughts  it was with unfeigned delight that the kindhearted masham welcomed under his own roof his two best and dearest friends he had asked nobody to meet them it was settled that they were to be quite alone and to talk of nothing but cherbury and marringhurst when they were seated at table the bishop who had been detained at the house of lords and been rather hurried to be in time to receive his guests turned to his servant and inquired whether any one had called  yes my lord lord cadurcis was the reply  our old companion said the bishop to lady annabel with a smile he has called upon me twice and i have on both occasions unfortunately been absent  lady annabel merely bowed an assent to the bishops remark venetia longed to speak but found it impossible what is it that represses me she asked herself is there to be another forbidden subject insensibly to arise between us i must struggle against this indefinable despotism that seems to pervade my life  have you met lord cadurcis sir at length asked venetia  once we resumed our acquaintance at a dinner party one day but i shall soon see a great deal of him for he has just taken his seat he is of age you know  i hope he has come to years of discretion in every sense said lady annabel but i fear not  oh my dear lady said the bishop he has become a great man he is our star i assure you there is nobody in london talked of but lord cadurcis he asked me a great deal after you and cherbury he will be delighted to see you  i cannot say replied lady annabel that the desire of meeting is at all mutual from all i hear our connections and opinions are very different and i dare say our habits likewise  my aunt lent us his new poem today said venetia boldly  have you read it asked the bishop  i am no admirer of modern poetry said lady annabel somewhat tartly  poetry of any kind is not much in my way said the bishop but if you like to read his poems i will lend them to you for he gave me a copy esteemed a great honour i assure you  thank you my lord said lady annabel both venetia and myself are much engaged now and i do not wish her to read while she is in london when we return to cherbury she will have abundance of time if desirable  both venetia and her worthy host felt that the present subject of conversation was not agreeable to lady annabel and it was changed they fell upon more gracious topics and in spite of this somewhat sullen commencement the meeting was quite as delightful as they anticipated lady annabel particularly exerted herself to please and as was invariably the case under such circumstances with this lady she was eminently successful she apparently endeavoured by her remarkable kindness to her daughter to atone for any unpleasant feeling which her previous manner might for an instant have occasioned venetia watched her beautiful and affectionate parent as lady annabel now dwelt with delight upon the remembrance of their happy home and now recurred to the anxiety she naturally felt about her daughters approaching presentation with feelings of love and admiration which made her accuse herself for the recent rebellion of her heart she thought only of her mothers sorrows and her devotion to her child and grateful for the unexpected course of circumstances which seemed to be leading every member of their former little society to honour and happiness she resolved to persist in that career of duty and devotion to her mother from which it seemed to her she had never deviated for a moment but to experience sorrow misfortune and remorse never did venetia receive her mothers accustomed embrace and blessing with more responsive tenderness and gratitude than this night she banished cadurcis and his poems from her thoughts confident that so long as her mother approved neither of her continuing his acquaintance nor perusing his writings it was well that the one should be a forgotten tie and the other a sealed book     chapter viii   among the intimate acquaintances of lady annabels brother was the nobleman who had been a minister during the american war and who had also been the guardian of lord cadurcis of whom indeed he was likewise a distant relative he had called with his wife on lady annabel after meeting her and her daughter at her brothers and had cultivated her acquaintance with great kindness and assiduity so that lady annabel had found it impossible to refuse his invitation to dinner  this dinner occurred a few days after the visit of the herberts to the bishop and that excellent personage her own family and some others equally distinguished but all of the ministerial party were invited to meet her lady annabel found herself placed at table between a pompous courtier who being a gourmand was not very prompt to disturb his enjoyment by conversation and a young man whom she found very agreeable and who at first indeed attracted her attention by his resemblance to some face with which she felt she was familiar and yet which she was not successful in recalling his manners were remarkably frank and ingenuous yet soft and refined without having any peculiar brilliancy of expression he was apt and fluent and his whole demeanour characterised by a gentle modesty that was highly engaging apparently he had travelled a great deal for he more than once alluded to his experience of foreign countries but this was afterwards explained by lady annabel discovering from an observation he let fall that he was a sailor a passing question from an opposite guest also told her that he was a member of parliament while she was rather anxiously wishing to know who he might be and congratulating herself that one in whose favour she was so much prepossessed should be on the right side their host saluted him from the top of the table and said captain cadurcis a glass of wine  the countenance was now explained it was indeed lord cadurcis whom he resembled though his eyes were dark blue and his hair light brown this then was that cousin who had been sent to sea to make his fortune and whom lady annabel had a faint recollection of poor mrs cadurcis once mentioning george cadurcis had not exactly made his fortune but he had distinguished himself in his profession and especially in rodneys victory and had fought his way up to the command of a frigate the frigate had recently been paid off and he had called to pay his respects to his noble relative with the hope of obtaining his interest for a new command the guardian of his cousin mortified with the conduct of his hopeful ward was not very favourably impressed towards any one who bore the name of cadurcis yet george with no pretence had a winning honest manner that made friends his lordship took a fancy to him and as he could not at the moment obtain him a ship he did the next best thing for him in his power a borough was vacant and he put him into parliament  do you know said lady annabel to her neighbour i have been fancying all dinner time that we had met before but i find it is that you only resemble one with whom i was once acquainted  my cousin said the captain he will be very mortified when i go home if i tell him your ladyship speaks of his acquaintance as one that is past  it is some years since we met said lady annabel in a more reserved tone  plantagenet can never forget what he owes to you said captain cadurcis how often has he spoken to me of you and miss herbert it was only the other night yes not a week ago that he made me sit up with him all night while he was telling stories of cherbury you see i am quite familiar with the spot he added smiling  you are very intimate with your cousin i see said lady annabel  i live a great deal with him said george cadurcis you know we had never met or communicated and it was not plantagenets fault i am sure for of all the generous amiable lovable beings cadurcis is the best i ever met with in this world ever since we knew each other he has been a brother to me and though our politics and opinions are so opposed and we naturally live in such a different circle he would have insisted even upon my having apartments in his house nor is it possible for me to give you the slightest idea of the delicate and unceasing kindness i experience from him if we had lived together all our lives it would be impossible to be more united  this eulogium rather softened lady annabels heart she even observed i always thought lord cadurcis naturally well disposed i always hoped he would turn out well but i was afraid from what i heard he was much changed he shows however his sense and good feeling in selecting you for his friend for you are his natural one she added after a momentary pause  and then you know he continued it is so purely kind of him for of course i am not fit to be a companion for cadurcis and perhaps as far as that no one is of course we have not a thought in common i know nothing but what i have picked up in a rough life and he you know is the cleverest person that ever lived at least i think so  lady annabel smiled  well he is very young she observed much your junior captain cadurcis and i hope he will yet prove a faithful steward of the great gifts that god has given him  i would stake all i hold dear said the captain with great animation that cadurcis turns out well he has such a good heart ah lady annabel if he be now and then a little irregular only think of the temptations that assail him only oneandtwenty his own master and all london at his feet it is too much for any ones head but say or think what the world may i know him better than they do and i know there is not a finer creature in existence i hope his old friends will not desert him added captain cadurcis with a smile which seemed to deprecate the severity of lady annabel for in spite of all his fame and prosperity perhaps after all this is the time when he most needs them  very possibly said her ladyship rather dryly  while the mother was engaged in this conversation with her neighbour respecting her former interesting acquaintance such was the fame of lord cadurcis then in the metropolis that he also formed the topic of conversation at another part of the table to which the daughter was an attentive listener the tone in which he was spoken of however was of a very different character while no one disputed his genius his principles temper and habits of life were submitted to the severest scrutiny and it was with blended feelings of interest and astonishment that venetia listened to the detail of wild opinions capricious conduct and extravagant and eccentric behaviour ascribed to the companion of her childhood who had now become the spoiled child of society a shrewd gentleman who had taken an extremely active part in this discussion inquired of venetia next to whom he was seated whether she had read his lordships last poem he was extremely surprised when venetia answered in the negative but he seized the opportunity of giving her an elaborate criticism on the poetical genius of cadurcis as for his style said the critic no one can deny that is his own and he will last by his style as for his philosophy and all these wild opinions of his they will pass away because they are not genuine they are not his own they are borrowed he will outwrite them depend upon it he will the fact is as a friend of mine observed the other day herberts writings have turned his head of course you could know nothing about them but there are wonderful things in them i can tell you that  i believe it most sincerely said venetia  the critic stared at his neighbour hush said he his wife and daughter are here we must not talk of these things you know lady annabel herbert there she is a very fine woman too and that is his daughter there i believe that dark girl with a turnedup nose i cannot say she warrants the poetical address to her    my precious pearl the false and glittering world   has neer polluted with its garish light  she does not look much like a pearl does she she should keep in solitude eh  the ladies rose and relieved venetia from her embarrassment  after dinner lady annabel introduced george cadurcis to her daughter and seated by them both he contrived without effort and without the slightest consciousness of success to confirm the pleasing impression in his favour which he had already made and when they parted it was even with a mutual wish that they might meet again     chapter ix   it was the night after the drawingroom lord cadurcis was at brookes dining at midnight having risen since only a few hours being a malcontent he had ceased to attend the court where his original reception had been most gracious which he had returned by some factious votes and a caustic lampoon  a party of young men entered from the court ball which in those days always terminated at midnight whence the guests generally proceeded to ranelagh one or two of them seated themselves at the table at which cadurcis was sitting they were full of a new beauty who had been presented their violent and even extravagant encomiums excited his curiosity such a creature had never been seen she was peerless the most radiant of acknowledged charms had been dimmed before her their majesties had accorded to her the most marked reception a prince of the blood had honoured her with his hand then they began to expatiate with fresh enthusiasm on her unparalleled loveliness  o cadurcis said a young noble who was one of his extreme admirers she is the only creature i ever beheld worthy of being one of your heroines  whom are you talking about asked cadurcis in a rather listless tone  the new beauty of course  and who may she be  miss herbert to be sure who speaks or thinks of any one else  what ve i mean miss herbert exclaimed cadurcis with no little energy  yes do you know her  do you mean to say and cadurcis stopped and rose from the table and joined the party round the fire what miss herbert is it he added after a short pause  why the miss herbert herberts daughter to be sure she was presented today by her mother  lady annabel  the same  presented today said cadurcis audibly yet speaking as it were to himself presented today presented how strange  so every one thinks one of the strangest things that ever happened remarked a bystander  and i did not even know they were in town continued cadurcis for from his irregular hours he had not seen his cousin since the party of yesterday he began walking up and down the room muttering masham weymouth london presented at court and i know nothing how life changes venetia at court my venetia then turning round and addressing the young nobleman who had first spoken to him he asked if the ball were over  yes all the world are going to ranelagh are you inclined to take a round  i have a strange fancy said cadurcis and if you will go with me i will take you in my visàvis it is here  this was an irresistible invitation and in a few minutes the companions were on their way cadurcis apparently with no peculiar interest in the subject leading the conversation very artfully to the presentation of miss herbert his friend was heartily inclined to gratify his curiosity he gave him ample details of miss herberts person even of her costume and the sensation both produced how she was presented by her mother who after so long an estrangement from the world scarcely excited less impression and the remarkable cordiality with which both mother and daughter were greeted by the sovereign and his royal consort  the two young noblemen found ranelagh crowded but the presence of lord cadurcis occasioned a sensation the moment he was recognised everywhere the whisper went round and many parties crowded near to catch a glimpse of the hero of the day which is he that fair tall young man no the other to be sure is it really he how distinguished how melancholy quite the poet do you think he is really so unhappy as he looks i would sooner see him than the king and queen he seems very young but then he has seen so much of the world fine eyes beautiful hair i wonder who is his friend how proud he must be who is that lady he bowed to that is the duke of  speaking to him such were the remarks that might be caught in the vicinity of lord cadurcis as he took his round gazed at by the assembled crowd of whom many knew him only by fame for the charm of ranelagh was that it was rather a popular than a merely fashionable assembly society at large blended with the court which maintained and renewed its influence by being witnessed under the most graceful auspices the personal authority of the aristocracy has decreased with the disappearance of ranelagh and similar places of amusement where rank was not exclusive and luxury by the gratification it occasioned others seemed robbed of half its selfism  in his second round lord cadurcis recognised the approach of the herberts they formed the portion of a large party lady annabel was leaning on her brother whom cadurcis knew by sight venetia was at the side of her aunt and several gentlemen were hovering about them among them to his surprise his cousin george cadurcis in his uniform for he had been to court and to the court ball venetia was talking with animation she was in her court dress and in powder her appearance was strange to him he could scarcely recognise the friend of his childhood but without any doubt in all that assembly unrivalled in the whole world for beauty grace and splendour she was without a parallel a cynosure on which all eyes were fixed  so occupied were the ladies of the herbert party by the conversation of their numerous and brilliant attendants that the approach of any one else but lord cadurcis might have been unnoticed by them but a hundred tongues before he drew nigh had prepared venetia for his appearance she was indeed most anxious to behold him and though she was aware that her heart fluttered not slightly as the moment was at hand she commanded her gaze and her eyes met his although she was doubtful whether he might choose or care to recognise her he bowed almost to the ground and when venetia had raised her responsive head he had passed by  why cadurcis you know miss herbert said his friend in a tone of some astonishment  well but it is a long time since i have seen her  is she not beautiful  i never doubted on that subject i tell you scrope we must contrive to join her party i wish we had some of our friends among them here comes the monteagle aid me to escape her  the most fascinating smile failed in arresting the progress of cadurcis fortunately the lady was the centre of a brilliant band all that he had to do therefore was boldly to proceed  do you think my cousin is altered since you knew him inquired george cadurcis of venetia  i scarcely had time to observe him she replied  i wish you would let me bring him to you he did not know until this moment you were in town i have not seen him since we met yesterday  oh no said venetia do not disturb him  in time however lord cadurcis was again in sight and now without any hesitation he stopped and falling into the line by miss herbert he addressed her i am proud of being remembered by miss herbert he said  i am most happy to meet you replied venetia with unaffected sincerity  and lady annabel i have not been able to catch her eye is she quite well i was ignorant that you were in london until i heard of your triumph this night  the countess whispered her niece and venetia accordingly presented lord cadurcis to her aunt this was a most gratifying circumstance to him he was anxious by some means or other to effect his entrance into her circle and he had an irresistible suspicion that lady annabel no longer looked upon him with eyes of favour so he resolved to enlist the aunt as his friend few persons could be more winning than cadurcis when he willed it and every attempt to please from one whom all emulated to gratify and honour was sure to be successful the countess who in spite of politics was a secret votary of his was quite prepared to be enchanted she congratulated herself on forming as she had long wished an acquaintance with one so celebrated she longed to pass lady monteagle in triumph cadurcis improved his opportunity to the utmost it was impossible for any one to be more engaging lively yet at the same time gentle and deferential with all his originality he spoke indeed more to the aunt than to venetia but when he addressed the latter there was a melting almost a mournful tenderness in his tones that alike affected her heart and charmed her imagination nor could she be insensible to the gratification she experienced as she witnessed every instant the emotion his presence excited among the passersby and of which cadurcis himself seemed so properly and so utterly unconscious and this was plantagenet  lord cadurcis spoke of his cousin who on his joining the party had assisted the arrangement by moving to the other side and he spoke of him with a regard which pleased venetia though cadurcis envied him his good fortune in having the advantage of a prior acquaintance with miss herbert in town but then we are old acquaintances in the country he added half in a playful half in a melancholy tone are we not  it is a long time that we have known each other and it is a long time since we have met replied venetia  a delicate reproach said cadurcis but perhaps rather my misfortune than my fault my thoughts have been often i might say ever at cherbury  and the abbey have you forgotten the abbey  i have never been near it since a morning you perhaps remember said his lordship in a low voice ah miss herbert he continued with a sigh i was young then i have lived to change many opinions and some of which you then disapproved  the party stopped at a box just vacant and in which the ladies seated themselves while their carriages were inquired for lord cadurcis with a rather faltering heart went up to pay his respects to venetias mother lady annabel received him with a courtesy that however was scarcely cordial but the countess instantly presented him to her husband with an unction which a little astonished her sisterinlaw then a whisper but unobserved passed between the earl and his lady and in a minute lord cadurcis had been invited to dine with them on the next day and meet his old friends from the country cadurcis was previously engaged but hesitated not a moment in accepting the invitation the monteagle party now passed by the lady looked a little surprised at the company in which she found her favourite and not a little mortified by his neglect what business had cadurcis to be speaking to that miss herbert was it not enough that the whole day not another name had scarcely crossed her ear but the night must even witness the conquest of lord cadurcis by the new beauty it was such bad ton it was so unlike him it was so underbred for a person of his position immediately to bow before the new idol of the hour and a tory girl too it was the last thing she could have expected from him she should on the contrary have thought that the universal admiration which this miss herbert commanded would have been exactly the reason why a man like cadurcis would have seemed almost unconscious of her existence she determined to remonstrate with him and she was sure of a speedy opportunity for he was to dine with her on the morrow     chapter x   notwithstanding lady annabels reserved demeanour lord cadurcis supported by the presence of his cousin whom he had discovered to be a favourite of that lady ventured to call upon her the next day but she was out they were to meet however at dinner where cadurcis determined to omit no opportunity to propitiate her the countess had a great deal of tact and she contrived to make up a party to receive him in which there were several of his friends among them his cousin and the bishop of and no strangers who were not like herself his great admirers but if she had known more she need not have given herself this trouble for there was a charm among her guests of which she was ignorant and cadurcis went determined to please and to be pleased  at dinner he was seated next to lady annabel and it was impossible for any person to be more deferential soft and insinuating he spoke of old days with emotion which he did not attempt to suppress he alluded to the present with infinite delicacy but it was very difficult to make way lady annabel was courteous but she was reserved his lively reminiscences elicited from her no corresponding sentiment and no art would induce her to dwell upon the present if she only would have condescended to compliment him it would have given him an opportunity of expressing his distaste of the life which he now led and a description of the only life which he wished to lead but lady annabel studiously avoided affording him any opening of the kind she treated him like a stranger she impressed upon him without effort that she would only consider him an acquaintance how cadurcis satiated with the incense of the whole world sighed for one single congratulation from lady annabel nothing could move her  i was so surprised to meet you last night at length he again observed i have made so many inquiries after you our dear friend the bishop was i fear almost wearied with my inquiries after cherbury i know not how it was i felt quite a pang when i heard that you had left it and that all these years when i have been conjuring up so many visions of what was passing under that dear roof you were at weymouth  yes we were at weymouth some time  but do not you long to see cherbury again i cannot tell you how i pant for it for my part i have seen the world and i have seen enough of it after all the end of all our exertions is to be happy at home that is the end of everything dont you think so  a happy home is certainly a great blessing replied lady annabel and a rare one  but why should it be rare inquired lord cadurcis  it is our own fault said lady annabel our vanity drives us from our hearths  but we soon return again and calm and cooled for my part i have no object in life but to settle down at the old abbey and never to quit again our woods but i shall lead a dull life without my neighbours he added with a smile and in a tone halfcoaxing  i suppose you never see lord  now said lady annabel mentioning his late guardian there was as cadurcis fancied some sarcasm in the question though not in the tone in which it was asked  no i never see him his lordship answered firmly we differ in our opinions and i differ from him with regret but i differ from a sense of duty and therefore i have no alternative  the claims of duty are of course paramount observed lady annabel  you know my cousin said cadurcis to turn the conversation  yes and i like him much he appears to be a sensible amiable person of excellent principles  i am not bound to admire georges principles said lord cadurcis gaily but i respect them because i know that they are conscientious i love george he is my only relation and he is my friend  i trust he will always be your friend for i think you will then at least know one person on whom you can depend  i believe it the friendships of the world are wind  i am surprised to hear you say so said lady annabel  why lady annabel  you have so many friends  lord cadurcis smiled i wish he said after a little hesitation if only for auld lang syne i might include lady annabel herbert among them  i do not think there is any basis for friendship between us my lord she said very dryly  the past must ever be with me said lord cadurcis and i should have thought a sure and solid one  our opinions on all subjects are so adverse that i must believe that there could be no great sympathy in our feelings  my feelings are beyond my control he replied they are and must ever be totally independent of my opinions  lady annabel did not reply his lordship felt baffled but he was resolved to make one more effort  do you know he said i can scarcely believe myself in london today to be sitting next to you to see miss herbert to hear dr mashams voice oh does it not recall cherbury or marringhurst or that day at cadurcis when you were so good as to smile over my rough repast ah lady annabel those days were happy those were feelings that can never die all the glitter and hubbub of the world can never make me forget them can never make you i hope lady annabel quite recall them with an effort we were friends then let us be friends now  i am too old to cultivate new friendships said lady annabel and if we are to be friends lord cadurcis i am sorry to say that after the interval that has occurred since we last parted we should have to begin again  it is a long time said cadurcis mournfully a very long time and one in spite of what the world may think to which i cannot look back with any selfcongratulation i wished three years ago never to leave cadurcis again indeed i did and indeed it was not my fault that i quitted it  it was no ones fault i hope whatever the cause may have been i have ever remained quite ignorant of it i wished and wish to remain ignorant of it i for one have ever considered it the wise dispensation of a merciful providence  cadurcis ground his teeth a dark look came over him which when once it rose on his brow was with difficulty dispelled and for the remainder of the dinner he continued silent and gloomy  he was however not unobserved by venetia she had watched his evident attempts to conciliate her mother with lively interest she had witnessed their failure with sincere sorrow in spite of that stormy interview the results of which in his hasty departure and the severance of their acquaintance she had often regretted she had always retained for him the greatest affection during these three years he had still in her inmost heart remained her own plantagenet her adopted brother whom she loved and in whose welfare her feelings were deeply involved the mysterious circumstances of her birth and the discoveries to which they had led had filled her mind with a fanciful picture of human nature over which she had long brooded a great poet had become her ideal of a man sometimes she had sighed when musing over her father and plantagenet on the solitary seashore at weymouth that cadurcis instead of being the merely amiable and somewhat narrowminded being that she supposed had not been invested with those brilliant and commanding qualities which she felt could alone master her esteem often had she in those abstracted hours played with her imagination in combining the genius of her father with the soft heart of that friend to whom she was so deeply attached she had wished in her reveries that cadurcis might have been a great man that he might have existed in an atmosphere of glory amid the plaudits and admiration of his race and that then he might have turned from all that fame so dear to them both to the heart which could alone sympathise with the native simplicity of his childhood  the ladies withdrew the bishop and another of the guests joined them after a short interval the rest remained below and drank their wine with the freedom not unusual in those days lord cadurcis among them although it was not his habit but he was not convivial though he never passed the bottle untouched he was in one of those dark humours of which there was a latent spring in his nature but which in old days had been kept in check by his simple life his inexperienced mind and the general kindness that greeted him and which nothing but the caprice and perversity of his mother could occasionally develope but since the great revolution in his position since circumstances had made him alike acquainted with his nature and had brought all society to acknowledge its superiority since he had gained and felt his irresistible power and had found all the world and all the glory of it at his feet these moods had become more frequent the slightest reaction in the selfcomplacency that was almost unceasingly stimulated by the applause of applauded men and the love of the loveliest women instantly took the shape and found refuge in the immediate form of the darkest spleen generally indeed brooding in silence and if speaking expressing itself only in sarcasm cadurcis was indeed as we have already described him the spoiled child of society a froward and petted darling not always to be conciliated by kindness but furious when neglected or controlled he was habituated to triumph it had been his lot to come to see and to conquer even the procrastination of certain success was intolerable to him his energetic volition could not endure a check to lady annabel herbert indeed he was not exactly what he was to others there was a spell in old associations from which he unconsciously could not emancipate himself and from which it was his opinion he honoured her in not desiring to be free he had his reasons for wishing to regain his old his natural influence over her heart he did not doubt for an instant that if cadurcis sued success must follow the condescending effort he had sued and he had been met with coldness almost with disdain he had addressed her in those terms of tenderness which experience had led him to believe were irresistible yet to which he seldom had recourse for hitherto he had not been under the degrading necessity of courting he had dwelt with fondness on the insignificant past because it was connected with her he had regretted or affected even to despise the glorious present because it seemed for some indefinite cause to have estranged him from her hearth yes he had humbled himself before her he had thrown with disdain at her feet all that dazzling fame and expanding glory which seemed his peculiar and increasing privilege he had delicately conveyed to her that even these would be sacrificed not only without a sigh but with cheerful delight to find himself once more living as of old in the limited world of her social affections three years ago he had been rejected by the daughter because he was an undistinguished youth now the mother recoiled from his fame and who was this woman the same cold stern heart that had alienated the gifted herbert the same narrow rigid mind that had repudiated ties that every other woman in the world would have gloried to cherish and acknowledge and with her he had passed his prejudiced youth and fancied like an idiot that he had found sympathy yes so long as he was a slave a mechanical submissive slave bowing his mind to all the traditionary bigotry which she adored never daring to form an opinion for himself worshipping her idol custom and labouring by habitual hypocrisy to perpetuate the delusions of all around her  in the meantime while lord cadurcis was chewing the cud of these bitter feelings we will take the opportunity of explaining the immediate cause of lady annabels frigid reception of his friendly advances all that she had heard of cadurcis all the information she had within these few days so rapidly acquired of his character and conduct were indeed not calculated to dispose her to witness the renewal of their intimacy with feelings of remarkable satisfaction but this morning she had read his poem the poem that all london was talking of and she had read it with horror she looked upon cadurcis as a lost man with her indeed since her marriage an imaginative mind had become an object of terror but there were some peculiarities in the tone of cadurcis genius which magnified to excess her general apprehension on this head she traced in every line the evidences of a raging vanity which she was convinced must prompt its owner to sacrifice on all occasions every feeling of duty to its gratification amid all the fervour of rebellious passions and the violence of a wayward mind a sentiment of profound egotism appeared to her impressed on every page she perused great as might have been the original errors of herbert awful as in her estimation were the crimes to which they had led him they might in the first instance be traced rather to a perverted view of society than of himself but self was the idol of cadurcis self distorted into a phantom that seemed to lady annabel pregnant not only with terrible crimes but with the basest and most humiliating vices the certain degradation which in the instance of her husband had been the consequence of a bad system would in her opinion in the case of cadurcis be the result of a bad nature and when she called to mind that there had once been a probability that this individual might have become the husband of her venetia her child whom it had been the sole purpose of her life to save from the misery of which she herself had been the victim that she had even dwelt on the idea with complacency encouraged its progress regretted its abrupt termination but consoled herself by the flattering hope that time with even more favourable auspices would mature it into fulfilment she trembled and turned pale  it was to the bishop that after dinner lady annabel expressed some of the feelings which the reappearance of cadurcis had occasioned her  i see nothing but misery for his future she exclaimed i tremble for him when he addresses me in spite of the glittering surface on which he now floats i foresee only a career of violence degradation and remorse  he is a problem difficult to solve replied masham but there are elements not only in his character but his career so different from those of the person of whom we were speaking that i am not inclined at once to admit that the result must necessarily be the same  i see none replied lady annabel at least none of sufficient influence to work any material change  what think you of his success replied masham cadurcis is evidently proud of it with all his affected scorn of the world he is the slave of society he may pique the feelings of mankind but i doubt whether he will outrage them  he is on such a dizzy eminence replied lady annabel that i do not believe he is capable of calculating so finely he does not believe i am sure in the possibility of resistance his vanity will tempt him onwards  not to persecution said masham now my opinion of cadurcis is that his egotism or selfism or whatever you may style it will ultimately preserve him from any very fatal from any irrecoverable excesses he is of the world worldly all his works all his conduct tend only to astonish mankind he is not prompted by any visionary ideas of ameliorating his species the instinct of selfpreservation will serve him as ballast  we shall see said lady annabel for myself whatever may be his end i feel assured that great and disgraceful vicissitudes are in store for him  it is strange after what in comparison with such extraordinary changes must be esteemed so brief an interval observed masham with a smile to witness such a revolution in his position i often think to myself can this indeed be our little plantagenet  it is awful said lady annabel much more than strange for myself when i recall certain indications of his feelings when he was last at cadurcis and think for a moment of the results to which they might have led i shiver i assure you my dear lord i tremble from head to foot and i encouraged him i smiled with fondness on his feelings i thought i was securing the peaceful happiness of my child what can we trust to in this world it is too dreadful to dwell upon it must have been an interposition of providence that venetia escaped  dear little venetia exclaimed the good bishop for i believe i shall call her little venetia to the day of my death how well she looks tonight her aunt is i think very fond of her see  yes it pleases me said lady annabel but i do wish my sister was not such an admirer of lord cadurcis poems you cannot conceive how uneasy it makes me i am quite annoyed that he was asked here today why ask him  oh there is no harm said masham you must forget the past by all accounts cadurcis is not a marrying man indeed as i understood marriage with him is at present quite out of the question and as for venetia she rejected him before and she will if necessary reject him again he has been a brother to her and after that he can be no more girls never fall in love with those with whom they are bred up  i hope i believe there is no occasion for apprehension replied lady annabel indeed it has scarcely entered my head the very charms he once admired in venetia can have no sway over him as i should think now i should believe him as little capable of appreciating venetia now as he was when last at cherbury of anticipating the change in his own character  you mean opinions my dear lady for characters never change believe me cadurcis is radically the same as in old days circumstances have only developed his latent predisposition  not changed my dear lord what that innocent sweettempered docile child  hush here he comes  the earl and his guests entered the room a circle was formed round lady annabel some evening visitors arrived there was singing it had not been the intention of lord cadurcis to return to the drawingroom after his rebuff by lady annabel he had meditated making his peace at monteagle house but when the moment of his projected departure had arrived he could not resist the temptation of again seeing venetia he entered the room last and some moments after his companions lady annabel who watched the general entrance concluded he had gone and her attention was now fully engaged lord cadurcis remained at the end of the room alone apparently abstracted and looking far from amiable but his eye in reality was watching venetia suddenly her aunt approached her and invited the lady who was conversing with miss herbert to sing lord cadurcis immediately advanced and took her seat venetia was surprised that for the first time in her life with plantagenet she felt embarrassed she had met his look when he approached her and had welcomed or at least intended to welcome him with a smile but she was at a loss for words she was haunted with the recollection of her mothers behaviour to him at dinner and she looked down on the ground far from being at ease  venetia said lord cadurcis  she started  we are alone he said let me call you venetia when we are alone  she did not she could not reply she felt confused the blood rose to her cheek  how changed is everything continued cadurcis to think the day should ever arrive when i should have to beg your permission to call you venetia  she looked up she met his glance it was mournful nay his eyes were suffused with tears she saw at her side the gentle and melancholy plantagenet of her childhood  i cannot speak i am agitated at meeting you she said with her native frankness it is so long since we have been alone and as you say all is so changed  but are you changed venetia he said in a voice of emotion for all other change is nothing  i meet you with pleasure she replied i hear of your fame with pride you cannot suppose that it is possible i should cease to be interested in your welfare  your mother does not meet me with pleasure she hears of nothing that has occurred to me with pride your mother has ceased to take an interest in my welfare and why should you be unchanged  you mistake my mother  no no replied cadurcis shaking his head i have read her inmost soul today your mother hates me me whom she once styled her son she was a mother once to me and you were my sister if i have lost her heart why have i not lost yours  my heart if you care for it is unchanged said venetia  o venetia whatever you may think i never wanted the solace of a sisters love more than i do at this moment  i pledged my affection to you when we were children replied venetia you have done nothing to forfeit it and it is yours still  when we were children said cadurcis musingly when we were innocent when we were happy you at least are innocent still are you happy venetia  life has brought sorrows even to me plantagenet  the blood deserted his heart when she called him plantagenet he breathed with difficulty  when i last returned to cherbury he said you told me you were changed venetia you revealed to me on another occasion the secret cause of your affliction i was a boy then a foolish ignorant boy instead of sympathising with your heartfelt anxiety my silly vanity was offended by feelings i should have shared and soothed and honoured ah venetia well had it been for one of us that i had conducted myself more kindly more wisely  nay plantagenet believe me i remember that interview only to regret it the recollection of it has always occasioned me great grief we were both to blame but we were both children then we must pardon each others faults  you will hear that is if you care to listen venetia much of my conduct and opinions continued lord cadurcis that may induce you to believe me headstrong and capricious perhaps i am less of both in all things than the world imagines but of this be certain that my feelings towards you have never changed whatever you may permit them to be and if some of my boyish judgments have as was but natural undergone some transformation be you my sweet friend in some degree consoled for the inconsistency since i have at length learned duly to appreciate one of whom we then alike knew little but whom a natural inspiration taught you at least justly to appreciate i need not say i mean the illustrious father of your being  venetia could not restrain her tears she endeavoured to conceal her agitated countenance behind the fan with which she was fortunately provided  to me a forbidden subject said venetia at least with them i could alone converse upon it but one that my mind never deserts  o venetia exclaimed lord cadurcis with a sigh would we were both with him  a wild thought she murmured and one i must not dwell upon  we shall meet i hope said lord cadurcis we must meet meet often i called upon your mother today fruitlessly you must attempt to conciliate her why should we be parted we at least are friends and more than friends i cannot exist unless we meet and meet with the frankness of old days  i think you mistake mamma i think you may indeed remember how lately she has met you and after how long an interval a little time and she will resume her former feelings and believe that you have never forfeited yours besides we have friends mutual friends my aunt admires you and here i naturally must be a great deal and the bishop he still loves you that i am sure he does and your cousin mamma likes your cousin i am sure if you can manage only to be patient if you will only attempt to conciliate a little all will be as before remember too how changed your position is venetia added with a smile you allow me to forget you are a great man but mamma is naturally restrained by all this wonderful revolution when she finds that you really are the lord cadurcis whom she knew such a very little boy the lord cadurcis who without her aid would never have been able even to write his fine poems oh she must love you again how can she help it  cadurcis smiled we shall see he said in the meantime do not you desert me venetia  that is impossible she replied the happiest of my days have been passed with you you remember the inscription on the jewel i shall keep to my vows  that was a very good inscription so far as it went said cadurcis and then as if a little alarmed at his temerity he changed the subject  do you know said venetia after a pause i am treating you all this time as a poet merely in deference to public opinion not a line have i been permitted to read but i am resolved to rebel and you must arrange it all  ah said the enraptured cadurcis this is fame  at this moment the countess approached them and told venetia that her mother wished to speak to her lady annabel had discovered the têteàtête and resolved instantly to terminate it lord cadurcis however who was quick as lightning read all that was necessary in venetias look instead of instantly retiring he remained some little time longer talked to the countess who was perfectly enchanted with him even sauntered up to the singers and complimented them and did not make his bow until he had convinced at least the mistress of the mansion if not her sisterinlaw that it was not venetia herbert who was his principal attraction in this agreeable society     chapter xi   the moment he had quitted venetia lord cadurcis returned home he could not endure the usual routine of gaiety after her society and his coachman often waiting until five oclock in the morning at monteagle house could scarcely assure himself of his good fortune in this exception to his accustomed trial of patience the visàvis stopped and lord cadurcis bounded out with a light step and a lighter heart his table was covered with letters the first one that caught his eye was a missive from lady monteagle cadurcis seized it like a wild animal darting on its prey tore it in half without opening it and grasping the poker crammed it with great energy into the fire this exploit being achieved cadurcis began walking up and down the room and indeed he paced it for nearly a couple of hours in a deep reverie and evidently under a considerable degree of excitement for his gestures were violent and his voice often audible at length about an hour after midnight he rang for his valet tore off his cravat and hurled it to one corner of the apartment called for his robe de chambre soda water and more lights seated himself and began pouring forth faster almost than his pen could trace the words the poem that he had been meditating ever since he had quitted the roof where he had met venetia she had expressed a wish to read his poems he had resolved instantly to compose one for her solitary perusal thus he relieved his heart    i    within a cloistered pile whose gothic towers   rose by the margin of a sedgy lake   embosomed in a valley of green bowers   and girt by many a grove and ferny brake   loved by the antlered deer a tender youth   whom time to childhoods gentle sway of love   still spared yet innocent as is the dove   nor mounded yet by cares relentless tooth   stood musing of that fair antique domain   the orphan lord and yet no childish thought   with wayward purpose holds its transient reign   in his young mind with deeper feelings fraught   then mystery all to him and yet a dream   that time has touched with its revealing beam    ii    there came a maiden to that lonely boy   and like to him as is the morn to night   her sunny face a very type of joy   and with her souls unclouded lustre bright   still scantier summers had her brow illumed   than that on which she threw a witching smile   unconscious of the spell that could beguile   his being of the burthen it was doomed   by his ancestral blood to bear a spirit   rife with desponding thoughts and fancies drear   a moody soul that men sometimes inherit   and worse than all the woes the world may bear   but when he met that maidens dazzling eye   he bade each gloomy image baffled fly    iii    amid the shady woods and sunny lawns   the maiden and the youth now wander gay   as the bright birds and happy as the fawns   their sportive rivals that around them play   their light hands linked in love the golden hours   unconscious fly while thus they graceful roam   and careless ever till the voice of home   recalled them from their sunshine find their flowers   for then they parted to his lonely pile   the orphanchief for though his woe to lull   the maiden called him brother her fond smile   gladdened another hearth while his was dull   yet as they parted she reproved his sadness   and for his sake she gaily whispered gladness    iv    she was the daughter of a noble race   that beauteous girl and yet she owed her name   to one who needs no heralds skill to trace   his blazoned lineage for his lofty fame   lives in the mouth of men and distant climes   reecho his wide glory where the brave   are honoured where tis noble deemed to save   a prostrate nation and for future times   work with a high devotion that no taunt   or ribald lie or zealots eager curse   or the shortsighted worlds neglect can daunt   that name is worshipped his immortal verse   blends with his godlike deeds a double spell   to bind the coming age he loved too well    v    for from his ancient home a scatterling   they drove him forth unconscious of their prize   and branded as a vile unhallowed thing   the man who struggled only to be wise   and even his hearth rebelled the duteous wife   whose bosom well might soothe in that dark hour   swelled with her gentle force the worlds harsh power   and aimed her dart at his devoted life   that struck the rest his mighty soul might scorn   but when his household gods averted stood   twas the last pang that cannot well be borne   when tortured een to torpor his hearts blood   flowed to the unseen blow then forth he went   and gloried in his ruthless banishment    vi    a newborn pledge of love within his home   his alien home the exiled father left   and when like cain he wandered forth to roam   a cain without his solace all bereft   stole down his pallid cheek the scalding tear   to think a stranger to his tender love   his child must grow untroubled where might rove   his restless life or taught perchance to fear   her fathers name and bred in sullen hate   shrink from his image thus the gentle maid   who with her smiles had soothed an orphans fate   had felt an orphans pang yet undismayed   though taught to deem her sire the child of shame   she clung with instinct to that reverent name    vii    time flew the boy became a man no more   his shadow falls upon his cloistered hall   but to a stirring world he learnd to pour   the passion of his being skilled to call   from the deep caverns of his musing thought   shadows to which they bowed and on their mind   to stamp the image of his own the wind   though all unseen with force or odour fraught   can sway mankind and thus a poets voice   now touched with sweetness now inflamed with rage   though breath can make us grieve and then rejoice   such is the spell of his creative page

languid eye what form before unseen   with all the spells of hallowed memory rife   now rises on his vision as the queen   of beauty from her bed of sparkling foam   sprang to the azure light and felt the air   soft as her cheek the wavy dancers bear   to his rapt sight a mien that calls his home   his cloistered home before him with his dreams   prophetic strangely blending the bright muse   of

stranger things than poets ever feign   in lifes perplexing annals is the fate   of those who act and musing penetrate   the mystery of fortune to whose reign   the haughtiest brow must bend twas passing strange   the youth of these fond children strange the flush   of his high fortunes and his spirits change   strange was the maidens tear the maidens blush   strange were his musing thoughts and trembling heart   tis strange they met and stranger if they part     chapter xii   when lady monteagle discovered which she did a very few hours after the mortifying event where lord cadurcis had dined the day on which he had promised to be her guest she was very indignant but her vanity was more offended than her selfcomplacency she was annoyed that cadurcis should have compromised his exalted reputation by so publicly dangling in the train of the new beauty still more that he should have signified in so marked a manner the impression which the fair stranger had made upon him by instantly accepting an invitation to a house so totally unconnected with his circle and where had it not been to meet this miss herbert it would of course never have entered his head to be a visitor but on the whole lady monteagle was rather irritated than jealous and far from suspecting that there was the slightest chance of her losing her influence such as it might be over lord cadurcis all that she felt was that less lustre must redound to her from its possession and exercise if it were obvious to the world that his attentions could be so easily attracted and commanded  when lord cadurcis therefore having dispatched his poem to venetia paid his usual visit on the next day to monteagle house he was received rather with sneers than reproaches as lady monteagle with no superficial knowledge of society or his lordships character was clearly of opinion that this new fancy of her admirer was to be treated rather with ridicule than indignation and in short as she had discovered that cadurcis was far from being insensible to mockery that it was clearly a fit occasion to use a phrase then very much in vogue for quizzing  how dye do said her ladyship with an arch smile i really could not expect to see you  cadurcis looked a little confused he detested scenes and now he dreaded one  you seem quite distrait continued lady monteagle after a moments pause which his lordship ought to have broken but no wonder if the world be right  the world cannot be wrong said cadurcis sarcastically  had you a pleasant party yesterday  very  lady  must have been quite charmed to have you at last said lady monteagle i suppose she exhibited you to all her friends as if you were one of the savages that went to court the other day  she was courteous  oh i can fancy her flutter for my part if there be one character in the world more odious than another i think it is a fussy woman lady  with lord cadurcis dining with her and the new beauty for a niece must have been in a most delectable state of bustle  i thought she was rather quiet said her companion with provoking indifference she seemed to me an agreeable person  i suppose you mean miss herbert said lady monteagle  oh these are moderate expressions to use in reference to a person like miss herbert  you know what they said of you two at ranelagh said her ladyship  no said lord cadurcis somewhat changing colour and speaking through his teeth something devilish pleasant i dare say  they call you sedition and treason said lady monteagle  then we are well suited said lord cadurcis  she certainly is a beautiful creature said her ladyship  i think so said lord cadurcis  rather too tall i think  do you  beautiful complexion certainly wants delicacy i think  do you  fine eyes grey i believe cannot say i admire grey eyes certain sign of bad temper i believe grey eyes  are they  i did not observe her hand i dare say a little coarse fair people who are tall generally fail in the hand and arm what sort of a hand and arm has she  i did not observe anything coarse about miss herbert  ah you admire her and you have cause no one can deny she is a fine girl and every one must regret that with her decidedly provincial air and want of style altogether which might naturally be expected considering the rustic way i understand she has been brought up an old house in the country with a methodistical mother that she should have fallen into such hands as her aunt lady  is enough to spoil any girls fortune in london  i thought that the  were people of high consideration said lord cadurcis  consideration exclaimed lady monteagle if you mean that they are people of rank and good blood and good property they are certainly people of consideration but they are goths vandals huns calmucks canadian savages they have no fashion no style no ton no influence in the world it is impossible that a greater misfortune could have befallen your beauty than having such an aunt why no man who has the slightest regard for his reputation would be seen in her company she is a regular quiz and you cannot imagine how everybody was laughing at you the other night  i am very much obliged to them said lord cadurcis  and upon my honour continued lady monteagle speaking merely as your friend and not being the least jealous cadurcis do not suppose that not a twinge has crossed my mind on that score but still i must tell you that it was most ridiculous for a man like you to whom everybody looks up and from whom the slightest attention is an honour to go and fasten yourself the whole night upon a rustic simpleton something between a wax doll and a dairymaid whom every fool in london was staring at the very reason why you should not have appeared to have been even aware of her existence  we have all our moments of weakness gertrude said lord cadurcis charmed that the lady was so thoroughly unaware and unsuspicious of his long and intimate connection with the herberts i suppose it was my cursed vanity i saw as you say every fool staring at her and so i determined to show that in an instant i could engross her attention  of course i know it was only that but you should not have gone and dined there cadurcis added the lady very seriously that compromised you but by cutting them in future in the most marked manner you may get over it  you really think i may inquired lord cadurcis with some anxiety  oh i have no doubt of it said lady monteagle  what it is to have a friend like you gertrude said cadurcis a friend who is neither a goth nor a vandal nor a hun nor a calmuck nor a canadian savage but a woman of fashion style ton influence in the world it is impossible that a greater piece of good fortune could have befallen me than having you for a friend  ah méchant you may mock said the lady triumphantly for she was quite satisfied with the turn the conversation had taken but i am glad for your sake that you take such a sensible view of the case  notwithstanding however this sensible view of the case after lounging an hour at monteagle house lord cadurcis carriage stopped at the door of venetias gothic aunt he was not so fortunate as to meet his heroine but nevertheless he did not esteem his time entirely thrown away and consoled himself for the disappointment by confirming the favourable impression he had already made in this establishment and cultivating an intimacy which he was assured must contribute many opportunities of finding himself in the society of venetia from this day indeed he was a frequent guest at her uncles and generally contrived also to meet her several times in the week at some great assembly but here both from the occasional presence of lady monteagle although party spirit deterred her from attending many circles where cadurcis was now an habitual visitant and from the crowd of admirers who surrounded the herberts he rarely found an opportunity for any private conversation with venetia his friend the bishop also notwithstanding the prejudices of lady annabel received him always with cordiality and he met the herberts more than once at his mansion at the opera and in the park also he hovered about them in spite of the sarcasms or reproaches of lady monteagle for the reader is not to suppose that that lady continued to take the same selfcomplacent view of lord cadurcis acquaintance with the herberts which she originally adopted and at first flattered herself was the just one his admiration of miss herbert had become the topic of general conversation it could no longer be concealed or disguised but lady monteagle was convinced that cadurcis was not a marrying man and persuaded herself that this was a fancy which must evaporate moreover monteagle house still continued his spot of most constant resort for his opportunities of being with venetia were with all his exertions limited and he had no other resource which pleased him so much as the conversation and circle of the bright goddess of his party after some fiery scenes therefore with the divinity which only led to his prolonged absence for the profound and fervent genius of cadurcis revolted from the base sentiment and mock emotions of society the lady reconciled herself to her lot still believing herself the most envied woman in london and often ashamed of being jealous of a country girl  the general result of the fortnight which elapsed since cadurcis renewed his acquaintance with his cherbury friends was that he had become convinced of his inability of propitiating lady annabel was devotedly attached to venetia though he had seldom an opportunity of intimating feelings which the cordial manner in which she ever conducted herself to him gave him no reason to conclude desperate at the same time that he had contrived that a day should seldom elapse which did not under some circumstances however unfavourable bring them together while her intimate friends and the circles in which she passed most of her life always witnessed his presence with favour     chapter xiii   we must however endeavour to be more intimately acquainted with the heart and mind of venetia in her present situation so strongly contrasting with the serene simplicity of her former life than the limited and constrained opportunities of conversing with the companion of his childhood enjoyed by lord cadurcis could possibly enable him to become let us recur to her on the night when she returned home after having met with plantagenet at her uncles and having pursued a conversation with him so unexpected so strange and so affecting she had been silent in the carriage and retired to her room immediately she retired to ponder the voice of cadurcis lingered in her ear his tearful eye still caught her vision she leant her head upon her hand and sighed why did she sigh what at this instant was her uppermost thought her mothers dislike of cadurcis your mother hates me these had been his words these were the words she repeated to herself and on whose fearful sounds she dwelt your mother hates me if by some means she had learnt a month ago at weymouth that her mother hated cadurcis that his general conduct had been such as to excite lady annabels odium venetia might have for a moment been shocked that her old companion in whom she had once been so interested had by his irregular behaviour incurred the dislike of her mother by whom he had once been so loved but it would have been a transient emotion she might have mused over past feelings and past hopes in a solitary ramble on the seashore she might even have shed a tear over the misfortunes or infelicity of one who had once been to her a brother but perhaps nay probably on the morrow the remembrance of plantagenet would scarcely have occurred to her long years had elapsed since their ancient fondness a considerable interval since even his name had met her ear she had heard nothing of him that could for a moment arrest her notice or command her attention  but now the irresistible impression that her mother disliked this very individual filled her with intolerable grief what occasioned this change in her feelings this extraordinary difference in her emotions there was apparently but one cause she had met cadurcis could then a glance could even the tender intonations of that unrivalled voice and the dark passion of that speaking eye work in an instant such marvels could they revive the past so vividly that plantagenet in a moment resumed his ancient place in her affections no it was not that it was less the tenderness of the past that made venetia mourn her mothers sternness to cadurcis than the feelings of the future for now she felt that her mothers heart was not more changed towards this personage than was her own  it seemed to venetia that even before they met from the very moment that his name had so strangely caught her eye in the volume on the first evening she had visited her relations that her spirit suddenly turned to him she had never heard that name mentioned since without a fluttering of the heart which she could not repress and an emotion she could ill conceal she loved to hear others talk of him and yet scarcely dared speak of him herself she recalled her emotion at unexpectedly seeing his portrait when with her aunt and her mortification when her mother deprived her of the poem which she sighed to read day after day something seemed to have occurred to fix her brooding thoughts with fonder earnestness on his image at length they met her emotion when she first recognised him at ranelagh and felt him approaching her was one of those tumults of the heart that form almost a crisis in our sensations with what difficulty had she maintained herself doubtful whether he would even formally acknowledge her presence her vision as if by fascination had nevertheless met his and grew dizzy as he passed in the interval that had elapsed between his first passing and then joining her what a chaos was her mind what a wild blending of all the scenes and incidents of her life what random answers had she made to those with whom she had been before conversing with ease and animation and then when she unexpectedly found cadurcis at her side and listened to the sound of that familiar voice familiar and yet changed expressing so much tenderness in its tones and in its words such deference and delicate respect existence felt to her that moment affluent with a blissful excitement of which she had never dreamed  her life was a reverie until they met again in which she only mused over his fame and the strange relations of their careers she had watched the conduct of her mother to him at dinner with poignant sorrow she scarcely believed that she should have an opportunity of expressing to him her sympathy and then what had followed a conversation every word of which had touched her heart a conversation that would have entirely controlled her feelings even if he had not already subjected them the tone in which he so suddenly had pronounced venetia was the sweetest music to which she had ever listened his allusion to her father had drawn tears which could not be restrained even in a crowded saloon now she wept plenteously it was so generous so noble so kind so affectionate dear dear cadurcis is it wonderful that you should be loved  then falling into a reverie of sweet and unbroken stillness with her eyes fixed in abstraction on the fire venetia reviewed her life from the moment she had known plantagenet not an incident that had ever occurred to them that did not rise obedient to her magical bidding she loved to dwell upon the time when she was the consolation of his sorrows and when cherbury was to him a pleasant refuge oh she felt sure her mother must remember those fond days and love him as she once did she pictured to herself the little plantagenet of her childhood so serious and so pensive when alone or with others yet with her at times so gay and wild and sarcastic forebodings all of that deep and brilliant spirit which had since stirred up the heart of a great nation and dazzled the fancy of an admiring world the change too in their mutual lots was also to a degree not free from that sympathy that had ever bound them together a train of strange accidents had brought venetia from her spellbound seclusion placed her suddenly in the most brilliant circle of civilisation and classed her among not the least admired of its favoured members and whom had she come to meet whom did she find in this new and splendid life the most courted and considered of its community crowned as it were with garlands and perfumed with the incense of a thousand altars her own plantagenet it was passing strange  the morrow brought the verses from cadurcis they greatly affected her the picture of their childhood and of the singular sympathy of their mutual situations and the description of her father called forth her tears she murmured however at the allusion to her other parent it was not just it could not be true these verses were not of course shown to lady annabel would they have been shown even if they had not contained the allusion the question is not perplexing venetia had her secret and a far deeper one than the mere reception of a poem all confidence between her and her mother had expired love had stept in and before his magic touch the discipline of a life expired in an instant  from all this an idea may be formed of the mood in which during the fortnight before alluded to venetia was in the habit of meeting lord cadurcis during this period not the slightest conversation respecting him had occurred between her mother and herself lady annabel never mentioned him and her brow clouded when his name as was often the case was introduced at the end of this fortnight it happened that her aunt and mother were out together in the carriage and had left her in the course of the morning at her uncles house during this interval lord cadurcis called and having ascertained through a garrulous servant that though his mistress was out miss herbert was in the drawingroom he immediately took the opportunity of being introduced venetia was not a little surprised at his appearance and conscious of her mothers feelings upon the subject for a moment a little agitated yet it must be confessed as much pleased she seized this occasion of speaking to him about his verses for hitherto she had only been able to acknowledge the receipt of them by a word while she expressed without affectation the emotions they had occasioned her she complained of his injustice to her mother this was the cause of an interesting conversation of which her father was the subject and for which she had long sighed with what deep unbroken attention she listened to her companions enthusiastic delineation of his character and career what multiplied questions did she not ask him and how eagerly how amply how affectionately he satisfied her just and natural curiosity hours flew away while they indulged in this rare communion  oh that i could see him sighed venetia  you will replied plantagenet your destiny requires it you will see him as surely as you beheld that portrait that it was the labour of a life to prevent you beholding  venetia shook her head and yet she added musingly my mother loves him  her life proves it said cadurcis bitterly  i think it does replied venetia sincerely  i pretend not to understand her heart he answered it is an enigma that i cannot solve i ought not to believe that she is without one but at any rate her pride is deeper than her love  they were ill suited said venetia mournfully and yet it is one of my dreams that they may yet meet  ah venetia he exclaimed in a voice of great softness they had not known each other from their childhood like us they met and they parted alike in haste  venetia made no reply her eyes were fixed in abstraction on a handscreen which she was unconscious that she held  tell me said cadurcis drawing his chair close to hers tell me venetia if  at this moment a thundering knock at the door announced the return of the countess and her sisterinlaw cadurcis rose from his seat but his chair which still remained close to that on which venetia was sitting did not escape the quick glance of her mortified mother the countess welcomed cadurcis with extreme cordiality lady annabel only returned his very courteous bow  stop and dine with us my dear lord said the countess we are only ourselves and lady annabel and venetia  i thank you clara said lady annabel but we cannot stop today  oh exclaimed her sister it will be such a disappointment to philip indeed you must stay she added in a coaxing tone we shall be such an agreeable little party with lord cadurcis  i cannot indeed my dear clara replied lady annabel not today indeed not today come venetia     chapter xiv   lady annabel was particularly kind to venetia on their return to their hotel otherwise her daughter might have fancied that she had offended her for she was silent venetia did not doubt that the presence of lord cadurcis was the reason that her mother would not remain and dine at her uncles this conviction grieved venetia but she did not repine she indulged the fond hope that time would remove the strong prejudice which lady annabel now so singularly entertained against one in whose welfare she was originally so deeply interested during their simple and short repast venetia was occupied in a reverie in which it must be owned cadurcis greatly figured and answered the occasional though kind remarks of her mother with an absent air  after dinner lady annabel drew her chair towards the fire for although may the weather was chill and said a quiet evening at home venetia will be a relief after all this gaiety venetia assented to her mothers observation and nearly a quarter of an hour elapsed without another word being spoken venetia had taken up a book and lady annabel was apparently lost in her reflections at length she said somewhat abruptly it is more than three years i think since lord cadurcis left cherbury  yes it is more than three years replied venetia  he quitted us suddenly  very suddenly agreed venetia  i never asked you whether you knew the cause venetia continued her mother but i always concluded that you did i suppose i was not in error  this was not a very agreeable inquiry venetia did not reply to it with her previous readiness and indifference that indeed was impossible but with her accustomed frankness after a moments hesitation she answered lord cadurcis never specifically stated the cause to me mamma indeed i was myself surprised at his departure but some conversation had occurred between us on the very morning he quitted cadurcis which on reflection i could not doubt occasioned that departure  lord cadurcis preferred his suit to you venetia and you rejected him said lady annabel  it is as you believe replied venetia not a little agitated  you did wisely my child and i was weak ever to have regretted your conduct  why should you think so dearest mamma  whatever may have been the cause that impelled your conduct then said lady annabel i shall ever esteem your decision as a signal interposition of providence in your favour except his extreme youth there was apparently no reason which should not have induced you to adopt a different decision i tremble when i think what might have been the consequences  tremble dearest mother  tremble venetia my only thought in this life is the happiness of my child it was in peril  nay i trust not that mamma you are prejudiced against plantagenet it makes me very unhappy and him also  he is again your suitor said lady annabel with a scrutinising glance  indeed he is not  he will be said lady annabel prepare yourself tell me then are your feelings the same towards him as when he last quitted us  feelings mamma said venetia echoing her mothers words for indeed the question was one very difficult to answer i ever loved plantagenet i love him still  but do you love him now as then then you looked upon him as a brother he has no soul now for sisterly affections i beseech you tell me my child me your mother your friend your best your only friend tell me have you for a moment repented that you ever refused to extend to him any other affection  i have not thought of the subject mamma i have not wished to think of the subject i have had no occasion to think of it lord cadurcis is not my suitor now  venetia said lady annabel i cannot doubt you love me  dearest mother exclaimed venetia in a tone of mingled fondness and reproach and she rose from her seat and embraced lady annabel  my happiness is an object to you venetia continued lady annabel  mother mother said venetia in a deprecatory tone do not ask such cruel questions whom should i love but you the best the dearest mother that ever existed and what object can i have in life that for a moment can be placed in competition with your happiness  then venetia i tell you said lady annabel in a solemn yet excited voice that that happiness is gone for ever nay my very life will be the forfeit if i ever live to see you the bride of lord cadurcis  i have no thought of being the bride of any one said venetia i am happy with you i wish never to leave you  my child the fulfilment of such a wish is not in the nature of things replied lady annabel the day will come when we must part i am prepared for the event nay i look forward to it not only with resignation but delight when i think it may increase your happiness but were that step to destroy it oh then then i could live no more i can endure my own sorrows i can struggle with my own bitter lot i have some sources of consolation which enable me to endure my own misery without repining but yours yours venetia i could not bear no if once i were to behold you lingering in life as your mother with blighted hopes and with a heart broken if hearts can break i should not survive the spectacle i know myself venetia i could not survive it  but why anticipate such misery why indulge in such gloomy forebodings am i not happy now do you not love me  venetia had drawn her chair close to that of her mother she sat by her side and held her hand  venetia said lady annabel after a pause of some minutes and in a low voice i must speak to you on a subject on which we have never conversed i must speak to you and here lady annabels voice dropped lower and lower but still its tones were distinct although she expressed herself with evident effort i must speak to you aboutyour father  venetia uttered a faint cry she clenched her mothers hand with a convulsive grasp and sank upon her bosom she struggled to maintain herself but the first sound of that name from her mothers lips and all the longsuppressed emotions that it conjured up overpowered her the blood seemed to desert her heart still she did not faint she clung to lady annabel pallid and shivering  her mother tenderly embraced her she whispered to her words of great affection she attempted to comfort and console her venetia murmured this is very foolish of me mother but speak oh speak of what i have so long desired to hear  not now venetia  now mother yes now i am quite composed i could not bear the postponement of what you were about to say i could not sleep dear mother if you did not speak to me it was only for a moment i was overcome see i am quite composed and indeed she spoke in a calm and steady voice but her pale and suffering countenance expressed the painful struggle which it cost her to command herself  venetia said lady annabel it has been one of the objects of my life that you should not share my sorrows  venetia pressed her mothers hand but made no other reply  i concealed from you for years continued lady annabel a circumstance in which indeed you were deeply interested but the knowledge of which could only bring you unhappiness yet it was destined that my solicitude should eventually be baffled i know that it is not from my lips that you learn for the first time that you have a father a father living  mother let me tell you all said venetia eagerly  i know all said lady annabel  but mother there is something that you do not know and now i would confess it  there is nothing that you can confess with which i am not acquainted venetia and i feel assured i have ever felt assured that your only reason for concealment was a desire to save me pain  that indeed has ever been my only motive replied venetia for having a secret from my mother  in my absence from cherbury you entered the chamber said lady annabel calmly in the delirium of your fever i became acquainted with a circumstance which so nearly proved fatal to you  venetias cheek turned scarlet  in that chamber you beheld the portrait of your father continued lady annabel from our friend you learnt that father was still living that is all said lady annabel inquiringly  no not all dear mother not all lord cadurcis reproached me at cherbury with with with having such a father she added in a hesitating voice it was then i learnt his misfortunes mother his misery  i thought that misfortunes that misery were the lot of your other parent replied lady annabel somewhat coldly  not with my love said venetia eagerly not with my love mother you have forgotten your misery in my love say so say so dearest mother and venetia threw herself on her knees before lady annabel and looked up with earnestness in her face  the expression of that countenance had been for a moment stern but it relaxed into fondness as lady annabel gently bowed her head and pressed her lips to her daughters forehead ah venetia she said all depends upon you i can endure nay i can forget the past if my child be faithful to me there are no misfortunes there is no misery if the being to whom i have consecrated the devotion of my life will only be dutiful will only be guided by my advice will only profit by my sad experience  mother i repeat i have no thought but for you said venetia my own dearest mother if my duty if my devotion can content you you shall be happy but wherein have i failed  in nothing love your life has hitherto been one unbroken course of affectionate obedience  and ever shall be said venetia but you were speaking mother you were speaking of of my my father  of him said lady annabel thoughtfully you have seen his picture  venetia kissed her mothers hand  was he less beautiful than cadurcis was he less gifted exclaimed lady annabel with animation he could whisper in tones as sweet and pour out his vows as fervently yet what am i o my child continued lady annabel beware of such beings they bear within them a spirit on which all the devotion of our sex is lavished in vain a year no not a year not one short year and all my hopes were blighted o venetia if your future should be like my bitter past and it might have been and i might have contributed to the fulfilment can you wonder that i should look upon cadurcis with aversion  but mother dearest mother we have known plantagenet from his childhood you ever loved him you ever gave him credit for a heart most tender and affectionate  he has no heart  mother  he cannot have a heart spirits like him are heartless it is another impulse that sways their existence it is imagination it is vanity it is self disguised with glittering qualities that dazzle our weak senses but selfishness the most entire the most concentrated we knew him as a child ah what can women know we are born to love and to be deceived we saw him young helpless abandoned he moved our pity we knew not his nature then he was ignorant of it himself but the young tiger though cradled at our hearths and fed on milk will in good time retire to its jungle and prey on blood you cannot change its nature and the very hand that fostered it will be its first victim  how often have we parted said venetia in a deprecating tone how long have we been separated and yet we find him ever the same he ever loves us yes dear mother he loves you now the same as in old days if you had seen him as i have seen him weep when he recalled your promise to be a parent to him and then contrasted with such sweet hopes your present reserve oh you would believe he had a heart you would indeed  weep exclaimed lady annabel bitterly ay they can weep sensibility is a luxury which they love to indulge their very susceptibility is our bane they can weep they can play upon our feelings and our emotion so easily excited is an homage to their own power in which they glory  look at cadurcis she suddenly resumed bred with so much care the soundest principles instilled into him with such sedulousness imbibing them apparently with so much intelligence ardour and sincerity with all that fervour indeed with which men of his temperament for the moment pursue every object but a few years back pious dutiful and moral viewing perhaps with intolerance too youthful all that differed from the opinions and the conduct he had been educated to admire and follow and what is he now the most lawless of the wild casting to the winds every salutary principle of restraint and social discipline and glorying only in the abandoned energy of self three years ago you yourself confessed to me he reproached you with your fathers conduct now he emulates it there is a career which such men must run and from which no influence can divert them it is in their blood today cadurcis may vow to you eternal devotion but if the world speak truth venetia a month ago he was equally enamoured of another and one too who cannot be his but grant that his sentiments towards you are for the moment sincere his imagination broods upon your idea it transfigures it with a halo which exists only to his vision yield to him become his bride and you will have the mortification of finding that before six mouths have elapsed his restless spirit is already occupied with objects which may excite your mortification your disgust even your horror  ah mother it is not with plantagenet as with my father plantagenet could not forget cherbury he could not forget our childhood said venetia  on the contrary while you lived together these recollections would be wearisome commonplace to him when you had separated indeed mellowed by distance and the comparative vagueness with which your absence would invest them they would become the objects of his muse and he would insult you by making the public the confidant of all your most delicate domestic feelings  lady annabel rose from her seat and walked up and down the room speaking with an excitement very unusual with her to have all the soft secrets of your life revealed to the coarse wonder of the gloating multitude to find yourself the object of the worlds curiosity still worse their pity their sympathy to have the sacred conduct of your hearth canvassed in every circle and be the grand subject of the pros and cons of every paltry journal ah venetia you know not you cannot understand it is impossible you can comprehend the bitterness of such a lot  my beloved mother said venetia with streaming eyes you cannot have a feeling that i do not share  venetia you know not what i had to endure exclaimed lady annabel in a tone of extreme bitterness there is no degree of wretchedness that you can conceive equal to what has been the life of your mother and what has sustained me what throughout all my tumultuous troubles has been the star on which i have ever gazed my child and am i to lose her now after all my sufferings all my hopes that she at least might be spared my miserable doom am i to witness her also a victim lady annabel clasped her hands in passionate grief  mother mother exclaimed venetia in agony spare yourself spare me  venetia you know how i have doted upon you you know how i have watched and tended you from your infancy have i had a thought a wish a hope a plan has there been the slightest action of my life of which you have not been the object all mothers feel but none ever felt like me you were my solitary joy  venetia leant her face upon the table at which she was sitting and sobbed aloud  my love was baffled lady annabel continued i fled for both our sakes from the world in which my family were honoured i sacrificed without a sigh in the very prime of my youth every pursuit which interests woman but i had my child i had my child  and you have her still exclaimed the miserable venetia mother you have her still  i have schooled my mind continued lady annabel still pacing the room with agitated steps i have disciplined my emotions i have felt at my heart the constant the undying pang and yet i have smiled that you might be happy but i can struggle against my fate no longer no longer can i suffer my unparalleled yes my unjust doom what have i done to merit these afflictions now then let me struggle no more let me die  venetia tried to rise her limbs refused their office she tottered she fell again into her seat with an hysteric cry  alas alas exclaimed lady annabel to a mother a child is everything but to a child a parent is only a link in the chain of her existence it was weakness it was folly it was madness to stake everything on a resource which must fail me i feel it now but i feel it too late  venetia held forth her arms she could not speak she was stifled with her emotion  but was it wonderful that i was so weak continued her mother as it were communing only with herself what child was like mine oh the joy the bliss the hours of rapture that i have passed in gazing upon my treasure and dreaming of all her beauty and her rare qualities i was so happy i was so proud ah venetia you know not how i have loved you  venetia sprang from her seat she rushed forward with convulsive energy she clung to her mother threw her arms round her neck and buried her passionate woe in lady annabels bosom  lady annabel stood for some minutes supporting her speechless and agitated child then as her sobs became fainter and the tumult of her grief gradually died away she bore her to the sofa and seated herself by her side holding venetias hand in her own and ever and anon soothing her with soft embraces and still softer words  at length in a faint voice venetia said mother what can i do to restore the past how can we be to each other as we were for this i cannot bear  love me my venetia as i love you be faithful to your mother do not disregard her counsel profit by her errors  i will in all things obey you said venetia in a low voice there is no sacrifice i am not prepared to make for your happiness  let us not talk of sacrifices my darling child it is not a sacrifice that i require i wish only to prevent your everlasting misery  what then shall i do  make me only one promise whatever pledge you give i feel assured that no influence venetia will ever induce you to forfeit it  name it mother  promise me never to marry lord cadurcis said lady annabel in a whisper but a whisper of which not a word was lost by the person to whom it was addressed  i promise never to marry but with your approbation said venetia in a solemn voice and uttering the words with great distinctness  the countenance of lady annabel instantly brightened she embraced her child with extreme fondness and breathed the softest and the sweetest expressions of gratitude and love     chapter xv   when lady monteagle discovered that of which her goodnatured friends took care she should not long remain ignorant that venetia herbert had been the companion of lord cadurcis childhood and that the most intimate relations had once subsisted between the two families she became the prey of violent jealousy and the bitterness of her feelings was not a little increased when she felt that she had not only been abandoned but duped and that the new beauty out of his fancy for whom she had flattered herself she had so triumphantly rallied him was an old friend whom he always admired she seized the first occasion after this discovery of relieving her feelings by a scene so violent that cadurcis had never again entered monteagle house and then repenting of this mortifying result which she had herself precipitated she overwhelmed him with letters which next to scenes were the very things which lord cadurcis most heartily abhorred these now indignant now passionate now loading him with reproaches now appealing to his love and now to his pity daily arrived at his residence and were greeted at first only with short and sarcastic replies and finally by silence then the lady solicited a final interview and lord cadurcis having made an appointment to quiet her went out of town the day before to richmond to a villa belonging to venetias uncle and where among other guests he was of course to meet lady annabel and her daughter  the party was a most agreeable one and assumed an additional interest with cadurcis who had resolved to seize this favourable opportunity to bring his aspirations to venetia to a crisis the day after the last conversation with her which we have noticed he had indeed boldly called upon the herberts at their hotel for that purpose but without success as they were again absent from home he had been since almost daily in the society of venetia but london to a lover who is not smiled upon by the domestic circle of his mistress is a very unfavourable spot for confidential conversations a villa life with its easy unembarrassed habits its gardens and lounging walks to say nothing of the increased opportunities resulting from being together at all hours and living under the same roof was more promising and here he flattered himself he might defy even the argus eye and ceaseless vigilance of his intended motherinlaw his enemy whom he could not propitiate and whom he now fairly hated  his cousin george too was a guest and his cousin george was the confidant of his love upon this kind relation devolved the duty far from a disagreeable one of amusing the mother and as lady annabel though she relaxed not a jot of the grim courtesy which she ever extended to lord cadurcis was no longer seriously uneasy as to his influence after the promise she had exacted from her daughter it would seem that these circumstances combined to prevent lord cadurcis from being disappointed at least in the first object which he wished to obtain an opportunity  and yet several days elapsed before this offered itself passed by cadurcis however very pleasantly in the presence of the being he loved and very judiciously too for no one could possibly be more amiable and ingratiating than our friend every one present except lady annabel appeared to entertain for him as much affection as admiration those who had only met him in throngs were quite surprised how their superficial observation and the delusive reports of the world had misled them as for his hostess whom it had ever been his study to please he had long won her heart and as she could not be blind to his projects and pretensions she heartily wished him success assisted him with all her efforts and desired nothing more sincerely than that her niece should achieve such a conquest and she obtain so distinguished a nephew  notwithstanding her promise to her mother venetia felt justified in making no alteration in her conduct to one whom she still sincerely loved and under the immediate influence of his fascination it was often when she was alone that she mourned with a sorrowing heart over the opinion which her mother entertained of him could it indeed be possible that plantagenet the same plantagenet she had known so early and so long to her invariably so tender and so devoted could entail on her by their union such unspeakable and inevitable misery whatever might be the view adopted by her mother of her conduct venetia felt every hour more keenly that it was a sacrifice and the greatest and she still indulged in a vague yet delicious dream that lady annabel might ultimately withdraw the harsh and perhaps heartbreaking interdict she had so rigidly decreed  cadurcis said his cousin to him one morning we are all going to hampton court now is your time lady annabel the vernons and myself will fill one carriage i have arranged that look out and something may be done speak to the countess  accordingly lord cadurcis hastened to make a suggestion to a friend always flattered by his notice my dear friend he said in his softest tone let you and venetia and myself manage to be together it will be so delightful we shall quite enjoy ourselves  the countess did not require this animating compliment to effect the object which cadurcis did not express she had gradually fallen into the unacknowledged conspiracy against her sisterinlaw whose prejudice against her friend she had long discovered and had now ceased to combat two carriages and one filled as george had arranged accordingly drove gaily away and venetia and her aunt and lord cadurcis were to follow them on horseback they rode with delight through the splendid avenues of bushey and cadurcis was never in a lighter or happier mood  the month of may was in its decline and the cloudless sky and the balmy air such as suited so agreeable a season the london season was approaching its close for the royal birthday was at the period of our history generally the signal of preparation for country quarters the carriages arrived long before the riding party for they had walked their steeds and they found a messenger who requested them to join their friends in the apartments which they were visiting  for my part said cadurcis i love the sun that rarely shines in this land i feel no inclination to lose the golden hours in these gloomy rooms what say you ladies fair to a stroll in the gardens it will be doubly charming after our ride  his companions cheerfully assented and they walked away congratulating themselves on their escape from the wearisome amusement of palacehunting straining their eyes to see pictures hung at a gigantic height and solemnly wandering through formal apartments full of state beds and massy cabinets and modern armour  taking their way along the terrace they struck at length into a less formal path at length the countess seated herself on a bench i must rest she said but you young people may roam about only do not lose me  come venetia said lord cadurcis  venetia was hesitating she did not like to leave her aunt alone but the countess encouraged her if you will not go you will only make me continue walking she said and so venetia proceeded and for the first time since her visit was alone with plantagenet  i quite love your aunt said lord cadurcis  it is difficult indeed not to love her said venetia  ah venetia i wish your mother was like your aunt he continued it was an observation which was not heard without some emotion by his companion though it was imperceptible venetia said cadurcis when i recollect old days how strange it seems that we now never should be alone but by some mere accident like this for instance  it is no use thinking of old days said venetia  no use said cadurcis i do not like to hear you say that venetia those are some of the least agreeable words that were ever uttered by that mouth i cling to old days they are my only joy and my only hope  they are gone said venetia  but may they not return said cadurcis  never said venetia mournfully  they had walked on to a marble fountain of gigantic proportions and elaborate workmanship an assemblage of divinities and genii all spouting water in fantastic attitudes  old days said plantagenet are like the old fountain at cadurcis dearer to me than all this modern splendour  the old fountain at cadurcis said venetia musingly and gazing on the water with an abstracted air i loved it well  venetia said her companion in a tone of extreme tenderness yet not untouched with melancholy dear venetia let us return and return together to that old fountain and those old days  venetia shook her head ah plantagenet she exclaimed in a mournful voice we must not speak of these things  why not venetia exclaimed lord cadurcis eagerly why should we be estranged from each other i love you i love only you never have i loved another and you have you forgotten all our youthful affection you cannot venetia our childhood can never be a blank  i told you when first we met my heart was unchanged said venetia  remember the vows i made to you when last at cherbury said cadurcis years have flown on venetia but they find me urging the same at any rate now i know myself at any rate i am not now an obscure boy yet what is manhood and what is fame without the charm of my infancy and my youth yes venetia you must you will he mine  plantagenet she replied in a solemn tone yours i never can be  you do not then love me said cadurcis reproachfully and in a voice of great feeling  it is impossible for you to be loved more than i love you said venetia  my own venetia said cadurcis venetia that i dote on what does this mean why then will you not be mine  i cannot there is an obstacle an insuperable obstacle  tell it me said cadurcis eagerly i will overcome it  i have promised never to marry without the approbation of my mother her approbation you never can obtain  cadurcis countenance fell this was an obstacle which he felt that even he could not overcome  i told you your mother hated me venetia and then as she did not reply he continued you confess it i see you confess it once you flattered me i was mistaken but now now you confess it  hatred is a word which i cannot understand replied venetia my mother has reasons for disapproving my union with you not founded on the circumstances of your life and therefore removable for i know what the world says plantagenet of you but i have confidence in your love and that is nothing but founded on your character on your nature they may be unjust but they are insuperable and i must yield to them  you have another parent venetia said cadurcis in a tone of almost irresistible softness the best and greatest of men once you told me that his sanction was necessary to your marriage i will obtain it o venetia be mine and we will join him join that illfated and illustrious being who loves you with a passion second only to mine him who has addressed you in language which rests on every lip and has thrilled many a heart that you even can never know my adored venetia picture to yourself for one moment a life with him resting on my bosom consecrated by his paternal love let us quit this mean and miserable existence which we now pursue which never could have suited us let us shun for ever this dull and degrading life that is not life if life be what i deem it let us fly to those beautiful solitudes where he communes with an inspiring nature let us let us be happy  he uttered these last words in a tone of melting tenderness he leant forward his head and his gaze caught hers which was fixed upon the water her hand was pressed suddenly in his his eye glittered his lip seemed still speaking he awaited his doom  the countenance of venetia was quite pale but it was disturbed you might see as it were the shadowy progress of thought and mark the tumultuous passage of conflicting passions her mind for a moment was indeed a chaos there was a terrible conflict between love and duty at length a tear one solitary tear burst from her burning eyeball and stole slowly down her cheek it relieved her pain she pressed cadurcis hand and speaking in a hollow voice and with a look vague and painful she said i am a victim but i am resolved i never will desert her who devoted herself to me  cadurcis quitted her hand rather abruptly and began walking up and down on the turf that surrounded the fountain  devoted herself to you he exclaimed with a fiendish laugh and speaking as was his custom between his teeth commend me to such devotion not content with depriving you of a father now forsooth she must bereave you of a lover too and this is a mother a devoted mother the coldblooded sullen selfish inexorable tyrant  plantagenet exclaimed venetia with great animation  nay i will speak victim indeed you have ever been her slave she a devoted mother ay as devoted as a mother as she was dutiful as a wife she has no heart she never had a feeling and she cajoles you with her love her devotion the stern hypocrite  i must leave you said venetia i cannot bear this  oh the truth the truth is precious said cadurcis taking her hand and preventing her from moving your mother your devoted mother has driven one man of genius from her bosom and his country yet there is another deny me what i ask and tomorrows sun shall light me to another land to this i will never return i will blend my tears with your fathers and i will publish to europe the double infamy of your mother i swear it solemnly still i stand here venetia prepared if you will but smile upon me to be her son her dutiful son nay her slave like you she shall not murmur i will be dutiful she shall be devoted we will all be happy he added in a softer tone now now venetia my happiness is on the stake now now  i have spoken said venetia my heart may break but my purpose shall not falter  then my curse upon your mothers head said cadurcis with terrible vehemency may heaven rain all its plagues upon her the hecate  i will listen no more exclaimed venetia indignantly and she moved away she had proceeded some little distance when she paused and looked back cadurcis was still at the fountain but he did not observe her she remembered his sudden departure from cherbury she did not doubt that in the present instance he would leave them as abruptly and that he would keep his word so solemnly given her heart was nearly breaking but she could not bear the idea of parting in bitterness with the being whom perhaps she loved best in the world she stopt she called his name in a voice low indeed but in that silent spot it reached him he joined her immediately but with a slow step when he had reached her he said without any animation and in a frigid tone i believe you called me  venetia burst into tears i cannot bear to part in anger plantagenet i wished to say farewell in kindness i shall always pray for your happiness god bless you plantagenet  lord cadurcis made no reply though for a moment he seemed about to speak he bowed and as venetia approached her aunt he turned his steps in a different direction     chapter xvi   venetia stopped for a moment to collect herself before she joined her aunt but it was impossible to conceal her agitation from the countess they had not however been long together before they observed their friends in the distance who had now quitted the palace venetia made the utmost efforts to compose herself and not unsuccessful ones she was sufficiently calm on their arrival to listen if not to converse the countess with all the tact of a woman covered her nieces confusion by her animated description of their agreeable ride and their still more pleasant promenade and in a few minutes the whole party were walking back to their carriages when they had arrived at the inn they found lord cadurcis to whose temporary absence the countess had alluded with some casual observation which she flattered herself was very satisfactory cadurcis appeared rather sullen and the countess with feminine quickness suddenly discovered that both herself and her niece were extremely fatigued and that they had better return in the carriages there was one vacant place and some of the gentlemen must ride outside lord cadurcis however said that he should return as he came and the grooms might lead back the ladies horses and so in a few minutes the carriages had driven off  our solitary equestrian however was no sooner mounted than he put his horse to its speed and never drew in his rein until he reached hyde park corner the rapid motion accorded with his tumultuous mood he was soon at home gave his horse to a servant for he had left his groom behind rushed into his library tore up a letter of lady monteagles with a demoniac glance and rang his bell with such force that it broke his valet not unused to such ebullitions immediately appeared  has anything happened spalding said his lordship  nothing particular my lord her ladyship sent every day and called herself twice but i told her your lordship was in yorkshire  that was right i saw a letter from her when did it come  it has been here several days my lord  mind i am at home to nobody i am not in town  the valet bowed and disappeared cadurcis threw himself into an easy chair stretched his legs sighed and then swore then suddenly starting up he seized a mass of letters that were lying on the table and hurled them to the other end of the apartment dashed several books to the ground kicked down several chairs that were in his way and began pacing the room with his usual troubled step and so he continued until the shades of twilight entered his apartment then he pulled down the other bellrope and mr spalding again appeared  order posthorses for tomorrow said his lordship  where to my lord  i dont know order the horses  mr spalding again bowed and disappeared  in a few minutes he heard a great stamping and confusion in his masters apartment and presently the door opened and his masters voice was heard calling him repeatedly in a very irritable tone  why are there no bells in this cursed room inquired lord cadurcis  the ropes are broken my lord  why are they broken  i cant say my lord  i cannot leave this house for a day but i find everything in confusion bring me some burgundy  yes my lord there is a young lad my lord called a few minutes back and asked for your lordship he says he has something very particular to say to your lordship i told him your lordship was out of town he said your lordship would wish very much to see him and that he had come from the abbey  the abbey said cadurcis in a tone of curiosity why did you not show him in  your lordship said you were not at home to anybody  idiot is this anybody of course i would have seen him what the devil do i keep you for sir you seem to me to have lost your head  mr spalding retired  the abbey that is droll said cadurcis i owe some duties to the poor abbey i should not like to quit england and leave anybody in trouble at the abbey i wish i had seen the lad some son of a tenant who has written to me and i have never opened his letters i am sorry  in a few minutes mr spalding again entered the room the young lad has called again my lord he says he thinks your lordship has come to town and he wishes to see your lordship very much  bring lights and show him up show him up first  accordingly a country lad was ushered into the room although it was so dusky that cadurcis could only observe his figure standing at the door  well my good fellow said cadurcis what do you want are you in any trouble  the boy hesitated  speak out my good fellow do not be alarmed if i can serve you or any one at the abbey i will do it  here mr spalding entered with the lights the lad held a cotton handkerchief to his face he appeared to be weeping all that was seen of his head were his locks of red hair he seemed a country lad dressed in a long green coat with silver buttons and he twirled in his disengaged hand a peasants white hat  that will do spalding said lord cadurcis leave the room now my good fellow my time is precious but speak out and do not be afraid  cadurcis said the lad in a sweet and trembling voice  gertrude by gd exclaimed lord cadurcis starting what infernal masquerade is this  is it a greater disguise than i have to bear every hour of my life exclaimed lady monteagle advancing have i not to bear a smiling face with a breaking heart  by jove a scene exclaimed cadurcis in a piteous tone  a scene exclaimed lady monteagle bursting into a flood of indignant tears is this the way the expression of my feelings is ever to be stigmatised barbarous man  cadurcis stood with his back to the fireplace with his lips compressed and his hands under his coattails he was resolved that nothing should induce him to utter a word he looked the picture of dogged indifference  i know where you have been continued lady monteagle you have been to richmond you have been with miss herbert yes i know all i am a victim but i will not be a dupe yorkshire indeed paltry coward  cadurcis hummed an air  and this is lord cadurcis continued the lady the sublime ethereal lord cadurcis condescending to the last refuge of the meanest most commonplace mind a vulgar wretched lie what could have been expected from such a mind you may delude the world but i know you yes sir i know you and i will let everybody know you i will tear away the veil of charlatanism with which you have enveloped yourself the world shall at length discover the nature of the idol they have worshipped all your meanness all your falsehood all your selfishness all your baseness shall be revealed i may be spurned but at any rate i will be revenged  lord cadurcis yawned  insulting pitiful wretch continued the lady and you think that i wish to hear you speak you think the sound of that deceitful voice has any charm for me you are mistaken sir i have listened to you too long it was not to remonstrate with you that i resolved to see you the tones of your voice can only excite my disgust i am here to speak myself to express to you the contempt the detestation the aversion the scorn the hatred which i entertain for you  lord cadurcis whistled  the lady paused she had effected the professed purport of her visit she ought now to have retired and cadurcis would most willingly have opened the door for her and bowed her out of his apartment but her conduct did not exactly accord with her speech she intimated no intention of moving her courteous friend retained his position and adhered to his policy of silence there was a dead pause and then lady monteagle throwing herself into a chair went into hysterics  lord cadurcis following her example also seated himself took up a book and began to read  the hysterics became fainter and fainter they experienced all those gradations of convulsive noise with which lord cadurcis was so well acquainted at length they subsided into sobs and sighs finally there was again silence now only disturbed by the sound of a page turned by lord cadurcis  suddenly the lady sprang from her seat and firmly grasping the arm of cadurcis threw herself on her knees at his side  cadurcis she exclaimed in a tender tone do you love me  my dear gertrude said lord cadurcis coolly but rather regretting he had quitted his original and less assailable posture you know i like quiet women  cadurcis forgive me murmured the lady pity me think only how miserable i am  your misery is of your own making said lord cadurcis what occasion is there for any of these extraordinary proceedings i have told you a thousand times that i cannot endure scenes female society is a relaxation to me you convert it into torture i like to sail upon a summer sea and you always will insist upon a white squall  but you have deserted me  i never desert any one replied cadurcis calmly raising her from her supplicating attitude and leading her to a seat the last time we met you banished me your presence and told me never to speak to you again well i obeyed your orders as i always do  but i did not mean what i said said lady monteagle  how should i know that said lord cadurcis  your heart ought to have assured you said the lady  the tongue is a less deceptive organ than the heart replied her companion  cadurcis said the lady looking at her strange disguise what do you advise me to do  to go home and if you like i will order my visàvis for you directly and he rose from his seat to give the order  ah you are sighing to get rid of me said the lady in a reproachful but still subdued tone  why the fact is gertrude i prefer calling upon you to your calling upon me when i am fitted for your society i seek it and when you are goodtempered always with pleasure when i am not in the mood for it i stay away and when i am at home i wish to see no one i have business now and not very agreeable business i am disturbed by many causes and you could not have taken a step which could have given me greater annoyance than the strange one you have adopted this evening  i am sorry for it now said the lady weeping when shall i see you again  i will call upon you tomorrow and pray receive me with smiles  i ever will said the lady weeping plenteously it is all my fault you are ever too good there is not in the world a kinder and more gentle being than yourself i shall never forgive myself for this exposure  would you like to take anything said lord cadurcis i am sure you must feel exhausted you see i am drinking wine it is my only dinner today but i dare say there is some salvolatile in the house i dare say when my maids go into hysterics they have it  ah mocker said lady monteagle but i can pardon everything if you will only let me see you  au revoir then said his lordship i am sure the carriage must be ready i hear it come mr gertrude settle your wig it is quite awry by jove we might as well go to the pantheon as you are ready dressed i have a domino and so saying lord cadurcis handed the lady to his carriage and pressed her lightly by the hand as he reiterated his promise of calling at monteagle house the next day     chapter xvii   lord cadurcis unhappy at home and wearied of the commonplace resources of society had passed the night in every species of dissipation his principal companion being that same young nobleman in whose company he had been when he first met venetia at ranelagh the morn was breaking when cadurcis and his friend arrived at his door they had settled to welcome the dawn with a beaker of burnt burgundy  now my dear scrope said cadurcis now for quiet and philosophy the laughter of those infernal women the rattle of those cursed dice and the oaths of those ruffians are still ringing in my ears let us compose ourselves and moralise  accustomed to their masters habits who generally turned night into day the household were all on the alert a blazing fire greeted them and his lordship ordered instantly a devil and the burnt burgundy  sit you down here my scrope that is the seat of honour and you shall have it what is this a letter and marked urgent and in a mans hand it must be read some good fellow nabbed by a bailiff or planted by his mistress signals of distress we must assist our friends  the flame of the fire fell upon lord cadurcis face as he read the letter he was still standing while his friend was stretched out in his easy chair and inwardly congratulating himself on his comfortable prospects the countenance of cadurcis did not change but he bit his lip and read the letter twice and turned it over but with a careless air and then he asked what oclock it was the servant informed him and left the room  scrope said lord cadurcis quietly and still standing are you very drunk  my dear fellow i am as fresh as possible you will see what justice i shall do to the burgundy  burgundy tomorrow as the greek proverb saith observed lord cadurcis read that  his companion had the pleasure of perusing a challenge from lord monteagle couched in no gentle terms and requesting an immediate meeting  well i never heard anything more ridiculous in my life said lord scrope does he want satisfaction because you have planted her  dn her said lord cadurcis she has occasioned me a thousand annoyances and now she has spoilt our supper i dont know though he wants to fight quickly let us fight at once i will send him a cartel now and then we can have our burgundy you will go out with me of course hyde park six oclock and short swords  lord cadurcis accordingly sat down wrote his letter and dispatched it by mr spalding to monteagle house with peremptory instructions to bring back an answer the companions then turned to their devil  this is a bore cadurcis said lord scrope  it is i cannot say i am very valorous in a bad cause i do not like to fight upon compulsion i confess if i had time to screw my courage up i dare say i should do it very well i dare say for instance if ever i am publicly executed i shall die game  god forbid said lord scrope i say cadurcis i would not drink any burgundy if i were you i shall take a glass of cold water  ah you are only a second and so you want to cool your valour said cadurcis you have all the fun  but how came this blowup inquired lord scrope letters discovered eh because i thought you never saw her now  by jove my dear fellow she has been the whole evening here masquerading it like a very vixen as she is and now she has committed us both i have burnt her letters without reading them for the last month now i call that honourable because as i had no longer any claim on her heart i would not think of trenching on her correspondence but honour what is honour in these dishonourable days this is my reward she contrived to enter my house this evening dressed like a farmers boy and you may imagine what ensued rage hysterics and repentance i am sure if monteagle had seen me he would not have been jealous i never opened my mouth but like a fool sent her home in my carriage and now i am going to be run through the body for my politeness  in this light strain blended however with more decorous feeling on the part of lord scrope the young men conversed until the messengers return with lord monteagles answer in hyde park in the course of an hour himself and lord cadurcis attended by their friends were to meet  well there is nothing like having these affairs over said cadurcis and to confess the truth my dear scrope i should not much care if monteagle were to despatch me to my fathers for in the whole course of my miserable life and miserable whatever the world may think it has been i never felt much more wretched than i have during the last fourandtwenty hours by jove do you know i was going to leave england this morning and i have ordered my horses too  leave england  yes leave england and where i never intended to return  well you are the oddest person i ever knew cadurcis i should have thought you the happiest person that ever existed everybody admires everybody envies you you seem to have everything that man can desire your life is a perpetual triumph  ah my dear scrope there is a skeleton in every house if you knew all you would not envy me  well we have not much time said lord scrope have you any arrangements to make  none my property goes to george who is my only relative without the necessity of a will otherwise i should leave everything to him for he is a good fellow and my blood is in his veins just you remember scrope that i will be buried with my mother that is all and now let us get ready  the sun had just risen when the young men went forth and the day promised to be as brilliant as the preceding one not a soul was stirring in the courtly quarter in which cadurcis resided even the last watchman had stolen to repose they called a hackney coach at the first stand they reached and were soon at the destined spot they were indeed before their time and strolling by the side of the serpentine cadurcis said yesterday morning was one of the happiest of my life scrope and i was in hopes that an event would have occurred in the course of the day that might have been my salvation if it had bythebye i should not have returned to town and got into this cursed scrape however the gods were against me and now i am reckless  now lord monteagle and his friend who was mr horace pole appeared cadurcis advanced and bowed lord monteagle returned his bow stiffly but did not speak the seconds chose their ground the champions disembarrassed themselves of their coats and their swords crossed it was a brief affair after a few passes cadurcis received a slight wound in his arm while his weapon pierced his antagonist in the breast lord monteagle dropped his sword and fell  you had better fly lord cadurcis said mr horace pole this is a bad business i fear we have a surgeon at hand and he can help us to the coach that is waiting close by  i thank you sir i never fly said lord cadurcis and i shall wait here until i see your principal safely deposited in his carriage he will have no objection to my friend lord scrope assisting him who by his presence today has only fulfilled one of the painful duties that society imposes upon us  the surgeon gave an unfavourable report of the wound which he dressed on the field lord monteagle was then borne to his carriage which was at hand and lord scrope the moment he had seen the equipage move slowly off returned to his friend  well cadurcis he exclaimed in an anxious voice i hope you have not killed him what will you do now  i shall go home and await the result my dear scrope i am sorry for you for this may get you into trouble for myself i care nothing  you bleed said lord scrope  a scratch i almost wish our lots had been the reverse come scrope help me on with my coat yesterday i lost my heart last night i lost my money and perhaps tomorrow i shall lose my arm it seems we are not in luck     chapter xviii   it has been well observed that no spectacle is so ridiculous as the british public in one of its periodical fits of morality in general elopements divorces and family quarrels pass with little notice we read the scandal talk about it for a day and forget it but once in six or seven years our virtue becomes outrageous we cannot suffer the laws of religion and decency to be violated we must make a stand against vice we must teach libertines that the english people appreciate the importance of domestic ties accordingly some unfortunate man in no respect more depraved than hundreds whose offences have been treated with lenity is singled out as an expiatory sacrifice if he has children they are to be taken from him if he has a profession he is to be driven from it he is cut by the higher orders and hissed by the lower he is in truth a sort of whipping boy by whose vicarious agonies all the other transgressors of the same class are it is supposed sufficiently chastised we reflect very complacently on our own severity and compare with great pride the high standard of morals established in england with the parisian laxity at length our anger is satiated our victim is ruined and heartbroken and our virtue goes quietly to sleep for seven years more  these observations of a celebrated writer apply to the instance of lord cadurcis he was the periodical victim the scapegoat of english morality sent into the wilderness with all the crimes and curses of the multitude on his head lord cadurcis had certainly committed a great crime not his intrigue with lady monteagle for that surely was not an unprecedented offence not his duel with her husband for after all it was a duel in selfdefence and at all events divorces and duels under any circumstances would scarcely have excited or authorised the storm which was now about to burst over the late spoiled child of society but lord cadurcis had been guilty of the offence which of all offences is punished most severely lord cadurcis had been overpraised he had excited too warm an interest and the public with its usual justice was resolved to chastise him for its own folly  there are no fits of caprice so hasty and so violent as those of society society indeed is all passion and no heart cadurcis in allusion to his sudden and singular success had been in the habit of saying to his intimates that he woke one morning and found himself famous he might now observe i woke one morning and found myself infamous before twentyfour hours had passed over his duel with lord monteagle he found himself branded by every journal in london as an unprincipled and unparalleled reprobate the public without waiting to think or even to inquire after the truth instantly selected as genuine the most false and the most flagrant of the fifty libellous narratives that were circulated of the transaction stories inconsistent with themselves were all alike eagerly believed and what evidence there might be for any one of them the virtuous people by whom they were repeated neither cared nor knew the public in short fell into a passion with their darling and ashamed of their past idolatry nothing would satisfy them but knocking the divinity on the head  until lord monteagle to the great regret of society who really wished him to die in order that his antagonist might commit murder was declared out of danger lord cadurcis never quitted his house and he was not a little surprised that scarcely a human being called upon him except his cousin who immediately flew to his succour george indeed would gladly have spared cadurcis any knowledge of the storm that was raging against him and which he flattered himself would blow over before cadurcis was again abroad but he was so much with his cousin and cadurcis was so extremely acute and naturally so suspicious that this was impossible moreover his absolute desertion by his friends and the invectives and the lampoons with which the newspapers abounded and of which he was the subject rendered any concealment out of the question and poor george passed his life in running about contradicting falsehoods stating truth fighting his cousins battles and then reporting to him in the course of the day the state of the campaign  cadurcis being a man of infinite sensibility suffered tortures he had been so habituated to panegyric that the slightest criticism ruffled him and now his works had suddenly become the subject of universal and outrageous attack having lived only in a cloud of incense he suddenly found himself in a pillory of moral indignation his writings his habits his temper his person were all alike ridiculed and vilified in a word cadurcis the petted idolised spoiled cadurcis was enduring that charming vicissitude in a prosperous existence styled a reaction and a conqueror who deemed himself invincible suddenly vanquished could scarcely be more thunderstruck or feel more impotently desperate  the tortures of his mind however which this sudden change in his position and in the opinions of society were of themselves competent to occasion to one of so impetuous and irritable a temperament and who ever magnified both misery and delight with all the creative power of a brooding imagination were excited in his case even to the liveliest agony when he reminded himself of the situation in which he was now placed with venetia all hope of ever obtaining her hand had now certainly vanished and he doubted whether even her love could survive the quick occurrence after his ardent vows of this degrading and mortifying catastrophe he execrated lady monteagle with the most heartfelt rage and when he remembered that all this time the world believed him the devoted admirer of this vixen his brain was stimulated almost to the verge of insanity his only hope of the truth reaching venetia was through the medium of his cousin and he impressed daily upon captain cadurcis the infinite consolation it would prove to him if he could contrive to make her aware of the real facts of the case according to the public voice lady monteagle at his solicitation had fled to his house and remained there and her husband forced his entrance into the mansion in the middle of the night while his wife escaped disguised in lord cadurcis clothes she did not however reach monteagle house in time enough to escape detection by her lord who had instantly sought and obtained satisfaction from his treacherous friend all the monstrous inventions of the first week had now subsided into this circumstantial and undoubted narrative at least this was the version believed by those who had been cadurcis friends they circulated the authentic tale with the most considerate assiduity and shook their heads and said it was too bad and that he must not be countenanced  the moment lord monteagle was declared out of danger lord cadurcis made his appearance in public he walked into brookes and everybody seemed suddenly so deeply interested in the newspapers that you might have supposed they had brought intelligence of a great battle or a revolution or a change of ministry at the least one or two men spoke to him who had never presumed to address him at any other time and he received a faint bow from a distinguished nobleman who had ever professed for him the greatest consideration and esteem  cadurcis mounted his horse and rode down to the house of lords there was a debate of some public interest and a considerable crowd was collected round the peers entrance the moment lord cadurcis was recognised the multitude began hooting he was agitated and grinned a ghastly smile at the rabble but he dismounted without further annoyance and took his seat not a single peer of his own party spoke to him the leader of the opposition indeed bowed to him and in the course of the evening he received from one or two more of his party some formal evidences of frigid courtesy the tone of his reception by his friends could not be concealed from the ministerial party it was soon detected and generally whispered that lord cadurcis was cut nevertheless he sat out the debate and voted the house broke up he felt lonely his old friend the bishop of who had observed all that had occurred and who might easily have avoided him came forward however in the most marked manner and in a tone which everybody heard said how do you do lord cadurcis i am very glad to see you shaking his hand most cordially this made a great impression several of the tory lords among them venetias uncle now advanced and sainted him he received their advances with a haughty but not disdainful courtesy but when his whig friends confused now hurried to encumber him with their assistance he treated them with the scorn which they well deserved  will you take a seat in my carriage home lord cadurcis said his leader for it was notorious that cadurcis had been mobbed on his arrival  thank you my lord said cadurcis speaking very audibly i prefer returning as i came we are really both of us such unpopular personages that your kindness would scarcely be prudent  the house had been full there was a great scuffle and confusion as the peers were departing the mob now considerable were prepared for the appearance of lord cadurcis and their demeanour was menacing some shouted out his name then it was repeated with odious and vindictive epithets followed by ferocious yells a great many peers collected round cadurcis and entreated him not to return on horseback it must be confessed that genuine and considerable feeling was now shown by all men of all parties and indeed to witness this young and noble and gifted creature but a few days back the idol of the nation and from whom a word a glance even was deemed the greatest and most gratifying distinction whom all orders classes and conditions of men had combined to stimulate with multiplied adulation with all the glory and ravishing delights of the world as it were forced upon him to see him thus assailed with the savage execrations of all those vile things who exult in the fall of everything that is great and the abasement of everything that is noble was indeed a spectacle which might have silenced malice and satisfied envy  my carriage is most heartily at your service lord cadurcis said the noble leader of the government in the upper house you can enter it without the slightest suspicion by these ruffians lord cadurcis my dear lord my good lord for our sakes if not for your own cadurcis dear cadurcis my good cadurcis it is madness folly insanity a mob will do anything and an english mob is viler than all for heavens sake such were a few of the varied exclamations which resounded on all sides but which produced on the person to whom they were addressed only the result of his desiring the attendant to call for his horses  the lobby was yet full it was a fine thing in the light of the archway to see cadurcis spring into his saddle instantly there was a horrible yell yet in spite of all their menaces the mob were for a time awed by his courage they made way for him he might even have rode quickly on for some few yards but he would not he reined his fiery steed into a slow but stately pace and with a countenance scornful and composed he continued his progress apparently unconscious of impediment meanwhile the hooting continued without abatement increasing indeed after the first comparative pause in violence and menace at length a bolder ruffian excited by the uproar rushed forward and seized cadurcis bridle cadurcis struck the man over the eyes with his whip and at the same time touched his horse with his spur and the assailant was dashed to the ground this seemed a signal for a general assault it commenced with hideous yells his friends at the house who had watched everything with the keenest interest immediately directed all the constables who were at hand to rush to his succour hitherto they had restrained the police lest their interference might stimulate rather than repress the mob the charge of the constables was well timed they laid about them with their staves you might have heard the echo of many a broken crown nevertheless though they dispersed the mass they could not penetrate the immediate barrier that surrounded lord cadurcis whose only defence indeed for they had cut off his groom was the terrors of his horses heels and whose managed motions he regulated with admirable skill now rearing now prancing now kicking behind and now turning round with a quick yet sweeping motion before which the mob retreated off his horse however they seemed resolved to drag him and it was not difficult to conceive if they succeeded what must be his eventual fate they were infuriate but his contact with his assailants fortunately prevented their comates from hurling stones at him from the fear of endangering their own friends  a messenger to the horse guards had been sent from the house of lords but before the military could arrive and fortunately for with their utmost expedition they must have been too late a rumour of the attack got current in the house of commons captain cadurcis lord scrope and a few other young men instantly rushed out and ascertaining the truth armed with good cudgels and such other effective weapons as they could instantly obtain they mounted their horses and charged the nearlytriumphant populace dealing such vigorous blows that their efforts soon made a visible diversion in lord cadurcis favour it is difficult indeed to convey an idea of the exertions and achievements of captain cadurcis no paladin of chivalry ever executed such marvels on a swarm of paynim slaves and many a bloody coxcomb and broken limb bore witness in petty france that night to his achievements still the mob struggled and were not daunted by the delay in immolating their victim as long as they had only to fight against men in plain clothes they were valorous and obstinate enough but the moment that the crests of a troop of horse guards were seen trotting down parliament street everybody ran away and in a few minutes all palaceyard was as still as if the genius of the place rendered a riot impossible  lord cadurcis thanked his friends who were profuse in their compliments to his pluck his manner usually playful with his intimates of his own standing was however rather grave at present though very cordial he asked them home to dine with him but they were obliged to decline his invitation as a division was expected so saying goodbye george perhaps i shall see you tonight cadurcis rode rapidly off  with cadurcis there was but one step from the most exquisite sensitiveness to the most violent defiance the experience of this day had entirely cured him of his previous nervous deference to the feelings of society society had outraged him and now he resolved to outrage society he owed society nothing his reception at the house of lords and the riot in palaceyard had alike cleared his accounts with all orders of men from the highest to the lowest he had experienced indeed some kindness that he could not forget but only from his own kin and those who with his associations were the same as kin his memory dwelt with gratification on his cousins courageous zeal and still more on the demonstration which masham had made in his favour which if possible argued still greater boldness and sincere regard that was a trial of true affection and an instance of moral courage which cadurcis honoured and which he never could forget he was anxious about venetia he wished to stand as well with her as he deserved no better but he was grieved to think she could believe all those infamous tales at present current respecting himself but for the rest of the world he delivered them all to the most absolute contempt disgust and execration he resolved from this time nothing should ever induce him again to enter society or admit the advances of a single civilised ruffian who affected to be social the country the people their habits laws manners customs opinions and everything connected with them were viewed with the same jaundiced eye and his only object now was to quit england to which he resolved never to return     chapter xix   venetia was perhaps not quite so surprised as the rest of her friends when on their return to richmond lord cadurcis was not again seen she was very unhappy she recalled the scene in the garden at cherbury some years back and with the knowledge of the impetuosity of his temper she believed she should never see him again poor plantagenet who loved her so much and whose love she so fully returned why might they not be happy she neither doubted the constancy of his affection nor their permanent felicity if they were united she shared none of her mothers apprehensions or her prejudices but she was the victim of duty and her vow in the course of fourandtwenty hours strange rumours were afloat respecting lord cadurcis and the newspapers on the ensuing morning told the truth and more than the truth venetia could not doubt as to the duel or the elopement but instead of feeling indignation she attributed what had occurred to the desperation of his mortified mind and she visited on herself all the fatal consequences that had happened at present however all her emotions were quickly absorbed in the one terrible fear that lord monteagle would die in that dreadful and urgent apprehension every other sentiment merged it was impossible to conceal her misery and she entreated her mother to return to town  very differently however was the catastrophe viewed by lady annabel she on the contrary triumphed in her sagacity and her prudence she hourly congratulated herself on being the saviour of her daughter and though she refrained from indulging in any open exultation over venetias escape and her own profound discretion it was nevertheless impossible for her to conceal from her daughter her infinite satisfaction and selfcongratulation while venetia was half brokenhearted her mother silently returned thanks to providence for the merciful dispensation which had exempted her child from so much misery  the day after their return to town captain cadurcis called upon them lady annabel never mentioned the name of his cousin but george finding no opportunity of conversing with venetia alone and being indeed too much excited to speak on any other subject plunged at once into the full narrative defended lord cadurcis abused the monteagles and the slanderous world and in spite of lady annabels illconcealed dissatisfaction favoured her with an exact and circumstantial account of everything that had happened how it happened when it happened and where it happened concluding by a declaration that cadurcis was the best fellow that ever lived the most unfortunate and the most illused and that if he were to be hunted down for an affair like this over which he had no control there was not a man in london who could be safe for ten minutes all that george effected by his zeal was to convince lady annabel that his cousin had entirely corrupted him she looked upon her former favourite as another victim but venetia listened in silence and not without solace  two or three days after the riot at the house of lords captain cadurcis burst into his cousins room with a triumphant countenance well plantagenet he exclaimed i have done it i have seen her alone and i have put you as right as possible nothing can be better  tell me my dear fellow said lord cadurcis eagerly  well you know i have called halfadozen times said george but either lady annabel was there or they were not at home or something always occurred to prevent any private communication but i met her today with her aunt i joined them immediately and kept with them the whole morning i am sorry to say she i mean venetia is devilish ill she is indeed however her aunt now is quite on your side and very kind i can tell you that i put her right at first and she has fought our battle bravely well they stopped to call somewhere and venetia was so unwell that she would not get out and i was left alone in the carriage with her time was precious and i opened at once i told her how wretched you were and that the only thing that made you miserable was about her because you were afraid she would think you so profligate and all that i went through it all told her the exact truth which indeed she had before heard but now i assured her on my honour that it was exactly what happened and she said she did not doubt it and could not from some conversation which you had together the day we were all at hampton court and that she felt that nothing could have been premeditated and fully believed that everything had occurred as i said and however she deplored it she felt the same for you as ever and prayed for your happiness then she told me what misery the danger of lord monteagle had occasioned her that she thought his death must have been the forerunner of her own but the moment he was declared out of danger seemed the happiest hour of her life i told her you were going to leave england and asked her whether she had any message for you and she said tell him he is the same to me that he has always been so when her aunt returned i jumped out and ran on to you at once  you are the best fellow that ever lived george said lord cadurcis and now the world may go to the devil  this message from venetia acted upon lord cadurcis like a charm it instantly cleared his mind he shut himself up in his house for a week and wrote a farewell to england perhaps the most masterly effusion of his powerful spirit it abounded in passages of overwhelming passion and almost satanic sarcasm its composition entirely relieved his longbrooding brain it contained moreover a veiled address to venetia delicate tender and irresistibly affecting he appended also to the publication the verses he had previously addressed to her  this volume which was purchased with an avidity exceeding even the eagerness with which his former productions had been received exercised extraordinary influence on public opinion it enlisted the feelings of the nation on his side in a struggle with a coterie it was suddenly discovered that lord cadurcis was the most injured of mortals and far more interesting than ever the address to the unknown object of his adoration and the verses to venetia mystified everybody lady monteagle was universally abused and all sympathised with the longtreasured and baffled affection of the unhappy poet cadurcis however was not to be conciliated he left his native shores in a blaze of glory but with the accents of scorn still quivering on his lip     end of book iv     book v     chapter i   the still waters of the broad and winding lake reflected the lustre of the cloudless sky the gentle declinations of the green hills that immediately bordered the lake with an undulating margin that now retired into bays of the most picturesque form now jutted forth into woody promontories and then opened into valleys of sequestered beauty which the eye delighted to pursue were studded with white villas and cottages scarcely less graceful and occasionally with villages and even towns here and there rose a solitary chapel and scarcely less conspicuous the black spire of some cypress strikingly contrasting with the fair buildings or the radiant foliage that in general surrounded them a rampart of azure mountains raised their huge forms behind the nearer hills and occasionally peering over these like spectres on some brilliant festival were the ghastly visages of the alpine glaciers  it was within an hour of sunset and the long shadows had fallen upon the waters a broad boat with a variegated awning rowed by two men approached the steps of a marble terrace the moment they had reached their point of destination and had fastened the boat to its moorings the men landed their oars and immediately commenced singing a simple yet touching melody wherewith it was their custom to apprise their employers of their arrival  will they come forth this evening think you vittorio said one boatman to the other  by our holy mother i hope so replied his comrade for this light air that is now rising will do the young signora more good than fifty doctors  they are good people said vittorio it gives me more pleasure to row them than any persons who ever hired us  ay ay said his comrade it was a lucky day when we first put an oar in the lake for them heretics though they be  but they may he converted yet said his companion for as i was saying to father francisco last night if the young signora dies it is a sad thing to think what will become of her  and what said the good father  he shook his head said vittorio  when father francisco shakes his head he means a great deal said his companion  at this moment a servant appeared on the terrace to say the ladies were at hand and very shortly afterwards lady annabel herbert with her daughter leaning on her arm descended the steps and entered the boat the countenances of the boatmen brightened when they saw them and they both made their inquiries after the health of venetia with tenderness and feeling  indeed my good friends said venetia i think you are right and the lake will cure me after all  the blessing of the lake be upon you signora said the boatmen crossing themselves  just as they were moving off came running mistress pauncefort quite breathless miss herberts fur cloak my lady you told me to remember my lady and i cannot think how i forgot it but i really have been so very hot all day that such a thing as furs never entered my head and for my part until i travelled i always thought furs were only worn in russia but live and learn as i say  they were now fairly floating on the calm clear waters and the rising breeze was as grateful to venetia as the boatmen had imagined  a return of those symptoms which had before disquieted lady annabel for her daughter and which were formerly the cause of their residence at weymouth had induced her in compliance with the advice of her physicians to visit italy but the fatigue of travel had exhausted the energies of venetia for in those days the alps were not passed in luxurious travelling carriages on the very threshold of the promised land and lady annabel had been prevailed upon to take a villa on the lago maggiore where venetia had passed two months still suffering indeed from great debility but not without advantage  there are few spots more favoured by nature than the italian lakes and their vicinity combining as they do the most sublime features of mountainous scenery with all the softer beauties and the varied luxuriance of the plain as the still bright lake is to the rushing and troubled cataract is italy to switzerland and savoy emerging from the chaotic ravines and the wild gorges of the alps the happy land breaks upon us like a beautiful vision we revel in the sunny light after the unearthly glare of eternal snow our sight seems renovated as we throw our eager glance over those golden plains clothed with such picturesque trees sparkling with such graceful villages watered by such noble rivers and crowned with such magnificent cities and all bathed and beaming in an atmosphere so soft and radiant every isolated object charms us with its beautiful novelty for the first time we gaze on palaces the garden the terrace and the statue recall our dreams beneath a colder sky and we turn from these to catch the hallowed form of some cupolaed convent crowning the gentle elevation of some green hill and flanked by the cypress or the pine  the influence of all these delightful objects and of this benign atmosphere on the frame and mind of venetia had been considerable after the excitement of the last year of her life and the harassing and agitating scenes with which it closed she found a fine solace in this fair land and this soft sky which the sad perhaps can alone experience its repose alone afforded a consolatory contrast to the turbulent pleasure of the great world she looked back upon those glittering and noisy scenes with an aversion which was only modified by her selfcongratulation at her escape from their exhausting and contaminating sphere here she recurred but with all the advantages of a change of scene and a scene so rich in novel and interesting associations to the calm tenor of those days when not a thought ever seemed to escape from cherbury and its spellbound seclusion her books her drawings her easel and her harp were now again her chief pursuits pursuits however influenced by the genius of the land in which she lived and therefore invested with a novel interest for the literature and the history of the country naturally attracted her attention and its fair aspects and sweet sounds alike inspired her pencil and her voice she had in the society of her mother indeed the advantage of communing with a mind not less refined and cultivated than her own lady annabel was a companion whose conversation from reading and reflection was eminently suggestive and their hours though they lived in solitude never hung heavy they were always employed and always cheerful but venetia was not more than cheerful still very young and gifted with an imaginative and therefore sanguine mind the course of circumstances however had checked her native spirit and shaded a brow which at her time of life and with her temperament should have been rather fanciful than pensive if venetia supported by the disciplined energies of a strong mind had schooled herself into not looking back to the past with grief her future was certainly not tinged with the iris pencil of hope it seemed to her that it was her fate that life should bring her no happier hours than those she now enjoyed they did not amount to exquisite bliss that was a conviction which by no process of reflection however ingenious could she delude herself to credit venetia struggled to take refuge in content a mood of mind perhaps less natural than it should be to one so young so gifted and so fair  their villa was surrounded by a garden in the ornate and artificial style of the country a marble terrace overlooked the lake crowned with many a statue and vase that held the aloe the laurel and the cactus the cypress and the pine filled the air with their fragrance or charmed the eye with their rarity and beauty the walks were festooned with the vine and they could raise their hands and pluck the glowing fruit which screened them from the beam by which it was ripened in this enchanted domain venetia might be often seen a form even fairer than the sculptured nymphs among which she glided catching the gentle breeze that played upon the surface of the lake or watching the white sail that glittered in the sun as it floated over its purple bosom  yet this beautiful retreat venetia was soon to quit and she thought of her departure with a sigh her mother had been warned to avoid the neighbourhood of the mountains in the winter and the autumn was approaching its close if venetia could endure the passage of the apennines it was the intention of lady annabel to pass the winter on the coast of the mediterranean otherwise to settle in one of the lombard cities at all events in the course of a few weeks they were to quit their villa on the lake     chapter ii   a very few days after this excursion on the lake lady annabel and her daughter were both surprised and pleased with a visit from a friend whose appearance was certainly very unexpected this was captain cadurcis on his way from switzerland to sicily he had heard of their residence in the neighbourhood and had crossed over from arona to visit them  the name of cadurcis was still dear to venetia and george had displayed such gallantry and devotion in all his cousins troubles that she was personally attached to him he had always been a favourite of her mother his arrival therefore was welcomed by each of the ladies with great cordiality he accepted the hospitality which lady annabel offered him and remained with them a week a period which they spent in visiting the most beautiful and interesting spots of the lake with which they were already sufficiently familiar to allow them to prove guides as able as they were agreeable these excursions indeed contributed to the pleasure and happiness of the whole party there was about captain cadurcis a natural cheerfulness which animated every one in his society a gay simplicity difficult to define but very charming and which without effort often produced deeper impressions than more brilliant and subtle qualities left alone in the world and without a single advantage save those that nature had conferred upon him it had often been remarked that in whatever circle he moved george cadurcis always became the favourite and everywhere made friends his sweet and engaging temper had perhaps as much contributed to his professional success as his distinguished gallantry and skill other officers no doubt were as brave and able as captain cadurcis but his commanders always signalled him out for favourable notice and strange to say his success instead of exciting envy and illwill pleased even his less fortunate competitors however hard another might feel his own lot it was soothed by the reflection that george cadurcis was at least more fortunate his popularity however was not confined to his profession his cousins noble guardian whom george had never seen until he ventured to call upon his lordship on his return to england now looked upon him almost as a son and omitted no opportunity of advancing his interests in the world of all the members of the house of commons he was perhaps the only one that everybody praised and his success in the world of fashion had been as remarkable as in his profession these great revolutions in his life and future prospects had however not produced the slightest change in his mind and manners and this was perhaps the secret spell of his prosperity though we are most of us the creatures of affectation simplicity has a great charm especially when attended as in the present instance with many agreeable and some noble qualities in spite of the rough fortunes of his youth the breeding of captain cadurcis was high the recollection of the race to which he belonged had never been forgotten by him he was proud of his family he had one of those light hearts too which enable their possessors to acquire accomplishments with facility he had a sweet voice a quick ear a rapid eye he acquired a language as some men learn an air then his temper was imperturbable and although the most obliging and kindesthearted creature that ever lived there was a native dignity about him which prevented his goodnature from being abused no sense of interest either could ever induce him to act contrary to the dictates of his judgment and his heart at the risk of offending his patron george sided with his cousin although he had deeply offended his guardian and although the whole world was against him indeed the strong affection that lord cadurcis instantly entertained for george is not the least remarkable instance of the singular though silent influence that captain cadurcis everywhere acquired lord cadurcis had fixed upon him for his friend from the first moment of their acquaintance and though apparently there could not be two characters more dissimilar there were at bottom some striking points of sympathy and some strong bonds of union in the generosity and courage that distinguished both and in the mutual blood that filled their veins  there seemed to be a tacit understanding between the several members of our party that the name of lord cadurcis was not to be mentioned lady annabel made no inquiry after him venetia was unwilling to hazard a question which would annoy her mother and of which the answer could not bring her much satisfaction and captain cadurcis did not think fit himself to originate any conversation on the subject nevertheless venetia could not help sometimes fancying when her eyes met his that their mutual thoughts were the same and both dwelling on one who was absent and of whom her companion would willingly have conversed to confess the truth indeed george cadurcis was on his way to join his cousin who had crossed over from spain to barbary and journeyed along the african coast from tangiers to tripoli their point of reunion was to be sicily or malta hearing of the residence of the herberts on the lake he thought it would be but kind to plantagenet to visit them and perhaps to bear to him some message from venetia there was nothing indeed on which captain cadurcis was more intent than to effect the union between his cousin and miss herbert he was deeply impressed with the sincerity of plantagenets passion and he himself entertained for the lady the greatest affection and admiration he thought she was the only person whom he had ever known who was really worthy to be his cousins bride and independent of her personal charms and undoubted talents she had displayed during the outcry against lord cadurcis so much good sense such a fine spirit and such modest yet sincere affection for the victim that george cadurcis had almost lost his own heart to her when he was endeavouring to induce her not utterly to reject that of another and it became one of the dreams of his life that in a little time when all as he fondly anticipated had ended as it should and as he wished it he should be able to find an occasional home at cadurcis abbey and enjoy the charming society of one whom he had already taught himself to consider as a sister  and tonight you must indeed go said venetia as they were walking together on the terrace it was the only time that they had been alone together during his visit  i must start from arona at daybreak replied george and i must travel quickly for in less than a month i must be in sicily  sicily why are you going to sicily  captain cadurcis smiled i am going to join a friend of ours he answered  plantagenet she said  captain cadurcis nodded assent  poor plantagenet said venetia  his name has been on my lips several times said george  i am sure of that said venetia is he well  he writes to me in fair spirits said captain cadurcis he has been travelling in spain and now he is somewhere in africa we are to meet in sicily or malta i think travel has greatly benefited him he seems quite delighted with his glimpse of oriental manners and i should scarcely be surprised if he were now to stretch on to constantinople  i wonder if he will ever return to england said venetia thoughtfully  there is only one event that would induce him said captain cadurcis and then after a pause he added you will not ask me what it is  i wish he were in england and were happy said venetia  it is in your power to effect both results said her companion  it is useless to recur to that subject said venetia plantagenet knows my feelings towards him but fate has forbidden our destinies to be combined  then he will never return to england and never be happy ah venetia what shall i tell him when we meet what message am i to bear him from you  those regards which he ever possessed and has never forfeited said venetia  poor cadurcis said his cousin shaking his head if any man ever had reason to be miserable it is he  we are none of us very happy i think said venetia mournfully i am sure when i look back to the last few years of my life it seems to me that there is some curse hanging over our families i cannot penetrate it it baffles me  i am sure said captain cadurcis with great animation nay i would pledge my existence cheerfully on the venture that if lady annabel would only relent towards cadurcis we should all be the happiest people in the world  heigho said venetia there are other cares in our house besides our unfortunate acquaintance with your cousin we were the last people in the world with whom he should ever have become connected  and yet it was an intimacy that commenced auspiciously said her friend i am sure i have sat with cadurcis and listened to him by the hour while he has told me of all the happy days at cherbury when you were both children the only happy days according to him that he ever knew  yes they were happy days said venetia  and what connection could have offered a more rational basis for felicity than your union he continued whatever the world may think i who know cadurcis to the very bottom of his heart feel assured that you never would have repented for an instant becoming the sharer of his life your families were of equal rank your estates joined he felt for your mother the affection of a son there seemed every element that could have contributed to earthly bliss as for his late career you who know all have already have always indeed viewed it with charity placed in his position who could have acted otherwise i know very well that his genius which might recommend him to another woman is viewed by your mother with more than apprehension it is true that a man of his exquisite sensibility requires sympathies as refined to command his nature it is no common mind that could maintain its hold over cadurcis and his spirit could not yield but to rare and transcendent qualities he found them venetia he found them in her whom he had known longest and most intimately and loved from his boyhood talk of constancy indeed who has been so constant as my cousin no venetia you may think fit to bow to the feelings of your mother and it would be impertinence in me to doubt for an instant the propriety of your conduct i do not doubt it i admire it i admire you and everything you have done none can view your behaviour throughout all these painful transactions with more admiration i might even say with more reverence than myself but venetia you never can persuade me you have never attempted to persuade me that you yourself are incredulous of the strength and permanency of my cousins love  ah george you are our friend said venetia a tear stealing down her cheek but indeed we must not talk of these things as for myself i think not of happiness i am certain i am not born to be happy i wish only to live calmly contentedly i would say but that perhaps is too much my feelings have been so harrowed my mind so harassed during these last few years and so many causes of pain and misery seem ever hovering round my existence that i do assure you my dear friend i have grown old before my time ah you may smile george but my heart is heavy it is indeed  i wish i could lighten it said captain cadurcis i fear i am somewhat selfish in wishing you to marry my cousin for then you know i should have a permanent and authentic claim to your regard but no one at least i think so can feel more deeply interested in your welfare than i do i never knew any one like you and i always tell cadurcis so and that i think makes him worse but i cannot help it  venetia could not refrain from smiling at the simplicity of this confession  well continued her companion everything after all is for the best you and plantagenet are both very young i live in hopes that i shall yet see you lady cadurcis  venetia shook her head but was not sorry that their somewhat melancholy conversation should end in a livelier vein so they entered the villa  the hour of parting was painful and the natural gaiety of captain cadurcis deserted him he had become greatly attached to the herberts without any female relatives of his own their former intimacy and probable connection with his cousin had taught him to look upon them in some degree in the light of kindred he had originally indeed become acquainted with them in all the blaze of london society not very calculated to bring out the softer tints and more subdued tones of our character but even then the dignified grace of lady annabel and the radiant beauty of venetia had captivated him and he had cultivated their society with assiduity and extreme pleasure the grand crisis of his cousins fortunes had enabled him to become intimate with the more secret and serious qualities of venetia and from that moment he had taken the deepest interest in everything connected with her his happy and unexpected meeting in italy had completed the spell and now that he was about to leave them uncertain even if they should ever meet again his soft heart trembled and he could scarcely refrain from tears as he pressed their hands and bade them his sincere adieus  the moon had risen ere he entered his boat and flung a rippling line of glittering light on the bosom of the lake the sky was without a cloud save a few thin fleecy vapours that hovered over the azure brow of a distant mountain the shores of the lake were suffused with the serene effulgence and every object was so distinct that the eye was pained by the lights of the villages that every instant became more numerous and vivid the bell of a small chapel on the opposite shore and the distant chant of some fishermen still working at their nets were the only sounds that broke the silence which they did not disturb reclined in his boat george cadurcis watched the vanishing villa of the herberts until the light in the principal chamber was the only sign that assured him of its site that chamber held venetia the unhappy venetia he covered his face with his hand when even the light of her chamber vanished and full of thoughts tender and disconsolate he at length arrived at arona     chapter iii   pursuant to their plans the herberts left the lago maggiore towards the end of october and proceeded by gentle journeys to the apennines before they crossed this barrier they were to rest awhile in one of the lombard cities and now they were on the point of reaching arquâ which venetia had expressed a strong desire to visit  at the latter part of the last century the race of tourists the offspring of a long peace and the rapid fortunes made during the war did not exist travelling was then confined to the aristocracy and though the english when opportunity offered have ever been a restless people the gentle bosom of the euganean hills was then rarely disturbed amid its green and sequestered valleys  there is not perhaps in all the italian region fertile as it is in interesting associations and picturesque beauty a spot that tradition and nature have so completely combined to hallow as the last residence of petrarch it seems indeed to have been formed for the retirement of a pensive and poetic spirit it recedes from the world by a succession of delicate acclivities clothed with vineyards and orchards until winding within these hills the mountain hamlet is at length discovered enclosed by two ridges that slope towards each other and seem to shut out all the passions of a troubled race the houses are scattered at intervals on the steep sides of these summits and on a little knoll is the mansion of the poet built by himself and commanding a rich and extensive view that ends only with the shores of the adriatic sea his tomb a sarcophagus of red marble supported by pillars doubtless familiar to the reader is at hand and placed on an elevated site gives a solemn impression to a scene of which the character would otherwise be serenely cheerful  our travellers were surprised to find that the house of the poet was inhabited by a very different tenant to the rustic occupier they had anticipated they heard that a german gentleman had within the last year fixed upon it as the residence of himself and his wife the peasants were profuse in their panegyrics of this visitor whose arrival had proved quite an era in the history of their village according to them a kinder and more charitable gentleman never breathed his whole life was spent in studying and contributing to the happiness of those around him the sick the sorrowful and the needy were ever sure of finding a friend in him and merit a generous patron from him came portions to the portionless no village maiden need despair of being united to her betrothed while he could assist her and at his own cost he had sent to the academy of bologna a youth whom his father would have made a cowherd but whom nature predisposed to be a painter the inhabitants believed this benevolent and generous person was a physician for he attended the sick prescribed for their complaints and had once even performed an operation with great success it seemed that since petrarch no one had ever been so popular at arquâ as this kind german lady annabel and venetia were interested with the animated narratives of the everactive beneficence of this good man and lady annabel especially regretted that his absence deprived her of the gratification of becoming acquainted with a character so rare and so invaluable in the meantime they availed themselves of the offer of his servants to view the house of petrarch for their master had left orders that his absence should never deprive a pilgrim from paying his homage to the shrine of genius  the house consisting of two floors had recently been repaired by the present occupier it was simply furnished the groundfloor was allotted to the servants the upper story contained five rooms three of which were of good size and two closets in one of these were the traditionary chair and table of petrarch and here according to their guides the master of the house passed a great portion of his time in study to which by their account he seemed devoted the adjoining chamber was his library its windows opened on a balcony looking on two lofty and conical hills one topped with a convent while the valley opened on the side and spread into a calm and very pleasant view of the other apartments one served as a saloon but there was nothing in it remarkable except an admirably painted portrait of a beautiful woman which the servant informed them was their mistress  but that surely is not a german physiognomy said lady annabel  the mistress is an italian replied the servant  she is very handsome of whatever nation she may be replied lady annabel  oh how i should have liked to have met these happy people mamma said venetia for happy they surely must be  they seem to be good people said lady annabel it really lightened my heart to hear of all this gentlemans kind deeds  ah if the signora only knew the master said their guide she would indeed know a good man  they descended to the garden which certainly was not like the garden of their villa it had been but lately a wilderness of laurels but there were evidences that the eye and hand of taste were commencing its restoration with effect  the master did this said their guide he will allow no one to work in the garden but himself it is a week since he went to bologna to see our paulo he gained a prize at the academy and his father begged the master to be present when it was conferred on him he said it would do his son so much good so the master went though it is the only time he has quitted quâ since he came to reside here  and how long has he resided here inquired venetia  tis the second autumn said the guide and he came in the spring if the signora would only wait we expect the master home tonight or tomorrow and he would be glad to see her  we cannot wait my friend said lady annabel rewarding the guide but you will thank your master in our names for the kindness we have experienced you are all happy in such a friend  i must write my name in petrarchs house said venetia adieu happy arquâ adieu happy dwellers in this happy valley     chapter iv   just as lady annabel and her daughter arrived at rovigo one of those sudden and violent storms that occasionally occur at the termination of an italian autumn raged with irresistible fury the wind roared with a noise that overpowered the thunder then came a rattling shower of hail with stones as big as pigeons eggs succeeded by rain not in showers but literally in cataracts the only thing to which a tempest of rain in italy can be compared is the bursting of a waterspout venetia could scarcely believe that this could be the same day of which the golden morning had found her among the sunny hills of arquâ this unexpected vicissitude induced lady annabel to alter her plans and she resolved to rest at rovigo where she was glad to find that they could be sheltered in a commodious inn  the building had originally been a palace and in its halls and galleries and the vast octagonal vestibule on which the principal apartments opened it retained many noble indications of the purposes to which it was formerly destined  at present a lazy innkeeper who did nothing his bustling wife who seemed equally at home in the saloon the kitchen and even the stable and a solitary waiter were the only inmates except the herberts and a travelling party who had arrived shortly after them and who like them had been driven by stress of weather to seek refuge at a place where otherwise they had not intended to remain  a blazing fire of pine wood soon gave cheerfulness to the vast and somewhat desolate apartment into which our friends had been ushered their sleepingroom was adjoining but separated in spite of the lamentations of pauncefort who had been drenched to the skin and who required much more waiting upon than her mistress lady annabel and venetia at length produced some degree of comfort they drew the table near the fire they ensconced themselves behind an old screen and producing their books and work notwithstanding the tempest they contrived to domesticate themselves at rovigo  i cannot help thinking of arquâ and its happy tenants mamma said venetia  and yet perhaps they may have their secret sorrows said lady annabel i know not why i always associate seclusion with unhappiness  venetia remembered cherbury their life at cherbury was like the life of the german at arquâ a chance visitor to cherbury in their absence viewing the beautiful residence and the fair domain and listening to the tales which they well might hear of all her mothers grace and goodness might perhaps too envy its happy occupiers but were they happy had they no secret sorrows was their seclusion associated with unhappiness these were reflections that made venetia grave but she opened her journal and describing the adventures and feelings of the morning she dissipated some mournful reminiscences  the storm still raged venetia had quitted the saloon in which her mother and herself had been sitting and had repaired to the adjoining chamber to fetch a book the door of this room opened as all the other entrances of the different apartments on to the octagonal vestibule just as she was quitting the room and about to return to her mother the door of the opposite chamber opened and there came forward a gentleman in a venetian dress of black velvet his stature was much above the middle height though his figure which was remarkably slender was bowed not by years certainly for his countenance though singularly emaciated still retained traces of youth his hair which he wore very long descended over his shoulders and must originally have been of a light golden colour but now was severely touched with grey his countenance was very pallid so colourless indeed that its aspect was almost unearthly but his large blue eyes that were deeply set in his majestic brow still glittered with fire and their expression alone gave life to a visage which though singularly beautiful in its outline from its faded and attenuated character seemed rather the countenance of a corpse than of a breathing being  the glance of the stranger caught that of venetia and seemed to fascinate her she suddenly became motionless wildly she stared at the stranger who in his turn seemed arrested in his progress and stood still as a statue with his eyes fixed with absorbing interest on the beautiful apparition before him an expression of perplexity and pain flitted over the amazed features of venetia and then it seemed that by some almost supernatural effort confusion amounting to stupefaction suddenly brightened and expanded into keen and overwhelming intelligence exclaiming in a frenzied tone my father venetia sprang forward and fell senseless on the strangers breast  such after so much mystery so many aspirations so much anxiety and so much suffering such was the first meeting of venetia herbert with her father  marmion herbert himself trembling and speechless bore the apparently lifeless venetia into his apartment not permitting her for a moment to quit his embrace he seated himself and gazed silently on the inanimate and unknown form he held so strangely within his arms those lips now closed as if in death had uttered however one word which thrilled to his heart and still echoed like a supernatural annunciation within his ear he examined with an eye of agitated scrutiny the fair features no longer sensible of his presence he gazed upon that transparent brow as if he would read some secret in its pellucid veins and touched those long locks of golden hair with a trembling finger that seemed to be wildly seeking for some vague and miraculous proof of inexpressible identity the fair creature had called him father his dreaming reveries had never pictured a being half so beautiful she called him father tha word had touched his brain as lightning cuts a tree he looked around him with a distracted air then gazed on the tranced form he held with a glance which would have penetrated her soul and murmured unconsciously the wild word she had uttered she called him father he dared not think who she might be his thoughts were wandering in a distant land visions of another life another country rose before him troubled and obscure baffled aspirations and hopes blighted in the bud and the cherished secrets of his lorn existence clustered like clouds upon his perplexed yet creative brain she called him father it was a word to make him mad father this beautiful being had called him father and seemed to have expired as it were in the irresistible expression his heart yearned to her he had met her embrace with an inexplicable sympathy her devotion had seemed as it were her duty and his right yet who was she he was a father it was a fact a fact alike full of solace and mortification the consciousness of which never deserted him but he was the father of an unknown child to him the child of his poetic dreams rather than his reality and now there came this radiant creature and called him father was he awake and in the harsh busy world or was it the apparition of au overexcited imagination brooding too constantly on one fond idea on which he now gazed so fixedly was this some spirit would that she would speak again would that those sealed lips would part and utter but one word would but again call him father and he asked no more  father to be called father by one whom he could not name by one over whom he mused in solitude by one to whom he had poured forth all the passion of his desolate soul to be called father by this being was the aspiring secret of his life he had painted her to himself in his loneliness he had conjured up dreams of ineffable loveliness and inexpressible love he had led with her an imaginary life of thrilling tenderness he had indulged in a delicious fancy of mutual interchange of the most exquisite offices of our nature and then when he had sometimes looked around him and found no daughter there no beaming countenance of purity to greet him with its constant smile and receive the quick and ceaseless tribute of his vigilant affection the tears had stolen down his latelyexcited features all the consoling beauty of his visions had vanished into air he had felt the deep curse of his desolation and had anathematised the cunning brain that made his misery a thousandfold keener by the mockery of its transporting illusions  and now there came this transcendent creature with a form more glowing than all his dreams a voice more musical than a seraphic chorus though it had uttered but one thrilling word there came this transcendent creature beaming with grace beauty and love and had fallen upon his heart and called him father  herbert looked up to heaven as if waiting for some fresh miracle to terminate the harrowing suspense of his tortured mind herbert looked down upon his mysterious companion the rose was gradually returning to her cheek her lips seemed to tremble with reviving breath there was only one word more strange to his ear than that which she had uttered but an irresistible impulse sent forth the sound  venetia he exclaimed  the eyes of the maiden slowly opened she stared around her with a vague glance of perplexity not unmingled with pain she looked up she caught the rapt gaze of her father bending over her with fondness yet with fear his lips moved for a moment they refused to articulate yet at length they again uttered venetia and the only response she made was to cling to him with nervous energy and hide her face in his bosom  herbert pressed her to his heart yet even now he hesitated to credit the incredible union again he called her by her name but added with rising confidence my venetia  your child your child she murmured your own venetia  he pressed his lips to hers he breathed over her a thousand blessings she felt his tears trickling on her neck  at length venetia looked up and sighed she was exhausted by the violence of her emotions her father relaxed his grasp with infinite tenderness watching her with delicate solicitude she leaned her arm upon his shoulder with downcast eyes  herbert gently took her disengaged hand and pressed it to his lips i am as in a dream murmured venetia  the daughter of my heart has found her sire said herbert in an impassioned voice the father who has long lived upon her fancied image the father i fear she has been bred up to hate  oh no no said venetia speaking rapidly and with a slight shiver not hate it was a secret his being was a secret his name was never mentioned it was unknown  a secret my existence a secret from my child my beautiful fond child exclaimed herbert in a tone even more desolate than bitter why did they not let you at least hate me  my father said venetia in a firmer voice and with returning animation yet gazing around her with a still distracted air am i with my father the clouds clear from my brain i remember that we met where was it was it at arquâ in the garden i am with my father she continued in a rapid tone and with a wild smile oh let me look on him and she turned round and gazed upon herbert with a serious scrutiny are you my father she continued in a still small voice your hair has grown grey since last i saw you it was golden then like mine i know you are my father she added after a pause and in a tone almost of gaiety you cannot deceive me i know your name they did not tell it me i found it out myself but it made me very ill very and i do not think i have ever been quite well since you are marmion herbert my mother had a dog called marmion when i was a little girl but i did not know i had a father then  venetia exclaimed herbert with streaming eyes as he listened with anguish to these incoherent sentences my venetia loves me  oh she always loved you replied venetia always always before she knew her father she loved him i dare say you think i do not love you because i am not used to speak to a father everything must be learnt you know she said with a faint sad smile and then it was so sudden i do not think my mother knows it yet and after all though i found you out in a moment still i know not why i thought it was a picture but i read your verses and i knew them by heart at once but now my memory has worn out for i am ill and everything has gone cross with me and all because my father wrote me verses tis very strange is not it  sweet lamb of my affections exclaimed herbert to himself i fear me much this sudden meeting with one from whose bosom you ought never to have been estranged has been for the moment too great a trial for this delicate brain  i will not tell my mother said venetia she will be angry  your mother darling where is your mother said herbert looking if possible paler than he was wont  she was at arquâ with me and on the lake for months but where we are now i cannot say if i could only remember where we are now she added with earnestness and with a struggle to collect herself i should know everything  this is rovigo my child the inn of rovigo you are travelling with your mother is it not so  yes and we came this morning and it rained now i know everything said venetia with an animated and even cheerful air  and we met in the vestibule my sweet continued herbert in a soothing voice we came out of opposite chambers and you knew me my venetia knew me try to tell me my darling he added in a tone of coaxing fondness try to remember how venetia knew her father  he was so like his picture at cherbury replied venetia  cherbury exclaimed herbert with a deepdrawn sigh  only your hair has grown grey dear father but it is long quite as long as in your picture  her dog called marmion murmured herbert to himself and my portrait too you saw your fathers portrait then every day love  oh no said venetia shaking her head only once only once and i never told mamma it was where no one could go but i went there one day it was in a room that no one ever entered except mamma but i entered it i stole the key and had a fever and in my fever i confessed all but i never knew it mamma never told me i confessed it until many many years afterwards it was the first the only time she ever mentioned to me your name my father  and she told you to shun me to hate me she told you i was a villain a profligate a demon eh eh was it not so venetia  she told me that you had broken her heart said venetia and she prayed to god that her child might not be so miserable  oh my venetia exclaimed herbert pressing her to his breast and in a voice stifled with emotion i feel now we might have been happy  in the meantime the prolonged absence of her daughter surprised lady annabel at length she rose and walked into their adjoining apartment but to her surprise venetia was not there returning to her saloon she found pauncefort and the waiter arranging the table for dinner  where is miss herbert pauncefort inquired lady annabel  i am sure my lady i cannot say i have no doubt she is in the other room  she is not there for i have just quitted it replied lady annabel how very strange you have not seen the signora inquired lady annabel of the waiter  the signora is in the room with the gentleman  the gentleman exclaimed lady annabel tell me good man what do you mean i am inquiring for my daughter  i know well the signora is talking of her daughter replied the waiter  but do you know my daughter by sight surely you you must mean some one else  do i know the signoras daughter said the waiter the beautiful young lady with hair like santa marguerita in the church of the holy trinity i tell the signora i saw her carried into numero 4 in the arms of the signor forestiere who arrived this morning  venetia is ill said lady annabel show me to the room my friend  lady annabel accordingly with a hurried step following her guide quitted the chamber pauncefort remained fixed to the earth the very picture of perplexity  well to be sure she exclaimed was anything ever so strange in the arms of signor forestiere forestiere an english name there is no person of the name of forest that i know and in his arms too i should not wonder if it was my lord after all well i should be glad if he were to come to light again for after all my lady may say what she likes but if miss venetia dont marry lord cadurcis i must say marriages were never made in heaven     chapter v   the waiter threw open the door of mr herberts chamber and lady annabel swept in with a majesty she generally assumed when about to meet strangers the first thing she beheld was her daughter in the arms of a man whose head was bent and who was embracing her notwithstanding this astounding spectacle lady annabel neither started nor screamed she only said in an audible tone and one rather expressing astonishment than agitation venetia  immediately the stranger looked up and lady annabel beheld her husband  she was rooted to the earth she turned deadly pale for a moment her countenance expressed only terror but the terror quickly changed into aversion suddenly she rushed forward and exclaimed in a tone in which decision conquered dismay restore me my child  the moment herbert had recognised his wife he had dexterously disengaged himself from the grasp of venetia whom he left on the chair and meeting lady annabel with extended arms that seemed to deprecate her wrath he said i seek not to deprive you of her she is yours and she is worthy of you but respect for a few moments the feelings of a father who has met his only child in a manner so unforeseen  the presence of her mother instantaneously restored venetia to herself her mind was in a moment cleared and settled her past and peculiar life and all its incidents recurred to her with their accustomed order vividness and truth she thoroughly comprehended her present situation actuated by longcherished feelings and the necessity of the occasion she rose and threw herself at her mothers feet and exclaimed o mother he is my father love him  lady annabel stood with an averted countenance venetia clinging to her hand which she had caught when she rushed forward and which now fell passive by lady annabels side giving no sign by any pressure or motion of the slightest sympathy with her daughter or feeling for the strange and agonising situation in which they were both placed  annabel said herbert in a voice that trembled though the speaker struggled to appear calm be charitable i have never intruded upon your privacy i will not now outrage it accident or some diviner motive has brought us together this day if you will not treat me with kindness look not upon me with aversion before our child  still she was silent and motionless her countenance hidden from her husband and her daughter but her erect and haughty form betokening her inexorable mind annabel said herbert who had now withdrawn to some distance and leant against a pillar will not then nearly twenty years of desolation purchase one moment of intercourse i have injured you be it so this is not the moment i will defend myself but have i not suffered is not this meeting a punishment deeper even than your vengeance could devise is it nothing to behold this beautiful child and feel that she is only yours annabel look on me look on me only one moment my frame is bowed my hair is grey my heart is withered the principle of existence waxes faint and slack in this attenuated frame i am no longer that herbert on whom you once smiled but a man stricken with many sorrows the odious conviction of my life cannot long haunt you yet a little while and my memory will alone remain think of this annabel i beseech you think of it oh believe me when the speedy hour arrives that will consign me to the grave where i shall at least find peace it will not be utterly without satisfaction that you will remember that we met if even by accident and parted at least not with harshness  mother dearest mother murmured venetia speak to him look on him  venetia said her mother without turning her head but in a calm firm tone your father has seen you has conversed with you between your father and myself there can be nothing to communicate either of fact or feeling now let us depart  no no not depart said venetia franticly you did not say depart dear mother i cannot go she added in a low and halfhysterical voice  desert me then said the mother a fitting consequence of your private communications with your father she added in a tone of bitter scorn and lady annabel moved to depart but venetia still kneeling clung to her convulsively  mother mother you shall not go you shall not leave me we will never part mother continued venetia in a tone almost of violence as she perceived her mother give no indication of yielding to her wish are my feelings then nothing she then exclaimed is this your sense of my fidelity am i for ever to be a victim she loosened her hold of her mothers hand her mother moved on venetia fell upon her forehead and uttered a faint scream the heart of lady annabel relented when she fancied her daughter suffered physical pain however slight she hesitated she turned she hastened to her child her husband had simultaneously advanced in the rapid movement and confusion her hand touched that of herbert  i yield her to you annabel said herbert placing venetia in her mothers arms you mistake me as you have often mistaken me if you think i seek to practise on the feelings of this angelic child she is yours may she compensate you for the misery i have caused you but never sought to occasion  i am not hurt dear mother said venetia as her mother tenderly examined her forehead dear dear mother why did you reproach me  forget it said lady annabel in a softened tone for indeed you are irreproachable  o annabel said herbert may not this child be some atonement this child of whom i solemnly declare i would not deprive you though i would willingly forfeit my life for a year of her affection and your your sufferance he added  mother speak to him said venetia with her head on her mothers bosom who still however remained rigidly standing but lady annabel was silent  your mother was ever stern and cold venetia said herbert the bitterness of his heart at length expressing itself  never said venetia with great energy never you know not my mother was she stern and cold when she visited each night in secret your portrait said venetia looking round upon her astonished father with her bright grey eye was she stern and cold when she wept over your poems those poems whose characters your own hand had traced was she stern and cold when she hung a withered wreath on your bridal bed the bed to which i owe my miserable being oh no my father sad was the hour of separation for my mother and yourself it may have dimmed the lustre of her eye and shaded your locks with premature grey but whatever may have been its inscrutable cause there was one victim of that dark hour less thought of than yourselves and yet a greater sufferer than both the being in whose heart you implanted affections whose unfulfilled tenderness has made that wretched thing they call your daughter  annabel exclaimed herbert rapidly advancing with an imploring gesture and speaking in a tone of infinite anguish annabel annabel even now we can be happy  the countenance of his wife was troubled but its stern expression had disappeared the longconcealed yet at length irrepressible emotion of venetia had touched her heart in the conflict of affection between the claims of her two parents lady annabel had observed with a sentiment of sweet emotion in spite of all the fearfulness of the meeting that venetia had not faltered in her devotion to her mother the mental torture of her child touched her to the quick in the excitement of her anguish venetia had expressed a profound sentiment the irresistible truth of which lady annabel could no longer withstand she had too long and too fondly schooled herself to look upon the outraged wife as the only victim there was then at length it appeared to this sternminded woman another she had laboured in the flattering delusion that the devotion of a mothers love might compensate to venetia for the loss of that other parent which in some degree lady annabel had occasioned her for the worthless husband had she chosen to tolerate the degrading connection might nevertheless have proved a tender father but nature it seemed had shrunk from the vain effort of the isolated mother the seeds of affection for the father of her being were mystically implanted in the bosom of his child lady annabel recalled the harrowing hours that this attempt by her to curb and control the natural course and rising sympathies of filial love had cost her child on whom she had so vigilantly practised it she recalled her strange aspirations her inspired curiosity her brooding reveries her fitful melancholy her terrible illness her resignation her fidelity her sacrifices there came across the mind of lady annabel a mortifying conviction that the devotion to her child on which she had so rated herself might after all only prove a subtle form of profound selfishness and that venetia instead of being the idol of her love might eventually be the martyr of her pride and thinking of these things she wept  this evidence of emotion which in such a spirit herbert knew how to estimate emboldened him to advance he fell on one knee before her and her daughter gently he stole her hand and pressed it to his lips it was not withdrawn and venetia laid her hand upon theirs and would have bound them together had her mother been relentless it seemed to venetia that she was at length happy but she would not speak she would not disturb the still and silent bliss of the impending reconciliation was it then indeed at hand in truth the deportment of herbert throughout the whole interview so delicate so subdued so studiously avoiding the slightest rivaly with his wife in the affections of their child and so carefully abstaining from attempting in the slightest degree to control the feelings of venetia had not been lost upon lady annabel and when she thought of him so changed from what he had been grey bent and careworn with all the lustre that had once so fascinated her faded and talking of that impending fate which his wan though spiritual countenance too clearly intimated her heart melted  suddenly the door burst open and there stalked into the room a woman of eminent but most graceful stature and of a most sovereign and voluptuous beauty she was habited in the venetian dress her dark eyes glittered with fire her cheek was inflamed with no amiable emotion and her long black hair was disordered by the violence of her gesture  and who are these she exclaimed in a shrill voice  all started herbert sprang up from his position with a glance of withering rage venetia was perplexed lady annabel looked round and recognised the identical face however distorted by passion that she had admired in the portrait at arquâ  and who are these exclaimed the intruder advancing perfidious marmion to whom do you dare to kneel  lady annabel drew herself up to a height that seemed to look down even upon this tall stranger the expression of majestic scorn that she cast upon the intruder made her in spite of all her violence and excitement tremble and be silent she felt cowed she knew not why  come venetia said lady annabel with all her usual composure let me save my daughter at least from this profanation  annabel said herbert rushing after them be charitable be just he followed them to the threshold of the door venetia was silent for she was alarmed  adieu marmion said lady annabel looking over her shoulder with a bitter smile but placing her daughter before her as if to guard her adieu marmion adieu for ever     chapter vi   the moon shone brightly on the house of petrarch and the hamlet slept in peace not a sound was heard save the shrill voice of the grasshoppers so incessant that its monotony blended as it were with the stillness over the green hills and the far expanse of the sheeny plain the beautiful light of heaven fell with all the magical repose of the serene hour an hour that brought to one troubled breast and one distracted spirit in that still and simple village no quietude  herbert came forth into the balcony of his residence and leaning over the balustrade revolved in his agitated mind the strange and stirring incidents of the day his wife and his child had quitted the inn of rovigo instantly after that mortifying rencounter that had dashed so cruelly to the ground all his sweet and quicklyrising hopes as for his companion she had by his peremptory desire returned to arquâ alone he was not in a mood to endure her society but he had conducted himself to her mildly though with firmness he had promised to follow her and in pursuance of his pledge he rode home alone  he was greeted on his return by his servant full of the the visit of the morning with an irresistible curiosity herbert had made him describe every incident that had occurred and repeat a hundred times every word that the visitors had uttered he listened with some consolation however mournful to his wifes praises of the unknown strangers life he gazed with witching interest upon the autograph of his daughter on the wall of his library he had not confessed to his mistress the relation which the two strangers bore to him yet he was influenced in concealing the real circumstances only by an indefinite sentiment that made him reluctant to acknowledge to her ties so pure the feelings of the parent overpowered the principles of the philosopher this lady indeed although at the moment she had indulged in so violent an ebullition of temper possessed little influence over the mind of her companion herbert however fond of solitude required in his restricted world the graceful results of feminine superintendence time had stilled his passions and cooled the fervour of his soul the age of his illusions had long passed this was a connection that had commenced in no extravagant or romantic mood and perhaps for that reason had endured he had become acquainted with her on his first unknown arrival in italy from america now nearly two years back it had been maintained on his side by a temper naturally sweet and which exhausted by years of violent emotion now required only repose seeking in a female friend a form that should not outrage an eye ever musing on the beautiful and a disposition that should contribute to his comfort and never ruffle his feelings separated from his wife by her own act whatever might have been its impulse and for so long an interval it was a connection which the world in general might have looked upon with charity which in her calmer hours one would imagine even lady annabel might have glanced over without much bitterness certainly it was one which under all the circumstances of the case could scarcely be esteemed by her as an outrage or an insult but even herbert felt with all his philosophy and proud freedom from prejudice that the rencounter of the morning was one which no woman could at the moment tolerate few eventually excuse and which of all incidents was that which would most tend to confirm his wife in her stoical obduracy of his offences towards her whatever were their number or their quality this surely was the least and yet its results upon his life and fortunes would in all probability only be equalled by the mysterious cause of their original separation but how much more bitter than that original separation was their present parting mortifying and annoying as had been the original occurrence it was one that many causes and considerations combined to enable herbert to support he was then in the very prime of youth inexperienced sanguine restless and adventurous with the whole world and its unknown results before him and freedom for which he ever sighed to compensate for the loss of that domestic joy that he was then unable to appreciate but now twenty years which in the career of such a spirit were equal to a century of the existence of coarser clay had elapsed he was bowed with thought and suffering if not by time his conscience was light but it was sad his illusions had all vanished he knew the world and all that the world could bring and he disregarded them and the result of all his profound study lofty aspirations and great conduct was that he sighed for rest the original catastrophe had been merely a separation between a husband and a wife the one that had just happened involved other feelings the father was also separated from his child and a child of such surpassing qualities that his brief acquaintance with her had alone sufficed to convert his dream of domestic repose into a vision of domestic bliss  beautiful venetia so fair and yet so dutiful with a bosom teeming with such exquisite sensibilities and a mind bright with such acute and elevated intelligence an abstract conception of the sentiments that might subsist between a father and a daughter heightened by all the devices of a glowing imagination had haunted indeed occasionally the solitary musing of marmion herbert but what was this creation of his poetic brain compared with the reality that now had touched his human heart vainly had he believed that repose was the only solace that remained for his exhausted spirit he found that a new passion now swayed his soul a passion too that he had never proved of a nature most peculiar pure gentle refined yet ravishing and irresistible compared with which all former transports no matter how violent tumultuous and exciting seemed evanescent and superficial they were indeed the wind the fire and the tempest that had gone before but this was the still small voice that followed excelled and survived their might and majesty unearthly and eternal  his heart melted to his daughter nor did he care to live without her love and presence his philosophical theories all vanished he felt how dependent we are in this world on our natural ties and how limited with all his arrogance is the sphere of man dreaming of philanthropy he had broken his wifes heart and bruised perhaps irreparably the spirit of his child he had rendered those miserable who depended on his love and for whose affection his heart now yearned to that degree that he could not contemplate existence without their active sympathy  was it then too late was it then impossible to regain that paradise he had forfeited so weakly and of whose amaranthine bowers but a few hours since he had caught such an entrancing glimpse of which the gate for a moment seemed about to reopen in spite of all then annabel still loved him loved him passionately visited his picture mused over the glowing expression of their loves wept over the bridal bed so soon deserted she had a dog too when venetia was a child and called it marmion  the recollection of this little trait so trifling yet so touching made him weep even with wildness the tears poured down his cheeks in torrents he sobbed convulsively his very heart seemed to burst for some minutes he leant over the balustrade in a paroxysm of grief  he looked up the convent hill rose before him bright in the moon beneath was his garden around him the humble roofs that he made happy it was not without an effort that he recalled the locality that he remembered he was at arquâ and who was sleeping within the house not his wife annabel was far away with their daughter the vision of his whole life passed before him study and strife and fame and love the pride of the philosopher the rapture of the poet the blaze of eloquence the clash of arms the vows of passion the execration and the applause of millions both once alike welcome to his indomitable soul and what had they borne to him misery he called up the image of his wife young beautiful and noble with a mind capable of comprehending his loftiest and his finest moods with a soul of matchless purity and a temper whose winning tenderness had only been equalled by her elevated sense of selfrespect a woman that might have figured in the days of chivalry soft enough to be his slave but too proud to be his victim he called up her image in the castle of his fathers exercising in a domain worthy of such a mistress all those sweet offices of life which here in this hired roof in a strange land and with his crippled means he had yet found solacing he conjured before him a bud by the side of that beauteous flower sharing all her lustre and all her fragrance his own venetia what happiness might not have been his and for what had he forfeited it a dream with no dreamlike beauty a perturbed and restless and agitated dream from which he had now woke shattered and exhausted  he had sacrificed his fortune he had forfeited his country he had alienated his wife and he had lost his child the home of his heroic ancestry the ancient land whose fame and power they had created the beauteous and gifted woman who would have clung for ever to his bosom and her transcendant offspring worthy of all their loves profound philosopher  the clock of the convent struck the second hour after midnight herbert started and all this time where were annabel and venetia they still lived they were in the same country an hour ago they were under the same roof in the same chamber their hands had joined their hearts had opened for a moment he had dared to believe that all that he cared for might be regained and why was it not the cause the cause it recurred to him with associations of dislike of disgust of wrath of hatred of which one whose heart was so tender and whose reason was so clear could under the influence of no other feelings have been capable the surrounding scene that had so often soothed his mournful soul and connected it with the last hours of a spirit to whom he bore much resemblance was now looked upon with aversion to rid himself of ties now so dreadful was all his ambition he entered the house quickly and seating himself in his closet he wrote these words  you beheld this morning my wife and child we can meet no more all that i can effect to console you under this sudden separation shall be done my banker from bologna will be here in two days express to him all your wishes  it was written sealed directed and left upon the table at which they had so often been seated herbert descended into the garden saddled his horse and in a few minutes in the heart of night had quitted arquâ     chapter vii   the moment that the wife of marmion herbert reentered her saloon she sent for her courier and ordered horses to her carriage instantly until they were announced as ready lady annabel walked up and down the room with an impatient step but was as completely silent as the miserable venetia who remained weeping on the sofa the confusion and curiosity of mistress pauncefort were extraordinary she still had a lurking suspicion that the gentleman was lord cadurcis and she seized the first opportunity of leaving the room and flouncing into that of the stranger as if by mistake determined to catch a glimpse of him but all her notable skill was baffled for she had scarcely opened the door before she was met by the italian lady who received mistress paunceforts readymade apology and bowed her away the faithful attendant then hurried downstairs to crossexamine the waiter but though she gained considerable information from that functionary it was of a perplexing nature for from him she only learnt that the stranger lived at arquâ the german gentleman soliloquised mistress pauncefort and what could he have to say to miss venetia and a married man too well to be sure there is nothing like travelling for adventures and i must say considering all that i know and how i have held my tongue for nearly twenty years i think it is very strange indeed of my lady to have any secrets from me secrets indeed poh and mistress pauncefort flounced again into lady annabels room with a face of offended pride knocking the books about dashing down writing cases tossing about work and making as much noise and disturbance as if she had a separate quarrel with every single article under her superintendence  in the meantime the carriage was prepared to which they were obliged almost to carry venetia feeble and stupefied with grief uncertain of her course but anxious in the present state of her daughter for rest and quiet lady annabel ordered the courier to proceed to padua at which city they arrived late at night scarcely a word having been interchanged during the whole journey between lady annabel and her child though infinite were the soft and soothing attentions which the mother lavished upon her night however brought no rest to venetia and the next day her state appeared so alarming to lady annabel that she would have instantly summoned medical assistance had it not been for venetias strong objections indeed dear mother she said it is not physicians that i require they cannot cure me let me be quiet  the same cause indeed which during the last five years had at intervals so seriously menaced the existence of this unhappy girl was now at work with renovated and even irresistible influence her frame could no longer endure the fatal action of her overexcited nerves her first illness however alarming had been baffled by time skill and principally by the vigour of an extremely youthful frame then a stranger to any serious indisposition at a later period the change of life induced by their residence at weymouth had permitted her again to rally she had quitted england with renewed symptoms of her former attack but a still more powerful change not only of scene but of climate and country and the regular and peaceful life she had led on the lago maggiore had again reassured the mind of her anxious mother this last adventure at rovigo however prostrated her the strange surprise the violent development of feeling the agonising doubts and hopes the terrible suspense the profound and bitter and overwhelming disappointment all combined to shake her mind to its very foundations she felt for the first time that she could no longer bear up against the torture of her singular position her energy was entirely exhausted she was no longer capable of making the slightest exertion she took refuge in that torpid resignation that results from utter hopelessness  lying on her sofa with her eyes fixed in listless abstraction the scene at rovigo flitted unceasingly before her languid vision at length she had seen that father that unknown and mysterious father whose idea had haunted her infancy as if by inspiration to gain the slightest knowledge of whom had cost her many long and acute suffering and round whose image for so many years every thought of her intelligence and every feeling of her heart had clustered like spirits round some dim and mystical altar at length she had beheld him she had gazed on that spiritual countenance she had listened to the tender accents of that musical voice within his arms she had been folded with rapture and pressed to a heart that seemed to beat only for her felicity the blessing of her father uttered by his longloved lips had descended on her brow and been sealed with his passionate embrace  the entrance of her mother that terrible contest of her lacerated heart when her two parents as it were appealed to her love which they would not share the inspiration of her despair that so suddenly had removed the barriers of long years before whose irresistible pathos her father had bent a penitent and her mothers inexorable pride had melted the ravishing bliss that for a moment had thrilled through her being experienced too for the first time when she felt that her parents were again united and bound by the sweet tie of her now happy existence this was the drama acted before her with an almost ceaseless repetition of its transporting incidents and when she looked round and beheld her mother sitting alone and watching her with a countenance almost of anguish it was indeed with extreme difficulty that venetia could persuade herself that all had not been a reverie and she was only convinced of the contrary by that heaviness of the heart which too quickly assures us of the reality of those sorrows of which fancy for a moment may cheat us into scepticism  and indeed her mother was scarcely less miserable the sight of herbert so changed from the form that she remembered those tones of heartrending sincerity in which he had mournfully appealed to the influence of time and sorrow on his life still greatly affected her she had indulged for a moment in a dream of domestic love she had cast to the winds the inexorable determination of a life and had mingled her tears with those of her husband and her child and how had she been repaid by a degrading catastrophe from whose revolting associations her mind recoiled with indignation and disgust but her lingering feeling for her husband her own mortification were as nothing compared with the harrowing anxiety she now entertained for her daughter to converse with venetia on the recent occurrence was impossible it was a subject which admitted of no discussion they had passed a week at padua and the slightest allusion to what had happened had never been made by either lady annabel or her child it was only by her lavish testimonies of affection that lady annabel conveyed to venetia how deeply she sympathised with her and how unhappy she was herself she had indeed never quitted for a moment the side of her daughter and witnessed each day with renewed anguish her deplorable condition for venetia continued in a state which to those unacquainted with her might have been mistaken for insensibility but her mother knew too well that it was despair she never moved she never sighed nor wept she took no notice of anything that occurred she sought relief in no resources books and drawings and music were quite forgotten by her nothing amused and nothing annoyed her she was not even fretful she had apparently no physical ailment she remained pale and silent plunged in an absorbing paroxysm of overwhelming woe  the unhappy lady annabel at a loss how to act at length thought it might be advisable to cross over to venice she felt assured now that it would be a long time if ever before her child could again endure the fatigue of travel and she thought that for every reason whether for domestic comfort or medical advice or those multifarious considerations which interest the invalid a capital was by far the most desirable residence for them there was a time when a visit to the city that had given her a name had been a favourite dream of venetia she had often sighed to be within    the seaborn citys walls the graceful towers   loved by the bard  those lines of her father had long echoed in her ear but now the proposition called no light to her glazed eye nor summoned for an instant the colour back to her cheek she listened to her mothers suggestion and expressed her willingness to do whatever she desired venice to her was now only a name for without the presence and the united love of both her parents no spot on earth could interest and no combination of circumstances affect her to venice however they departed having previously taken care that every arrangement should be made for their reception the english ambassador at the ducal court was a relative of lady annabel and therefore no means or exertions were spared to study and secure the convenience and accommodation of the invalid the barge of the ambassador met them at fusina and when venetia beheld the towers and cupolas of venice suffused with a golden light and rising out of the bright blue waters for a moment her spirit seemed to lighten it is indeed a spectacle as beautiful as rare and one to which the world offers few if any rivals gliding over the great lagune the buildings with which the pictures at cherbury had already made her familiar gradually rose up before her the mosquelike church of st marc the tall campanile red in the sun the moresco palace of the doges the deadly bridge of sighs and the dark structure to which it leads  venice had not then fallen the gorgeous standards of the sovereign republic and its tributary kingdoms still waved in the place of st marc the bucentaur was not rotting in the arsenal and the warlike galleys of the state cruised without the lagune a busy and picturesque population swarmed in all directions and the venetian noble the haughtiest of men might still be seen proudly moving from the council of state or stepping into a gondola amid a bowing crowd all was stirring life yet all was silent the fantastic architecture the glowing sky the flitting gondolas and the brilliant crowd gliding about with noiseless step this city without sound it seemed a dream    chapter viii   the ambassador had engaged for lady annabel a palace on the grand canal belonging to count manfrini it was a structure of great size and magnificence and rose out of the water with a flight of marble steps within was a vast gallery lined with statues and busts on tall pedestals suites of spacious apartments with marble floors and hung with satin ceilings painted by tintoretto and full of turkish trophies furniture alike sumptuous and massy the gilding although of two hundred years duration as bright and burnished as if it had but yesterday been touched with the brush sequin gold as the venetians tell you to this day with pride but even their old furniture will soon not be left to them as palaces are now daily broken up like old ships and their colossal spoils consigned to hanway yard and bond street whence reburnished and vamped up their titantic proportions in time appropriately figure in the boudoirs of may fair and the miniature saloons of st james many a fine lady now sits in a doges chair and many a dandy listens to his doom from a couch that has already witnessed the less inexorable decrees of the council of ten  amid all this splendour however one mournful idea alone pervaded the tortured consciousness of lady annabel herbert daily the dark truth stole upon her with increased conviction that venetia had come hither only to die there seemed to the agitated ear of this distracted mother a terrible omen even in the very name of her child and she could not resist the persuasion that her final destiny would in some degree be connected with her fanciful appellation the physicians for hopeless as lady annabel could not resist esteeming their interference venetia was now surrounded with physicians shook their heads prescribed different remedies and gave contrary opinions each day however their patient became more languid thinner and more thin until she seemed like a beautiful spirit gliding into the saloon leaning on her mothers arm and followed by pauncefort who had now learnt the fatal secret from her mistress and whose heart was indeed almost broken at the prospect of the calamity that was impending over them  at padua lady annabel in her mortified reveries outraged as she conceived by her husband and anxious about her daughter had schooled herself into visiting her fresh calamities on the head of the unhappy herbert to whose intrusion and irresistible influence she ascribed all the illness of her child but as the indisposition of venetia gradually but surely increased until at length it assumed so alarming an aspect that lady annabel in the distraction of her mind could no longer refrain from contemplating the most fatal result she had taught herself bitterly to regret the failure of that approaching reconciliation which now she could not but believe would at least have secured her the life of venetia whatever might be the risk of again uniting herself with her husband whatever might be the mortification and misery which it might ultimately or even speedily entail upon her there was no unhappiness that she could herself experience which for one moment she could put in competition with the existence of her child when that was the question every feeling that had hitherto impelled her conduct assumed a totally different complexion that conduct in her view had been a systematic sacrifice of self to secure the happiness of her daughter and the result of all her exertions was that not only her happiness was destroyed but her life was fast vanishing away to save venetia it now appeared to lady annabel that there was no extremity which she would not endure and if it came to a question whether venetia should survive or whether she should even be separated from her mother her maternal heart now assured her that she would not for an instant hesitate in preferring an eternal separation to the death of her child her terror now worked to such a degree upon her character that she even at times half resolved to speak to venetia upon the subject and contrive some method of communicating her wishes to her father but pride the habitual repugnance of so many years to converse upon the topic mingled also as should be confessed with an indefinite apprehension of the ill consequences of a conversation of such a character on the nervous temperament of her daughter restrained her  my love said lady annabel one day to her daughter do you think you could go out the physicians think it of great importance that you should attempt to exert yourself however slightly  dear mother if anything could annoy me from your lips it would be to hear you quote these physicians said venetia their daily presence and inquiries irritate me let me be at peace i wish to see no one but you  but venetia said lady annabel in a voice of great emotion venetia and here she paused think of my anxiety  dear mother it would be ungrateful for me ever to forget that but you and you alone know that my state whatever it may be and to whatever it may be i am reconciled is not produced by causes over which these physicians have any control over which no one has controlnow added venetia in a tone of great mournfulness  for here we must remark that so inexperienced was venetia in the feelings of others and so completely did she judge of the strength and purity of their emotions from her own that reflection since the terrible adventure of rovigo had only convinced her that it was no longer in her mothers power to unite herself again with her other parent she had taught herself to look upon her fathers burst of feeling towards lady annabel as the momentary and inevitable result of a meeting so unexpected and overpowering but she did not doubt that the stranger whose presence had ultimately so fatally clouded that interview of promise possessed claims upon marmion herbert which he would neither break nor upon reflection be desirous to question it was then the conviction that a reconciliation between her parents was now impossible in which her despair originated and she pictured to herself her father once more at arquâ disturbed perhaps for a day or two as he naturally must be by an interview so sudden and so harassing shedding a tear perhaps in secret to the wife whom he had injured and the child whom he had scarcely seen but relapsing alike from the force of habit and inclination into those previous and confirmed feelings under whose influence she was herself a witness his life had been so serene and even so laudable she was confirmed in these opinions by the circumstance of their never having heard since from him placed in his situation if indeed an irresistible influence were not controlling him would he have hesitated for a moment to have prevented even their departure or to have pursued them to have sought at any rate some means of communicating with them he was plainly reconciled to his present position and felt that under these circumstances silence on his part was alike kindest and most discreet venetia had ceased therefore to question the justice or the expediency or even the abstract propriety of her mothers conduct she viewed their condition now as the result of stern necessity she pitied her mother and for herself she had no hope  there was then much meaning in that little monosyllable with which venetia concluded her reply to her mother she had no hope now lady annabel however ascribed it to a very different meaning she only believed that her daughter was of opinion that nothing would induce her now to listen to the overtures of her father prepared for any sacrifice of self lady annabel replied but there is hope venetia when your life is in question there is nothing that should not be done  nothing can be done said venetia who of course could not dream of what was passing in her mothers mind  lady annabel rose from her seat and walked to the window apparently her eye watched only the passing gondolas but indeed she saw them not she saw only her child stretched perhaps on the couch of death  we quitted perhaps rovigo too hastily said lady annabel in a choking voice and with a face of scarlet it was a terrible struggle but the words were uttered  no mother said venetia to lady annabels inexpressible surprise we did right to go  even my child even venetia with all her devotion to him feels the absolute necessity of my conduct thought lady annabel her pride returned she felt the impossibility of making an overture to herbert she looked upon their daughter as the last victim of his fatal career     chapter ix   how beautiful is night in venice then music and the moon reign supreme the glittering sky reflected in the waters and every gondola gliding with sweet sounds around on every side are palaces and temples rising from the waves which they shadow with their solemn forms their costly fronts rich with the spoils of kingdoms and softened with the magic of the midnight beam the whole city too is poured forth for festival the people lounge on the quays and cluster on the bridges the light barks skim along in crowds just touching the surface of the water while their bright prows of polished iron gleam in the moonshine and glitter in the rippling wave not a sound that is not graceful the tinkle of guitars the sighs of serenaders and the responsive chorus of gondoliers now and then a laugh light joyous and yet musical bursts forth from some illuminated coffeehouse before which a buffo disports a tumbler stands on his head or a juggler mystifies and all for a sequin  the place of st marc at the period of our story still presented the most brilliant spectacle of the kind in europe not a spot was more distinguished for elegance luxury and enjoyment it was indeed the inner shrine of the temple of pleasure and very strange and amusing would be the annals of its picturesque arcades we must not however step behind their blue awnings but content ourselves with the exterior scene and certainly the place of st marc with the variegated splendour of its christian mosque the ornate architecture of its buildings its diversified population a tribute from every shore of the midland sea and where the noble venetian in his robe of crimson silk and long white peruque might be jostled by the sclavonian with his target and the albanian in his kilt while the turk sitting crosslegged on his persian carpet smoked his long chibouque with serene gravity and the mild armenian glided by him with a low reverence presented an aspect under a venetian moon such as we shall not easily find again in christendom and in spite of the dying glory and the neighbouring vice was pervaded with an air of romance and refinement compared with which the glittering dissipation of paris even in its liveliest and most graceful hours assumes a character alike coarse and commonplace  it is the hour of love and of faro now is the hour to press your suit and to break a bank to glide from the apartment of rapture into the chamber of chance thus a noble venetian contrived to pass the night in alternations of excitement that in general left him sufficiently serious for the morrows council for more vulgar tastes there was the minstrel the conjuror and the storyteller goblets of cyprus wine flasks of sherbet and confectionery that dazzled like diamonds and for every one from the grave senator to the gay gondolier there was an atmosphere in itself a spell and which after all has more to do with human happiness than all the accidents of fortune and all the arts of government  amid this gay and brilliant multitude one human being stood alone muffled in his cloak and leaning against a column in the portico of st marc an expression of oppressive care and affliction was imprinted on his countenance and ill accorded with the light and festive scene had he been crossed in love or had he lost at play was it woman or gold to which his anxiety and sorrow were attributable for under one or other of these categories undoubtedly all the miseries of man may range want of love or want of money lies at the bottom of all our griefs  the stranger came forward and leaving the joyous throng turned down the piazzetta and approached the quay of the lagune a gondolier saluted him and he entered his boat  whither signor said the gondolier  to the grand canal he replied  over the moonlit wave the gondola swiftly skimmed the scene was a marvellous contrast to the one which the stranger had just quitted but it brought no serenity to his careworn countenance though his eye for a moment kindled as he looked upon the moon that was sailing in the cloudless heaven with a single star by her side  they had soon entered the grand canal and the gondolier looked to his employer for instructions row opposite to the manfrini palace said the stranger and rest upon your oar  the blinds of the great window of the palace were withdrawn distinctly might be recognised a female figure bending over the recumbent form of a girl an hour passed away and still the gondola was motionless and still the silent stranger gazed on the inmates of the palace a servant now came forward and closed the curtain of the chamber the stranger sighed and waving his hand to the gondolier bade him return to the lagune     chapter x   it is curious to recall our feelings at a moment when a great event is impending over us and we are utterly unconscious of its probable occurrence how often does it happen that a subject which almost unceasingly engages our mind is least thought of at the very instant that the agitating suspense involved in its consideration is perhaps about to be terminated for ever the very morning after the mysterious gondola had rested so long before the manfrini palace venetia rose for the first time since the flight from rovigo refreshed by her slumbers and tranquil in her spirit it was not in her power to recall her dreams but they had left a vague and yet serene impression there seemed a lightness in her heart that long had been unusual with her and she greeted her mother with a smile faint indeed yet natural  perhaps this beneficial change slight but still delightful might be attributed to the softness and the splendour of the morn before the approach of winter it seemed that the sun was resolved to remind the venetians that they were his children and that although his rays might be soon clouded for a season they were not to believe that their parent had deserted them the sea was like glass a golden haze suffused the horizon and a breeze not strong enough to disturb the waters was wafted at intervals from the gardens of the brenta fitful and sweet  venetia had yielded to the suggestion of her mother and had agreed for the first time to leave the palace they stepped into their gondola and were wafted to an island in the lagune where there was a convent and what in venice was more rare and more delightful a garden its scanty shrubberies sparkled in the sun and a cypress flanked by a pinetree offered to the eye unused to trees a novel and picturesque group beneath its shade they rested watching on one side the distant city and on the other the still and gleaming waters of the adriatic while they were thus sitting renovated by the soft air and pleasant spectacle a holy father with a beard like a meteor appeared and addressed them  welcome to st lazaro said the holy father speaking in english and may the peace that reigns within its walls fill also your breasts  indeed holy father said lady annabel to the armenian monk i have long heard of your virtues and your happy life  you know that paradise was placed in our country said the monk with a smile we have all lost paradise but the armenian has lost his country too nevertheless with gods blessing on this islet we have found an eden pure at least and tranquil  for the pious paradise exists everywhere said lady annabel  you have been in england holy father said venetia  it has not been my good fortune replied the monk  yet you speak our tongue with a facility and accent that surprise me  i learnt it in america where i long resided rejoined the armenian  this is for your eye lady continued the monk drawing a letter from his bosom  lady annabel felt not a little surprised but the idea immediately occurred to her that it was some conventual memorial appealing to her charity she took the paper from the monk who immediately moved away but what was the agitation of lady annabel when she recognised the handwriting of her husband her first thought was to save venetia from sharing that agitation she rose quickly she commanded herself sufficiently to advise her daughter in a calm tone to remain seated while for a moment she refreshed herself by a stroll she had not quitted venetia many paces when she broke the seal and read these lines  tremble not annabel when you recognise this handwriting it is that of one whose only aspiration is to contribute to your happiness and although the fulfilment of that fond desire may be denied him it never shall be said even by you that any conduct of his should now occasion you annoyance i am in venice at the peril of my life which i only mention because the difficulties inseparable from my position are the principal cause that you did not receive this communication immediately after our strange meeting i have gazed at night upon your palace and watched the forms of my wife and our child but one word from you and i quit venice for ever and it shall not be my fault if you are ever again disturbed by the memory of the miserable herbert  but before i go i will make this one appeal if not to your justice at least to your mercy after the fatal separation of a life we have once more met you have looked upon me not with hatred my hand has once more pressed yours for a moment i indulged the impossible hope that this weary and exhausted spirit might at length be blessed with agony i allude to the incident that dispelled the rapture of this vision sufficient for me most solemnly to assure you that fourandtwenty hours had not elapsed without that feeble and unhallowed tie being severed for ever it vanished instantaneously before the presence of my wife and my child however you decide it can never again subsist its utter and eternal dissolution was the inevitable homage to your purity  whatever may have been my errors whatever my crimes for i will not attempt to justify to you a single circumstance of my life i humble myself in the dust before you and solicit only mercy yet whatever may have been my career ah annabel in the infinite softness of your soul was it not for a moment pardoned am i indeed to suffer for that last lamentable intrusion you are a woman annabel with a brain as clear as your heart is pure judge me with calmness annabel were there no circumstances in my situation to extenuate that deplorable connection i will not urge them i will not even intimate them but surely annabel when i kneel before you full of deep repentance and long remorse if you could pardon the past it is not that incident however mortifying to you however disgraceful to myself that should be an impassable barrier to all my hopes  once you loved me i ask you not to love me now there is nothing about me now that can touch the heart of woman i am old before my time bent with the blended influence of action and of thought and of physical and moral suffering the play of my spirit has gone for ever my passions have expired like my hopes the remaining sands of my life are few once it was otherwise you can recall a different picture of the marmion on whom you smiled and of whom you were the first love o annabel grey feeble exhausted penitent let me stagger over your threshold and die i ask no more i will not hope for your affection i will not even count upon your pity but endure my presence let your roof screen my last days  it was read it was read again dim as was the sight of lady annabel with fastflowing tears still holding the letter but with hands fallen she gazed upon the shining waters before her in a fit of abstraction it was the voice of her child that roused her  mother said venetia in a tone of some decision you are troubled and we have only one cause of trouble that letter is from my father  lady annabel gave her the letter in silence  venetia withdrew almost unconsciously a few paces from her mother she felt this to be the crisis of her life there never was a moment which she believed required more fully the presence of all her energies before she had addressed lady annabel she had endeavoured to steel her mind to great exertion yet now that she held the letter she could not command herself sufficiently to read it her breath deserted her her hand lost its power she could not even open the lines on which perhaps her life depended suddenly with a rapid effort she glanced at the contents the blood returned to her check her eye became bright with excitement she gasped for breath she advanced to lady annabel ah mother she exclaimed you will grant all that it desires  still gazing on the wave that laved the shore of the island with an almost inperceptible ripple lady annabel continued silent  mother said venetia my beloved mother you hesitate she approached lady annabel and with one arm round her neck she grasped with the other her mothers hand i implore you by all that affection which you lavish on me yield to this supplication o mother dearest mother it has been my hope that my life has been at least a life of duty i have laboured to yield to all your wishes i have struggled to make their fulfilment the law of my being yes mother your memory will assure you that when the sweetest emotions of my heart were the stake you appealed to me to sacrifice them and they were dedicated to your will have i ever murmured i have sought only to repay your love by obedience speak to me dearest mother i implore you speak to me tell me can you ever repent relenting in this instance o mother you will not hesitate you will not indeed you will bring joy and content to our longharassed hearth tell me so i beseech you tell me so i wish oh how i wish that you would comply from the mere impulse of your own heart but grant that it is a sacrifice grant that it may be unwise that it may be vain i supplicate you to make it i your child who never deserted you who will never desert you pledging my faith to you in the face of heaven for my sake i supplicate you to make it you do not hesitate you cannot hesitate mother you cannot hesitate ah you would not if you knew all if you knew all the misery of my life you would be glad you would be cheerful you would look upon this as an interposition of providence in favour of your venetia you would indeed dear mother  what evil fortune guided our steps to italy said lady annabel in a solemn tone and as if in soliloquy  no no mother not evil fortune fortune the best and brightest exclaimed her daughter we came here to be happy and happiness we have at length gained it is in our grasp i feel it it was not fortune dear mother it was fate it was providence it was god you have been faithful to him and he has brought back to you my father chastened and repentant god has turned his heart to all your virtues will you desert him no no mother you will not you cannot for his sake for your own sake and for your childs you will not  for twenty years i have acted from an imperious sense of duty said lady annabel and for your sake venetia as much as for my own shall the feelings of a moment  o mother dearest mother say not these words with me at least it has not been the feeling of a moment it haunted my infancy it harassed me while a girl it has brought me in the prime of womanhood to the brink of the grave and with you mother has it been the feeling of a moment ah you ever loved him when his name was never breathed by those lips you loved him when you deemed he had forgotten you when you pictured him to yourself in all the pride of health and genius wanton and daring and now now that he comes to you penitent perhaps dying more like a remorseful spirit than a breathing being and humbles himself before you and appeals only to your mercy ah my mother you cannot reject you could not reject him even if you were alone even if you had no child  my child my child all my hopes were in my child murmured lady annabel  is she not by your side said venetia  you know not what you ask you know not what you counsel said lady annabel it has been the prayer and effort of my life that you should never know there is a bitterness in the reconciliation which follows long estrangement that yields a pang more acute even than the first disunion shall i be called upon to mourn over the wasted happiness of twenty years why did he not hate us  the pang is already felt mother said venetia reject my father but you cannot resume the feelings of a month back you have seen him you have listened to him he is no longer the character which justified your conduct and upheld you under the trial his image has entered your soul your heart is softened bid him quit venice without seeing you and you will remain the most miserable of women  on his head then be the final desolation said lady annabel it is but a part of the lot that he has yielded me  i am silent said venetia relaxing her grasp i see that your child is not permitted to enter into your considerations she turned away  venetia said her mother  mother said venetia looking back but not returning  return one moment to me  venetia slowly rejoined her lady annabel spoke in a kind and gentle though serious tone  venetia she said what i am about to speak is not the impulse of the moment but has been long revolved in my mind do not therefore misapprehend it i express without passion what i believe to be truth i am persuaded that the presence of your father is necessary to your happiness nay more to your life i recognise the mysterious influence which he has ever exercised over your existence i feel it impossible for me any longer to struggle against a power to which i bow be happy then my daughter and live fly to your father and be to him as matchless a child as you have been to me she uttered these last words in a choking voice  is this indeed the dictate of your calm judgment mother said venetia  i call god to witness it has of late been more than once on my lips the other night when i spoke of rovigo i was about to express this  then mother said venetia i find that i have been misunderstood at least i thought my feelings towards yourself had been appreciated they have not and i can truly say my life does not afford a single circumstance to which i can look back with content well will it indeed be for me to die  the dream of my life said lady annabel in a tone of infinite distress was that she at least should never know unhappiness it was indeed a dream  there was now a silence of several minutes lady annabel remained in exactly the same position venetia standing at a little distance from her looking resigned and sorrowful  venetia at length said lady annabel why are you silent  mother i have no more to say i pretend not to act in this life it is my duty to follow you  and your inclination inquired lady annabel  i have ceased to have a wish upon any subject said venetia  venetia said lady annabel with a great effort i am miserable  this unprecedented confession of suffering from the strong mind of her mother melted venetia to the heart she advanced and threw her arms round her mothers neck and buried her weeping face in lady annabels bosom  speak to me my daughter said lady annabel counsel me for my mind trembles anxiety has weakened it nay i beseech you speak speak speak venetia what shall i do  mother i will never say anything again but that i love you  i see the holy father in the distance let us walk to him my child and meet him  accordingly lady annabel now leaning on venetia approached the monk about five minutes elapsed before they reached him during which not a word was spoken  holy father said lady annabel in a tone of firmness that surprised her daughter and made her tremble with anticipation you know the writer of this letter  he is my friend of many years lady replied the armenian i knew him in america i owe to him my life and more than my life there breathes not his equal among men  a tear started to the eye of lady annabel she recalled the terms in which the household at arquâ had spoken of herbert he is in venice she inquired  he is within these walls the monk replied  venetia scarcely able to stand felt her mother start after a momentary pause lady annabel said can i speak with him and alone  nothing but the most nervous apprehension of throwing any obstacle in the way of the interview could have sustained venetia quite pale with her disengaged hand clenched not a word escaped her lips she hung upon the answer of the monk  you can see him and alone said the monk he is now in the sacristy follow me  venetia said lady annabel remain in this garden i will accompany this holy man stop embrace me before i go and she added in a whisper pray for me  it needed not the admonition of her mother to induce venetia to seek refuge in prayer in this agony of her life but for its salutary and stilling influence it seemed to her that she must have forfeited all control over her mind the suspense was too terrible for human aid to support her seated by the seaside she covered her face with her hands and invoked the supreme assistance more than an hour passed away venetia looked up two beautiful birds of strange form and spotless plumage that perhaps had wandered from the aegean were hovering over her head bright and glancing in the sun she accepted their appearance as a good omen at this moment she heard a voice and looking up observed a monk in the distance beckoning to her she rose and with a trembling step approached him he retired still motioning to her to follow him she entered by a low portal a dark cloister it led to an antechapel through which as she passed her ear caught the solemn chorus of the brethren her step faltered her sight was clouded she was as one walking in a dream the monk opened a door and retiring waved his hand as for her to enter there was a spacious and lofty chamber scantily furnished some huge chests and many sacred garments at the extreme distance her mother was reclined on a bench her head supported by a large crimson cushion and her father kneeling by her mothers side with a soundless step and not venturing even to breathe venetia approached them and she knew not how found herself embraced by both her parents     end of book v     book vi     chapter i   in a green valley of the apennines close to the seacoast between genoa and spezzia is a marine villa that once belonged to the malaspina family in olden time the friends and patrons of dante it is rather a fantastic pile painted in fresco but spacious in good repair and convenient although little more than a mile from spezzia a glimpse of the blue sea can only be caught from one particular spot so completely is the land locked with hills covered with groves of chestnut and olive orchards from the heights however you enjoy magnificent prospects of the most picturesque portion of the italian coast a lofty undulating and wooded shore with an infinite variety of bays and jutting promontories while the eye wandering from leghorn on one side towards genoa on the other traces an almost uninterrupted line of hamlets and casinos gardens and orchards terraces of vines and groves of olive beyond them the broad and blue expanse of the midland ocean glittering in the meridian blaze or about to receive perhaps in its glowing waters the red orb of sunset  it was the month of may in italy at least the merry month of may and marmion herbert came forth from the villa malaspina and throwing himself on the turf was soon lost in the volume of plato which he bore with him he did not move until in the course of an hour he was roused by the arrival of servants who brought seats and a table when looking up he observed lady annabel and venetia in the portico of the villa he rose to greet them and gave his arm to his wife  spring in the apennines my annabel said herbert is a happy combination i am more in love each day with this residence the situation is so sheltered the air so soft and pure the spot so tranquil and the season so delicious that it realises all my romance of retirement as for you i never saw you look so well and as for venetia i can scarcely believe this rosy nymph could have been our paleeyed girl who cost us such anxiety  our breakfast is not ready let us walk to our sea view said lady annabel give me your book to carry marmion  there let the philosopher repose said herbert throwing the volume on the turf plato dreamed of what i enjoy  and of what did plato dream papa said venetia  he dreamed of love child  venetia took her fathers disengaged arm  they had now arrived at their sea view a glimpse of the mediterranean between two tall crags  a sail in the offing said herbert how that solitary sail tells annabel  i feel the sea breeze mother does not it remind you of weymouth said venetia  ah marmion said lady annabel i would that you could see masham once more he is the only friend that i regret  he prospers annabel let that be our consolation i have at least not injured him  they turned their steps their breakfast was now prepared the sun had risen above the hill beneath whose shade they rested and the opposite side of the valley sparkled in light it was a cheerful scene i have a passion for living in the air said herbert i always envied the shepherds in don quixote one of my youthful dreams was living among mountains of rosemary and drinking only goats milk after breakfast i will read you don quixotes description of the golden age i have often read it until the tears came into my eyes  we must fancy ourselves in spain said lady annabel it is not difficult in this wild green valley and if we have not rosemary we have scents as sweet nature is our garden here venetia and i do not envy even the statues and cypresses of our villa of the lake  we must make a pilgrimage some day to the maggiore annabel said herbert it is hallowed ground to me now  their meal was finished the servants brought their work and books and drawings and herbert resuming his natural couch reopened his plato but venetia ran into the villa and returned with a volume you must read us the golden age papa she said as she offered him with a smile his favourite don quixote  you must fancy the don looking earnestly upon a handful of acorns said herbert opening the book while he exclaims o happy age which our first parents called the age of gold not because gold so much adored in this iron age was then easily purchased but because those two fatal words meum and tuum were distinctions unknown to the people of those fortunate times for all things were in common in that holy age men for their sustenance needed only to lift their hands and take it from the sturdy oak whose spreading arms liberally invited them to gather the wholesome savoury fruit while the clear springs and silver rivulets with luxuriant plenty afforded them their pure refreshing water in hollow trees and in the clefts of rocks the labouring and industrious bees erected their little commonwealths that men might reap with pleasure and with ease the sweet and fertile harvest of their toils the tough and strenuous corktrees did of themselves and without other art than their native liberality dismiss and impart their broad light bark which served to cover those lowly huts propped up with roughhewn stakes that were first built as a shelter against the inclemencies of the air all then was union all peace all love and friendship in the world as yet no rude ploughshare presumed with violence to pry into the pious bowels of our mother earth for she without compulsion kindly yielded from every part of her fruitful and spacious bosom whatever might at once satisfy sustain and indulge her frugal children then was the time when innocent beautiful young sheperdesses went tripping over the hills and vales their lovely hair sometimes plaited sometimes loose and flowing clad in no other vestment but what the modesty of nature might require the tyrian dye the rich glossy hue of silk martyred and dissembled into every colour which are now esteemed so fine and magnificent were unknown to the innocent simplicity of that age yet bedecked with more becoming leaves and flowers they outshone the proudest of the vaindressing ladies of our times arrayed in the most magnificent garbs and all the most sumptuous adornings which idleness and luxury have taught succeeding pride lovers then expressed the passion of their souls in the unaffected language of the heart with the native plainness and sincerity in which they were conceived and divested of all that artificial contexture which enervates what it labours to enforce imposture deceit and malice had not yet crept in and imposed themselves unbribed upon mankind in the disguise of truth justice unbiassed either by favour or interest which now so fatally pervert it was equally and impartially dispensed nor was the judges fancy law for then there were neither judges nor causes to be judged the modest maid might then walk alone but in this degenerate age fraud and a legion of ills infecting the world no virtue can be safe no honour be secure while wanton desires diffused into the hearts of men corrupt the strictest watches and the closest retreats which though as intricate and unknown as the labyrinth of crete are no security for chastity thus that primitive innocence being vanished the oppression daily prevailing there was a necessity to oppose the torrent of violence for which reason the order of knighthood errant was instituted to defend the honour of virgins protect widows relieve orphans and assist all that are distressed now i myself am one of this order honest friends and though all people are obliged by the law of nature to be kind to persons of my character yet since you without knowing anything of this obligation have so generously entertained me i ought to pay you my utmost acknowledgment and accordingly return you my most hearty thanks  there said herbert as he closed the book in my opinion don quixote was the best man that ever lived  but he did not ever live said lady annabel smiling  he lives to us said herbert he is the same to this age as if he had absolutely wandered over the plains of castile and watched in the sierra morena we cannot indeed find his tomb but he has left us his great example in his hero cervantes has given us the picture of a great and benevolent philosopher and in his sancho a complete personification of the world selfish and cunning and yet overawed by the genius that he cannot comprehend alive to all the material interests of existence yet sighing after the ideal securing his four young foals of the sheass yet indulging in dreams of empire  but what do you think of the assault on the windmills marmion said lady annabel  in the outset of his adventures as in the outset of our lives he was misled by his enthusiasm replied herbert without which after all we can do nothing but the result is don quixote was a redresser of wrongs and therefore the world esteemed him mad  in this vein now conversing now occupied with their pursuits and occasionally listening to some passage which herbert called to their attention and which ever served as the occasion for some critical remarks always as striking from their originality as they were happy in their expression the freshness of the morning disappeared the sun now crowned the valley with his meridian beam and they reentered the villa the ladies returned to their cool saloon and herbert to his study  it was there he amused himself by composing the following lines    spring in the apennines    i    spring in the apennine now holds her court   within an amphitheatre of hills   clothed with the blooming chestnut musical   with murmuring pines waving their light green cones   like youthful bacchants while the dewy grass   the myrtle and the mountain violet   blend their rich odours with the fragrant trees   and sweeten the soft air above us spreads   the purple sky bright with the unseen sun   the hills yet screen although the golden beam   touches the topmost boughs and tints with light   the grey and sparkling crags the breath of morn   still lingers in the valley but the bee   with restless passion hovers on the wing   waiting the opening flower of whose embrace   the sun shall be the signal poised in air   the winged minstrel of the liquid dawn   the lark pours forth his lyric and responds   to the fresh chorus of the sylvan doves   the stir of branches and the fall of streams   the harmonies of nature    ii      gentle spring   once more oh yes once more i feel thy breath   and charm of renovation to the sky   thou bringest light and to the glowing earth   a garb of grace but sweeter than the sky   that hath no cloud and sweeter than the earth   with all its pageantry the peerless boon   thou bearest to me a temper like thine own   a springlike spirit beautiful and glad   long years long years of suffering and of thought   deeper than woe had dimmed the eager eye   once quick to catch thy brightness and the ear   that lingered on thy music the harsh world   had jarred the freshness of my life was gone   and hope no more an omen in thy bloom   found of a fertile future there are minds   like lands but with one season and that drear   mine was eternal winter    iii      a dark dream   of hearts estranged and of an eden lost   entranced my being one absorbing thought   which if not torture was a dull despair   that agony were light to but while sad   within the desert of my life i roamed   and no sweet springs of love gushed for to greet   my wearied heart behold two spirits came   floating in light seraphic ministers   the semblance of whose splendour on me fell   as on some dusky stream the matin ray   touching the gloomy waters with its life   and both were fond and one was merciful   and to my home long forfeited they bore   my vagrant spirit and the gentle hearth   i reckless fled received me with its shade   and pleasant refuge and our softened hearts   were like the twilight when our very bliss   calls tears to soothe our rapture as the stars   steal forth then shining smiles their trembling ray   mixed with our tenderness and love was there   in all his manifold forms the sweet embrace   and thrilling pressure of the gentle hand   and silence speaking with the melting eye    iv    and now again i feel thy breath o spring   and now the seal hath fallen from my gaze   and thy wild music in my ready ear   finds a quick echo the discordant world   mars not thy melodies thy blossoms now   are emblems of my heart and through my veins   the flow of youthful feeling long pent up   glides like thy sunny streams in this fair scene   on forms still fairer i my blessing pour   on her the beautiful the wise the good   who learnt the sweetest lesson to forgive   and on the brighteyed daughter of our love   who soothed a mother and a father saved     chapter ii   between the reconciliation of lady annabel herbert with her husband at the armenian convent at venice and the spring morning in the apennines which we have just described half a year had intervened the political position of marmion herbert rendered it impossible for him to remain in any city where there was a representative of his britannic majesty indeed it was scarcely safe for him to be known out of america he had quitted that country shortly after the struggle was over chiefly from considerations for his health his energies had been fast failing him and a retired life and change of climate had been recommended by his physicians his own feelings induced him to visit italy where he had once intended to pass his life and where he now repaired to await death assuming a feigned name and living in strict seclusion it is probable that his presence would never have been discovered or if detected would not have been noticed once more united with his wife her personal influence at the court of st james and her powerful connections might secure him from annoyance and venetia had even indulged in a vague hope of returning to england but herbert could only have found himself again in his native country as a prisoner on parole it would have been quite impossible for him to mix in the civil business of his native land or enjoy any of the rights of citizenship if a mild sovereign in his mercy had indeed accorded him a pardon it must have been accompanied with rigorous and mortifying conditions and his presence in all probability would have been confined to his country residence and its immediate neighbourhood the pride of lady annabel herself recoiled from this sufferance and although herbert keenly conscious of the sacrifice which a permanent estrangement from england entailed upon his wife and child would have submitted to any restrictions however humiliating provided they were not inconsistent with his honour it must be confessed that when he spoke of this painful subject to his wife it was with no slight selfcongratulation that he had found her resolution to remain abroad under any circumstances was fixed with her habitual decision she communicated both to the bishop of  and to her brother the unexpected change that had occurred in her condition and she had reason to believe that a representation of what had happened would be made to the royal family perhaps both the head of her house and her reverend friend anticipated that time might remove the barrier that presented itself to herberts immediate return to england they confined their answers however to congratulations on the reconciliation to their confidence in the satisfaction it would occasion her and to the expression of their faithful friendship and neither alluded to a result which both if only for her sake desired  the herberts had quitted venice a very few days after the meeting on the island of st lazaro had travelled by slow journeys crossing the apennines to genoa and only remained in that city until they engaged their present residence it combined all the advantages which they desired seclusion beauty comfort and the mild atmosphere that venetia had seemed to require it was not however the genial air that had recalled the rose to venetias cheek and the sunny smile to her bright eye or had inspired again that graceful form with all its pristine elasticity it was a heart content a spirit at length at peace the contemplation of the happiness of those most dear to her that she hourly witnessed and the blissful consciousness that her exertions had mainly contributed to if not completely occasioned all this felicity were remedies of far more efficacy than all the consultations and prescriptions of her physicians the conduct of her father repaid her for all her sufferings and realised all her dreams of domestic tenderness and delight tender grateful and affectionate herbert hovered round her mother like a delicate spirit who had been released by some kind mortal from a tedious and revolting thraldom and who believed he could never sufficiently testify his devotion there was so much respect blended with his fondness that the spirit of her mother was utterly subdued by his irresistible demeanour all her sadness and reserve her distrust and her fear had vanished and rising confidence mingling with the love she had ever borne to him she taught herself even to seek his opinion and be guided by his advice she could not refrain indeed from occasionally feeling in this full enjoyment of his love that she might have originally acted with too much precipitation and that had she only bent for a moment to the necessity of conciliation and condescended to the excusable artifices of affection their misery might have been prevented once when they were alone her softened heart would have confessed to herbert this painful conviction but he was too happy and too generous to permit her for a moment to indulge in such a remorseful retrospect all the error he insisted was his own and he had been fool enough to have wantonly forfeited a happiness which time and experience had now taught him to appreciate  we married too young marmion said his wife  it shall be that then love replied herbert but for all that i have suffered i would not have avoided my fate on the condition of losing the exquisite present  it is perhaps scarcely necessary to remark that herbert avoided with the most scrupulous vigilance the slightest allusion to any of those peculiar opinions for which he was unhappily too celebrated musing over the singular revolutions which had already occurred in his habits and his feelings towards herself lady annabel indeed did not despair that his once selfsufficient soul might ultimately bow to that blessed faith which to herself had ever proved so great a support and so exquisite a solace it was indeed the inexpressible hope that lingered at the bottom of her heart and sometimes she even indulged in the delightful fancy that his mild and penitent spirit had by the gracious mercy of providence been already touched by the bright sunbeam of conviction at all events his subdued and chastened temperament was no unworthy preparation for still greater blessings it was this hallowed anticipation which consoled and alone consoled lady annabel for her own estrangement from the communion of her national church of all the sacrifices which her devotion to herbert entailed upon her this was the one which she felt most constantly and most severely not a day elapsed but the chapel at cherbury rose before her and when she remembered that neither herself nor her daughter might again kneel round the altar of their god she almost trembled at the step which she had taken and almost esteemed it a sacrifice of heavenly to earthly duty which no consideration perhaps warranted this apprehension indeed was the cloud in her life and one which venetia who felt all its validity found difficulty in combating  otherwise when venetia beheld her parents she felt ethereal and seemed to move in air for her life in spite of its apparent tranquillity was to her all excitement she never looked upon her father or heard his voice without a thrill his society was as delightful as his heart was tender it seemed to her that she could listen to him for ever every word he spoke was different from the language of other men there was not a subject on which his richlycultivated mind could not pour forth instantaneously a flood of fine fancies and deep intelligence he seemed to have read every book in every language and to have mused over every line he had read she could not conceive how one the tone of whose mind was so original that it suggested on every topic some conclusion that struck instantly by its racy novelty could be so saturated with the learning and the views of other men although they lived in unbroken solitude and were almost always together not a day passed that she did not find herself musing over some thought or expression of her father and which broke from his mind without effort and as if by chance literature to herbert was now only a source of amusement and engaging occupation all thought of fame had long fled his soul he cared not for being disturbed and he would throw down his plato for don quixote or close his aeschylus and take up a volume of madame de sévigné without a murmur if reminded by anything that occurred of a passage which might contribute to the amusement and instruction of his wife and daughter indeed his only study now was to contribute to their happiness for him they had given up their country and society and he sought by his vigilant attention and his various accomplishments to render their hours as light and pleasant as under such circumstances was possible his muse too was only dedicated to the celebration of any topic which their life or themselves suggested he loved to lie under the trees and pour forth sonnets to lady annabel and encouraged venetia by the readiness and interest with which he invariably complied with her intimations to throw out every fancy which occurred to her for his verse a life passed without the intrusion of a single evil passion without a single expression that was not soft and graceful and mild and adorned with all the resources of a most accomplished and creative spirit required not the distractions of society it would have shrunk from it from all its artificial excitement and vapid reaction the days of the herberts flowed on in one bright continuous stream of love and literature and gentle pleasures beneath them was the green earth above them the blue sky their spirits were as clear and their hearts as soft as the clime  the hour of twilight was approaching and the family were preparing for their daily walk their simple repast was finished and venetia held the verses which her father had written in the morning and which he had presented to her  let us descend to spezzia said herbert to lady annabel i love an ocean sunset  accordingly they proceeded through their valley to the craggy path which led down to the bay after passing through a small ravine the magnificent prospect opened before them the sun was yet an hour above the horizon and the sea was like a lake of molten gold the colour of the sky nearest to the sun of a pale green with two or three burnished streaks of vapour quite still and so thin you could almost catch the sky through them fixed as it were in this gorgeous frame it was now a dead calm but the sail that had been hovering the whole morning in the offing had made the harbour in time and had just cast anchor near some coasting craft and fishingboats all that now remained where napoleon had projected forming one of the arsenals of the world  tracing their way down a mild declivity covered with spreading vineyards and quite fragrant with the blossom of the vine the herberts proceeded through a wood of olives and emerged on a terrace raised directly above the shore leading to spezzia and studded here and there with rugged groups of aloes  i have often observed here said venetia about a mile out at sea there now where i point the water rise it is now a calm and yet it is more troubled i think than usual tell me the cause dear father for i have often wished to know  it passes my experience said herbert but here is an ancient fisherman let us inquire of him  he was an old man leaning against a rock and smoking his pipe in contemplative silence his face bronzed with the sun and the roughness of many seasons and his grey hairs not hidden by his long blue cap herbert saluted him and pointing to the phenomenon requested an explanation of it  tis a fountain of fresh water signor that rises in our gulf said the old fisherman to the height of twenty feet  and is it constant inquired herbert  tis the same in sunshine and in storm in summer and in winter in calm or in breeze said the old fisherman  and has it always been so  it came before my time  a philosophic answer said herbert and deserves a paul mine was a crude question adio good friend  i should like to drink of that fountain of fresh water annabel said herbert there seems to me something wondrous fanciful in it some day we will row there it shall be a calm like this  we want a fountain in our valley said lady annabel  we do said herbert and i think we must make one we must inquire at genoa i am curious in fountains our fountain should i think be classical simple compact with a choice inscription the altar of a naiad  and mamma shall make the design and you shall write the inscription said venetia  and you shall be the nymph child said herbert  they were now within a bowshot of the harbour and a jutting cliff of marble more graceful from a contiguous bed of myrtles invited them to rest and watch the approaching sunset  say what they like said herbert there is a spell in the shores of the mediterranean sea which no others can rival never was such a union of natural loveliness and magical associations on these shores have risen all that interests us in the past egypt and palestine greece rome and carthage moorish spain and feodal italy these shores have yielded us our religion our arts our literature and our laws if all that we have gained from the shores of the mediterranean was erased from the memory of man we should be savages will the atlantic ever be so memorable its civilisation will be more rapid but will it be as refined and far more important will it be as permanent will it not lack the racy vigour and the subtle spirit of aboriginal genius will not a colonial character cling to its society feeble inanimate evanescent what america is deficient in is creative intellect it has no nationality its intelligence has been imported like its manufactured goods its inhabitants are a people but are they a nation i wish that the empire of the incas and the kingdom of montezuma had not been sacrificed i wish that the republic of the puritans had blended with the tribes of the wilderness  the red sun was now hovering over the horizon it quivered for an instant and then sank immediately the high and undulating coast was covered with a crimson flush the cliffs the groves the bays and jutting promontories each straggling sail and tall white tower suffused with a rosy light gradually that rosy tint became a bright violet and then faded into purple but the glory of the sunset long lingered in the glowing west streaming with every colour of the iris while a solitary star glittered with silver light amid the shifting splendour  hesperus rises from the sunset like the fountain of fresh water from the sea said herbert the sky and the ocean have two natures like ourselves  at this moment the boat of the vessel which had anchored about an hour back put to shore  that seems an english brig said herbert i cannot exactly make out its trim it scarcely seems a merchant vessel  the projection of the shore hid the boat from their sight as it landed the herberts rose and proceeded towards the harbour there were some rude steps cut in the rock which led from the immediate shore to the terrace as they approached these two gentlemen in sailors jackets mounted suddenly lady annabel and venetia simultaneously started as they recognised lord cadurcis and his cousin they were so close that neither party had time to prepare themselves venetia found her hand in that of plantagenet while lady annabel saluted george infinite were their mutual inquiries and congratulations but it so happened that with one exception no name was mentioned it was quite evident however to herbert that these were very familiar acquaintances of his family for in the surprise of the moment lord cadurcis had saluted his daughter by her christian name there was no slight emotion too displayed on all sides indeed independently of the agitation which so unexpected a rencounter was calculated to produce the presence of herbert after the first moments of recognition not a little excited the curiosity of the young men and in some degree occasioned the embarrassment of all who was this stranger on whom venetia and her mother were leaning with such fondness he was scarcely too old to be the admirer of venetia and if there were a greater disparity of years between them than is usual his distinguished appearance might well reconcile the lady to her lot or even justify her choice had then cadurcis again met venetia only to find her the bride or the betrothed of another a mortifying situation even an intolerable one if his feelings remained unchanged and if the eventful year that had elapsed since they parted had not replaced her image in his susceptible mind by another more cherished and perhaps less obdurate again to lady annabel the moment was one of great awkwardness for the introduction of her husband to those with whom she was recently so intimate and who were then aware that the name of that husband was never even mentioned in her presence recalled the painful past with a disturbing vividness venetia indeed did not share these feelings fully but she thought it ungracious to anticipate her mother in the announcement  the herberts turned with lord cadurcis and his cousin they were about to retrace their steps on the terrace when lady annabel taking advantage of the momentary silence and summoning all her energy with a pale cheek and a voice that slightly faltered said lord cadurcis allow me to present you to mr herbert my husband she added with emphasis  good god exclaimed cadurcis starting and then outstretching his hand he contrived to add have i indeed the pleasure of seeing one i have so long admired  lord cadurcis exclaimed herbert scarcely less surprised is it lord cadurcis this is a welcome meeting  everyone present felt overwhelmed with confusion or astonishment lady annabel sought refuge in presenting captain cadurcis to her husband this ceremony though little noticed even by those more immediately interested in it nevertheless served in some degree as a diversion herbert who was only astonished was the first who rallied perhaps lord cadurcis was the only man in existence whom herbert wished to know he had read his works with deep interest at least those portions which foreign journals had afforded him he was deeply impressed with his fame and genius but what perplexed him at this moment even more than his unexpected introduction to him was the singular the very extraordinary circumstance that the name of their most celebrated countryman should never have escaped the lips either of his wife or his daughter although they appeared and venetia especially to be on terms with him of even domestic intimacy  you arrived here to day lord cadurcis said herbert from whence  immediately from naples where we last touched replied his lordship but i have been residing at athens  i envy you said herbert  it would be a fit residence for you said lord cadurcis you were however in some degree my companion for a volume of your poems was one of the few books i had with me i parted with all the rest but i retained that it is in my cabin and full of my scribblement if you would condescend to accept it i would offer it to you  mr herbert and lord cadurcis maintained the conversation along the terrace venetia by whose side her old companion walked was quite silent once her eyes met those of cadurcis his expression of mingled archness and astonishment was irresistible his cousin and lady annabel carried on a more suppressed conversation but on ordinary topics when they had reached the olivegrove herbert said here lies our way homeward my lord if you and your cousin will accompany us it will delight lady annabel and myself  nothing i am sure will give george and myself greater pleasure he replied we had indeed no purpose when you met us but to enjoy our escape from imprisonment little dreaming we should meet our kindest and oldest friends he added  kindest and oldest friends thought herbert to himself well this is strange indeed  it is but a slight distance said lady annabel who thought it necessary to enforce the invitation we live in the valley of which yonder hill forms a part  and there we have passed our winter and our spring added venetia almost as delightfully as you could have done at athens  well thought cadurcis to himself i have seen many of the worlds marvels but this day is a miracle  when they had proceeded through the olivewood and mounted the acclivity they arrived at a path which permitted the ascent of only one person at a time cadurcis was last and followed venetia unable any longer to endure the suspense he was rather irritated that she kept so close to her father he himself loitered a few paces behind and breaking off a branch of laurel he tossed it at her she looked round and smiled he beckoned to her to fall back tell me venetia he said what does all this mean  it means that we are at last all very happy she replied do you not see my father  yes and i am very glad to see him but this company is the very last in which i expected to have that pleasure  it is too long a story to tell now you must imagine it  but are you glad to see me  very  i dont think you care for me the least  silly lord cadurcis she said smiling  if you call me lord cadurcis i shall immediately go back to the brig and set sail this night for athens  well then silly plantagenet  he laughed and they ran on     chapter iii   well i am not surprised that you should have passed your time delightfully here said lord cadurcis to lady annabel when they had entered the villa for i never beheld so delightful a retreat it is even more exquisite than your villa on the lake of which george gave me so glowing a description i was almost tempted to hasten to you would you have smiled on me he added rather archly and in a coaxing tone  i am more gratified that we have met here said lady annabel  and thus added cadurcis  you have been a great traveller since we last met said lady annabel a little embarrassed  my days of restlessness are over said cadurcis i desire nothing more dearly than to settle down in the bosom of these green hills as you have done  this life suits mr herbert said lady annabel he is fond of seclusion and you know i am accustomed to it  ah yes said cadurcis mournfully when i was in greece i used often to wish that none of us had ever left dear cherbury but i do not now  we must forget cherbury said lady annabel  i cannot i cannot forget her who cherished my melancholy childhood dear lady annabel he added in a voice of emotion and offering her his hand forget all my follies and remember that i was your child once as dutiful as you were affectionate  who could resist this appeal lady annabel not without agitation yielded him her hand which he pressed to his lips now i am again happy said cadurcis now we are all happy sweetest of friends you have removed in a moment the bitterness of years  although lights were in the saloon the windows opening on the portico were not closed the evening air was soft and balmy and though the moon had not risen the distant hills were clear in the starlight venetia was standing in the portico conversing with george cadurcis  i suppose you are too much of a turk to drink our coffee lord cadurcis said herbert cadurcis turned and joined him together with lady annabel  nay said lord cadurcis in a joyous tone lady annabel will answer for me that i always find everything perfect under her roof  captain cadurcis and venetia now reentered the villa they clustered round the table and seated themselves  why venetia said cadurcis george met me in sicily and quite frightened me about you is it the air of the apennines that has worked these marvels for really you appear to me exactly the same as when we learnt the french vocabulary together ten years ago  the french vocabulary together ten years ago thought herbert not a mere london acquaintance then this is very strange  why indeed plantagenet replied venetia i was very unwell when george visited us but i really have quite forgotten that i ever was an invalid and i never mean to be again  plantagenet soliloquised herbert and this is the great poet of whom i have heard so much my daughter is tolerably familiar with him  i have brought you all sorts of buffooneries from stamboul continued cadurcis sweetmeats and slippers and shawls and daggers worn only by sultanas and with which if necessary they can keep the harems lord in order i meant to have sent them with george to england for really i did not anticipate our meeting here  sweetmeats and slippers said herbert to himself shawls and daggers what next  and has george been with you all the time inquired venetia  oh we quarrelled now and then of course he found athens dull and would stay at constantinople chained by the charms of a fair perote to whom he wanted me to write sonnets in his name i would not because i thought it immoral but on the whole we got on very well a sort of pylades and orestes i assure you we never absolutely fought  come come said george cadurcis is always ashamed of being amiable we were together much more than i ever intended or anticipated you know mine was a sporting tour and therefore of course we were sometimes separated but he was exceedingly popular with all parties especially the turks whom he rewarded for their courtesy by writing odes to the greeks to stir them up to revolt  well they never read them said cadurcis all we poor fellows can do he added turning to herbert is to wake the hellenistic raptures of may fair and that they call fame as much like fame as a toadstool is like a truffle  nevertheless i hope the muse has not slumbered said herbert for you have had the happiest inspiration in the climes in which you have resided not only are they essentially poetic but they offer a virgin vein  i have written a little replied cadurcis i will give it you if you like some day to turn over yours is the only opinion that i really care for i have no great idea of the poetry but i am very strong in my costume i feel very confident about that i fancy i know how to hit off a pasha or touch in a greek pirate now as for all the things i wrote in england i really am ashamed of them i got up my orientalism from books and sultans and sultanas at masquerades he added archly i remember i made my heroines always wear turbans only conceive my horror when i found that a turkish woman would as soon think of putting my hat on as a turban and that it was an article of dress entirely confined to a bond street milliner  the evening passed in interesting and diverting conversation of course principally contributed by the two travellers who had seen so much inspirited by his interview with lady annabel and her gracious reception of his overtures lord cadurcis was in one of those frolic humours which we have before noticed was not unnatural to him he had considerable powers of mimicry and the talent that had pictured to venetia in old days with such liveliness the habits of the old maids of morpeth was now engaged on more considerable topics an interview with a pasha a peep into a harem a visit to a pirates isle the slavemarket the bazaar the barracks of the janissaries all touched with irresistible vitality and coloured with the rich phrases of unrivalled force of expression the laughter was loud and continual even lady annabel joined zealously in the glee as for herbert he thought cadurcis by far the most hearty and amusing person he had ever known and could not refrain from contrasting him with the picture which his works and the report of the world had occasionally enabled him to sketch to his minds eye the noble young and impassioned bard pouring forth the eloquent tide of his morbid feelings to an idolising world from whose applause he nevertheless turned with an almost misanthropic melancholy  it was now much past the noon of night and the hour of separation long postponed was inevitable often had cadurcis risen to depart and often without regaining his seat had he been tempted by his friends and especially venetia into fresh narratives at last he said now we must go lady annabel looks good night i remember the look he said laughing when we used to beg for a quarter of an hour more o venetia do not you remember that christmas when dear old masham read julius caesar and we were to sit up until it was finished when he got to the last act i hid his spectacles i never confessed it until this moment will you pardon me lady annabel and he pressed his hands together in a mockery of supplication  will you come and breakfast with us tomorrow said lady annabel  with delight he answered i am used you know to walks before breakfast george i do not think george can do it though george likes his comforts he is a regular john bull he was always calling for tea when we were in turkey  at this moment mistress pauncefort entered the room ostensibly on some little affair of her mistress but really to reconnoitre  ah mistress pauncefort my old friend mistress pauncefort how do you do exclaimed his lordship  quite well my lord please your lordship and very glad to see your lordship again and looking so well too  ah mistress pauncefort you always flattered me  oh dear my lord your lordship no said mistress pauncefort with a simper  but you pauncefort said cadurcis why there must be some magic in the air here i have been complimenting your lady and miss venetia but really you i should almost have thought it was some younger sister  oh my lord you have such a way said mistress pauncefort retreating with a slow step that still lingered for a remark  pauncefort is that an italian cap said lord cadurcis you know pauncefort you were always famous for your caps  mistress pauncefort disappeared in a fluster of delight  and now they had indeed departed there was a pause of complete silence after they had disappeared the slight and not painful reaction after the mirthful excitement of the last few hours at length herbert dropping as was his evening custom a few drops of orangeflower into a tumbler of water said annabel my love i am rather surprised that neither you nor venetia should have mentioned to me that you knew and knew so intimately a man like lord cadurcis  lady annabel appeared a little confused she looked even at venetia but venetias eyes were on the ground at length she said in truth marmion since we met we have thought only of you  cadurcis abbey papa is close to cherbury said venetia  cherbury said herbert with a faint blush i have never seen it and now i shall never see it no matter my country is your mother and yourself some find a home in their country i find a country in my home well he added in a gayer tone it has gratified me much to meet lord cadurcis we were happy before but now we are even gay i like to see you smile annabel and hear venetia laugh i feel myself quite an unusual hilarity cadurcis it is very strange how often i have mused over that name a year ago it was one of my few wishes to know him my wishes then dear annabel were not very ambitious they did not mount so high as you have since permitted them and now i do know him and under what circumstances is not life strange but is it not happy i feel it so good night sweet wife my darling daughter a happy happy night he embraced them ere they retired and opening a volume composed his mind after the novel excitement of the evening     chapter iv   cadurcis left the brig early in the morning alone and strolled towards the villa he met herbert halfway to spezzia who turned back with him towards home they sat down on a crag opposite the sea there was a light breeze the fishing boats wore out and the view was as animated as the fresh air was cheering  there they go said cadurcis smiling catching john dory as you and i try to catch john bull now if these people could understand what two great men were watching them how they would stare but they dont care a sprat for us not they they are not part of the world the three or four thousand civilised savages for whom we sweat our brains and whose fetid breath perfumed with musk is fame pah  herbert smiled i have not cared much myself for this same world  why no you have done something and shown your contempt for them no one can deny that i will some day if i have an opportunity i owe it them i think i can show them a trick or two stilla i have got a damascus blade in store for their thick hides i will turn their flank yet  footnote a i think i know a trick or two would turn your flanks don juan  and gain a victory where conquest brings no glory you are worth brighter laurels lord cadurcis  now is not it the most wonderful thing in the world that you and i have met said cadurcis now i look upon ourselves as something like eh fellows with some pith in them by jove if we only joined together how we could lay it on crack crack crack i think i see them wincing under the thong the pompous poltroons if you only knew how they behaved to me by jove sir they hooted me going to the house of lords and nearly pulled me off my horse the ruffians would have massacred me if they could and then they all ran away from a drummerboy and a couple of grenadiers who were going the rounds to change guard was not that good fine eh a brutish mob in a fit of morality about to immolate a gentleman and then scampering off from a sentry i call that human nature  as long as they leave us alone and do not burn us alive i am content said herbert i am callous to what they say  so am i said cadurcis i made out a list the other day of all the persons and things i have been compared to it begins well with alcibiades but it ends with the swiss giantess or the polish dwarf i forget which here is your book you see it has been well thumbed in fact to tell the truth it was my cribbing book and i always kept it by me when i was writing at athens like a gradus a gradus ad parnassum you know but although i crib i am candid and you see i fairly own it to you  you are welcome to all i have ever written said herbert mine were but crude dreams i wished to see man noble and happy but if he will persist in being vile and miserable i must even be content i can struggle for him no more  well you opened my mind said cadurcis i owe you everything but i quite agree with you that nothing is worth an effort as for philosophy and freedom and all that they tell devilish well in a stanza but men have always been fools and slaves and fools and slaves they always will be  nay said herbert i will not believe that i will not give up a jot of my conviction of a great and glorious future for human destinies but its consummation will not be so rapid as i once thought and in the meantime i die  ah death said lord cadurcis that is a botherer what can you make of death there are those poor fishermen now there will be a white squall some day and they will go down with those lateen sails of theirs and be food for the very prey they were going to catch and if you continue living here you may eat one of your neighbours in the shape of a shoal of red mullets when it is the season the great secret we cannot penetrate that with all our philosophy my dear herbert all that we know is nothing can be known barren barren barren and yet what a grand world it is look at this bay these blue waters the mountains and these chestnuts devilish fine the fact is truth is veiled but like the shekinah over the tabernacle the veil is of dazzling light  life is the great wonder said herbert into which all that is strange and startling resolves itself the mist of familiarity obscures from us the miracle of our being mankind are constantly starting at events which they consider extraordinary but a philosopher acknowledges only one miracle and that is life political revolutions changes of empire wrecks of dynasties and the opinions that support them these are the marvels of the vulgar but these are only transient modifications of life the origin of existence is therefore the first object which a true philosopher proposes to himself unable to discover it he accepts certain results from his unbiassed observation of its obvious nature and on them he establishes certain principles to be our guides in all social relations whether they take the shape of laws or customs nevertheless until the principle of life be discovered all theories and all systems of conduct founded on theory must be considered provisional  and do you believe that there is a chance of its being discovered inquired cadurcis  i cannot from any reason in my own intelligence find why it should not said herbert  you conceive it possible that a man may attain earthly immortality inquired cadurcis  undoubtedly  by jove said cadurcis if i only knew how i would purchase an immense annuity directly  when i said undoubtedly said herbert smiling i meant only to express that i know no invincible reason to the contrary i see nothing inconsistent with the existence of a supreme creator in the annihilation of death it appears to me an achievement worthy of his omnipotence i believe in the possibility but i believe in nothing more i anticipate the final result but not by individual means it will of course be produced by some vast and silent and continuous operation of nature gradually effecting some profound and comprehensive alteration in her order a change of climate for instance the great enemy of life so that the inhabitants of the earth may attain a patriarchal age this renovated breed may in turn produce a still more vigorous offspring and so we may ascend the scale from the threescore and ten of the psalmist to the immortality of which we speak indeed i for my own part believe the operation has already commenced although thousands of centuries may elapse before it is consummated the threescore and ten of the psalmist is already obsolete the whole world is talking of the general change of its seasons and its atmosphere if the origin of america were such as many profound philosophers suppose viz a sudden emersion of a new continent from the waves it is impossible to doubt that such an event must have had a very great influence on the climate of the world besides why should we be surprised that the nature of man should change does not everything change is not change the law of nature my skin changes every year my hair never belongs to me a month the nail on my hand is only a passing possession i doubt whether a man at fifty is the same material being that he is at fiveandtwenty  i wonder said lord cadurcis if a creditor brought an action against you at fifty for goods delivered at fiveandtwenty one could set up the want of identity as a plea in bar it would be a consolation to an elderly gentleman  i am afraid mankind are too hostile to philosophy said herbert smiling to permit so desirable a consummation  should you consider a long life a blessing said cadurcis would you like for instance to live to the age of methusalem  those whom the gods love die young said herbert for the last twenty years i have wished to die and i have sought death but my feelings i confess on that head are at present very much modified  youth glittering youth said cadurcis in a musing tone i remember when the prospect of losing my youth frightened me out of my wits i dreamt of nothing but grey hairs a paunch and the gout or the gravel but i fancy every period of life has its pleasures and as we advance in life the exercise of power and the possession of wealth must be great consolations to the majority we bully our children and hoard our cash  two most noble occupations said herbert but i think in this world there is just as good a chance of being bullied by our children first and paying their debts afterwards  faith you are right said cadurcis laughing and lucky is he who has neither creditors nor offspring and who owes neither money nor affection after all the most difficult to pay of the two  it cannot be commanded certainly said herbert there is no usury for love  and yet it is very expensive too sometimes said cadurcis laughing for my part sympathy is a puzzler  you should read cabanis said herbert if indeed you have not i think i may find it here i will lend it you it has from its subject many errors but it is very suggestive  now that is kind for i have not a book here and after all there is nothing like reading i wish i had read more but it is not too late i envy you your learning besides so many other things however i hope we shall not part in a hurry we have met at last he said extending his hand and we were always friends  herbert shook his hand very warmly i can assure you lord cadurcis you have not a more sincere admirer of your genius i am happy in your society for myself i now aspire to be nothing better than an idler in life turning over a page and sometimes noting down a fancy you have it appears known my family long and intimately and you were doubtless surprised at finding me with them i have returned to my hearth and i am content once i sacrificed my happiness to my philosophy and now i have sacrificed my philosophy to my happiness  dear friend said cadurcis putting his arm affectionately in herberts as they walked along for indeed you must allow me to style you so all the happiness and all the sorrow of my life alike flow from your roof  in the meantime lady annabel and venetia came forth from the villa to their morning meal in their amphitheatre of hills marmion was not there to greet them as usual  was not plantagenet amusing last night said venetia and are not you happy dear mother to see him once more  indeed i am now always happy said lady annabel  and george was telling me last night in this portico of all their life he is more attached to plantagenet than ever he says it is impossible for any one to have behaved with greater kindness or to have led in every sense a more calm and rational life when he was alone at athens he did nothing but write george says that all his former works are nothing to what he has written now  he is very engaging said lady annabel  i think he will be such a delightful companion for papa i am sure papa must like him i hope he will stay some time for after all poor dear papa he must require a little amusement besides our society instead of being with his books he might be walking and talking with plantagenet i think dearest mother we shall be happier than ever  at this moment herbert with cadurcis leaning on his arm and apparently speaking with great earnestness appeared in the distance there they are said venetia i knew they would be friends come dearest mother let us meet them  you see lady annabel said lord cadurcis it is just as i said mr george is not here he is having tea and toast on board the brig  i do not believe it said venetia smiling  they seated themselves at the breakfasttable  you should have seen our apennine breakfasts in the autumn lord cadurcis said herbert every fruit of nature seemed crowded before us it was indeed a meal for a poet or a painter like paul veronese our grapes our figs our peaches our mountain strawberries they made a glowing picture for my part i have an original prejudice against animal food which i have never quite overcome and i believe it is only to please lady annabel that i have relapsed into the heresy of cutlets  do you think i have grown fatter lady annabel said lord cadurcis starting up i brought myself down at athens to bread and olives but i have been committing terrible excesses lately but only fish  ah here is george said lady annabel  and captain cadurcis appeared followed by a couple of sailors bearing a huge case  george said venetia i have been defending you against plantagenet he said you would not come  never mind george it was only behind your back said lord cadurcis and under those legitimate circumstances why even our best friends cannot expect us to spare them  i have brought venetia her toys said captain cadurcis and she was right to defend me as i have been working for her  the top of the case was knocked off and all the turkish buffooneries as cadurcis called them made their appearance slippers and shawls and bottles of perfumes and little hand mirrors beautifully embroidered and fanciful daggers and rosaries and a thousand other articles of which they had plundered the bazaars of constantinople  and here is a turkish volume of poetry beautifully illuminated and that is for you said cadurcis giving it to herbert perhaps it is a translation of one of our works who knows we can always say it is  this is the second present you have made me this morning here is a volume of my works said herbert producing the book that cadurcis had before given him i never expected that anything i wrote would be so honoured this too is the work of which i am the least ashamed for my wife admired it there annabel even though lord cadurcis is here i will present it to you tis an old friend  lady annabel accepted the book very graciously and in spite of all the temptations of her toys venetia could not refrain from peeping over her mothers shoulder at its contents mother she whispered in a voice inaudible save to lady annabel i may read this  lady annabel gave it her  and now we must send for pauncefort i think said lady annabel to collect and take care of our treasures  pauncefort said lord cadurcis when that gentlewoman appeared i have brought you a shawl but i could not bring you a turban because the turkish ladies do not wear turbans but if i had thought we should have met so soon i would have had one made on purpose for you  la my lord you always are so polite     chapter v   when the breakfast was over they wandered about the valley which cadurcis could not sufficiently admire insensibly he drew venetia from the rest of the party on the pretence of showing her a view at some little distance they walked along by the side of a rivulet which glided through the hills until they were nearly a mile from the villa though still in sight  venetia he at length said turning the conversation to a more interesting topic your father and myself have disburthened our minds to each other this morning i think we know each other now as well as if we were as old acquaintances as myself and his daughter  ah i knew that you and papa must agree said venetia i was saying so this morning to my mother  venetia said cadurcis with a laughing eye all this is very strange is it not  very strange indeed plantagenet i should not be surprised if it appeared to you as yet even incredible  it is miraculous said cadurcis but not incredible an angel interfered and worked the miracle i know all  venetia looked at him with a faint flush upon her cheek she gathered a flower and plucked it to pieces  what a singular destiny ours has been venetia said cadurcis do you know i can sit for an hour together and muse over it  can you plantagenet  i have such an extraordinary memory i do not think i ever forgot anything we have had some remarkable conversations in our time eh venetia do you remember my visit to cherbury before i went to cambridge and the last time i saw you before i left england and now it all ends in this what do you think of it venetia  think of what plantagenet  why of this reconciliation  dear plantagenet what can i think of it but what i have expressed that it is a wonderful event but the happiest in my life  you are quite happy now  quite  i see you do not care for me the least  plantagenet you are perverse are you not here  did you ever think of me when i was away  you know very well plantagenet that it is impossible for me to cease to be interested in you could i refrain from thinking of such a friend  friend poh i am not your friend and as for that you never once mentioned my name to your father miss venetia  you might easily conceive that there were reasons for such silence said venetia it could not arise on my part from forgetfulness or indifference for even if my feelings were changed towards you you are not a person that one would or even could avoid speaking of especially to papa who must have felt such interest in you i am sure even if i had not known you there were a thousand occasions which would have called your name to my lips had they been uncontrolled by other considerations  come venetia i am not going to submit to compliments from you said lord cadurcis no blarney i wish you only to think of me as you did ten years ago i will not have our hearts polluted by the vulgarity of fame i want you to feel for me as you did when we were children i will not be an object of interest and admiration and fiddlestick to you i will not submit to it  well you shall not said venetia laughing i will not admire you the least i will only think of you as a good little boy  you do not love me any longer i see that said cadurcis  yes i do plantagenet  you do not love me so much as you did the night before i went to eton and we sat over the fire ah how often i have thought of that night when i was at athens he added in a tone of emotion  dear plantagenet said venetia do not be silly i am in the highest spirits in the world i am quite gay with happiness and all because you have returned do not spoil my pleasure  ah venetia i see how it is you have forgotten me or worse than forgotten me  well i am sure i do not know what to say to satisfy you said venetia i think you very unreasonable and very ungrateful too for i have always been your friend plantagenet and i am sure you know it you sent me a message before you went abroad  darling said lord cadurcis seizing her hand i am not ungrateful i am not unreasonable i adore you you were very kind then when all the world was against me you shall see how i will pay them off the dogs and worse than dogs their betters far dogs are faithful do you remember poor old marmion how we were mystified venetia little did we think then who was marmions godfather  venetia smiled but she said i do not like this bitterness of yours plantagenet you have no cause to complain of the world and you magnify a petty squabble with a contemptible coterie into a quarrel with a nation it is not a wise humour and if you indulge it it will not be a happy one  i will do exactly what you wish on every subject said cadurcis if you will do exactly what i wish on one  well said venetia  once you told me said cadurcis that you would not marry me without the consent of your father then most unfairly you added to your conditions the consent of your mother now both your parents are very opportunely at hand let us fall down upon our knees and beg their blessing  o my dear plantagenet i think it will be much better for me never to marry we are both happy now let us remain so you can live here and i can be your sister will not that do  no venetia it will not  dear plantagenet said venetia with a faltering voice if you knew how much i had suffered dear plantagenet  i know it i know all said cadurcis taking her arm and placing it tenderly in his now listen to me sweet girl i loved you when a child when i was unknown to the world and unknown to myself i loved you as a youth not utterly inexperienced in the world and when my rising passions had taught me to speculate on the character of women i loved you as a man venetia with that world at my feet that world which i scorn but which i will command i have been constant venetia your heart assures you of that you are the only being in existence who exercises over me any influence and the influence you possess is irresistible and eternal it springs from some deep and mysterious sympathy of blood which i cannot penetrate it can neither be increased nor diminished by time it is entirely independent of its action i pretend not to love you more at this moment than when i first saw you when you entered the terraceroom at cherbury and touched my cheek from that moment i was yours i declare to you most solemnly i declare to you that i know not what love is except to you the world has called me a libertine the truth is no other woman can command my spirit for an hour i see through them at a glance i read all their weakness frivolity vanity affectation as if they were touched by the revealing rod of asmodeus you were born to be my bride unite yourself with me control my destiny and my course shall be like the sun of yesterday but reject me reject me and i devote all my energies to the infernal gods i will pour my lava over the earth until all that remains of my fatal and exhausted nature is a black and barren cone surrounded by bitter desolation  plantagenet be calm  i am perfectly calm venetia you talk to me of your sufferings what has occasioned them a struggle against nature nature has now triumphed and you are happy what necessity was there for all this misery that has fallen on your house why is your father an exile do not you think that if your mother had chosen to exert her influence she might have prevented the most fatal part of his career undoubtedly despair impelled his actions as much as philosophy though i give him credit for a pure and lofty spirit to no man more but not a murmur against your mother from me she received my overtures of reconciliation last night with more than cordiality she is your mother venetia and she once was mine indeed i love her indeed you would find that i would study her happiness for after all sweet is there another woman in existence better qualified to fill the position of my motherinlaw i could not behave unkindly to her i could not treat her with neglect or harshness not merely for the sake of her many admirable qualities but from other considerations venetia considerations we never can forget by heavens i love your mother i do indeed venetia i remember so many things her last words to me when i went to eton if she would only behave kindly to me you would see what a soninlaw i should make you would be jealous that you should venetia i can bear anything from you venetia but with others i cannot forget who i am it makes me bitter to be treated as lady annabel treated me last year in london but a smile and a kind word and i recall all her maternal love i do indeed venetia last night when she was kind i could have kissed her  poor venetia could not answer her tears were flowing so plenteously i have told your father all sweetest said cadurcis i concealed nothing  and what said he murmured venetia  it rests with your mother after all that has passed he will not attempt to control your fate and he is right perhaps his interference in my favour might even injure me but there is no cause for despair all i wanted was to come to an understanding with you to be sure you loved me as you always have done i will not be impatient i will do everything to soothe and conciliate and gratify lady annabel you will see how i will behave as you say too we are happy because we are together and therefore it would be unreasonable not to be patient i never can be sufficiently grateful for this meeting i concluded you would be in england though we were on our way to milan to inquire after you george has been a great comfort to me in all this affair venetia he loves you venetia almost as much as i do i think i should have gone mad during that cursed affair in england had it not been for george i thought you would hate me but when george brought me your message i cared for nothing and then his visit to the lake was so devilish kind he is a noble fellow and a true friend my sweet sweet venetia dry your eyes let us rejoin them with a smile we have not been long away i will pretend we have been violet hunting said cadurcis stooping down and plucking up a handful of flowers do you remember our violets at home venetia do you know venetia i always fancy every human being is like some object in nature and you always put me in mind of a violet so fresh and sweet and delicate     chapter vi   we have been exploring the happy valley said lord cadurcis to lady annabel and here is our plunder and he gave her the violets  you were always fond of flowers said lady annabel  yes i imbibed the taste from you said cadurcis gratified by the gracious remark  he seated himself at her feet examined and admired her work and talked of old times but with such infinite discretion that he did not arouse a single painful association venetia was busied with her fathers poems and smiled often at the manuscript notes of cadurcis lying as usual on the grass and leaning his head on his left arm herbert was listening to captain cadurcis who was endeavouring to give him a clear idea of the bosphorus thus the morning wore away until the sun drove them into the villa  i will show you my library lord cadurcis said herbert  cadurcis followed him into a spacious apartment where he found a collection so considerable that he could not suppress his surprise italian spoils chiefly said herbert a friend of mine purchased an old library at bologna for me and it turned out richer than i imagined the rest are old friends that have been with me many of them at least at college i brought them back with me from america for then they were my only friends  can you find cabanis said lord cadurcis  herbert looked about it is in this neighbourhood i imagine he said cadurcis endeavoured to assist him what is this he said plato  i should like to read plato at athens said herbert my ambition now does not soar beyond such elegant fortune  we are all under great obligations to plato said cadurcis i remember when i was in london i always professed myself his disciple and it is astonishing what results i experienced platonic love was a great invention  herbert smiled but as he saw cadurcis knew nothing about the subject he made no reply  plato says or at least i think he says that life is love said cadurcis i have said it myself in a very grand way too i believe i cribbed it from you but what does he mean i am sure i meant nothing but i dare say you did  i certainly had some meaning said herbert stopping in his search and smiling but i do not know whether i expressed it the principle of every motion that is of all life is desire or love at present i am in love with the lost volume of cabanis and if it were not for the desire of obtaining it i should not now be affording any testimony of my vitality by looking after it  that is very clear said cadurcis but i was thinking of love in the vulgar sense in the shape of a petticoat certainly when i am in love with a woman i feel love is life but when i am out of love which often happens and generally very soon i still contrive to live  we exist said herbert because we sympathise if we did not sympathise with the air we should die but if we only sympathised with the air we should be in the lowest order of brutes baser than the sloth mount from the sloth to the poet it is sympathy that makes you a poet it is your desire that the airy children of your brain should be born anew within anothers that makes you create therefore a misanthropical poet is a contradiction in terms  but when he writes a lampoon said cadurcis  he desires that the majority who are not lampooned should share his hate said herbert  but swift lampooned the species said cadurcis for my part i think life is hatred  but swift was not sincere for he wrote the drapiers letters at the same time besides the very fact of your abusing mankind proves that you do not hate them it is clear that you are desirous of obtaining their good opinion of your wit you value them you esteem them you love them their approbation causes you to act and makes you happy as for sexual love said herbert of which you were speaking its quality and duration depend upon the degree of sympathy that subsists between the two persons interested plato believed and i believe with him in the existence of a spiritual antitype of the soul so that when we are born there is something within us which from the instant we live and move thirsts after its likeness this propensity develops itself with the development of our nature the gratification of the senses soon becomes a very small part of that profound and complicated sentiment which we call love love on the contrary is an universal thirst for a communion not merely of the senses but of our whole nature intellectual imaginative and sensitive he who finds his antitype enjoys a love perfect and enduring time cannot change it distance cannot remove it the sympathy is complete he who loves an object that approaches his antitype is proportionately happy the sympathy is feeble or strong as it may be if men were properly educated and their faculties fully developed continued herbert the discovery of the antitype would be easy and when the day arrives that it is a matter of course the perfection of civilisation will be attained  i believe in plato said lord cadurcis and i think i have found my antitype his theory accounts for what i never could understand     chapter vii   in the course of the evening lady annabel requested lord cadurcis and his cousin to take up their quarters at the villa independent of the delight which such an invitation occasioned him cadurcis was doubly gratified by its being given by her it was indeed her unprompted solicitation for neither herbert nor even venetia however much they desired the arrangement was anxious to appear eager for its fulfilment desirous of pleasing her husband and her daughter a little penitent as to her previous treatment of cadurcis now that time and strange events had combined to soften her feelings and won by his engaging demeanour towards herself lady annabel had of mere impulse resolved upon the act and she was repaid by the general air of gaiety and content which it diffused through the circle  few weeks indeed passed ere her ladyship taught herself even to contemplate the possibility of an union between her daughter and lord cadurcis the change which had occurred in her own feelings and position had in her estimation removed very considerable barriers to such a result it would not become her again to urge the peculiarity of his temperament as an insuperable objection to the marriage that was out of the question even if the conscience of lady annabel herself now that she was so happy were perfectly free from any participation in the causes which occasioned the original estrangement between herbert and herself desirous too as all mothers are that her daughter should be suitably married lady annabel could not shut her eyes to the great improbability of such an event occurring now that venetia had as it were resigned all connection with her native country as to her daughter marrying a foreigner the very idea was intolerable to her and venetia appeared therefore to have resumed that singular and delicate position which she occupied at cherbury in earlier years when lady annabel had esteemed her connection with lord cadurcis so fortunate and auspicious moreover while lord cadurcis in birth rank country and consideration offered in every view of the ease so gratifying an alliance he was perhaps the only englishman whose marriage into her family would not deprive her of the society of her child cadurcis had a great distaste for england which he seized every opportunity to express he continually declared that he would never return there and his habits of seclusion and study so entirely accorded with those of her husband that lady annabel did not doubt they would continue to form only one family a prospect so engaging to her that it would perhaps have alone removed the distrust which she had so unfortunately cherished against the admirer of her daughter and although some of his reputed opinions occasioned her doubtless considerable anxiety he was nevertheless very young and far from emancipated from the beneficial influence of his early education she was sanguine that this sheep would yet return to the fold where once he had been tended with so much solicitude when too she called to mind the chastened spirit of her husband and could not refrain from feeling that had she not quitted him he might at a much earlier period have attained a mood so full of promise and to her so cheering she could not resist the persuasion that under the influence of venetia cadurcis might speedily free himself from the dominion of that arrogant genius to which rather than to any serious conviction the result of a studious philosophy she attributed his indifference on the most important of subjects on the whole however it was with no common gratification that lady annabel observed the strong and intimate friendship that arose between her husband and cadurcis they were inseparable companions independently of the natural sympathy between two highly imaginative minds there were in the superior experience the noble character the vast knowledge and refined taste of herbert charms of which cadurcis was very susceptible cadurcis had not been a great reader himself and he liked the company of one whose mind was at once so richly cultured and so deeply meditative thus he obtained matter and spirit distilled through the alembic of anothers brain jealousy had never had a place in herberts temperament now he was insensible even to emulation he spoke of cadurcis as he thought with the highest admiration as one without a rival and in whose power it was to obtain an imperishable fame it was his liveliest pleasure to assist the full development of such an intellect and to pour to him with a lavish hand all the treasures of his taste his learning his fancy and his meditation his kind heart his winning manners his subdued and perfect temper and the remembrance of the relation which he bore to venetia completed the spell which bound cadurcis to him with all the finest feelings of his nature it was indeed an intercourse peculiarly beneficial to cadurcis whose career had hitherto tended rather to the development of the power than the refinement of his genius and to whom an active communion with an equal spirit of a more matured intelligence was an incident rather to be desired than expected herbert and cadurcis therefore spent their mornings together sometimes in the library sometimes wandering in the chestnut woods sometimes sailing in the boat of the brig for they were both fond of the sea in these excursions george was in general their companion he had become a great favourite with herbert as with everybody else no one managed a boat so well although cadurcis prided himself also on his skill in this respect and george was so frank and unaffected and so used to his cousins habits that his presence never embarrassed herbert and cadurcis and they read or conversed quite at their ease as if there were no third person to mar by his want of sympathy the full communion of their intellect the whole circle met at dinner and never again parted until at a late hour of night this was a most agreeable life cadurcis himself good humoured because he was happy doubly exerted himself to ingratiate himself with lady annabel and felt every day that he was advancing venetia always smiled upon him and praised him delightfully for his delightful conduct  in the evening herbert would read to them the manuscript poem of cadurcis the fruits of his attic residence and grecian meditations the poet would sometimes affect a playful bashfulness on this head perhaps not altogether affected and amuse venetia in a whisper with his running comments or exclaim with an arch air i say venetia what would mrs montague and the blues give for this eh i can fancy hannah more in decent ecstasies     chapter viii   it is an odd thing my dear herbert said cadurcis to his friend in one of these voyages that destiny should have given you and me the same tutor  masham said herbert smiling i tell you what is much more singular my dear cadurcis it is that notwithstanding being our tutor a mitre should have fallen upon his head  i am heartily glad said cadurcis i like masham very much i really have a sincere affection for him do you know during my infernal affair about those accursed monteagles when i went to the house of lords and was cut even by my own party think of that the polished ruffians masham was the only person who came forward and shook hands with me and in the most marked manner a bishop too and the other side that was good was it not but he would not see his old pupil snubbed if he had waited ten minutes longer he might have had a chance of seeing him massacred and then they complain of my abusing england my mother country a stepdame i take it  masham is in politics a tory in religion ultraorthodox herbert he has nothing about him of the latitudinarian and yet he is the most amiable man with whom i am acquainted nature has given him a kind and charitable heart which even his opinions have not succeeded in spoiling  perhaps that is exactly what he is saying of us two at this moment said cadurcis after all what is truth it changes as you change your clime or your country it changes with the century the truth of a hundred years ago is not the truth of the present day and yet it may have been as genuine truth at rome is not the truth of london and both of them differ from the truth of constantinople for my part i believe everything  well that is practically prudent if it be metaphysically possible said herbert do you know that i have always been of opinion that pontius pilate has been greatly misrepresented by lord bacon in the quotation of his celebrated question what is truth said jesting pilate and would not wait for an answer let us be just to pontius pilate who has sins enough surely to answer for there is no authority for the jesting humour given by lord bacon pilate was evidently of a merciful and clement disposition probably an epicurean his question referred to a declaration immediately preceding it that he who was before him came to bear witness to the truth pilate inquired what truth  well i always have a prejudice against pontius pilate said lord cadurcis and i think it is from seeing him when i was a child on an old dutch tile fireplace at marringhurst dressed like a burgomaster one cannot get over ones early impressions but when you picture him to me as an epicurean he assumes a new character i fancy him young noble elegant and accomplished crowned with a wreath and waving a goblet and enjoying his government vastly  before the introduction of christianity said herbert the philosophic schools answered to our present religious sects you said of a man that he was a stoic or an epicurean as you say of a man now that he is a calvinist or a wesleyan  i should have liked to have known epicurus said cadurcis  i would sooner have known him and plato than any of the ancients said herbert i look upon plato as the wisest and the profoundest of men and upon epicurus as the most humane and gentle  now how do you account for the great popularity of aristotle in modern ages said cadurcis and the comparative neglect of these at least his equals chance i suppose that settles everything  by no means said herbert if you mean by chance an absence of accountable cause i do not believe such a quality as chance exists every incident that happens must be a link in a chain in the present case the monks monopolised literature such as it might be and they exercised their intellect only in discussing words they therefore adopted aristotle and the peripatetics plato interfered with their heavenly knowledge and epicurus who maintained the rights of man to pleasure and happiness would have afforded a dangerous and seducing contrast to their dark and miserable code of morals  i think of the ancients said cadurcis alcibiades and alexander the great are my favourites they were young beautiful and conquerors a great combination  and among the moderns inquired herbert  they dont touch my fancy said cadurcis who are your heroes  oh i have many but i confess i should like to pass a day with milton or sir philip sidney  among mere literary men said cadurcis i should say bayle  and old montaigne for me said herbert  well i would fain visit him in his feudal chateau said cadurcis his is one of the books which give a spring to the mind of modern times the feudal ages of italy most interest me i think that was a springtide of civilisation all the fine arts nourished at the same moment  they ever will said herbert all the inventive arts maintain a sympathetic connection between each other for after all they are only various expressions of one internal power modified by different circumstances either of the individual or of society it was so in the age of pericles i mean the interval which intervened between the birth of that great man and the death of aristotle undoubtedly whether considered in itself or with reference to the effects which it produced upon the subsequent destinies of civilised man the most memorable in the history of the world  and yet the age of pericles has passed away said lord cadurcis mournfully and i have gazed upon the mouldering parthenon o herbert you are a great thinker and muse deeply solve me the problem why so unparalleled a progress was made during that period in literature and the arts and why that progress so rapid and so sustained so soon received a check and became retrograde  it is a problem left to the wonder and conjecture of posterity said herbert but its solution perhaps may principally be found in the weakness of their political institutions nothing of the athenians remains except their genius but they fulfilled their purpose the wrecks and fragments of their subtle and profound minds obscurely suggest to us the grandeur and perfection of the whole their language excels every other tongue of the western world their sculptures baffle all subsequent artists credible witnesses assure us that their paintings were not inferior and we are only accustomed to consider the painters of italy as those who have brought the art to its highest perfection because none of the ancient pictures have been preserved yet of all their fine arts it was music of which the greeks were themselves most proud its traditionary effects were far more powerful than any which we experience from the compositions of our times and now for their poetry cadurcis it is in poetry and poetry alone that modern nations have maintained the majesty of genius do we equal the greeks do we even excel them  let us prove the equality first said cadurcis the greeks excelled in every species of poetry in some we do not even attempt to rival them we have not a single modern ode or a single modern pastoral we have no one to place by pindar or the exquisite theocritus as for the epic i confess myself a heretic as to homer i look upon the iliad as a remnant of national songs the wise ones agree that the odyssey is the work of a later age my instinct agrees with the result of their researches i credit their conclusion the paradise lost is doubtless a great production but the subject is monkish dante is national but he has all the faults of a barbarous age in general the modern epic is framed upon the assumption that the iliad is an orderly composition they are indebted for this fallacy to virgil who called order out of chaos but the aeneid all the same appears to me an insipid creation and now for the drama you will adduce shakspeare  there are passages in dante said herbert not inferior in my opinion to any existing literary composition but as a whole i will not make my stand on him i am not so clear that as a lyric poet petrarch may not rival the greeks shakspeare i esteem of ineffable merit  and who is shakspeare said cadurcis we know of him as much as we do of homer did he write half the plays attributed to him did he ever write a single whole play i doubt it he appears to me to have been an inspired adapter for the theatres which were then not as good as barns i take him to have been a botcher up of old plays his popularity is of modern date and it may not last it would have surprised him marvellously heaven knows at present all that bears his name is alike admired and a regular shaksperian falls into ecstasies with trash which deserves a niche in the dunciad for my part i abhor your irregular geniuses and i love to listen to the little nightingale of twickenham  i have often observed said herbert that writers of an unbridled imagination themselves admire those whom the world erroneously in my opinion and from a confusion of ideas esteems correct i am myself an admirer of pope though i certainly should not ever think of classing him among the great creative spirits and you you are the last poet in the world cadurcis whom one would have fancied his votary  i have written like a boy said cadurcis i found the public bite and so i baited on with tainted meat i have never written for fame only for notoriety but i am satiated i am going to turn over a new leaf  for myself said herbert if i ever had the power to impress my creations on my fellowmen the inclination is gone and perhaps the faculty is extinct my career is over perhaps a solitary echo from my lyre may yet at times linger about the world like a breeze that has lost its way but there is a radical fault in my poetic mind and i am conscious of it i am not altogether void of the creative faculty but mine is a fragmentary mind i produce no whole unless you do this you cannot last at least you cannot materially affect your species but what i admire in you cadurcis is that with all the faults of youth of which you will free yourself your creative power is vigorous prolific and complete your creations rise fast and fair like perfect worlds  well we will not compliment each other said cadurcis for after all it is a miserable craft what is poetry but a lie and what are poets but liars  you are wrong cadurcis said herbert poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world  i see the towers of porto venere said cadurcis directing the sail we shall soon be on shore i think too i recognise venetia ah my dear herbert your daughter is a poem that beats all our inspiration     chapter ix   one circumstance alone cast a gloom over this happy family and that was the approaching departure of captain cadurcis for england this had been often postponed but it could be postponed no longer not even the entreaties of those kind friends could any longer prevent what was inevitable the kind heart the sweet temper and the lively and companionable qualities of captain cadurcis had endeared him to everyone all felt that his departure would occasion a blank in their life impossible to be supplied it reminded the herberts also painfully of their own situation in regard to their native country which they were ever unwilling to dwell upon george talked of returning to them but the prospect was necessarily vague they felt that it was only one of those fanciful visions with which an affectionate spirit attempts to soothe the pang of separation his position his duties all the projects of his life bound him to england from which indeed he had been too long absent it was selfish to wish that for their sakes he should sink down into a mere idler in italy and yet when they recollected how little his future life could be connected with their own everyone felt dispirited  i shall not go boating today said george to venetia it is my last day mr herbert and plantagenet talk of going to lavenza let us take a stroll together  nothing can be refused to those we love on the last day and venetia immediately acceded to his request in the course of the morning therefore herself and george quitted the valley in the direction of the coast towards genoa many a white sail glittered on the blue waters it was a lively and cheering scene but both venetia and her companion were depressed  i ought to be happy said george and sighed the fondest wish of my heart is attained you remember our conversation on the lago maggiore venetia you see i was a prophet and you will be lady cadurcis yet  we must keep up our spirits said venetia i do not despair of our all returning to england yet so many wonders have happened that i cannot persuade myself that this marvel will not also occur i am sure my uncle will do something i have a secret idea that the bishop is all this time working for papa i feel assured i shall see cherbury and cadurcis again and cadurcis will be your home  a year ago you appeared dying and plantagenet was the most miserable of men said captain cadurcis you are both now perfectly well and perfectly happy living even under the same roof soon i feel to be united and with the cordial approbation of lady annabel your father is restored to you every blessing in the world seems to cluster round your roof it is selfish for me to wear a gloomy countenance  ah dear george you never can be selfish said venetia  yes i am selfish venetia what else can make me sad  you know how much you contribute to our happiness said venetia and you feel for our sufferings at your absence  no venetia i feel for myself said captain cadurcis with energy i am certain that i never can be happy except in your society and plantagenets i cannot express to you how i love you both nothing else gives me the slightest interest  you must go home and marry said venetia smiling you must marry an heiress  never said captain cadurcis nothing shall ever induce me to marry no all my dreams are confined to being the bachelor uncle of the family  well now i think said venetia of all the persons i know there is no one so qualified for domestic happiness as yourself i think your wife george would be a very fortunate woman and i only wish i had a sister that you might marry her  i wish you had venetia i would give up my resolution against marriage directly  alas said venetia there is always some bitter drop in the cup of life must you indeed go george  my present departure is inevitable he replied but i have some thoughts of giving up my profession and parliament and then i will return never to leave you again  what will lord  say that will never do said venetia no i should not be content unless you prospered in the world george you are made to prosper and i should be miserable if you sacrificed your existence to us you must go home and you must marry and write letters to us by every post and tell us what a happy man you are the best thing for you to do would be to live with your wife at the abbey or cherbury if you liked you see i settle everything  i never will marry said captain cadurcis seriously  yes you will said venetia  i am quite serious venetia now mark my words and remember this day i never will marry i have a reason and a strong and good one for my resolution  what is it  because my marriage will destroy the intimacy that subsists between me and yourself and plantagenet he added  your wife should be my friend said venetia  happy woman said george  let us indulge for a moment in a dream of domestic bliss said venetia gaily papa and mamma at cherbury plantagenet and myself at the abbey where you and your wife must remain until we could build you a house and dr masham coming down to spend christmas with us would it not be delightful i only hope plantagenet would be tame i think he would burst out a little sometimes  not with you venetia not with you said george you have a hold over him which nothing can ever shake i could always put him in an amiable mood in an instant by mentioning your name  i wish you knew the abbey george said venetia it is the most interesting of all old places i love it you must promise me when you arrive in england to go on a pilgrimage to cadurcis and cherbury and write me a long account of it  i will indeed i will write to you very often  you shall find me a most faithful correspondent which i dare say plantagenet would not prove  oh i beg your pardon said george you have no idea of the quantity of letters he wrote me when he first quitted england and such delightful ones i do not think there is a more lively letterwriter in the world his descriptions are so vivid a few touches give you a complete picture and then his observations they are so playful i assure you there is nothing in the world more easy and diverting than a letter from plantagenet  if you could only see his first letter from eton to me said venetia i have always treasured it it certainly was not very diverting and if by easy you mean easy to decipher she added laughing his handwriting must have improved very much lately dear plantagenet i am always afraid i never pay him sufficient respect that i do not feel sufficient awe in his presence but i cannot disconnect him from the playfellow of my infancy and do you know it seems to me whenever he addresses me his voice and air change and assume quite the tone and manner of childhood  i have never known him but as a great man said captain cadurcis but he was so frank and simple with me from the very first that i cannot believe that it is not two years since we first met  ah i shall never forget that night at ranelagh said venetia half with a smile and half with a sigh how interesting he looked i loved to see the people stare at him and to hear them whisper his name  here they seated themselves by a fountain overshadowed by a planetree and for a while talked only of plantagenet  all the dreams of my life have come to pass said venetia i remember when i was at weymouth ill and not very happy i used to roam about the sands thinking of papa and how i wished plantagenet was like him a great man a great poet whom all the world admired little did i think that before a year had passed plantagenet my unknown plantagenet would be the admiration of england little did i think another year would pass and i should be living with my father and plantagenet together and they should be bosom friends you see george we must never despair  under this bright sun said captain cadurcis one is naturally sanguine but think of me alone and in gloomy england  it is indeed a bright sun said venetia how wonderful to wake every morning and be sure of meeting its beam  captain cadurcis looked around him with a sailors eye over the apennines towards genoa there was a ridge of dark clouds piled up with such compactness that they might have been mistaken in a hasty survey for part of the mountains themselves  bright as is the sun said captain cadurcis we may have yet a squall before night  i was delighted with venice said his companion not noticing his observation i think of all places in the world it is one which plantagenet would most admire i cannot believe but that even his delicious athens would yield to it  he did lead the oddest life at athens you can conceive said captain cadurcis the people did not know what to make of him he lived in the latin convent a fine building which he had almost to himself for there are not half a dozen monks he used to pace up and down the terrace which he had turned into a garden and on which he kept all sorts of strange animals he wrote continually there indeed he did nothing but write his only relaxation was a daily ride to piraeus about five miles over the plain he told me it was the only time in his life he was ever contented with himself except when he was at cherbury he always spoke of london with disgust  plantagenet loves retirement and a quiet life said venetia but he must not be marred with vulgar sights and commonplace duties that is the secret with him  i think the wind has just changed said captain cadurcis it seems to me that we shall have a sirocco there it shifts again we shall have a sirocco for certain  what did you think of papa when you first saw him said venetia was he the kind of person you expected to see  exactly said captain cadurcis so very spiritual plantagenet said to me as we went home the first night that he looked like a golden phantom i think him very like you venetia indeed there can be no doubt you inherited your face from your father  ah if you had seen his portrait at cherbury when he was only twenty said venetia that was a golden phantom or rather he looked like hyperion what are you staring at so george  i do not like this wind muttered captain cadurcis there it goes  you cannot see the wind george  yes i can venetia and i do not like it at all do you see that black spot flitting like a shade over the sea it is like the reflection of a cloud on the water but there is no cloud well that is the wind venetia and a very wicked wind too  how strange is that indeed the wind  we had better return home said captain cadurcis i wish they had not gone to lavenza  but there is no danger said venetia  danger no no danger but they may get a wet jacket  they walked on but captain cadurcis was rather distrait his eye was always watching the wind at last he said i tell you venetia we must walk quickly for by jove we are going to have a white squall  they hurried their pace venetia mentioned her alarm again about the boat but her companion reassured her yet his manner was not so confident as his words  a white mist began to curl above the horizon the blueness of the day seemed suddenly to fade and its colour became grey there was a swell on the waters that hitherto had been quite glassy and they were covered with a scurfy foam  i wish i had been with them said captain cadurcis evidently very anxious  george you are alarmed said venetia earnestly i am sure there is danger  danger how can there be danger venetia perhaps they are in port by this time i dare say we shall find them at spezzia i will see you home and run down to them only hurry for your own sake for you do not know what a white squall in the mediterranean is we have but a few moments  and even at this very instant the wind came roaring and rushing with such a violent gush that venetia could scarcely stand george put his arm round her to support her the air was filled with thick white vapour so that they could no longer see the ocean only the surf rising very high all along the coast  keep close to me venetia said captain cadurcis hold my arm and i will walk first for we shall not be able to see a yard before us in a minute i know where we are we are above the olive wood and we shall soon be in the ravine these mediterranean white squalls are nasty things i had sooner by half be in a southwester for one cannot run before the wind in this bay the reefs stretch such a long way out  the danger and the inutility of expressing fears which could only perplex her guide made venetia silent but she was terrified she could not divest herself of apprehension about her father and plantagenet in spite of all he said it was evident that her companion was alarmed  they had now entered the valley the mountains had in some degree kept off the vapour the air was more clear venetia and captain cadurcis stopped a moment to breathe now venetia you are safe said captain cadurcis i will not come in i will run down to the bay at once he wiped the mist off his face venetia perceived him deadly pale  george she said conceal nothing from me there is danger imminent danger tell me at once  indeed venetia said captain cadurcis i am sure everything will be quite right there is some danger certainly at this moment but of course long ago they have run into harbour i have no doubt they are at spezzia at this moment now do not be alarmed indeed there is no cause god bless you he said and bounded away no cause thought he to himself as the wind sounded like thunder and the vapour came rushing up the ravine god grant i may be right but neither between the tropics nor on the line have i witnessed a severer squall than this what open boat can live in this weather oh that i had been with them i shall never forgive myself     chapter x   venetia found her mother walking up and down the room as was her custom when she was agitated she hurried to her daughter you must change your dress instantly venetia said lady annabel where is george  he has gone down to spezzia to papa and plantagenet it is a white squall it comes on very suddenly in this sea he ran down to spezzia instantly because he thought they would be wet said the agitated venetia speaking with rapidity and trying to appear calm  are they at spezzia inquired lady annabel quickly  george has no doubt they are mother said venetia  no doubt exclaimed lady annabel in great distress god grant they may be only wet  dearest mother said venetia approaching her but speech deserted her she had advanced to encourage lady annabel but her own fear checked the words on her lips  change your dress venetia said lady annabel lose no time in doing that i think i will send down to spezzia at once  that is useless now dear mother for george is there  go dearest said lady annabel i dare say we have no cause for fear but i am exceedingly alarmed about your father about them i am indeed i do not like these sudden squalls and i never liked this boating indeed i never did george being with them reconciled me to it now go venetia go my love  venetia quitted the room she was so agitated that she made pauncefort a confidant of her apprehensions  la my dear miss said mistress pauncefort i should never have thought of such a thing do not you remember what the old man said at weymouth there is many a boat will live in a rougher sea than a ship and it is such an unlikely thing it is indeed miss venetia i am certain sure my lord can manage a boat as well as a common sailor and master is hardly less used to it than he la miss dont make yourself nervous about any such preposterous ideas and i dare say you will find them in the saloon when you go down again really i should not wonder i think you had better wear your twill dress i have put the new trimming on  they had not returned when venetia joined her mother that indeed she could scarcely expect but in about half an hour a message arrived from captain cadurcis that they were not at spezzia but from something he had heard he had no doubt they were at sarzana and he was going to ride on there at once he felt sure however from what he had heard they were at sarzana this communication afforded lady annabel a little ease but venetias heart misgave her she recalled the alarm of george in the morning which it was impossible for him to disguise and she thought she recognised in this hurried message and vague assurances of safety something of the same apprehension and the same fruitless efforts to conceal it  now came the time of terrible suspense sarzana was nearly twenty miles distant from spezzia the evening must arrive before they could receive intelligence from captain cadurcis in the meantime the squall died away the heavens became again bright and though the waves were still tumultuous the surf was greatly decreased lady annabel had already sent down more than one messenger to the bay but they brought no intelligence she resolved now to go herself that she might have the satisfaction of herself crossexamining the fishermen who had been driven in from various parts by stress of weather she would not let venetia accompany her who she feared might already suffer from the exertions and rough weather of the morning this was a most anxious hour and yet the absence of her mother was in some degree a relief to venetia it at least freed her from the perpetual effort of assumed composure while her mother remained venetia had affected to read though her eye wandered listlessly over the page or to draw though the pencil trembled in her hand anything which might guard her from conveying to her mother that she shared the apprehensions which had already darkened her mothers mind but now that lady annabel was gone venetia muffling herself up in her shawl threw herself on a sofa and there she remained without a thought her mind a chaos of terrible images  her mother returned and with a radiant countenance venetia sprang from the sofa there is good news o mother have they returned  they are not at spezzia said lady annabel throwing herself into a chair panting for breath but there is good news you see i was right to go venetia these stupid people we send only ask questions and take the first answer i have seen a fisherman and he says he heard that two persons englishmen he believes have put into lerici in an open boat  god be praised said venetia o mother i can now confess to you the terror i have all along felt  my own heart assures me of it my child said lady annabel weeping and they mingled their tears together but tears not of sorrow  poor george said lady annabel he will have a terrible journey to sarzana and be feeling so much for us perhaps he may meet them  i feel assured he will said venetia and perhaps ere long they will all three be here again joy joy  they must never go in that boat again said lady annabel  oh they never will dearest mother if you ask them not said venetia  we will send to lerici said lady annabel  instantly said venetia but i dare say they already sent us a messenger  no said lady annabel men treat the danger that is past very lightly we shall not hear from them except in person  time now flew more lightly they were both easy in their minds the messenger was despatched to lerici but even lerici was a considerable distance and hours must elapse before his return still there was the hope of seeing them or hearing from them in the interval  i must go out dear mother said venetia let us both go out it is now very fine let us go just to the ravine for indeed it is impossible to remain here  accordingly they both went forth and took up a position on the coast which commanded a view on all sides all was radiant again and comparatively calm venetia looked upon the sea and said ah i never shall forget a white squall in the mediterranean for all this splendour  it was sunset they returned home no news yet from lerici lady annabel grew uneasy again the pensive and melancholy hour encouraged gloom but venetia who was sanguine encouraged her mother  suppose they were not englishmen in the boat said lady annabel  it is impossible mother what other two persons in this neighbourhood could have been in an open boat besides the man said englishmen you remember he said englishmen you are quite sure he did it must be they i feel as convinced of it as of your presence  i think there can be no doubt said lady annabel i wish that the messenger would return  the messenger did return no two persons in an open boat had put into lerici but a boat like the one described with every stitch of canvas set had passed lerici just before the squall commenced and the people there doubted not had made sarzana  lady annabel turned pale but venetia was still sanguine they are at sarzana she said they must be at sarzana you see george was right he said he was sure they were at sarzana besides dear mother he heard they were at sarzana  and we heard they were at lerici said lady annabel in a melancholy tone  and so they were dear mother it all agrees the accounts are consistent do not you see how very consistent they are they were seen at lerici and were off lerici but they made sarzana and george heard they were at sarzana i am certain they are at sarzana i feel quite easy i feel as easy as if they were here they are safe at sarzana but it is too far to return tonight we shall see them at breakfast tomorrow all three  venetia dearest do not you sit up said her mother i think there is a chance of george returning i feel assured he will send tonight but late of course go dearest and sleep  sleep thought venetia to herself but to please her mother she retired  goodnight my child said lady annabel the moment any one arrives you shall be aroused     chapter xi   venetia without undressing lay down on her bed watching for some sound that might give her hope of georges return dwelling on every instant the time dragged heavily along and she thought that the night had half passed when pauncefort entered her room and she learnt to her surprise that only an hour had elapsed since she had parted from her mother this entrance of pauncefort had given venetia a momentary hope that they had returned  i assure you miss venetia it is only an hour said pauncefort and nothing could have happened now do try to go to sleep that is a dear young lady for i am certain sure that they will all return in the morning as i am here i was telling my lady just now i said says i i dare say they are all very wet and very fatigued  they would have returned pauncefort said venetia or they would have sent they are not at sarzana  la miss venetia why should they be at sarzana why should they not have gone much farther on for as vicenzo was just saying to me and vicenzo knows all about the coast with such a wind as this i should not be surprised if they were at leghorn  o pauncefort said venetia i am sick at heart  now really miss venetia do not take on so said pauncefort for do not you remember when his lordship ran away from the abbey and went a gipsying nothing would persuade poor mrs cadurcis that he was not robbed and murdered and yet you see he was as safe and sound all the time as if he had been at cherbury  does vicenzo really think they could have reached leghorn said venetia clinging to every fragment of hope  he is morally sure of it miss venetia said pauncefort and i feel quite as certain for vicenzo is always right  i had confidence about sarzana said venetia i really did believe they were at sarzana if only captain cadurcis would return if he only would return and say they were not at sarzana i would try to believe they were at leghorn  now miss venetia said pauncefort i am certain sure that they are quite safe for my lord is a very good sailor he is indeed all the men say so and the boat is as seaworthy a boat as boat can be there is not the slightest fear i do assure you miss  do the men say that plantagenet is a good sailor inquired venetia  quite professional said mistress pauncefort and can command a ship as well as the best of them they all say that  hush pauncefort i hear something  its only my lady miss i know her step  is my mother going to bed said venetia  yes said pauncefort my lady sent me here to see after you i wish i could tell her you were asleep  it is impossible to sleep said venetia rising up from the bed withdrawing the curtain and looking at the sky what a peaceful night i wish my heart were like the sky i think i will go to mamma pauncefort  oh dear miss venetia i am sure i think you had better not if you and my lady now would only just go to sleep and forget every thing till morning it would be much better for you besides i am sure if my lady knew you were not gone to bed already it would only make her doubly anxious now really miss venetia do take my advice and just lie down again you may be sure the moment any one arrives i will let you know indeed i shall go and tell my lady that you are lying down as it is and very drowsy and so saying mistress pauncefort caught up her candle and bustled out of the room  venetia took up the volume of her fathers poems which cadurcis had filled with his notes how little did plantagenet anticipate when he thus expressed at athens the passing impressions of his mind that ere a year had glided away his fate would be so intimately blended with that of herbert it was impossible however for venetia to lose herself in a volume which under any other circumstances might have compelled her spirit the very associations with the writers added to the terrible restlessness of her mind she paused each instant to listen for the wishedfor sound but a mute stillness reigned throughout the house and household there was something in this deep unbroken silence at a moment when anxiety was universally diffused among the dwellers beneath that roof and the heart of more than one of them was throbbing with all the torture of the most awful suspense that fell upon venetias excited nerves with a very painful and even insufferable influence she longed for sound for some noise that might assure her she was not the victim of a trance she closed her volume with energy and she started at the sound she had herself created she rose and opened the door of her chamber very softly and walked into the vestibule there were caps and cloaks and whips and canes of cadurcis and her father lying about in familiar confusion it seemed impossible but that they were sleeping as usual under the same roof and where were they that she should live and be unable to answer that terrible question when she felt the utter helplessness of all her strong sympathy towards them it seemed to her that she must go mad she gazed around her with a wild and vacant stare at the bottom of her heart there was a fear maturing into conviction too horrible for expression she returned to her own chamber and the exhaustion occasioned by her anxiety and the increased coolness of the night made her at length drowsy she threw herself on the bed and slumbered  she started in her sleep she awoke she dreamed they had come home she rose and looked at the progress of the night the night was waning fast a grey light was on the landscape the point of day approached venetia stole softly to her mothers room and entered it with a soundless step lady annabel had not retired to bed she had sat up the whole night and was now asleep a lamp on a small table was burning at her side and she held firmly grasped in her hand the letter of her husband which he had addressed to her at venice and which she had been evidently reading a tear glided down the cheek of venetia as she watched her mother retaining that letter with fondness even in her sleep and when she thought of all the misery and heartaches and harrowing hours that had preceded its receipt and which venetia believed that letter had cured for ever what misery awaited them now why were they watchers of the night she shuddered when these dreadful questions flitted through her mind she shuddered and sighed her mother started and woke  who is there inquired lady annabel  venetia  my child have you not slept  yes mother and i woke refreshed as i hope you do  i wake with trust in gods mercy said lady annabel tell me the hour  it is just upon dawn mother  dawn no one has returned or come  the house is still mother  i would you were in bed my child  mother i can sleep no more i wish to be with you and venetia seated herself at her mothers feet and reclined her head upon her mothers knee  i am glad the night has passed venetia said lady annabel in a suppressed yet solemn tone it has been a trial and here she placed the letter in her bosom venetia could only answer with a sigh  i wish pauncefort would come said lady annabel and yet i do not like to rouse her she was up so late poor creature if it be the dawn i should like to send out messengers again something may be heard at spezzia  vicenzo thinks they have gone to leghorn mother  has he heard anything said lady annabel eagerly  no but he is an excellent judge said venetia repeating all paunceforts consolatory chatter he knows the coast so well he says he is sure the wind would carry them on to leghorn and that accounts you know mother for george not returning they are all at leghorn  would that george would return murmured lady annabel i wish i could see again that sailor who said they were at lerici he was an intelligent man  perhaps if we send down to the bay he may be there said venetia  hush i hear a step said lady annabel  venetia sprung up and opened the door but it was only pauncefort in the vestibule  the household are all up my lady said that important personage entering tis a beautiful morning vicenzo has run down to the bay my lady i sent him off immediately vicenzo says he is certain sure they are at leghorn my lady and this time three years the very same thing happened they were fishing for anchovies my lady close by my lady near sarzana two young men or rather one about the same age as master and one like my lord cousins my lady and just in the same sort of boat my lady and there came on a squall just the same sort of squall my lady and they did not return home and everyone was frightened out of their wits my lady and their wives and families quite distracted and after all they were at leghorn for this sort of wind always takes your open boats to leghorn vicenzo says  the sun rose the household were all stirring and many of them abroad the common routine of domestic duty seemed by some general yet not expressed understanding to have ceased the ladies descended below at a very early hour and went forth into the valley once the happy valley what was to be its future denomination vicenzo returned from the bay and he contrived to return with cheering intelligence the master of a felucca who in consequence of the squall had put in at lerici and in the evening dropped down to spezzia had met an open boat an hour before he reached sarzana and was quite confident that if it had put into port it must have been from the speed at which it was going a great distance down the coast no wrecks had been heard of in the neighbourhood this intelligence the gladsome time of day and the nonarrival of captain cadurcis which according to their mood was always a circumstance that counted either for good or for evil and the sanguine feelings which make us always cling to hope altogether reassured our friends venetia dismissed from her mind the dark thought which for a moment had haunted her in the noon of night and still it was a suspense a painful agitating suspense but only suspense that yet influenced them  time said lady annabel time we must wait  venetia consoled her mother she affected even a gaiety of spirit she was sure that vicenzo would turn out to be right after all pauncefort said he always was right and that they were at leghorn  the day wore apace the noon arrived and passed it was even approaching sunset lady annabel was almost afraid to counterorder the usual meals lest venetia should comprehend her secret terror the very same sentiment influenced venetia thus they both had submitted to the ceremony of breakfast but when the hour of dinner approached they could neither endure the mockery they looked at each other and almost at the same time they proposed that instead of dining they should walk down to the bay  i trust we shall at least hear something before the night said lady annabel i confess i dread the coming night i do not think i could endure it  the longer we do not hear the more certain i am of their being at leghorn said venetia  i have a great mind to travel there tonight said lady annabel  as they were stepping into the portico venetia recognised captain cadurcis in the distance she turned pale she would have fallen had she not leaned on her mother who was not so advanced and who had not seen him  what is the matter venetia said lady annabel alarmed  he is here he is here  marmion  no george let me sit down  her mother tried to support her to a chair lady annabel took off her bonnet she had not strength to walk forth she could not speak she sat down opposite venetia and her countenance pictured distress to so painful a degree that at any other time venetia would have flown to her but in this crisis of suspense it was impossible george was in sight he was in the portico he was in the room  he looked wan haggard and distracted more than once he essayed to speak but failed  lady annabel looked at him with a strange delirious expression venetia rushed forward and seized his arm and gazed intently on his face he shrank from her glance his frame trembled     chapter xii   in the heart of the tempest captain cadurcis traced his way in a sea of vapour with extreme danger and difficulty to the shore on his arrival at spezzia however scarcely a house was visible and the only evidence of the situation of the place was the cessation of an immense white surf which otherwise indicated the line of the sea but the absence of which proved his contiguity to a harbour in the thick fog he heard the cries and shouts of the returning fishermen and of their wives and children responding from the land to their exclamations he was forced therefore to wait at spezzia in an agony of impotent suspense until the fury of the storm was over and the sky was partially cleared at length the objects became gradually less obscure he could trace the outline of the houses and catch a glimpse of the water half a mile out and soon the old castles which guard the entrance of the strait that leads into the gulf looming in the distance and now and then a group of human beings in the vanishing vapour of these he made some inquiries but in vain respecting the boat and his friends he then made the brig but could learn nothing except their departure in the morning he at length obtained a horse and galloped along the coast towards lerici keeping a sharp look out as he proceeded and stopping at every village in his progress for intelligence when he had arrived in the course of three hours at lerici the storm had abated the sky was clear and no evidence of the recent squall remained except the agitated state of the waves at lerici he could hear nothing so he hurried on to sarzana where he learnt for the first time that an open boat with its sails set had passed more than an hour before the squall commenced from sarzana he hastened on to lavenza a little port the nearest seapoint to massa and where the carrara marble is shipped for england here also his inquiries were fruitless and exhausted by his exertions he dismounted and rested at the inn not only for repose but to consider over the course which he should now pursue the boat had not been seen off lavenza and the idea that they had made the coast towards leghorn now occurred to him his horse was so wearied that he was obliged to stop some time at lavenza for he could procure no other mode of conveyance the night also was fast coming on and to proceed to leghorn by this dangerous route at this hour was impossible at lavenza therefore he remained resolved to hasten to leghorn at break of day this was a most awful night although physically exhausted captain cadurcis could not sleep and after some vain efforts he quitted his restless bed on which he had laid down without undressing and walked forth to the harbour between anxiety for herbert and his cousin and for the unhappy women whom he had left behind he was nearly distracted he gazed on the sea as if some sail in sight might give him a chance of hope his professional experience assured him of all the danger of the squall he could not conceive how an open boat could live in such a sea and an instant return to port so soon as the squall commenced appeared the only chance of its salvation could they have reached leghorn it seemed impossible there was no hope they could now be at sarzana or lerici when he contemplated the full contingency of what might have occurred his mind wandered and refused to comprehend the possibility of the terrible conclusion he thought the morning would never break  there was a cavernous rock by the seashore that jutted into the water like a small craggy promontory captain cadurcis climbed to its top and then descending reclined himself upon an inferior portion of it which formed a natural couch with the wave on each side there lying at his length he gazed upon the moon and stars whose brightness he thought would never dim the mediterranean is a tideless sea but the swell of the waves which still set in to the shore bore occasionally masses of seaweed and other marine formations and deposited them around him plashing as it broke against the shore with a melancholy and monotonous sound the abstraction of the scene the hour and the surrounding circumstances brought however no refreshment to the exhausted spirit of george cadurcis he could not think indeed he did not dare to think but the villa of the apennines and the open boat in the squall flitted continually before him his mind was feeble though excited and he fell into a restless and yet unmeaning reverie as long as he had been in action as long as he had been hurrying along the coast the excitement of motion the constant exercise of his senses had relieved or distracted the intolerable suspense but this pause this inevitable pause overwhelmed him it oppressed his spirit like eternity and yet what might the morning bring he almost wished that he might remain for ever on this rock watching the moon and stars and that the life of the world might never recommence  he started he had fallen into a light slumber he had been dreaming he thought he had heard the voice of venetia calling him he had forgotten where he was he stared at the sea and sky and recalled his dreadful consciousness the wave broke with a heavy plash that attracted his attention it was indeed that sound that had awakened him he looked around there was some object he started wildly from his restingplace sprang over the cavern and bounded on the beach it was a corpse he is kneeling by its side it is the corpse of his cousin lord cadurcis was a fine swimmer and had evidently made strong efforts for his life for he was partly undressed in all the insanity of hope still wilder than despair george cadurcis seized the body and bore it some yards upon the shore life had been long extinct the corpse was cold and stark the eyes closed an expression of energy however yet lingering in the fixed jaw and the hair sodden with the sea suddenly captain cadurcis rushed to the inn and roused the household with a distracted air and broken speech and rapid motion he communicated the catastrophe several persons some bearing torches others blankets and cordials followed him instantly to the fatal spot they hurried to the body they applied all the rude remedies of the moment rather from the impulse of nervous excitement than with any practical purpose for the case had been indeed long hopeless while captain cadurcis leant over the body chafing the extremities in a hurried frenzy and gazing intently on the countenance a shout was heard from one of the stragglers who had recently arrived the sea had washed on the beach another corpse the form of marmion herbert it would appear that he had made no struggle to save himself for his hand was locked in his waistcoat where at the moment he had thrust the phaedo showing that he had been reading to the last and was meditating on immortality when he died  end of book vi     book vii     chapter i   it was the commencement of autumn the verdure of summer still lingered on the trees the sky if not so cloudless was almost as refulgent as italy and the pigeons bright and glancing clustered on the roof of the hall of cherbury the steward was in attendance the household all in deep mourning were assembled everything was in readiness for the immediate arrival of lady annabel herbert  tis nearly four years come martinmas said the greyheaded butler since my lady left us  and no good has come of it said the housekeeper and for my part i never heard of good coming from going to foreign parts  i shall like to see miss venetia again said a housemaid bless her sweet face  i never expected to see her miss venetia again from all we heard said a footman  gods will be done said the greyheaded butler but i hope she will find happiness at home tis nigh on twenty years since i first nursed her in these arms  i wonder if there is any new lord cadurcis said the footman i think he was the last of the line  it would have been a happy day if i had lived to have seen the poor young lord marry miss venetia said the housekeeper i always thought that match was made in heaven  he was a sweetspoken young gentleman said the housemaid  for my part said the footman i should like to have seen our real master squire herbert he was a famous gentleman by all accounts  i wish they had lived quietly at home said the housekeeper  i shall never forget the time when my lord returned said the greyheaded butler i must say i thought it was a match  mistress pauncefort seemed to think so said the housemaid  and she understands those things said the footman  i see the carriage said a servant who was at a window in the hall all immediately bustled about and the housekeeper sent a message to the steward  the carriage might be just discovered at the end of the avenue it was some time before it entered the iron gates that were thrown open for its reception the steward stood on the steps with his hat off the servants were ranged in order at the entrance touching their horses with the spur and cracking their whips the postilions dashed round the circular plot and stopped at the halldoor under any circumstances a return home after an interval of years is rather an awful moment there was not a servant who was not visibly affected on the outside of the carriage was a foreign servant and mistress pauncefort who was not so profuse as might have been expected in her recognitions of her old friends her countenance was graver than of yore misfortune and misery had subdued even mistress pauncefort the foreign servant opened the door of the carriage a young man who was a stranger to the household but who was in deep mourning alighted and then lady annabel appeared the steward advanced to welcome her the household bowed and curtseyed she smiled on them for a moment graciously and kindly but her countenance immediately reassumed a serious air and whispering one word to the strange gentleman she entered the hall alone inviting the steward to follow her  i hope your ladyship is well welcome home my lady welcome again to cherbury a welcome return my lady hope miss venetia is quite well happy to see your ladyship amongst us again and miss venetia too my lady lady annabel acknowledged these salutations with kindness and then saying that miss herbert was not very well and was fatigued with her journey she dismissed her humble but trusty friends lady annabel then turned and nodded to her fellowtraveller  upon this lord cadurcis if we must indeed use a title from which he himself shrank carried a shrouded form in his arms into the hall where the steward alone lingered though withdrawn to the back part of the scene and lady annabel advancing to meet him embraced his treasured burden her own unhappy child  now venetia dearest venetia she said tis past we are at home  venetia leant upon her mother but made no reply  upstairs dearest said lady annabel a little exertion a very little leaning on her mother and lord cadurcis venetia ascended the staircase and they reached the terraceroom venetia looked around her as she entered the chamber that scene of her former life endeared to her by so many happy hours and so many sweet incidents that chamber where she had first seen plantagenet lord cadurcis supported her to a chair and then overwhelmed by irresistible emotion she sank back in a swoon  no one was allowed to enter the room but pauncefort they revived her lord cadurcis holding her hand and touching with a watchful finger her pulse venetia opened her eyes and looked around her her mind did not wander she immediately recognised where she was and recollected all that had happened she faintly smiled and said in a low voice you are all too kind and i am very weak after our trials what is this george she added struggling to appear animated you are at length at cherbury  once more at cherbury it was indeed an event that recalled a thousand associations in the wild anguish of her first grief when the dreadful intelligence was broken to her if anyone had whispered to venetia that she would yet find herself once more at cherbury she would have esteemed the intimation as mockery but time and hope will struggle with the most poignant affliction and their influence is irresistible and inevitable from her darkened chamber in their mediterranean villa venetia had again come forth and crossed mountains and traversed immense plains and journeyed through many countries she could not die as she had supposed at first that she must and therefore she had exerted herself to quit and to quit speedily a scene so terrible as their late abode she was the very first to propose their return to england and to that spot where she had passed her early life and where she now wished to fulfil in quiet and seclusion the allotment of her remaining years to meditate over the marvellous past and cherish its sweet and bitter recollections the native firmness of lady annabel her long exercised control over her emotions the sadness and subdued tone which the early incidents of her career had cast over her character her profound sympathy with her daughter and that religious consolation which never deserted her had alike impelled and enabled her to bear up against the catastrophe with more fortitude than her child the arrow indeed had struck venetia with a double barb she was the victim and all the cares of lady annabel had been directed to soothe and support this stricken lamb yet perhaps these unhappy women must have sunk under their unparalleled calamities had it not been for the devotion of their companion in the despair of his first emotions george cadurcis was nearly plunging himself headlong into the wave that had already proved so fatal to his house but when he thought of lady annabel and venetia in a foreign land without a single friend in their desolation and pictured them to himself with the dreadful news abruptly communicated by some unfeeling stranger and called upon in the midst of their overwhelming agony to attend to all the heartrending arrangements which the discovery of the bodies of the beings to whom they were devoted and in whom all their feelings were centred must necessarily entail upon them he recoiled from what he contemplated as an act of infamous desertion he resolved to live if only to preserve them from all their impending troubles and with the hope that his exertions might tend in however slight a degree not to alleviate for that was impossible but to prevent the increase of that terrible woe the very conception of which made his brain stagger he carried the bodies therefore with him to spezzia and then prepared for that fatal interview the commencement of which we first indicated yet it must be confessed that though the bravest of men his courage faltered as he entered the accustomed ravine he stopped and looked down on the precipice below he felt it utterly impossible to meet them his mind nearly deserted him death some great and universal catastrophe an earthquake a deluge that would have buried them all in an instant and a common fate would have been hailed by george cadurcis at that moment as good fortune  he lurked about the ravine for nearly three hours before he could summon up heart for the awful interview the position he had taken assured him that no one could approach the villa to which he himself dared not advance at length in a paroxysm of energetic despair he had rushed forward met them instantly and confessed with a whirling brain and almost unconscious of his utterance that they could not hope to see them again in this world  what ensued must neither be attempted to be described nor even remembered it was one of those tragedies of life which enfeeble the most faithful memories at a blow shatter nerves beyond the faculty of revival cloud the mind for ever or turn the hair grey in an instant they carried venetia delirious to her bed the very despair and almost madness of her daughter forced lady annabel to selfexertion of which it was difficult to suppose that even she was capable and george too was obliged to leave them he stayed only the night a few words passed between lady annabel and himself she wished the bodies to be embalmed and borne to england there was no time to be lost and there was no one to be entrusted except george he had to hasten to genoa to make all these preparations and for two days he was absent from the villa when he returned lady annabel saw him but venetia was for a long time invisible the moment she grew composed she expressed a wish to her mother instantly to return to cherbury all the arrangements necessarily devolved upon george cadurcis it was his study that lady annabel should be troubled upon no point the household were discharged all the affairs were wound up the felucca hired which was to bear them to genoa and in readiness before he notified to them that the hour of departure had arrived the most bitter circumstance was looking again upon the sea it seemed so intolerable to venetia that their departure was delayed more than one day in consequence but it was inevitable they could reach genoa in no other manner george carried venetia in his arms to the boat with her face covered with a shawl and bore her in the same manner to the hotel at genoa where their travelling carriage awaited them  they travelled home rapidly all seemed to be impelled as it were by a restless desire for repose cherbury was the only thought in venetias mind she observed nothing she made no remark during their journey they travelled often throughout the night but no obstacles occurred no inconveniences there was one in this miserable society whose only object in life was to support venetia under her terrible visitation silent but with an eye that never slept george cadurcis watched venetia as a nurse might a child he read her thoughts he anticipated her wishes without inquiring them every arrangement was unobtrusively made that could possibly consult her comfort  they passed through london without stopping there george would not leave them for an instant nor would he spare a thought to his own affairs though they urgently required his attention the change in his position gave him no consolation he would not allow his passport to be made out with his title he shuddered at being called lord cadurcis and the only reason that made him hesitate about attending them to cherbury was its contiguity to his ancestral seat which he resolved never to visit there never in the world was a less selfish and more singlehearted man than george cadurcis though the death of his cousin had invested him with one of the most ancient coronets in england a noble residence and a fair estate he would willingly have sacrificed his life to have recalled plantagenet to existence and to have secured the happiness of venetia herbert     chapter ii   the reader must not suppose from the irresistible emotion that overcame venetia at the very moment of her return that she was entirely prostrated by her calamities on the contrary her mind had been employed during the whole of her journey to england in a silent effort to endure her lot with resignation she had resolved to bear up against her misery with fortitude and she inherited from her mother sufficient firmness of mind to enable her to achieve her purpose she came back to cherbury to live with patience and submission and though her dreams of happiness might be vanished for ever to contribute as much as was in her power to the content of that dear and remaining relative who was yet spared to her and who depended in this world only upon the affection of her child the return to cherbury was a pang and it was over venetia struggled to avoid the habits of an invalid she purposed resuming as far as was in her power all the pursuits and duties of her life and if it were neither possible nor even desirable to forget the past she dwelt upon it neither to sigh nor to murmur but to cherish in a sweet and musing mood the ties and affections round which all her feelings had once gathered with so much enjoyment and so much hope  she rose therefore on the morning after her return to cherbury at least serene and she took an early opportunity when george and her mother were engaged and absent from the terraceroom to go forth alone and wander amid her old haunts there was not a spot about the park and gardens which had been favourite resorts of herself and plantagenet in their childhood that she did not visit they were unchanged as green and bright and still as in old days but what was she the freshness and brilliancy and careless happiness of her life were fled for ever and here he lived and here he roamed and here his voice sounded now in glee now in melancholy now in wild and fanciful amusement and now pouring into her bosom all his domestic sorrows it was but ten years since he first arrived at cherbury and who could have anticipated that that little silent reserved boy should ere ten years had passed have filled a wide and lofty space in the worlds thought that his existence should have influenced the mind of nations and his death eclipsed their gaiety his death terrible and disheartening thought plantagenet was no more but he had not died without a record his memory was embalmed in immortal verse and he had breathed his passion to his venetia in language that lingered in the ear and would dwell for ever on the lips of his fellowmen  among these woods too had venetia first mused over her father before her rose those mysterious chambers whose secret she had penetrated at the risk of her life there were no secrets now was she happier now she felt that even in her early mystery there was delight and that hope was veiled beneath its ominous shadow there was now no future to ponder over her hope was gone and memory alone remained all the dreams of those musing hours of her hidden reveries had been realised she had seen that father that surpassing parent who had satisfied alike her heart and her imagination she had been clasped to his bosom she had lived to witness even her mother yield to his penitent embrace and he too was gone she could never meet him again in this world in this world in which they had experienced such exquisite bliss and now she was once more at cherbury oh give her back her girlhood with all its painful mystery and harassing doubt give her again a future  she returned to the hall she met george on the terrace she welcomed him with a sweet yet mournful smile i have been very selfish she said for i have been walking alone i mean to introduce you to cherbury but i could not resist visiting some old spots her voice faltered in these last words they reentered the terraceroom together and joined her mother  nothing is changed mamma said venetia in a more cheerful tone it is pleasant to find something that is the same  several days passed and lord cadurcis evinced no desire to visit his inheritance yet lady annabel was anxious that he should do so and had more than once impressed upon him the propriety even venetia at length said to him it is very selfish in us keeping you here george your presence is a great consolation and yet yet ought you not to visit your home she avoided the name of cadurcis  i ought dear venetia said george and i will i have promised lady annabel twenty times but i feel a terrible disinclination tomorrow perhaps  tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow murmured venetia to herself i scarcely comprehend now what tomorrow means and then again addressing him and with more liveliness she said we have only one friend in the world now george and i think that we ought to be very grateful that he is our neighbour  it is a consolation to me said lord cadurcis for i cannot remain here and otherwise i should scarcely know how to depart  i wish you would visit your home if only for one morning said venetia if only to know how very near you are to us  i dread going alone said lord cadurcis i cannot ask lady annabel to accompany me because he hesitated  because inquired venetia  i cannot ask or wish her to leave you  you are always thinking of me dear george said venetia artlessly i assure you i have come back to cherbury to be happy i must visit your home some day and i hope i shall visit it often we will all go soon she added  then i will postpone my visit to that day said george i am in no humour for business which i know awaits me there let me enjoy a little more repose at dear cherbury  i have become very restless of late i think said venetia but there is a particular spot in the garden that i wish to see come with me george  lord cadurcis was only too happy to attend her they proceeded through a winding walk in the shrubberies until they arrived at a small and open plot of turf where venetia stopped there are some associations she said of this spot connected with both those friends that we have lost i have a fancy that it should be in some visible manner consecrated to their memories on this spot george plantagenet once spoke to me of my father i should like to raise their busts here and indeed it is a fit place for such a purpose for poets she added faintly smiling should be surrounded with laurels  i have some thoughts on this head that i am revolving in my fancy myself said lord cadurcis but i will not speak of them now  yes now george for indeed it is a satisfaction for me to speak of them at least with you with one who understood them so well and loved them scarcely less than i did  george tenderly put his arm into hers and led her away as they walked along he explained to her his plans which yet were somewhat crude but which greatly interested her but they were roused from their conversation by the bell of the hall sounding as if to summon them and therefore they directed their way immediately to the terrace a servant running met them he brought a message from lady annabel their friend the bishop of  had arrived     chapter iii   well my little daughter said the good masham advancing as venetia entered the room and tenderly embracing her the kindhearted old man maintained a conversation on indifferent subjects with animation for some minutes and thus a meeting the anticipation of which would have cost venetia hours of pain and anxiety occurred with less uneasy feelings  masham had hastened to cherbury the moment he heard of the return of the herberts to england he did not come to console but to enliven he was well aware that even his eloquence and all the influence of his piety could not soften the irreparable past and knowing from experience how in solitude the unhappy brood over sorrow he fancied that his arrival and perhaps his arrival only might tend in some degree at this moment to their alleviation and comfort he brought lady annabel and venetia letters from their relations with whom he had been staying at their country residence and who were anxious that their unhappy kinsfolk should find change of scene under their roof  they are very affectionate said lady annabel but i rather think that neither venetia nor myself feel inclined to quit cherbury at present  indeed not mamma said venetia i hope we shall never leave home again  you must come and see me some day said the bishop then turning to george whom he was glad to find here he addressed him in a hearty tone and expressed his delight at again meeting him  insensibly to all parties this arrival of the good masham exercised a beneficial influence on their spirits they could sympathise with his cheerfulness because they were convinced that he sympathised with their sorrow his interesting conversation withdrew their minds from the painful subject on which they were always musing it seemed profanation to either of the three mourners when they were together alone to indulge in any topic but the absorbing one and their utmost effort was to speak of the past with composure but they all felt relieved though at first unconsciously when one whose interest in their feelings could not be doubted gave the signal of withdrawing their reflections from vicissitudes which it was useless to deplore even the social forms which the presence of a guest rendered indispensable and the exercise of the courtesies of hospitality contributed to this result they withdrew their minds from the past and the worthy bishop whose tact was as eminent as his good humour and benevolence evincing as much delicacy of feeling as cheerfulness of temper a very few days had elapsed before each of his companions was aware that his presence had contributed to their increased content  you have not been to the abbey yet lord cadurcis said masham to him one day as they were sitting together after dinner the ladies having retired you should go  i have been unwilling to leave them said george and i could scarcely expect them to accompany me it is a visit that must revive painful recollections  we must not dwell on the past said masham we must think only of the future  venetia has no future i fear said lord cadurcis  why not said masham she is yet a girl and with a prospect of a long life she must have a future and i hope and i believe it will yet be a happy one  alas said lord cadurcis no one can form an idea of the attachment that subsisted between plantagenet and venetia they were not common feelings or the feelings of common minds my dear lord  no one knew them both better than i did said masham not even yourself they were my children  i feel that said george and therefore it is a pleasure to us all to see you and to speak with you  but we must look for consolation said masham to deplore is fruitless if we live we must struggle to live happily to tell you the truth though their immediate return to cherbury was inevitable and their residence here for a time is scarcely to be deprecated i still hope they will not bury themselves here for my part after the necessary interval i wish to see venetia once more in the world  lord cadurcis looked very mournful and shook his head  as for her dear mother she is habituated to sorrow and disappointment said masham as long as venetia lives lady annabel will be content besides deplorable as may be the past there must be solace to her in the reflection that she was reconciled to her husband before his death and contributed to his happiness venetia is the stricken lamb but venetia is formed for happiness and it is in the nature of things that she will be happy we must not however yield unnecessarily to our feelings a violent exertion would be unwise but we should habituate ourselves gradually to the exercise of our duties and to our accustomed pursuits it would be well for you to go to cadurcis if i were you i would go tomorrow take advantage of my presence and return and give a report of your visit habituate venetia to talk of a spot with which ultimately she must renew her intimacy  influenced by this advice lord cadurcis rose early on the next morning and repaired to the seat of his fathers where hitherto his foot had never trod when the circle at cherbury assembled at their breakfast table he was missing and masham had undertaken the office of apprising his friends of the cause of his absence he returned to dinner and the conversation fell naturally upon the abbey and the impressions he had received it was maintained at first by lady annabel and the bishop but venetia ultimately joined in it and with cheerfulness many a trait and incident of former days was alluded to they talked of mrs cadurcis whom george had never seen they settled the chambers he should inhabit they mentioned the improvements which plantagenet had once contemplated and which george must now accomplish  you must go to london first said the bishop you have a great deal to do and you should not delay such business i think you had better return with me at this time of the year you need not be long absent you will not be detained and when you return you will find yourself much more at ease for after all nothing is more harassing than the feeling that there is business which must be attended to and which nevertheless is neglected  both lady annabel and venetia enforced this advice of their friend and so it happened that ere a week had elapsed lord cadurcis accompanying masham found himself once more in london     chapter iv   venetia was now once more alone with her mother it was as in old times their life was the same as before the visit of plantagenet previous to his going to cambridge except indeed that they had no longer a friend at marringhurst they missed the sabbath visits of that good man for though his successor performed the duties of the day which had been a condition when he was presented to the living the friend who knew all the secrets of their hearts was absent venetia continued to bear herself with great equanimity and the anxiety which she observed instantly impressed on her mothers countenance the moment she fancied there was unusual gloom on the brow of her child impelled venetia doubly to exert herself to appear resigned and in truth when lady annabel revolved in her mind the mournful past and meditated over her early and unceasing efforts to secure the happiness of her daughter and then contrasted her aspirations with the result she could not acquit herself of having been too often unconsciously instrumental in forwarding a very different conclusion than that for which she had laboured this conviction preyed upon the mother and the slightest evidence of reaction in venetias tranquilised demeanour occasioned her the utmost remorse and grief the absence of george made both lady annabel and venetia still more finely appreciate the solace of his society left to themselves they felt how much they had depended on his vigilant and considerate attention and how much his sweet temper and his unfailing sympathy had contributed to their consolation he wrote however to venetia by every post and his letters if possible endeared him still more to their hearts unwilling to dwell upon their mutual sorrows yet always expressing sufficient to prove that distance and absence had not impaired his sympathy he contrived with infinite delicacy even to amuse their solitude with the adventures of his life of bustle the arrival of the post was the incident of the day and not merely letters arrived one day brought books another music continually some fresh token of his thought and affection reached them he was however only a fortnight absent but when he returned it was to cadurcis he called upon them the next day and indeed every morning found him at cherbury but he returned to his home at night and so without an effort from their guest he had become their neighbour  plantagenet had left the whole of his property to his cousin his mothers fortune which as an accessory fund was not inconsiderable besides the estate and george intended to devote a portion of this to the restoration of the abbey venetia was to be his counsellor in this operation and therefore there were ample sources of amusement for the remainder of the year on a high ridge which was one of the beacons of the county and which moreover marked the junction of the domains of cherbury and cadurcis it was his intention to raise a monument to the united memories of marmion herbert and plantagenet lord cadurcis he brought down a design with him from london and this was the project which he had previously whispered to venetia with george for her companion too venetia was induced to resume her rides it was her part to make him acquainted with the county in which he was so important a resident time therefore at cherbury on the whole flowed on in a tide of tranquil pleasure and lady annabel observed with interest and fondness the continual presence beneath her roof of one who from the first day she had met him had engaged her kind feelings and had since become intimately endeared to her  the end of november was however now approaching and parliament was about to reassemble masham had written more than once to lord cadurcis impressing upon him the propriety and expediency of taking his seat he had shown these letters as he showed everything to venetia who was his counsellor on all subjects and venetia agreed with their friend  it is right said venetia you have a duty to perform and you must perform it besides i do not wish the name of cadurcis to sink again into obscurity i shall look forward with interest to lord cadurcis taking the oaths and his seat it will please me it will indeed  but venetia said george i do not like to leave this place i am happy if we may be happy this life suits me i am a quiet man i dislike london i feel alone there  you can write to us you will have a great deal to say and i shall have something to say to you now i must give you a continual report how they go on at the abbey i will be your steward and superintend everything  ah said george what shall i do in london without you without your advice there will be something occurring every day and i shall have no one to consult indeed i shall feel quite miserable i shall indeed  it is quite impossible that with your station and at your time of life you should bury yourself in the country said venetia you have the whole world before you and you must enjoy it it is very well for mamma and myself to lead this life i look upon ourselves as two nuns if cadurcis is an abbey cherbury is now a convent  how can a man wish to be more than happy i am quite content here said george what is london to me  it may be a great deal to you more than you think said venetia a great deal awaits you yet however there can be no doubt you should take your seat you can always return if you wish but take your seat and cultivate dear masham i have the utmost confidence in his wisdom and goodness you cannot have a friend more respectable now mind my advice george  i always do venetia     chapter v   time and faith are the great consolers and neither of these precious sources of solace were wanting to the inhabitants of cherbury they were again living alone but their lives were cheerful and if venetia no longer indulged in a worldly and blissful future nevertheless in the society of her mother in the resources of art and literature in the diligent discharge of her duties to her humble neighbours and in cherishing the memory of the departed she experienced a life that was not without its tranquil pleasures she maintained with lord cadurcis a constant correspondence he wrote to her every day and although they were separated there was not an incident of his life and scarcely a thought of which she was not cognisant it was with great difficulty that george could induce himself to remain in london but masham who soon obtained over him all the influence which venetia desired ever opposed his return to the abbey the good bishop was not unaware of the feelings with which lord cadurcis looked back to the hall of cherbury and himself of a glad and sanguine temperament he indulged in a belief in the consummation of all that happiness for which his young friend rather sceptically sighed but masham was aware that time could alone soften the bitterness of venetias sorrow and prepare her for that change of life which he felt confident would alone ensure the happiness both of herself and her mother he therefore detained lord cadurcis in london the whole of the sessions that on his return to cherbury his society might be esteemed a novel and agreeable incident in the existence of its inhabitants and not be associated merely with their calamities  it was therefore about a year after the catastrophe which had so suddenly changed the whole tenor of their lives and occasioned so unexpected a revolution in his own position that lord cadurcis arrived at his ancestral seat with no intention of again speedily leaving it he had long and frequently apprised his friends of his approaching presence and arriving at the abbey late at night he was at cherbury early on the following morning  although no inconsiderable interval had elapsed since lord cadurcis had parted from the herberts the continual correspondence that had been maintained between himself and venetia divested his visit of the slightest embarrassment they met as if they had parted yesterday except perhaps with greater fondness the chain of their feelings was unbroken he was indeed welcomed both by lady annabel and her daughter with warm affection and his absence had only rendered him dearer to them by affording an opportunity of feeling how much his society contributed to their felicity venetia was anxious to know his opinion of the improvements at the abbey which she had superintended but he assured her that he would examine nothing without her company and ultimately they agreed to walk over to cadurcis  it was a summer day and they walked through that very wood wherein we described the journey of the child venetia at the commencement of this very history the blue patches of wild hyacinths had all disappeared but there were flowers as sweet what if the first feelings of our heart fade like the first flowers of spring succeeding years like the coming summer may bring emotions not less charming and perchance far more fervent  i can scarcely believe said lord cadurcis that i am once more with you i know not what surprises me most venetia that we should be walking once more together in the woods of cherbury or that i ever should have dared to quit them  and yet it was better dear george said venetia you must now rejoice that you have fulfilled your duty and yet you are here again besides the abbey never would have been finished if you had remained to complete all our plans it required a mistress  i wish it always had one said george ah venetia once you told me never to despair  and what have you to despair about george  heigh ho said lord cadurcis i never shall be able to live in this abbey alone  you should have brought a wife from london said venetia  i told you once venetia that i was not a marrying man said lord cadurcis and certainly i never shall bring a wife from london  then you cannot accustom yourself too soon to a bachelors life said venetia  ah venetia said george i wish i were clever i wish i were a genius i wish i were a great man  why george  because venetia perhaps and lord cadurcis hesitated perhaps you would think differently of me i mean perhaps your feelings towards me might ah venetia perhaps you might think me worthy of you perhaps you might love me  i am sure dear george if i did not love you i should be the most ungrateful of beings you are our only friend  and can i never be more than a friend to you venetia said lord cadurcis blushing very deeply  i am sure dear george i should be very sorry for your sake if you wished to be more said venetia  why said lord cadurcis  because i should not like to see you unite your destiny with that of a very unfortunate if not a very unhappy person  the sweetest the loveliest of women said lord cadurcis o venetia i dare not express what i feel still less what i could hope i think so little of myself so highly of you that i am convinced my aspirations are too arrogant for me to breathe them  ah dear george you deserve to be happy said venetia would that it were in my power to make you  dearest venetia it is it is exclaimed lord cadurcis then checking himself as if frightened by his boldness he added in a more subdued tone i feel i am not worthy of you  they stood upon the breezy down that divided the demesnes of cherbury and the abbey beneath them rose embosomed in a valley of green bowers the ancient pile lately renovated under the studious care of venetia  ah said lord cadurcis be not less kind to the master of these towers than to the roof that you have fostered you have renovated our halls restore our happiness there is an union that will bring consolation to more than one hearth and baffle all the crosses of adverse fate venetia beautiful and nobleminded venetia condescend to fulfil it  perhaps the reader will not be surprised that within a few months of this morning walk the hands of george lord cadurcis and venetia herbert were joined in the chapel at cherbury by the good masham peace be with them
